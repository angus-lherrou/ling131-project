All right uh we got a lot of stuff out there moving at the same time and I wanted to\nI wanted a dive right into it some of the stuff's off the beaten path some of the stuff's a you know nationally known so so let's just dive right in here um right according right according to plan you knew this was going to be the case they have busted an illegal adult\nPretending to be an unaccompanied minor down at the border in El Paso I only raise just because we do have the four thousand man strong\nMigrant army marching up towards the United states from Honduras to Guatemala and eventually to Mexico um we know they like judicial watch had a I had a story earlier today that said\nThat the the Guatemalan president acknowledges that about a hundred ISIS operatives have been busted down in Guatemala already this chaos coming to the border rod\n[noise] well and always have been encouraged by the Obama administration will of the process now this is very interesting as opposed to previous years where\nIllegals would try to avoid a border patrol yup the customs and border protection officers and tried to sneak into the United states now they just walk right up to the\nOfficers and ask to be a a asylum seekers and there and the officers now are forced to take them by by judicial rulings as well as the law forced to take these folks\nWho request asylum or to request for you know the audit company minor a status that they they are taken into custody as a ban some judges going to have to determine that\nOrder sixty thousand and one month um and so they're released and now they're being released as they were during the Obama administration in remote areas they're being flown to Phoenix from Tucson for example a now in the in the midst of this and and if there is going to be a tsunami this fall this is it it's not the blue way or the right way if\nYou have to visit the border uh and and of course now we have this isolated incidents of of an adult oh tell me it isn't so\nThese incidents happened not only regularly but by the unit at border stations all along the Mexican border because what is happening is all of the Donald ... economic you know disadvantage people seeking opportunity but even that under current\nA whole bunch of people with criminal records or with fake passports with fake this or that you\nCan get a Guatemalan passport for a hundred bucks a you know in Guatemala and and and when that President\nJimmy Morales came out and said hey we we we apprehended a hundred ... what he was trying to do in the presence of a meeting in which a vice president Pence was was was there\nThat are that President was trying to say a look we're doing the best we can to keep the undesirable out but you've got to take you know are under class\nBecause we can't take up and down here so we're heading to a to a confrontation and it's a confrontation that's being caused or get once again you know remember the paid protesters at the Kavanaugh hearings oh yeah uh there's a quote non governmental organization that scored\nThese immigrants to the border instruct them on what to say when they encounter the border patrol officer and then takes them through the process so that they are then uh either breaking the process because there's no detention facility in the world could hold them All right uh or they're you know they're flooding there flooding result here\nAnd and this is being done with someone financing it\nYeah there are people from not forget Mexican and Central America that Paul ... who time from you know you can go to the most remote court a corner of the earth\nAnd find that illegal at the edge you know and now in El Paso trying to get across the border how do they get there when the national income and Paul is into hundreds of dollars a year right they go through Brazil they go through you know et cetera giant\nA air airplane journeys and giant expenses twenty thirty thousand dollars to get to El Paso where did they get that money and who's funding them\nThat's the great thing and what is their mission upon arrival that we know that will make up for the costs are encouraged to get there that's the prior trucks\nUm and and they got caught a couple of times and maybe a third time I mean I have this conversation at the gym with a guy to be\nSo explain the three strikes thing to because you know I got two felonies and I've been arrested on his ... and you know that they they they come to grips with the fact that in California it's possible you could go away for life for you know a felony this maybe not the most egregious

make it clear to anybody that I was just a mom through the college sports where we when we get there were seven years old right so when are advisers tell us what our classes are going to be and you know pretty much tell these are the courses that are going to fit your schedule for you to make it all practiced on time and write\nThese things these things or what ushered into the young athlete so we don't really have a say we're following our guardians of the people who are in control of what we're supposed to say and do so when they're telling us to do these things he follows so\nAnd so when you when you miss a class when you don't make a class or or or grades to get a little sideways in the class what what happens they just they just they just let you slide they how does this work\nWell how many how many athletes have you seen um being academically has ended because they don't have the great I mean anytime that you've seen a pop up what is the end that we've got scanned players this year that are academically ineligible you don't see it at all never because best the best is\nThe number one priority is to make sure they stay eligible haven't we do it and if you look at any media guy you'll see three prominent degree under all athletes or it will be communication right it will be general studies and it will be African American studies\nWow I always thought I thought I thought they would throw some sports management in there are some times when someone on because\nWe don't have that case in the program set up so you can't throw anything sports in their\nInteresting when you um ... when they came to you because because it was ... there were tutors involved I for some people understand that there were tutors who are doing a lot of the work to help get you through right is that is it fair to say\nOh they were friends with the program I guess you can call them two years or friends every year visors it was all of it was all the system you know it wasn't like they were contracted differently and we just met with the tutors individual right we all made up at the same time here and got the same treatment\nSo with you at a paper due on Shakespeare they might be able to get you a little bit further down the road there with that Shakespeare pay\nThe paper was already done already knew they already\nKnew what we needed to who they already knew what I read where we will have to write they already had a band and we just had to pick 'em up and kind of man\nOkay so so let me here's what I think it's so interesting were shouted McCants author plantation education the exploitation of the modern day\nAthlete students you you can have a prep school you got eleven twenty on the SATs I mean you're obviously a good student here obviously somebody who who sees and understands the rigors at the prep school expects the rigors I mean un sees not a not a joke of university and it's a series university right\nUm how how are you feeling as you're going through this I mean do you feel like listen I'm just kind of go with this flow or how does it how does it make\nYou feel that as a as a young Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen year old and and you're still trying to balance play in the big games are on TV you got the tournament looming how you how do you balance that\nThere is no balance because your your your whole goal is to be there\nFor the pros that was the reason the coach said in your living room and told you that you were going to make it to the NBA well because that will do you want to go to school for friday didn't sitting in the room and throw you were going to be a Harvard scholar or a Rhodes Scholar or any of those callers he didn't say that you were getting academics\nFor sitting in a room and you were going to be a Harvard scholar or Rhodes Scholar or any of those callers he didn't say that you were getting the academic scholarship yup you're attending his university on athletic scholarship we are expecting you to perform at a very high level when you get in here because we are investing in you\nYou got out you\nYou you you made you got a championship you got out and you went into the NBA what about the folks that look at that and say well that that's a job well done a good job you you you made it to the you made it to the big ... ... ... what do you say to those folks\nI say this is what I say to those folks there should be a clear indication that it's not about me\nIf I Am the one that made it out I received the fruits of all the labor and all of our work that I put in\nAll of the lucky ones I was looking and so the story can be about me I Can't be fighting for myself I made it out to be fighting for the kids that didn't make those does eighty seven Ninety percent of the kids that think that that three hundred fly NBA um career you\nIs is predicated to two million kids it's two million she's looking for three hundred spots it's impossible unless you're very very very talented [noise] so what I wanted to do with this book is let people know man when you don't have a plan a plan B or plan C you're dependent on a university to hold\nEducation to its highest priority when its highest already making money\nI'm telling the kids don't worry about that change the direction as something as you can be doing instead of letting people take advantage of [noise]\nWhy do you think um why do you think\nYour revealing all of this and and talking about these sort of thing has been received the way it was received versus say I'm just going to do with a B comparison with another basketball player\nOn a versus say say the fight that ... and I had over over his Jersey and over that sort of stuff here here he's he's elevated as somebody who fought for the rights of\nOf marketing and and the value of his imaging and and people pound you because you came out and exposes why why do you think there's a what do you think they're sort of a double standard there\n[noise] I don't think there is made I think there is he rode the visit ladies and then there's villains\nAnd they've been vigilante and a villain all plays a very important purpose when it comes to society because people were going to sway away from the truth\nEven though it's him and his fate is right there in front of you and that's what I'm here to do regardless if you like it or not I will fight the demand I Will play the villain because I Know my purpose is to create some type of new platform\nFor athletes to get money in education at the same time there's a lot of people that don't want that they just want the athlete to entertain rather\nShocking job man get out there and keep your feet and entertain that don't worry about no indication don't worry about no compensation make sure we cheer\nIf you were out there on the floor if you're out there on the floor and two thousand for two thousand five and God Forbid you blow in ACL or something like ... um is that university going back you up or are they going to cut you lose\nThey cut you Lucas already proven because this is why my book is called the exploitation of the at the student by\nThe time student athlete is now become a legal time back to protect the sea bubble a\nBecause if if if the meaning that the student is a student chairs and that the athlete part is the extra curricular activity right so if you get hurt while playing the extra curricular activity on the university university is not liable for workers' compensation or insurance so you do get hurt\nIn any given time down there your time of university they're not liable to protect you and your own your own at that moment so\nWhat's your what's your advice to a mom or dad or or somebody who's aspiring to get up and play big time sports at a big time college what's what's what's your advice as I Want people to get your book obviously but what's what what would be a a word of wisdom for these folks\nI Would one understand the national a veteran ... which binds you under contract that you are a student athlete first and that you'll be attending that university as such and it binds you to give it away your rights are not allowing you to do to me to do to take care of yourself secondly\nThinking about legal representation and understand that you can get\nMultiple millions a scholarship opportunities that could pay for your insurance if you did get hurt meaning that the church can give you scholarships their different um I'm a non a charitable opportunities as you can hear from scholarships that they don't share with you on with the if you're gonna lay or your university\nSo the only thing that you can get one scholarship you can get multiple scholarships that can help secure your financial wellbeing while you're in college\nAt the end of the day this is just come down to the fact that we got we should think about paying student athletes are athletes students\nDon't think so I think is education I think he's ever mentioned you pay if you just paid athlete and they still go out there and squandered their money away like we've seen countless times\nAnd we're getting nowhere so the first plan of action should be let's educate the athlete how to spend their money out of budget how to find out how to invest in how to give back to the community then they they can become valuable whether or not there that school in in the pros or not because they know what to do with their money\nI think it's such an important\nConversation was shot and I love to have you back on TALK more about this I I appreciate you making time for us and and raising

to manage the Astros and the hurricane had hit Puerto Rico and devastated Puerto Rico Maria devastated Puerto Rico\nAnd he said when he sat down and talk about his contract\nWith dumb Rashid they offered him the job um he said all he wanted a ... in terms of a guarantee from the red Sox was he didn't care about housing didn't care about a plane didn't get anything like that he just went on a plane load of supplies to go to his village in Puerto Rico wind the red socks that they provided that for him\nAnd I I mean it was just an interesting reveal that like you don't normally hear about and\nYou hear in these big organizations big companies in America\nThey stand up they do really good things I thought that was a really impressive result was really impressed with him to say hey can you get a a plane load of supplies to my village right where my family is where my friends are\nBut the fact that the team would do that and say you're going to come work for us next year but we'll

meets the road everybody's in American we're all together and we're just in this fight together trying to do the right thing and I think that that's it's selflessness and that's that's what's missing

S. M. B.\nI'm Roger Hitchcock with Roger report well even the California state government had to admit it the new motor voter laws they California initiative since twenty sixteen which sought to ignore the fact\nThat illegals in this state can now get driver's licenses went on to register everyone at the DMV whether you were there to get a license renewal license register car whatever everyone that goes to the DMV gets a form to register to vote\nThe authors of the bill Lorena Gonzalez of San Diego and secretary of state Alex ... confidently predicted at the time the bill passed but motor voter registration would not include illegal aliens\nThey were surprised but almost no one else was what a report last week indicated that over Fifteen hundred illegals had in fact been registered as voters\nBut both ... and ... are now saying there's no need to freeze the program there is no need to audited because these are just small details that will work out in the implementation\nShown off ... joining us here from the California district Attorneys Association I'm to the extent that it can be quantified how much more unsafe or the people of California today than they were say in twenty sixteen before this initiative fast\nI I think that it's difficult to quantify and and it's\nUm you know certainly there are individuals who have been released a fence twenty sixteen who but for ... fifty seven would still be in prison I don't know that there's been\nMuch tracking as far as what they are a citizen right has been [noise] um I Know that the the grant rate for those those folks has about twenty percent so you figure one in every five people that\nAre petitions for early release ... fifty seven is being released back out into the community\nUm [noise] you know but I I I Wonder if\nMost Californians feel safer in twenty eight team then they didn't twenty sixteen my guess is that they probably don't um and it it's not just to ... fifty seven thing but it's it's sort of this\nAh this this ongoing wave of uh of reform starting with would they be one oh nine and ... forty seven ... seven um and in the way that these have been done through the initiative process\nThey can't be easily ... it's going to take another initiative to ah to undo some of the you know the really problematic aspects of of these initiatives\nCan you give me an update on this sex offender release case that was moving through Sacramento a ... in the courts there because I I Do know that there was a judge that issued an order about releasing these the sex offenders out of out of the jail system what's the story there so\nYeah so that was back in February um the the logic used in that case was very similar to uh to the rationale but the court used here they said look these guys have committed sex offenses that are by definition non violent again things like rape and unconscious person rape of an intoxicated person [noise]\nUm [noise] you know certain human trafficking offenses you know these are by definition non violent therefore these particular sex offenders are eligible for early release ... fifty seven\nUh that's still at the you know going through appeals my understanding is that the administration is continuing to challenge that\nUm they have conceded that the the non violent third strikers they're going to rewrite the regulations to give those guys and opportunity for early release there continue to challenge um to have their prohibition on the sex offenders upheld but I mean frankly I don't see how\nYou know given that the the rationale but the court used in this case I don't I don't see how it wouldn't apply\nEqually to to the sex offenders and again that was something that that we pointed out he said you can't restrict these certain classes by by way of regulation that'll never work and you know as much as I Wish we'd done wrong um that's not the case\nHow many how many sex offenders are we talking about in this class by the way\nYou know I don't have to have that number okay I Know on the as far as the third strikers they're talking about maybe four thousand people right um but as far as the the sex offenders I don't know\nSo it's four thousand third strikers in X number of sex offenders and then we we compound onto this and not to not to do away from this book but to pivot you\nTo do a similar issue it's at least something that's related by marriage let's say I'm a ... is this uh this idiocy that came out of the state of the ... of the state Senate that was um a ending the sentencing of young people as

that is correct that doesn't make you I mean just a personal questions on I mean here you are you doing good work with the California district Attorneys Association\nWe see that look quality of life crimes are up drug abuse is up in this state heroin is up\nYou see the disgusting behavior that goes on in San Francisco with the ... I mean there was a ramp and lawlessness going on here it must make you want to pull the hair out of your head or Sean when you when you are out there trying to fight the fight to keep our kids safe and you have aggressive groups trying to get these people released I it's amazing to me\nIt's it's frustrating I'm certainly the or\nThe other side is very well funded um and and they have you know a lot of resources they have a lot of sympathetic ears in our legislature um [noise] and so it it does make it difficult but um you know you you feel like you're on the right side of the issue but if you're not you're not getting the brakes necessarily\nWhy appreciate the work you're doing and I appreciate what you all do you have a website where people can go and get more information on on the effort you all are making at the ... those isn't\nOur association website is is the da di ... and their links there to uh some of the other uh initiatives and whatnot that were involved in\nAll right we are going to stay in close touch my friend because we've got to give you the support on this and and we've got to keep these folks say I appreciate you are shown for coming by thank you so much of a great weekend you to pay our heart Sean Hoffman\nCalifornia district Attorneys Association OK so just to be clear we're we're going to look to release about four thousand ... three strikers me to get them out of jail just to be clear we're looking to release so called non violence sex offenders and non violent would include human traffickers\nAnd people that may have a slipped a somebody a date rape drug yeah or gotten him drunk and then re unconscious raped them while they were unconscious that's not that's a non violent effect right so when you wake up the next day and you're injured\nThat you you did not suffer violence in the mindset of these judges in Sacramento and and Jerry Brown's buddies are inside the less empty the jail caucus\nBut then the the jails let's get them out let's get folks out let's let's be more diverse here's the problem when they let 'em out they go anywhere which means they'll ... they don't have to stay in California they can go out of state and disappear\nCome to your community go on to that overpass\nGo by that school you have no idea they want to put four thousand three striker is out there they want to put sex offenders out there and they may have made a move to and sentencing as an adult for young people who may have committed vicious psychopathic murders\nAnd they make you feel just as an American just as a as a human being I didn't get what your political affiliation is as a human being does that make you feel better if you've got kids or people you laws eight hundred seven sixty K.

rest of the country we are behind the blue curtain here in in California and somehow magically John ... got on the ballot to take on ... avenue and a lot of conservatives very energized about that we don't we understand that this is a huge leap challenging electoral map\nUh on the house side of things the Senate side I don't know if it says challenging necessarily for for the for for the Republicans I'm I I think the Republicans are gonna hold the Senate personally as my my my opinion but what are you seeing here in the state because what you're doing is you're in the state polling statewide right\nThat's right uh we've been polling to stay for a couple of days we pulled it back in the primary recall and we saw that new someone's going to take and we saw Cox coming in second there was actually a little battle there in that Republican side but\nHe was able to take that lead and then you have that gas tax issue in the rental issues um I see these prop questions are going to help drive out certain populations in turn out and so as we look\nTowards election day you know what's motivating these voters and on a national platform what they're talking about his health care from the Democrats in immigration from the republic right and so that's the battle in both sides have to explain why they're issue is more important than the other issue\nAnd that's where we are going to see over the next what Eighteen days or so that\nIf the Democrats can get health care or um what they're really hammering on his pre existing conditions\nAnd with the ... in the what the Republicans are hammering on his immigration policy and you know Trump is playing this out beautifully as a narrative and where he sees the you know this group coming up from\nA through Mexico and saying hey look at this problem and he's focusing the attention on it so it'll be interesting to see if the Democrats are able to get their message out there or the president is able to carry a couple of Republicans own\nOver the finish line we're we're in an interesting position and and you are coming out here looking at these at at at these different races and I and I get to do in the state wide you're not necessarily doing the congressional here\nBut I'm In California is such a concentrated thing in terms of the potential impact because you're looking at potentially having Nancy Pelosi become speaker or Kevin McCarthy become speaker yet old from California\nWhich I ... and let's talk about that for a second because everybody's talking about November sick you've got to talk about ... regardless of who takes the house they've got to be able to\nCome together around one of the speakers and clearly the Democrats are not jumping on board with below sea there's got to be about sixty of the candidates that said they will not support her so even if they had two hundred and fifty seats she's not going to get the two hundred and Eighteen boats to be speaker\nAnd then McCarthy he's going to have a similar issue on the Republican side if date squeak out in hold the house how does he get to the to Eighteen before you see the inter party fighting and which will be really fun to watch but that's really you know if you get into the the er inside baseball\nTo the to Eighteen before you see the inter party fighting and which will be really fun to watch but that's really you know if you get into the the uh inside baseball of it that's what I'm looking at November seventh numbered November ... just part of the show right\nNovember six is is good is going to set you up for that for that match up on the on the back side of that you can have all the all the positioning in the maneuvering especially people like Jim Jordan yeah Mark Meadows and those guys out of their caucus\nOr the Tea Party caucus I'm afraid I'm cautious when when you look at some of these high profile races are there are some really high profile people people like Devin Nunes has been on the front pages for for two years as part of the Russia investigation on he was he was taking some pretty heavy shots\nAre there in his district in Fresno I don't know how how the numbers are looking right now but um [noise] we are really like outside in terms of the impact on the national conversation where we are really outside because you've also got Adam Schiff potentially taking over the intelligence committee\nIf the Democratic documentary Maxine Waters takes over bank\nIf you end up with the with the Democratic takeover of the house so I ... this massive impact here\nThat's right and that's the part that you know you know that they say in the candidate when I'm One of the Newman wins and he's like what do we do now right now you got to actually have policy now with what's going to be you

have all show and seven sixty talk and breaking news continuing our visit with Spencer Campbell from Emerson College polling he's giving us a look Eighteen days out from the mid terms of a sort of what's what's starting to firm up out there we talked about Calif\nAnd specifically and I think people are confused of what they're voting for or against um because it looks like people want to repeal the gas tax from what we're seeing in these early numbers but\nIt doesn't really match with their party affiliation because Democrats are wanting to repeal which tells me they don't understand what they're voting on and I think\nHe really nailed it with these ballot questions and you were talking about it in the earlier segment on the uh the forty seven fifty seven years you know there's always\nYou know hitting a policy that come out that you don't see devil's in the details and we don't see these things and so um I think you've got that issue with the gas tax we also have it with a couple of other topics that are being\nRecords role is another hot one\nToo yeah because people don't understand what that really means and so they're like of course I Want rent control or the or the rent or and you know the homeowners like no um but on the flip side what are you going to get from it does it protect the ... the military does it protect the veteran doesn't protect\nYou know these other classes of people which the current law does in the new law may not and I think people need to be very careful of because we're making these decisions based on a thirty second ad how\nHow long how how much longer is your poll going to be running on the six set on the the ten and all those\nSo the whole thing we uh we'll finish it up tomorrow we publish a Monday morning I've got some\nPolls okay so maybe I'll get your back here and being of the week I Love to see what these numbers are actually fires autonomy has got to be great that'll be great uh All right let's let's pivot around the horn a little bit on some of these other uh a racist these Senate races that are out there\nDean Heller are taking on a Jacky Rosen over there in Nevada the president's gonna head in there and and and bring his considerably I think he's made like about a dozen trips to Nevada they're saying oh which is a pretty high number what's that looking like in terms of Heller Rosen in Nevada\nSo that race has been very close a rose and had been holding a lead for a lot of the summer in into Labor Day but we've all seen with this cabin I issue starting about ... around Columbus Day at all kinds of switched over to the Republicans and so we've got hell or with a seven point lead I think last couple of other polls have him up two or three points\nAnd so you can see that the momentum is with Heller and we're actually looking at that third district because Rosen is a representative of third and now ... is running a in their against Lee\nAnd that might be a potential seat for the Republicans to pick up which would be\nYou know take a break in the grain of what we're talking about in this election with a blue wave\nOkay uh it hadn't south of Nevada we're going to Arizona where you've got a real hard fought race interesting race because it's between two women you've got a mix Sally Martha McSally are taking on Christian cinema what's that one looking like that certainly has gotten a little weird and the last few days and certainly very aggressive\nSo that's right and it's gotten a out in my opinion very tight because a mix Sally had come at a really tough ... primary with ward in our pie too conservative Republicans and when she came out cinema held like five six point lead and she held that lead again until around Columbus Day weekend we're all of a sudden\nThere's been a shift and now we saw poll wasn't ours but another poll where you saw Mick Sally up by six points\nUm if Arizona's a state in about a\nA Arizona's I in my opinion you know the number one state the Democrats you pick up because it's an open seat it's much more difficult to being an incumbent\nBut if they're not able to win that seat there's really no pathway for them to take\nThe Senate okay somebody is uh has pointed out it might have been Chuck Todd pointed out that um between now and twenty twenty for the state of Arizona will have eight Senate races because of the primaries and then they\nWill it's going to be interesting that Kyle appointment is Only Temporary and that's why it's important for do see to beat a Garcia over there in that governor's race cars they're going to be able to a real point if you know I don't think Kyle holding it for two years I think he was there for the cabinet boat and he's going to be out in the lame duck session and maybe if Sally loses they plug her into Kyle seat\nAnd so they do get that representation by\nThat candidate is going to have to run again in twenty twenty as you said to hold that seat we saw a lot of that in Massachusetts sure we had a big turnover\nDecade yeah absolutely that's the ... there's no doubt I'm let's pivot over to Texas Texas you've got better or taking on Ted Cruz um six eight nine months ago we would have been like this would have been a runaway for Cruz what's it look like right now\nWhere we were just talking about the Houston paper just endorsed uh or Rourke and that was you know kind of a swing for the Houston paper to go with the Democrat\nAnd or or has run a good campaign raised about forty million dollars in the last cycle which is you know got huge you know fanfare and obviously he's positioning himself as feels more for like a presidential run\nHowever I thought he kinda made a mistake and that CNN a presentation it's not easy to be on stage for an hour and I think it showed\n'em in he may have actually hurt himself by over exposing at this point\nI mean it looks like Cruz's got this race back Abbott is blowing out a ... and the governor's race and so not much ticket splitting there so I got to think that Cruz will hold that seat and again where else did the Democrats go I guess we could jump over to Tennessee and we take a look at the bread a sin and I'm ...\nIn fact you don't see this I Am going to take a break I Want to come back with that real okay when did you Tennessee and maybe a little quick way of joy and Florida that's right that's the way
