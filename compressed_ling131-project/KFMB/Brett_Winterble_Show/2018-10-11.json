did um you know in Donald Trump's to me it was a stronger more attractive candidate obviously for\nSure um you know the the Mitt Romney was so I have one thing that I remember when Hillary Clinton was running around saying that you wanted to recount she wanted a recount in certain states yes I always said that they should recount California not because it's going to prove that Donald Trump won

that that's the killer up like a fighter sidebar what ... what I was going to say though it was like well both of these people that are supposed to go but at the end of the day what\nReally happens is where the Supreme Supreme Court these other courts they are the people are the apparatus that rule over us really because look at the state and and and the craziness that goes on\nWith the Supreme Court and and I think it manifest itself that way because for one thing people that are hungry for power will do anything right I think we've seen that\nAre reflected in the last couple of weeks of of a\nSaturday I mean really I mean it's all it's it's completely in fact I for me watching it I mean I'm fifty one mhm I've seen a lot of politics to my life but seeing that whole Kavanaugh Erie thing right I felt like I mean the whole ... want to put it was like\nYou said someone as white privilege you're basically saying in a different context you can you say well that guy's name is Jewish know random people kill or something\nYeah you sound like you're saying you're sitting right we're you're saying you're saying that you use the term white privilege feels like a slur at times\nBecause we're all Americans and I can look it up and go well I'm halfway right but see I mean just you know what I'm saying I don't get yeah you're not alone you're not you're not alone in a in fact\nIn this piece I I was looking at the overwhelming majority of people are ... are they they they're tired of the political correctness thing setting the tone in the country and in fact when you drill down into the study you find out that it's it's it's a really tiny minority of people political activists who are pushing this\nSo you are not crazy 'cause you're out by yourself making this you're not crazy they they create these construct psych white privilege and these constructs like the\nPatriarchy which has lifted directly from Margaret Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's tale which is a work of fiction these are people\nThat are I mean these are like live action role player people you know when you go to ... and the people were the costumes they do all that stuff these nice people protesting

Kanye West you saw that oh I Know that that's\nThe latest on media equalizer dot com yeah Don Lemon had a panel\nOf one not conservative and two black Democrats and both black Democrat referred to Kanye West as a token negro\nUm but that's OK to use that type of the planet tore a racial profiling language but use the term mob and all of a sudden CNN and all their ... lose their heads and you know why they had this because it's absolutely true\nUm if if the Democrats didn't pay for the violent mob or they wouldn't be as loud as they needed to be and so we can't be fooled\nBy this political theater that they pay for a because they are the minority I Believe that a majority of Americans do not want to be presumed guilty before proven innocent a and I believe that that is what's really going to drive people to the polls especially ... when you look at the most recent polls\nIn Nevada Arizona um and even Tennessee we've got a Republican candidates that have actually flipped a deficit into a a positive beyond the margin of error and that's the first time that we could actually call that I Believe the cabin effect\nIs ... is the mama bear affect real is that going to be sustained you think Reagan\nMama there yeah the I as far as women\nIt was over the women who have sons and husbands and and are concerned about the way men have been put on trial in mass over the last a month\nFor the better be\nBecause this is the future that the Democrat Party want America to look like whereby men are just simply presumed guilty before being proven innocent or even if it's a job interview like the Democrats kept saying well it's just a job interview I yeah your character assassinated presumably\nInnocent man I at this quote unquote job interview with potential criminal charges um if there were criminal charges a if a criminal charges really held water what they would have done has gone to Montgomery County and filed criminal charges\nOf it all of a sudden Dr Ford now just had said oh I'm not going to pursue it oh okay great um I guess you were used up use like he wanted to be used and abused like many Democrat women like to be used and abused by the Democrat Party\nIt bothers me greatly die seems to skate a any responsibility here even even her fellow centers many of them Republicans\nHave basically given the clean bill of health saying yeah you know we don't think you lead to we don't think you're going to do with this at the end of the day she made the decision to release that at the last possible moment and that was at a minimum a dirty trick wasn't it so\nAbsolutely you know if these charges were so incredibly serious that would impede uh the nomination process\nUm then of course you know why would it my girlfriend came to me and said look I was sexually assaulted thirty six years ago I Would say we have to go to the police I wouldn't fit on those allegations for two more months uh after she had waited thirty six years the bowl this assault\nUm it was an absolute political ploy ah it was an attempt at political assassination and character destruction on behalf of Dianne Feinstein and ah you know this is the problem with the swamp as as Lindsey Graham said in his first before he actually became somewhat of a hero he's I feel ambushed by my friends across the aisle okay\nAnd across the aisle okay at number wind up friends don't ambushed you turn on and so get get out of the McCain mode where you'd think that you can actually do deals with socialists because social simply ears you and then to stab you in the back like they have done a with many a political elected as well as innocent people\nDo you think that this has been enough of a near death experience for\nA for conservatives in the Senate that it that it takes the wind out of the sales of the never Trump or his people like ... people like like I I don't know flakes on his way out Corker is on his way out Sasha certainly still going to be there they did this represents ... an end to to the never Trump movement in America\nWhy it was a watershed moment because when I looked at the never Trump movement I at least that it initially you don't understand the enemy\nAnd when you don't understand the enemy you don't know how to fight the enemy the enemy is that Donald Trump or the enemy yet Hillary Clinton a proclaimed as the opposition party right at the Democrats will do everything they can do to search and destroy and defeat there\nAren't any politics the Democrats as a blood sport uh there is no such thing as reaching across the aisle because when he reached across the aisle how do you hold the knife out of your back uh\nAnd that's one thing that they should have learned by watching the political theater and antics of John McCain um and just like you know may have done is a favor at the ... hour by demanding another FBI investigation but I think we all knew when we were watching that that that was simply going to get the Democrats and other you\nBy saying what lesson that fall Blount FBI investigation for an hour job interview why do we need to know\nAbout the game show yeah that's true very good point oh finally you bring them up to Clinton or they're doing this live nation tour they're going to go into Canada and come around the United states twenty Eighteen twenty Nineteen [noise] um I\nFeel like she's making one more run because if this was just about money they would just do a Netflix series or something to try to stay relevant and getting cash a paycheck\nUm I feel like what they're trying to do is sort of run sort of in the draft or the draft of the Jews and ask our analogy of of all this energy being expanded by the Democrats and by the wacko is like a cause you a court as in the hopes that they can swoop in and be relevant is twenty twenty opens why what what do you think about that are making\nWell what I Need they're trying to do is just kind of hearken back the time or actually they were willing to work with the folks across the aisle Newt Gingrich you know one thing that Bill Clinton actually dead at the lessons of the other side I'm especially when he had a Republican Congress and things like welfare reform\nSo they might be trying to reinvent the Democrat Party away from the socialist takeover of the Democrat Party and into something that's more moderate which\nThey claimed to be oh gosh [laughter] a moderate socialist versus a full boil socialist oh God scares me either way it's just right\nAll right up Meghan bart always great to talk to you a Reagan ... dot com also

start here give us the background of this story I was going to explain it but I thought you would be the one uh as to how these came to be\nDarned well this got started\nOn Thursday the twenty seventh so Fridays would twenty seven so it was Thursday the day of the Kavanaugh here in ... in the Senate\nOr there was an email message that were circulated by a group to sort of a student lists are within the U.S he price school public policy but went out to all our students and it was announcing I'm a no your title nine workshop I'm\nKind of an an innocuous announcement not problematic in and of itself and anyway um but uh no your title nine is a nonprofit organization that educate students about their rights under title nine\nAnd a the ... message went out with a poodle editorializing attached to it that said\nEffectively among other things because of the Kavanaugh here into important to remember that we should believe all survivors\nAnd um [noise] I thought well given that this does address due process a due process is something I work with the university on fairly intensive land for some time [noise] um I Know this was on the student's mind is because of the hearing is taking place\nThis is a broadcast message to every body of the door has been open to this discussion so I responded and I wanted to respond briefly because I didn't think I'd have their attention very long\nAnd I said exactly this is the day comes you were accused of some crime or toward of which you are not guilty\nAnd you find your peers automatically believing your accuser I expect to find yourself a stronger proponent of due process protections than you are now period accusers sometimes lie [noise] than that led to a chain of events\nUm the common needed with this protest outside the

extent you disagree with the students\nUm but it's been a little bit of a challenge but I Am basically happy overall with my work here at USC the central administration has not communicated with me about this demand [noise]\nI don't expect that they will act on it um I um I've been hearing from a lot of folks far more than I expected across the country about this um all all of the external um communications everything from outside the university has been supportive\nOf some of the students within this group were very negative about my having said that um but my colleagues at the university those who are at least the ones who have chosen to communicate with may have been relatively supportive overall\nThe students that were protesting you know these students personally\n[noise] um I don't know them well frankly um they are um part of and they don't come from any one specific program within the school they're part of an organization\nThat cuts across the school um rice women and

I'm twenty four seven\nAlright [laughter] enough\nWhat what's the point do I really need this\nWe're going to come back we're going to talk about and I'll give you a little hint at little keys here at the University of Missouri a few years ago I think back to that and we'll compare that to this story happening at USC right now we're also in June 'cause I was actually going to ask you\nHow the ... when herbal audience feels about ...\nOh well we have it's it's kind of split to love hate ... there's ... there's also a ... I don't know about it I don't\nTrust them okay well we'll we'll bring the next saga of it uh around as well we've got some phenomenal guest coming up here on AM seven sixty talking breaking news miles symbol filling in for Brett winter ... Jim sure about what are we got coming up\nThere was also an alleged racial slur said by someone walking on campus now no one was able to verify it but good oh yeah I heard it I heard it and the kicker of the third incident with the Nazi swastikas there was made out of poop\nAnd scratched on the bathroom and that was the one that really drove him nobody ever really knows if it was a swastika but someone said they thought okay\nGetting sounds a lot like Kevin I'll hear those three incidences led the students to call for the president of the university to be fired and other administrators in the end\nThe president resigned as well as the chancellor of the university so don't tell me this can't happen there's literally happened three years ago some students get outraged\nThis guy up at USC could I could easily see I'm being fire I'm not saying it's right it is totally not right eat is despicable that the dean of that USC college didn't ... didn't have a backbone didn't have a spine to sit there and say you know what what's that professor said is a hundred percent true\nA hundred percent accusers sometimes ally\nHe didn't say every accuser lives he said sometimes they lie that fact but the fact that the dean didn't stick behind them that's a coward move\n\nBut in this whole new topic in this way could Kavanaugh hearings it's no longer about race so we've we've shifted slightly I was thinking about this we've shifted slightly from race and I'm sure race will come back I'm not saying we're do with race\nBut now it's all about women more specifically rape victims or even maybe just making up rape victims so you have this professor he's taught for Thirty years Thirty years\nAnd his response to that email or about how we need to believe all women\nWas if the day comes and you were accused of some sort of crime of which you are not guilty and you find your peers automatically believing your accuser I expect you find yourself a stronger proponent of due process protections than you are now\nAccusers sometimes lie that's true\nThat's true none of those senators that were questioning Kavanaugh door making these moral grandstand if they were accused of sexual assault and hadn't done it none of them will be doing that\nYou think they set up there and say well we need to believe all women nope it say what what [noise] what about due\nProcess what about due process unbelievable it's sad it's sad\nLike I said I don't even blame the students for this one I mean the students are in full but I Can't but they're kids\nThey're raised in a society where their parents tell them they can do whatever their professors allow them to get away with whatever\nThey say they have they are safe spaces all of that\nSo I don't even blame the students there they don't know better\nWho I blame is the dean of the school\n\nSo that it was disrespectful insensitive comments accusers never lie what\nNow the University of Missouri the enrollment has dropped twenty five percent since they allowed the mob to run the school\nWhen they allowed the professor they forced the professor the the president of the school out twenty five percent because they let the kids dictator\nYou have a spine if your USC or back then three years ago at the University of Missouri and you say hey guys that's not gonna work you can protest all you want over there you can't just run on rule the all around the campus that's not going to work\nThat's not going to work at all\nBut once you say well yeah you know sure\nOf take a mile and one eight hundred seven sixty five three six to let's go to Daniel in San Diego Daniel what do you make of all of this\n[laughter] I'm really disappointed I really have I think um [noise] I expect more from uh the people are supposed to just call balls and strikes and quit calling it the way they caught a lot of plant because it's really unfair to everybody else was on a fulltime job got a family got kids got a house and whatnot\nAnd then you've got scared sense of reality\nAnd then you go off thinking that that's the truth and then you come to find out it's not or you don't\nAnd that's even worse because you get the people who are just like walking into law ethic that's OK and secondly about this whole mind versus not why what ever happened to looking at reality because there are things such as pathological\nLiar [laughter] yell suppliers and host of other personality disorders that fall into the DSM five hundred class a be in the work is one of the features happy to be lying jerk and I just\nI don't care [noise] your your mental left right and it's it's a fact and I just don't think it's okay to just blown up thank you\nI appreciate it Daniel want to touch on your first point there but you're you're you're totally right he talked about you know this this gentleman a USC\nI don't know what he's got a family get kids got a wife got people to feed\nIt got to living to make I've never when whenever anybody calls for the firing of someone you better and that person better have done something so harsh\nI mean I'm I'm totally committed a crime\nBecause when you really think about it if someone on Fox News right now or CNN said something inappropriate I'd say on I was probably a stupid thing to say only call for they're firing that person\n... exits and TV station demeanor wherever their job and goes out and goes home and has a family they have bills to pay they have things to do\nAnd when people people love coloring for ... for firing these students wanted oh let's fire this this teacher for Thirty years he's given back to the the the university I guarantee it nobody\nThese students are going to raise they're going to go go get a job when they grow older they don't want someone to call for they're firing\nListening right now when someone saying oh yeah you should fire them yeah you should fire them because guess what they have an answer they have to go home every night\nThere are kids you better be damn sure you want someone fired before you just start throwing that around\nEight hundred seven sixty five three six and two ... what should we do is you would take a break I Want to take
