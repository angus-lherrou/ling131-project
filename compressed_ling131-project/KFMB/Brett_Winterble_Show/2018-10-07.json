we see a lot of people who want to be in a result community\nAnd the value that idea of luck and leave the Congo or something and the maintenance free community where they can come and go and then joined leisure time here and not have to worry about how he might not\nHaving that that though a lot of Europeans especially from big cities where I learned the premium and then they'd be full political condos in Hong Kong tree\nActually like the idea of owning a single family homes yeah a little bit of ... and the extra a privacy that out of all them so it really does depend but one trend with the more and more off now especially with European by as\nIf they wanna walk ability that don't want to drive they want to be able to come out of their home go shopping rest bronco and grab a cup

however very educated by it so they're going to the age you know out of their properties backup against competition wanted that really we're in some cultures cultural um it is to automatically make a low offer and negotiate up from that so\nQuite often at that stage do they lose if there's five other offers on the table\nYeah and so we have to educate them but I you know I Am from this is how are you in your country but we're in the stock market right now this is what happening in markets\nSo the relative shortage really educate those customers about how to win and how to put folders strong offer in that particular market at that time\nHow do you actually find foreign buyers to show my house to watch your process\nWhat we do is we pick up the ticket on this thing and we owe it to a

but wait till you hear the allegations from insiders that have been published recently the ticket master is playing dirty pool with your wallet [noise]\n\nFor just a moment [noise]\nI have always despised ticket master\nBecause you go to buy a ticket to something and there's this outrageous fee added to it and if you're not aware how that all came about ticket master a very cleverly but very diabolical he\nWent to promoters and Venus around the country and offered them\nPretty much whatever they wanted to become the exclusive seller of tickets\nAnd hit a point of critical mass where when you wanted to buy tickets to most anything in the United states you have to go through the ticket master monopoly and with the added on has no relationship at all so if it costs the infrastructure\nIs all a basically a monopoly passed through and it's why I despise monopolies so much and you think that that would be enough\nFor Ticketmaster to rake off out of your wallet but there's a long form story in Rolling Stone you may have heard about bit insiders\n... ticket master have\nSpill the beans that ticket master has a system operating where they manipulate the sale of tickets to get them into the hands of their own scalpers\nSo they're they're making money both on the fees up front bend the fees when the tickets resold plus the profits now ticket master denies it we'll see what goes on with that but I Want to tell you the whole system is rotten\nWe're getting rocked and it stinks\nAnd when there's a time that I can go to a box office and buy tickets direct and not pay the fee I Do that but there are times I Will not go to an event because I Will not pay the ticket master rip off the\nThe good news for you and me\nIs that a lot of events don't sell out any more than it used to people or so distracted there's so much going on in our lives sports events or even if they are nominally a sell out their soft sell out there are so many empty seats\nAt sports events now you can buy tickets if you're willing to\nAt the last minute often for much less\nThan you would pay if you just gotta gotta gotta be there in addition if you're willing to set like I Do and the crummy seats\nYou're gonna find that you're going to pay for so many events now less\nThan face you will get an incredible deal waiting and not being choosy [noise] you'll save a whole lot of money you're listening to the car talent show [noise]\n\nAttention San Diego area how would you like the chance to earn cash\nEvery month inconsistent mailbox money will listen to this actor dean king noted Superman on ABC's hit TV show Lois and Clark and now real estate investor with the national real estate network or giving away their riches in real estate get for free to anyone who calls now bill show you their formula for flipping houses\nAs a metro customer you might get slow down your your priority is lower than a T Mobile customer\nWhich brings us to the most interesting to me of what's happening with the second tier and that's what for rising is doing with visible at\nHow much a month for I'm forty dollars a month now and that's rising some limited plans are Seventy five ten Ninety five dollars a month so visible is only forty dollars a month the taxes and fees included again only\nFor iPhones right now they say they're going to bring availability for androids but only for iPhones ... name has not anywhere to be found\nAround visible they don't want anybody to know that it's them not it is that is that it's their network and so it's at forty the one guy show with their forty a month\nIs that the speeds\nThat you'll have when you're on high speed data will not be as fast as they are on parent ...\nThat's true uh and I've been reading some accounts and people on line they say that it hasn't been too much of an issue for them they're still able to watch Youtube videos without suffering and still able to get around the Internet pretty quickly\nBut there is that is a a compromise with this plan and also with some of the other ones he might be slowed down a little bit see one I read through the fine print to know that\nYou are paying less but you may be getting a little bit slower service\nAnd the biggest difference between the horizon visible and cricket and a metro buy T Mobile and the booze is how many stores as the invisible I go in and all they really are invisible\nThere is no stores it's all done through an app\nThat's right you download the app you sign up for the service there you pay through that everything and that's really much more how cell phone service have done elsewhere in the world without relying on a big network or stores\nOr cricket is suddenly a Eighteen ...\nSecond tier brand has now been exposed that they weren't up to the standards of the others so they made some changes\nYeah uh what cricket did cricket has to unlimited plans and there really hasn't been much of a change to the cheaper one\nIt does restrict your speeds and that's a compromise that I think a lot of people might not be comfortable with but it's a really great type price points are fifty dollars a month for one line but for for lines it's a hundred dollars a month so that's still a really good deal and then if you're drunk sees itself it's all included\nAre now they're\nMore expensive plan they used to have a limitation on speed as well but that's now been removed so four fifty five dollars a month with auto pay you're getting really fast unlimited plan on Eighteen T's network\nAnd the reason it's fifty five is there is a grudge match of hate\nBetween eighty and see and John ledger the guy from the mobile bay hate each other Eighteen he tried to have him arrested in Las Vegas a few years ago at CBS they I mean it is like a blood feud like Hatfield McCoys so\nTeen mobile came out with the metro buy T Mobile it's sixty so then cricket said well we're going to go fifty five exactly so the competition is great and you've got all this explained were charts and all that\nWe've got it all laid out so all the all these plans you can read side by side and then you can go and also compare them to the big four forest plans to see if saving that extra twenty dollars a month or so is going to be worth it for you and you can deal with some of the the gotcha has that come with all of these unlimited plants\nAnd now we moved to a marketplace where there are now three tiers of service\nThere's the second tier companies we've talked about and now there's a third tier of ultra cheap companies that come with a lot of things you've got to be willing to live with and we have those laid out for you at Clark dot com as well with those plans starting at as little as ten dollars a month\nFor bona fide real cell phone service with\nI'm not a huge amount of data but some data yeah\nWell thank you and I appreciate how you stay on top of this because is there ever a week that goes by that cell phone right plans don't change\nNo they're changing multiple times a week and we're staying on top of it all its own Clark dot com thank you very much\nJohn joins us on the Clark Howard show Hi John\nThat color [laughter] ... how are you do talk to you great to have you\nKnow I'm doing well I'm an avid listener and glad to be on um\nHad a question for you though which is it seems like you're favoring one of your children are vanguard you continue to call them the the lowest cost provider the low cost provider um\nWell actually I have I have favorite children\nAnd so it's hard to pick you know it's like a parent's arrest you know you got you got these these four kids which is really your favorite why don't have any favors are all [laughter] now you're you're doing that to me with investing so tell me who it is you feel like I'm dissing\nFidelity you've mentioned on your show they have to you know widely diversified funds mutual funds that have come out they have a ton of really low cost no transaction fee each yes\nOr no minimum to account minimum to start um they've really kind of blazed the trail of lowest cost in my opinion\nZero's that has such a brilliant marketing campaign around the ... zeroes which have no commission and no ongoing fees that they absorb all the fees\nI think this is absolutely great what fidelity is done finality ah let me tell you why this came about fidelity had found itself steadily losing market share\nTo a nachos fan guard but also to the bigger player out there that most of us in the United states don't pay a lot of attention to black rock\nAnd so the two of them were taking all the market share their was out there so fidelity\nComing up with the new product development zero has set down a marker that no one can say they're not the cheapest because obviously fidelity at no cost is offering a better deal than anybody else\nAnd so they have the total stock market index which has thousands of U.S companies\nAll in one investment at no fees at all and then the international index fund which just thousands of international stocks all free so a fidelity\nAnd then the international index fund which just thousands of international stocks oh free so a fatality is in the game solid you know what else they've done\nWhich\nSo fatality used to have relatively high cost target retirement funds\nAnd now they have two flavors up the bay of an extremely low cost series of\nA target retirement funds and then they have their old one that still has very high cost well not high costs but a higher than a low cost companies should be offering\nSo they have become much more aggressive on the front and so do you invest with fidelity and you wonder why always talked about vanguard or were you trying to figure between the two\nSo I didn't know which ... and just kind of comparing costs and I also kind of ... was invested in their ecosystems thirty two percent cash card\nGood for you explain that a\nLot of people don't know that fidelity offers one of the two best credit cards in America\nYou have a two percent cash back on every every purchase you run through and I think it's underwritten by a separate bank but you get two percent cash back deposited into any of your fertility account\nSo that he has managed bastion an account or it can be an IRA over right or a college savings plans exactly yeah\nSo so you want to know why do I always talk vanguard vanguard vanguard went through that what he's doing all this good stuff\nExactly on a number of calls it seemed like people were asking which way to go and you kind of lean towards telling them vanguard\nI was just struck by that\nYeah and so uh I should not be fending\nFor Dallas because they do a great job a Schwab does a great job I mean these companies are huge companies and they've all become lower costs but vanguard really set\nThe pattern and set the tone and took the market share and that's why they are the ones that created the pressure in the marketplace for lower costs\nAnd maybe that's a sentimental thing\nBut I ... you're probably right I should be talking about that Fidel tea is well now offers a series of ultra cheap choices for investing\nThanks for bringing it to my attention you're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise]\n\n\nTo some of them [laughter] [noise]\nThis offer camping combined with any other offering it

in many states may in fact be illegal where they're taking kickbacks\nFrom insurers at the airlines and the cruise lines for recommending are pushing bees insurance products of pseudo insurance

you had the kids with is of course it's very difficult to go to\nTarget or any other store without a spinning off a lot of money [noise] uh but what was really interesting and this was Sunday I thought you know shrimp cocktail would be good to have to have with the football games in the afternoon\nOr picked up this bag and since it was on sale took it up and as the associates scan the shrimp or there was an abnormal sound or you know not the normal lives\nAre so I looked at the screen that says she was looking at and it said a do not sell this item\nOr an it printed out a little ticket it said to attach this to the bag of shrimp and calling manager or and says manager came over and a U.S but you know what this could possibly be and she said we really don't know we all we looked at the expiration date or wasn't expired didn't expired so next year\nI'm In and I said well you know maybe there was some kind of recall\nA and the manager said you know that that's entirely possible or the you know at this point we don't know so I've looked since then to see if there was a recall on any kind of frozen shrimp in there hadn't been one and a couple of years I'm ... is that maybe there's a recall in process and it just hasn't been announced yet but they would not let us buy that bag of shrimp\nBad is fascinating and it's a mystery maybe will unfold over time but that is the kind of thing that's coming is that we will before we can get out of the store\nThere will be items that are still on the shelf that have already been identified as being a risk for whatever reason and before that item could end up at home you watching football and suddenly not feeling so hot\n'cause not cause your team lost but because who shrimp or or or it was like a ... in your life or you\nGot sack for big big loss anyway you'd never had that happen\nNo and ... you know I I think the manager out as I said you know I'm Glad this happened and and I didn't end up exactly where where you are talking about Clark\nWell the good thing is that whatever the issue with sort of the shrimp it didn't happen to you and the fact that we're going to have more and more circumstances where we don't have to
