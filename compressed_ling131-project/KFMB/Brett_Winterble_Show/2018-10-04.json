now now maybe they are going to release that maybe that is that's changed\nBut the action which her lawyer at legal team and she has taken a raises many red flags\nHow are we supposed to take anything Dianne Feinstein of these Democrat senators\nI'm to say seriously given the fact that they were clearly at a minimum knowledgeable of the cover up\nOf of of this letter for an extended period of time and and in other cases possibly complicit in trying to stick it to a cabin on the last possible minute but for the leaking\nOf the original letter that came out I mean is is are we just going to kind of remember this is yet another Democrat scandal do you think there is actually going to be a price to pay for Deborah cats and bromley lawyers who were who were hooked up with a ... was was he for by the by the ... operation\nI Will will will Dianne Feinstein be held accountable for this I mean she's up for reelection here she's going to win reelection ... that's been established but\nBut will there be I mean that feels like there ought to be at a minimum an ethics referrals to the to the Senate Ethics committee not that that will do anything but my lord it ought to be on the record\nWell some sort of censure yeah\nI mean if these allegations are so serious in order to inhibit or stop Brett Kavanaugh for I'm taking this position then why didn't they present them for the two months or month and a half that they had them a\nThis was coordinated this was planned a ... this is a a part in a typical pattern of that delay and obstruction tactics that the Democrats and that's why I say uh they used this woman and perhaps you want it to be used up but they use this woman they breached Turk requests for anonymity\nAh they lied about her travel habits or fear of flying in order to create a political spectacle in theater\nThat we were all witness to no matter how Brett Kavanaugh came out swinging or lack of swinging a he has already assumed guilty\nOr in the Democrat world or they're no longer is a presumption of innocence and I don't want to live in the world are all women aren't you believed and I don't want to live in a world where all men are to be believed\nInteresting to uh to check you know I checked in a few minutes ago on Rachel Maddow and she made the known as one of the ... yeah I got a bunch of I got a bunch of monitors in the studio so they're all basically do tune to the different news channels\nBut Rachel Maddow or just no hid in passing so Megan well you know Chris Wray and Brett Kavanaugh did go to law school together so now we

well you know\nReaching for ... you know about sexual assault or is it about throwing I ended up out his presentation on the floor or is it about sexual assault that makes absolutely no sense of what we are\nIs that what we are seeing that last gasp of the messenger is trying to protect their quote unquote white to abort their child no matter when they want to level\nSo let's talk about it that's all I'm pro way\nSo let's say ... you're right so let's talk about the practical implications of this you've got high camped out there you've got Donnelly out there you've got maybe by extension Jon Tester you've got mansion in West Virginia [noise] you've got a number of potentially McCaskill in Missouri I a number of potentially vulnerable Democrats who are going to have to explain\nNot just

like Nancy Pelosi Kamala Harris\nCory Booker Richard Blumenthal and Patrick Leahy and the list goes on and on a if the lap regain power every man it might be presumed guilty before proven innocent or and they will have a political enemies list that's political theater that we have been a witness to buy the destruction of an animal family\nAll will be a just it's child play right now for them this is a prelude\nTo what has to become of our Congress as well as our judicial system\nAnd so we do need a ride away then I Do see a red wave specifically if you look at real clear politics today a they published a list of those states that you just mentioned we're talking point or that even\nAh when you factor in either the margin of error yeah I and so if we do not show up\nThe Democrats win if we show up they lose the Democrats want to hang our hat on how many people they registered about well that should tell you something because most of the voter rolls in this country are dirty\nOr because we don't check for citizenship of registered voters true so they figure if they can pollute the voter rolls with enough fraud\nOr they can win elections and that is why it is so important that

gift because we don't know how this is going to go but given the fact that the FBI report doesn't give us anything new into cabin on no skeleton no captain of the rape squad and I mean I'm not none of that stuff right that we were told was going to be in there\nIf Mitch McConnell succeed in getting Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court given the fact that he was able to engineer around the Merrick Garland nomination and get Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court\nAnd engineer the tax cut and\nBasically navigate and sort of keep all laid on all the Russia stuff that goes on in the Senate\nIs it fair to say that Mitch McConnell is in elite in a positive way an elite politicians like as much as people hate Mitch McConnell and there are plenty of people in this audience who for ever have hated Mitch McConnell I Can't stand Mitch McConnell\nAsia rhino we got to get rid of them we gotta send him packing now he's up for re election in the next cycle not this one but he's up in twenty\nAre you coming around on Mitch McConnell are you coming around on Lindsey Graham not a trick question I mean I don't have I think what he's pulled off he gets cabin on the bench is a pretty pretty unbelievable feet\nIt'd be able to get\nKevin on the bench after you get Gorsuch on the badge essentially engineer a takeover of the Supreme Court and you get the tax is caught\nI Know Obamacare repeal that went badly that was a McCain and McCain was a double agent I mean he was working for Chuck Schumer as much as he was working for Mitch McConnell but it eight hundred seven sixty calf I'm the eight hundred seven sixty five or six to ... do you have to give credit to McConnell for pulling it off\nNow I can already hear the the ... there's going to call them they're going to say\nDon't give him any credit man he's a rhino she hates the press in ... and Ryan are the reason we're not getting stuff done that we need ... such as well building the wall and funding the wall well that's that does come into play for sure not\nCutting the size of government not reducing their spending not applying conservative principles well that's that's true too but but by taking over a century taking over anybody can go any way I mean we saw Robert ... there's a big when everybody thought he was ag on gay marriage in a number of other topics\nAnything's possible but when when you look at what McConnell's doing if he gets capital on the bench and the Democrats do end up pulling off a coup d'etat in the house of representatives and taking over the house but not taking over the Senate\nHe's got and you're a pretty decent firewall there especially considering that Gorsuch and cabinet are relatively young people\nAnd the reality is the clock is not the friend or Ruth Bader Ginsburg Stephen Bright so it is more likely than not I mean right now\nIt is more likely than not going to get another edition of the bench\nIn the next horizon I mean I'm not that much is a fact\nAct but I'm just I'm Wondering how much credit and and again I'm not suck it up to McConnell I'm just like we have to acknowledge he's been effective\nAnd he's been very effective or maybe you're saying\nWell you know what McConnell he's a technician he gets under your car he changes the oil filter he changes the spark plugs into swaps out the oil he's just doing his job after his job that's what he does nothing special nothing

one of the hand off from the Clinton campaign to give information to the FBI started surveilling Carter Page and the Donald Trump campaign\nAnd he works at ... shows you go driving to go driving up the eight oh five today on the right make sure you wave at Perkins Coates right there and when they were called and contacted for comment ... said\nWe have nothing to do with what he did he was a lawyer in the department of justice in the cybercrime division Brian ... was when he did to hand off the chart to the FBI to take down Donald Trump don't bother us again click but here's the original\nQuestion McConnell how much credit does McConnell deserved if he ends up getting cabin on on the Supreme Court will you finally acknowledge and Mitch McConnell is in the lead politician doing good things for the republic or is he still about I'm feeding swamp dweller Diana in San Diego starts us off hello Diana what's on your\nUm yeah I Would give him credit a lot of credit because I think he saw the writing on the wall either either he was going to be no for an evening for due process and the constitutional or he was going to be no Sean allowing the Democrats below over on us and give us\nA different kind of justice system and I think the American people got scared I Know I did sure when I heard that and the way that the Democrats handled themselves I mean I I Am just amazed I'm Amazed I Can't believe that I'm In this country that book I\nI think those women who had the thing that put back the truth that come especially the third issue there and the second one have put back the true victim of sexual assault back decades\nBecause everybody is kind of wonder now and I think a lot to her name but first accuser I Can't even remember ... holes there's all kinds of holes in her testimony and I I don't know you know I think\nI think the women got scared I think the country got scared and I don't know how the Democrats are going to do in ... next month I really don't know but I think that Mitch McConnell did the right to say she needed ... where we are I mean I don't want to look like some foreign country where you're guilty\nYeah that's true for\nAnd and then you have to end this man he they wouldn't they wouldn't give him a warrant\nLet me let me ask you will not let you in effect but let me ask you to sign up let me ask you this because you're you're important member of the electric because\nPeople are saying no matter where the election is where the state is Midwest southeast northeast that it's it's it's female voters that are going to be clutching this election when you look at this whole sordid affairs going back eighty we're now eighty three days since the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh eighty three days\nUm did the Democrats if he gets on the Supreme Court\nThe Democrats lose it or did the Republicans in ...\nAnd McConnell when it like how do you how do you score it was it something the Democrats blew it or that the Republicans just went into one\nI think I think that first for the Democrats ... ... when they started attacking him and you know the accusations and the way they treated him and he can't get a little while we have to test yeah I think that started the ball rolling and then the Republicans pick it up and that's\nWhat's going on here you know I mean you know but\nThat's just what I see how you make mistakes everybody drinks a lot of we all make mistakes\nAnd we don't have the opportunity to elect them and make our life turn around and nobody is ever going to do anything it's a great point\nAnd also if if he said you're not fly you place yourself on the position of oh God\nYeah that's right there's only one perfect person that ever walked the earth right now that none of us for sure for sure why I die I don't I I appreciate you being out there and you stay in touch especially as it started kind of moves forward thank you very much it's an important point that she makes though right it's an important part and I said this from almost day one\nIf there's an error that was made by Schumer's team by die science company it was not\nLimiting the number of accusers if you just had lousy forward come out\nYou might have had something here because we have been ... versus ... then you add in you layer and Ramirez and then you layer in sweat Nick who just makes these insane claims like almost seemed like they did did the Koch brothers pay ... to go pull her out to create a complete mess\nWas there some kind of as a sign up and it was run here was sweating like Paul and the eight oh five are looking at McConnell are you giving him a credit for what he was able to pull off here or is he just doing his job [noise]\nAfter the uh the McConnell is like you know real remember growing up in
