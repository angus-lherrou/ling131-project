seven sixty talked and breaking\nNews so one of the things that I like a lot that I like a lot about the conversation\nThat's happening in this country is each feels like there's a momentum shift taking place and the momentum shift is is\nWhere you have so much rage and anger and anxiety on one side of the ledger\nBut you have a\nPretty remarkable degree of calm on the other side\nYou you watch what happened with this cabinet stuff you watched all the protests the raging screaming the mob stuffed up banging on the doors of the Supreme Court the people in the streets the people going after a lawmakers all that sort of stuff\nAnd I think it burned off a lot of energy and I think now the hangover is starting to set in a little bit early you can feel that the intensity is starting to diminish a little bit because um it looks very unlikely that the Democrats are going to take the Senate\nVery unlikely Barry outside chance that the Democrats pick up the Senate\nLikely that the Republicans not only hold the Senate but extend a the the margin in the Senate that's number one number two it looks to me at least from some of the stuff that I'm reading\nDemocrats are concerned that they are not adequately mobilizing to key voting blocks one young people\nYoung people in blue cities that are already mobilized\nThat's not the problem the problem is the young people who are out there in America that are not being mobilized by the Democrats effectively because you do have a lot of Trump districts that need to be flipped for the Democrats to take control of the house of representatives\nThat's number one number two the other group that seems to have been left behind\nIs up a Latino voters\nAnd you've got this really bad\nAwful terrible assumption\nBeing made by\nBy the Democrats and by other folks who watch these things sort of closely and carefully and it's this people assume because you have any Hispanic last name or you have a Hispanic heritage or Latino heritage in your background people assume\nThat you must be in favor of illegal immigration that you are in favor of uh this this caravan that's coming up from Honduras for four thousand people in it because\nAfter all if you are Latino if you are a Hispanic person to person of Hispanic or ethnicity or origin or your your ancestors came from from Mexico where it came from uh south central America then of course you have to be in favor of uh of illegal immigration and that's absurd\nThat's crazy why\nWould that be the case\nRight we've got a winner congratulations to Daryl in San Diego he wins

there were ISIS guys in in the in the crew do you think that would maybe give people boss\nYeah being you that for sure most definitely\n[noise] okay so Guatemala's president and now it's in the country's largest newspaper this is a dateline today that nearly\nOne hundred I says terrorists have been apprehended\nIn Guatemala why should Americans care about this well according to the corruption chronicles over judicial watch a caravan of these migrants that is making its way north right\nIs transiting across Guatemala now I Am not saying that the people who are coming up from Honduras worse\nWay north right\nIs transiting across Guatemala now I Am not saying that the people who are coming up from Honduras worst gaping poverty and who are escaping a rampant crime and a lack of opportunity and they want to protect their kids I get it understand it I get why people want to come here\nBut bad guys are going to take advantage of large migrations remember what happened in Europe\nIn the wake of the inflow of people coming in from the middle east to the people who were dislodged in Syria and in Lebanon who started walking across a turkey and then into Eastern Europe and then into Western Europe\nRemember who was among those people\nAre coming in\nThere was actual ISIS fighters in fact for a member of the ... theater remember all of these attacks that took place especially in twenty Fifteen\nThose\nWere in many cases ISIS command and control operations\nBecause you have people who are ISIS fighters cloaking themselves as we're just trying to get away from the ethnic cleansing and the religious cleansing\nThat Bashar Assad is doing we don't want to get gassed we don't do that no what you do is you hide out inside the civilian population you do have a vulnerable civilian population that is moving and you're just hide out and play it cool till you get to Belgium until you get to France and then you go active\nI mean it's a natural way to conceal and otherwise really nefarious\nA purpose so the president of Guatemala this isn't some think tank guy this isn't some guys some guy on TV or radio shows is the actual president of actual Guatemala saying oh yeah we've grabs a hundred ISIS fighters here in the country so far\nI have no idea what the hell you done with them\nYeah and I couldn't tell you that that I couldn't tell you but\nYou you look at this group of folks\nWho are migrating northward up to the border with Mexico and I don't know Mexico's checking ID's I don't know if they're looking into it I don't know what\nWhat what's going on but consider the fact that and this is important\nThat Guatemala has long been known as a major smuggling corridor for foreigners from African and Asian countries making their way into the United states\nLast year bought 'em all his biggest newspaper prints a Libra published an in depth piece on the inner workings of the international human smuggling network that moves migrants from Afghanistan Pakistan, India Nepal Bangladesh to the United states that are sent it to\nBuy in the way he then flown to Brazil before heading to Columbia ones in South America the migrants are transported to Panama before moving on to Costa Rica and then a central point in Guatemala\nNobody wants to talk about that\nOne Spanish news report referred to Guatemala as a human smuggling paradise because it's so easy to get fake passports\nPresident Jimmy morale is of Guatemala has can for one hundred people\nTo be ISIS opera his have been apprehended so far Brentwood herbal show I Am seven sixty talking breaking news Jim shut out what the headlines well\nApparently we couldn't shake the Santa Ana conditions because they're back for the next few days what that means to you next [noise] am\nSeven sixty KFC envy\nI'm Roger Hitchcock with Roger report it is illegal for Treasury Department employees federal employees including those of the I. R.

on their taxes they owe a collective nine point seven million dollars if you look at the whole workforce of the federal government including members of Congress\nThey old Uncle Sam a collective three point three billion dollars in back taxes\nThe federal employee retiree delinquency initiative report has been released by the IRS following a freedom of information request and it shows that the federal government is not even trying to get the three point three billion back\nFrom its own employees who are back on their taxes I tell you what before they raise taxes on any other American shouldn't their own employees pay what they owe us Roger report now this war\nThat [noise] talk to her London a president of the London Center for policy research we so appreciate your making time for us today on these very complex matters and I uh I I appreciate you make in time and I look forward to our next disaster I always do to both of you to you as well thank\nYou Dr herbal undone checking in here uh from the London a Center for policy research\nSo let me let me spend this back out to the audience here\nThe president\nThe president has no good a hand here to to play right because the world is looking to President Trump to be somehow responsible for this or to manage the situation\nWe have nothing we have nothing to do with what it is that happened\nAnd what's not American personnel who who went into that embassy it was not an American citizen who was murdered in that embassy though they'll show he at one point or ... or ... ... ... has been a writer for the Washington Post\nAnd has spent time here in the United states with a green card but he is not an American citizen\nSo in terms of a legal in ... it just the specific legal interest we have a very narrow pathway here now in terms of human rights concern of course nobody wants to see people murdered\nMost most importantly murdered in an embassy because an embassy according to all the international treaties are supposed to be places you can safely go to ... business with states to go in there so you're not going to get abducted or kidnapped or murdered\nRight it is a diplomatic quality that needs to be upheld across across the uh\nThe globe here and there there there's there's one particular country I think of\nAnd its North Korea who has so completely and totally historically abused their\nConsular privileges and their embassy privileges because for many many years\nThat the north Korean government would use their embassies around the world as drug trafficking uh points they would they would traffic out industrial grade methamphetamines through their embassies\nThey would also um I'm a ... engage in the counter fading of American hundred dollar bills the so called super notes and they would distribute them\nThrough their embassies to criminal uh means are out there into the criminal of a arena in their host countries especially over in Europe\nUm and throughout Asia\nThat is an abuse of consular privilege right you you are not to take this diplomatic immunity you have and turn your your consulate or your embassy into a a gangster clubhouse\nThat's not supposed to be what it is for and so when the Saudis\nDo they took a show he in that embassy in Istanbul may violate five thousand years of of of of the diplomatic community that nations have respected\nIn terms of well we're not going to murder or your representatives and we're not going to use our diplomacy to murder people and that that's not what's supposed to happen\nSo the president has no good hand here and you watch\nIf you put on resistance TV right now whether it's a a CNN or MSNBC\nThey're going to have you believe the president and killed because showed your yeah he gave the order to kill his show it's not true I watch Shepard Smith this afternoon to forty minutes on journalists are being murdered around the world the president is complicit in this show\nThe murder he's a bad guy he doesn't like reporters either the implications were clear by Shepard Smith over at Fox\nThat that well there is a reporter is getting killed in the White House doesn't care and they're trying to work with a Saturday they're trying to keep intact this relationship is pressuring the Iranians\n... trust me pal you you you don't want to be walking around the streets of Saudi or Tehran shop do remote go do a live\nBroadcast from Tehran or or or ... let me know how it works out for the president's dealing with some pretty rough customers in that neighborhood\nBut these guys are oh you don't believe he was murdered\nAnd the Washington Post is publishing his final column and he was calling for freedom of the press and all that we all support freedom of the press\nWhatever the president says about partisans in the press you know that doesn't mean you want to lock people up and kill them it means I just want fair coverage I Want you to cover me straight rather than coming in with a with a bias but the president is not a dumping journalists off the streets and killing him\nDespite the expectations of a you know of people on the cable nets give me a break\nIt's really unbelievable it's ... it's been something to watch as the president's been made into this proxy for the Saudi royal family and I do not for the life of me understand it\nWe didn't do it we didn't kill him it's not our

advisor form of political advisor to President Trump to\nOther twenty sixteen Trump campaign so the latest outrage the thing that's taking up a lot of oxygen in the room is to show that he said well what do you what are you ah what do you make of this and this this whole cause she'll be saying\nThat that's going on here at ... you you got you got the president kind of genes between a couple of rough customers and the Turks and the Saudis\nThere's no good pathway voted for him and and and the the shame of it is is it feels like these these cable outlets are trying to put it on the president he didn't do jak diddly squat of ... to to cause there's this is on a Saturday operation itself probably\nA lot of well I think you're exactly right [noise] um so obviously looking for the October surprise the proverbial October surprise to hurt as a president I doubt that people are going to decide do or what we get to the last ten days practically decide\nWhat happened with because the Saudis whatever the Saudis are dead and the Saudis unfortunately it killed his than it was an American resident you have a lot of American resident always disgusting barbaric yup uh and do you would think that they would have enough\nFor so I don't understand why they had to kill him in any of that if they don't like the guys riding I regretted\nA piece of disguise before but you want to say that the way they did they did this so we're in this and they're ... they're facing a consequences or with that said I think that they're just looking for anything to blame the president and all the president and I do with this and if you if this is really an issue\nThis is a pocketbook issue this is\nNot a direction of the country moves on a referendum or the leadership because nobody can say the responsible for a bunch of 'em you know people that live in that ... people that live kind of like the privatize acting as if they live in primitive car\nDown it's it's it's ... it's a rough neighborhood a these are rough characters and the you know look\nI mean you're you're you're in New York you're just a couple of miles away from the handiwork are perpetrated by Fifteen Saudis I mean let's be honest so um you know this is not the first time that they've stepped out of line and and it will be the last but we we we are facing a very serious threat from the Iranians are allies are facing a threat from the uranium\nAnd this is the president that's got to manage I mean he's basically he's basically juggling uh uh bowling balls covered in ginsu knives with these people in this neighborhood and get all always\nFunny is I Can't I get these increasingly liberal reporters is\nDonald Trump responsible for the survey said why would you responsible for every ... yeah he spoke

part of obviously besides Israel\nBecause any more clarity he has brought that back in the state so I think that this was just simply some below just looking for him he said well look I think of but but I think two weeks from about ... another\nIssue out for sure is what it is but this president has shown\nTremendous strength and leadership in taking on and\nSay I think the Democrats are you sure where you look you guys want to make this a referendum on the let's say for the ... midterm elections I really gave it everything I got to see what happens\nLet me let me ask you this but we we don't know what's going to shake out with this ah with this migrant a caravan story presidents obviously talking tough and he's going to stand up pretty tough on that and we'll see what happens is this gets closer to election day\nBut something that certainly surprises me and I'd love to get your thoughts on it for the world are you surprised at the ... thing isn't blooming larger in this mid term like this because it feels like they've lost a lot of momentum and a lot of energy in this fight [noise]\nWell I think a little hole semi all supplies but what I say give blessing poverty as a nation by yeah\nUm I wouldn't be surprised if you get it but I Am so strange to live a society suddenly um I don't know if you saw the ... but he suddenly out of the blue gives you an interview\nTo the wall Street Journal yeah any sorts\nThe size of late [noise] um I don't know if you saw the audience but he suddenly out of the interview\nTo the wall Street Journal yeah a ... and talking about um all the ... district shell I found a strange\nI kept the powers that gay are are trying to hit the wall or eighty or for the come out after the election right\nI'm trying to in the attic ... gone up at ... for the Democrats by ah by what they look at I think I may call we miss fired so badly yup\nAnd obviously his biggest fan or does he can't he while he would like to show an issue with I ... a short debate and and now he's probably leaning towards well yeah [noise]\nListen great stuff from Sam Nunberg always appreciate you coming by well here we are when we're Eighteen days away from this uh from this election will get you back on again next week I'm\nGoing to ask about going\nOut to California I I look I think I I went on the record early and I said I think the Democrats come up short of a takeover of the house I think it makes them go even ... okay I'm a I think that ... going to pick up\nA ISIS seat I think hunters going to retain his seat we'll see what happens obviously with the court proceedings and that sort of stuff uh I I don't know that ... is going to pick up off of Rohrabacher um I I think I think you have a very odd enthused\nA Latino voter base of the Democrats assumed that if you threw a abolish ice and and all that kind of stuff out there you'll just pick up a Latino voters like magic which is silly because that is not a mile layer that is not a model if\nPeople that are that are Hispanic voters Latino voters they care about everything that everybody else cares about safe streets schools they don't want to illegal immigration\nThey don't want to see criminals walking the streets they don't want to see heroin needles and bags of poop up in San Francisco I think there's a lot I think there's a lot still to be said by this electorate in this state and\nThis and this this big blue wave that they're expecting could just end up being a puddle here in the state and uh you know you you you get it in the usual spot you'd expect and they won't be able to prevail and some others that that's that's my feeling Sam\n... had major pickups\nI personally do not I'm going to have now now tomorrow so white if you can listen to the show tomorrow I got Spencer Campbell\nOn and he's going to be in Studio from Emerson College polling and you know Emerson College polling was the most accurate pollster in twenty sixteen they called the Trump victory
