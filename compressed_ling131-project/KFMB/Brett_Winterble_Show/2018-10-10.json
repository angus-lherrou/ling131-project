that's going to affect a lot of stuff and I think you're going to start hearing reports because I've heard people\nIn my broad social circle essentially say that as\nYou can hear reports that conservatives have run businesses are going to go in and and and fire\nAnd fire from their companies liberals that work for them because people know what your politics by and large if you're in a small enough company\nEven if you're in a large company um people know what the politics are in the company they know who the liberals are they know who the conservatives are they know who the gun nuts are they do with the anti fought types are they do the Hillary supporters are people know and I think what you're just going to see it as a producer class is going to take it out on liberals there in the company and they're just going to go in there be like\nHey listen we're limited in your position I'm really sorry I'm\nMaybe Michael Moore's hiring but we are we are eliminating your position um effective immediately here's a two week severance thanks a lot it's been really good by\nAnd I think because at some point the Democrats in play all the games they want to play it inside the sphere of democratic politics and what they can do is they can they can chase people down and and corner of them in restaurants and go after public officials and that sort of stuff\nBut I think what's what's going to happen is in real life you're going to see what people do on social media which is they're going to eliminate\nThey're going to live eliminate troublemakers from their life\nAnd documenting physical or by one cause conservatives don't go out into the streets and punch people and beat people up because of their politics they really don't\nWhen you see the stupid white nationalist with their Confederate flags I said it at the time and the Confederate flags the flag of trees and I think a Nazi flags the flag of treason to be honest with you\nYou want to fly those those things those are flags that were vanquished by the union army those were flags that were vanquished by the Americans and the allies and the allied forces I Would never raise a communist flag never raises Soviet flag I wouldn't ... never raise a Nazi flag would never read the Confederate flag to be honest with you\nI'm not going to go out and beat people up I'm not going to go up but what I Am going to do is I'm gonna start removing myself from the circles of people with whom it's not just that I disagree but that represent a systemic threat to my wellbeing in terms of economics in terms of policy and things like that I'm going to try to convince people to agree with me\nBut I'm not going to make it any more personal and that and I think that's what you're going to end up having\nMore battles cars which inspired me to create simple and affordable payroll for us business owners with one to one hundred employees\nHe don't have to make the same mistakes I did let us help

Americans strongly dislike PC culture\nYeah show monk is a lecture on government at Harvard University so you know price that in the equation\n\nSteven Hawkins and Daniel you'd kitten Miriam one tour as in Tim diction have put out a report today entitled hidden tribes a study of America's polarized landscapes\nGuess what it turns out people don't like the PC thing\nThey noticed a breakdown of of Americans are and this is a survey that was done between eight thousand respondents in thirty one our interviews six focus groups conducted from December twenty Seventeen September of\nTwenty Eighteen and and you look at the issues like white privilege sex harassment um\nThat sort of stuff and they know in this case\nThat there are seven distinct clusters of Americans right these years seven tribes of Americans in their in their analysis progressive activists traditional liberals passive liberals politically disengaged moderates traditional conservatives and devoted conservatives\nAll right so I read that is five groups of liberals and two groups of conservative but let's just go with their model for a second year according to the report twenty five percent of Americans are traditional are devoted conservatives\nAnd their views are far outside the American mainstream okay so we'll we'll pull the twenty five percent of traditional and devoted conservative I'll call them wackos insect down the side and our mind okay very good\nUm eight percent of Americans are progressive activists their views are even less typical so you've got\nThirty three percent of people thrown out of the pile right now okay two thirds of Americans who don't belong to either quote extreme constitute an exhausted majority in America their members share a sense of fatigue with the polarized national conversation and\nA willingness to be flexible in their political viewpoints they also had a lack of voice in the national conversation\nMost members of the exhausted majority and then some dislike political correctness among the general population eighty percent believe political correctness is a problem in our country even young people do\nPolitical correctness among the general population eighty percent believe political correctness is a problem in our country even young people don't like political correctness Seventy four percent between the ages of twenty four and twenty nine Seventy nine percent under age twenty four\nOn this particular issue vote whoa\nWhoa whoa ... folk are a minority across all ages\nWhites are ever so slightly less likely than average to believe that political correctness is a problem in the country so let me say that again whites are ever so slightly less likely than average to believe that political correctness is a problem in the country Seventy nine percent of them share that sentiment\nInstead it's Asians had eighty two percent Hispanics eighty seven percent American Indians eighty eight percent who are most likely to oppose political correctness\nWait a minute I thought why it's where the problem way way way you're you're busting this thing wide open on me here wait a minute hold on\n[noise]\nOne forty year old American indian and Oklahoma said his focus group according to the report quote seems like every day you wake up some things change do you say Jew or Jewish is it a black guy and African American you're on your toes because you never know what to say so political correctness in that sense it's scary\nYou feel that way folks I mean honestly and if you want to be anonymous and you want to call in a way and on this are you arguing that group of people where you go I don't know any more is this thing is that a thing everything's become a thing and I'm going to offend somebody and then I'm going to get fired and I don't want to be so I'm just going to shut up and just kind of take it\nA hundred and seven sixty Seventy eight hundred seven sixty five through six to if agent race don't predict support for political correctness what does incoming education\nEighty three percent of respondents who make less than fifty thousand dollars dislike political correctness\nSeventy percent of those who make more than a hundred thousand are skeptical skeptical about it\nEighty seven percent who have never attended college think political correctness has grown to be a problem only sixty six percent of those where they post graduate degree share the sentiment\nPolitical tribes defined by the author's isn't even better predictor of views on political correctness among devoted conservatives Ninety seven percent belief political correctness has a problem traditional liberals sixty one percent do progressive activists are the only group that strongly backs political correctness\nMore than Seventy percent\nOnly thirty percent of progressive activists see political correctness as a problem I think about how the tone is being set by that super minority of people\nBecause remember Seventy percent of the politically correct loving progress is are driving that conversation and how many are there out of them out of the American mainstream that are progressive activists eight percent of the entire population\nThey're calling the tune that's the elite those are the people in DC and New York and Hollywood in Silicon valley Chicago\nCan you identify with this eight hundred seven sixty KF and the one eight hundred seven sixty five three sixty let's talk about ... am seven sixty talking breaking news Jim show that was the big story\nWell the flu season coming in today city officials took the first steps to diminish its impact the story next\nAm seven sixty KF MB I'm Roger Hitchcock with Roger report I could spend a lot of time talking about crazy legislation passed by the California legislature in Sacramento but let's talk about one set of built twelve fifty signed by governor Jerry Brown which solution is the requirement\nThat state senators and simply members reside in the district that they purport to represent\nThe rule has been since Eighteen fifty but if you want to represent a district the assembly or said it you have to live in that district and be registered to vote in that district have your primary residence in that district if you're going to quote represent\nThe people of that district now as B. twelve fifty says well the new assumption is that any address a candidate loose on their voter registration will be accepted\nAs their residents for eligibility to run for office\nAnd the bill prohibits prosecutors from using any evidence to establish that the law makers primary residences somewhere else is there no end of the corruption his Sacramento that's the Roger report now this word\nSo this is something that's really important to me a snoring is usually a symptom of something a lot more serious so\n\nHere's an email I got twenty five minutes ago an email from twenty five minutes ago\nSitting here putting this show together and I get a get this note making an observation about the state of things about the state of things in our country it comes in from Nick Nick writes\nIt feels wrong back the Indians in Braves both got eliminated on Columbus Day I'll just relax and watch some foot law oh God the Redskins or play\n\nI mean that's that's symptomatic I mean is that not that day that is eight\nMike on the eight welcome to the show what do you think about this study this hidden tribes conversation [laughter]\nI Love your show read it and uh gosh I Wish I was half as bright as you political correctness I think was best defined to me by a a student at Texas a and M. and two thousand seven\nWhen he said political correctness is a doctor and fostered by a delusional a logical minority and rapidly promoted by unscrupulous mainstream media\nWhich holds forth the proposition that it is entirely possible to pick up a piece of poop by\nThe clean and [noise]\nLike I Wish I was paid for use you and your friends that I Am I I didn't\nGo there I'll tell you what do I mean it just to follow up I think what you just sit in your last two minutes just nails it to me the ... the fundamental problem I see with\nThe left and I have a lot of friends that are liberal and that are Democrats but the fundamental problem I see what they're thinking is that we can solve racism\nWas more racism and then ultimately if the if the conversation continues I'm told that I Can't possibly contribute anything positive to the conversation ultimately because\nI have ... as a proportion\nI have a in a relative matter I have less melanin right in my uh skin then or somebody else their form my opinion is is just inherently racist and\n... and therefore doesn't matter anyways you're right I I think that's I think that's where we all get lost I hate racism I despise sure I'm ... and in my life and in my job I've I've I've spoken to a lot of folks that are that are black and I've asked them about racism and and their experiences in life and by and large the vast majority of those\nOf those people have told me that the most racist people that they've encountered a maritime\nWere other\nMinorities for other people of color and it it's it's I don't know I just wonder if we're where we were back in the sixties what the you know there's a giant silent majority and and the folks making all the news the they looked like there are they looked like there are a majority but they maybe they're maybe they're not\nWell the new marijuana or they're not according to this hidden tribes report apparently they're not they're not but they are able to project much more of a size and much more power\nThan than there as they as they as they say in the world of cricket their batting above their weight right and that's and that's really what you're dealing with here now here's where I think it gets very complicated\nIf you are attempting to raise awareness about an issue\nSo let's say a it's breast cancer awareness month okay\nIf you're informing people about breast cancer or any other camps are out there and you're saying hey there's X number of cases of breast cancer every year we've got to really do something to battle breast cancer or there's all ... number of cases every ... Samaras happening we need to do something about all summer\nSo if you think about if you think about identity politics and and and the arguments over racism or identity or those sorts of things\nIf you are educating people about that sort of stuff it really shouldn't be framed through the lens of a zero sum game\nAll right so nobody walks around and says this is breast cancer awareness month did you know with breast cancer awareness month you didn't know your is dumb uterus gummy person for not knowing that and you know what you're ignorant\nOf breast cancer and you are the problem you're that's what happens when you get into conversation black lives matter any of these any of that and the social issues that have been ... that have been raised in the last decade right go back to the Nineteen eighties when you add the outbreak of HIV and AIDS\nAnd what happened you had people actively going out there trying to educate people you can't get aids if you hug somebody you\nCan't get aids if you sit on a toilet seat you can't say I mean remember people didn't know so they were they were educated and they were informing\nFor for many in the civil rights movement\nThe black civil rights movement in the Nineteen sixties okay what what what was Martin Luther king advocating for her to score equal opportunity and access I have a dream that one day little black girls and a little white boys will be able to have the same I that's sort of stuff none of that was ever sold as\n... I'm coming we're taking your the enemy you got to be destroyed we're going to get you out of your job we're going to get you fired for what you said we're going to get\nWhen you frame when you frame social\nJustice matters against the backdrop of a zero sum political game\nThat is a toxic recipe\nBecause what you have are people who harden themselves into positions\nWhat you saw happened when Kavanaugh was an inability to change a single mind either way you're not going to change feminist off of believing Ford you're not going to change a lot of people were backing Kavanaugh off of not believing Kavanaugh because it has become a zero sum game\nAt dawn and fueled on by a dangerous concoction\nA dangerous mix of college professors\nOf special interest groups funded by money interest in that fight\n\nAnd whether it's guns whether it's abortion whether it's\nAnything that's a volatile issue like that the ... definition of marriage if you try to sell that against the backdrop of zero sum game of politics\nWere you when you lose Eric Holder when they go low we kick 'em in the head Hillary Clinton\nWe want to win let's be uncivilized let's be in civil to these people let's do this and destroy them let's not just when let's destroy them less confront them where they eat\nConfront them where they let's not try to convince them that separation of families is a sad thing or a bad thing let's confront them in a parking lot I'll call football Williams helped bring the cinder block and we'll be sure to either convince these people were severely injured them on the way\nThis is the problem\nCinder block and will be shared either convince these people were severely injured among the way\nThe problem\nThat group of people willing to do that kind of activity anti by the Nazis\nWhatever that's a small group but they got a big podium\nAnd nobody is engaged in the art or the active persuasion instead they're in the pursuit of domination and that's why you can't have an adult conversation I did not mean that ride\nIt out at seven sixty KFI maybe it's the ... wonderful show I have seven sixty talking ... ... what's the latest hurricane Michael the strongest storm to hit Florida and a quarter century and the third most powerful ever to strike the U.S mainland roared into the state's Gulf Coast today with trees stabbing wins and towering waves that flooded whole beach towns [noise]\nIt made landfall as a category for storm winds up to one hundred and fifty five miles an hour\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell says that President Trump does decide to fire attorney general Jeff Sessions is replacement will not be as Senate Republicans McConnell side of the Republicans than Senate majority for why the replacement must come from elsewhere\nApple and Amazon both have their worst days on Wall street and two and a half years as us stocks plunged to there are worse loss and eight months today the Dow Jones industrial average fell eight hundred thirty one points\nYou're never more than Fifteen minutes away from the top stories of the day on the ... wearable show am seven sixty talk and breaking news\nWill tell you about it that we talk about it I Am seven sixty talk\nAnd breaking news [noise]\nSeven sixty three ... three winners Miramar road earlier crash is final clearing stages right side of the traffic is already we still a little bit extra slow [noise]\nAlso five freeway sounds on the other costs to avenue a stolen car they're forcing you to the right field event as if there is this report sponsored by Walgreens get your flu shot today at Walgreens and receive a cell phone to earn a ten dollar reward on your next purchase of thirty dollars or loss reward valid on future purchase vaccine restrictions apply terms and restrictions apply to Tucson\nFollow Armstrong Getty tomorrow morning from five to send our name seven sixty\nIf you'll have an accent that's probably somebody else's fault but if you do remember mark motor his body shop is M.

you not want to debate that were already did\nVery good so if you're just looking at the news coverage\nYou probably figure Beto O'Rourke is up on Ted Cruz because it's like all you see is battle battle battle I even seen Ted Cruz to Kevin offsite Ted Cruz actually is leading in that race by a real clear politics average of six point\nThat's the average somehow ... by ten some of them up a little bit less but he's leading by six they they've\nGot him like if some kind of an underdog look let let's take a quick survey here of the uh of the races that are that are out there that are happening okay so these are the big states that are up\nThis coming election cycle in Florida\nBill Nelson is up by two over Rick Scott certainly according to our CPA average the real clear politics

and I look I mean I'm a glass as half full kind of a guy mostly I mean\nWe're up eight thousand points in two years of this of this presidency and and I ended up the fact that you know the great things about real estate is I I but I don't think you'll ever see a day where in one day you'll lose three percent of your value and your real estate right may right I mean unless it's a really bad [laughter] that's right that's right well\nYou know I like to say the glass is completely full very nice you know half with liquid house with air\nOh that is there any more optimistic divvy holy cow digging philosophy to come all the different on\nAll of it okay so what are the things that that I like to also look at right because you've got the health of the economy people everybody seems to be working people are making money\nI'm seeing a lot more new cars out there on the road the malls are full you know looking pretty good around here in San Diego um one thing that's very interesting is the fact that the average rent is now at almost two thousand dollars for mayor on that\nSame exactly right according to market point realty advisors or rent in San Diego county hit an\nAll time high in September and the average rent reached Nineteen hundred and sixty dollars you're right almost two thousand dollars up five point seven percent from September of last year and out of one hundred cities San Diego ranked\nTense or in the highest average rent and the highest market as expected the cameras is going thirty six fifty three thousand six hundred and fifty a month\nAnd we have relatives actually young kids they're doing well but man they are paying that much rent it really is amazing and that does give incentive yes to people to buy a home especially now that it's not as much of a seller's market and it's slowly becoming a little bit more of a buyer's market\nYeah I mean 'cause that starts to look like a mortgage payment and you get all the other benefits ownership you get taxed out of all that other stuff starts to play in here when I'm going I'm thirty six fifty and I'm paying somebody else more somebody else's mortgage I ought to be building something for the future here especially if I'm going along in the markets\nAbsolutely right today I was having lunch with um number one realtor for virtually houses away in a living on a ranch is on his area James Bond very well known in the area and you know you brought up something that\nEvery once every few years we bring it up and that's the fact that when you look at it\nOkay if you're going to be able to buy that one point two million dollar home for maybe one point one million because now maybe he can negotiate a little bit more right ah right if you look at how much rates have gone up your backyard you back into it\nIt's as if you aren't getting the lower rates so people get to tunnel vision on just rates sure but remember that hey you know there's a little more inventory to choose from in some cases you can negotiate a little bit more for the with the seller is going to pick up that\nMillion dollar home for a hundred thousand dollars less maybe you know that more than makes up for that interest rate jumped so really the glass is all full it all depends how you looked at it\nSo so when you look at the when you look at the rates out there and then you look at some of the options that are out there right like for example the\nYou've got some of these non the qualifying a easy qualifier loan options right certainly not they're not the ninja loans back once upon a time that we are just insane but now you've got these banks statement loans no tax returns or transcripts I mean that's that's that's something that really do yeah yeah I mean every\nDay every day we're talking about this stuff you've got a self employed person will get show bank statements on average deposits or you know are enough\nInstead of tax returns we use that to have you purchase a home refinance and got an older couple amazing situation in the eighties selling their home for about eight hundred netting about three hundred thousand while they were going to rent I said don't rent you can put\nThat died three hundred thousand or you're gonna run out of it in eight years they're going to take twenty eight hundred miles round instead they're able to buy a six hundred and sixty thousand dollar home put out three hundred thousand dollars down the rest of it as a reverse mortgage\nAnd no monthly mortgage payments and the way they can preserve that equity and actually leaving inherits as behind instead of running out of your cash to too many people emotionally and make a decision on just selling oh I'm just ranting frightening really got to stop and do some planning\nAnd and the nice thing about the reverse mortgage that you talk about a lot is you don't have closing costs you get access to more cash 'em you don't have to worry about that mortgage insurance so they're not F ha reverse mortgages and the loan amounts of gone way up\nOh yeah yeah we're just talking about over lunch that we can sometimes do reverse mortgage loans off to almost five million dollars is huge so\nEven multimillion dollar homes can benefit from it and you know look at this sell off what happened for example a lot of people have free and clear homes tons of equity by how do you protect yourself you've done everything else you can but if you set up a line of credit for too\nFor example a lot of people are free and clear homes tons of equity by how do you protect yourself\nYou've done everything else you can but if you set up a line of credit for two or three four hundred dollars and orange multi million dollar home and kick out a million two million three million with a reverse mortgage you know those are ways of having cash having no mortgage payment\nPlus if you're ready for that if it's going to be more of a buyer's market you can make some moves and get some deals out\nThere really good point also ... and and this is a very significant thing especially for anybody who's bought a home um who's bought a condo or bought a home themselves in a community the fact that the F ha condo approval no longer is required on the non F ha reverse mortgages that's that's big because you options\nAbsolutely we've got a lot of high end and you know lo and ... and\nYou know condos that just Ninety seven percent are never after eight chair proved and they have the equity their IV age everything's on line but the condo development and not have eight year proven it's very difficult to get that done so now with these proprietary non after ha programs we no longer need FHM rule\nYeah it's a great it's a it's a great point to a huge point and it's important folks if you if you if if you're sixty two are older or your spouse or sixty two are older and you got significant equity there in your in your home\nOr you want to talk to Iran about this because there's so many different
