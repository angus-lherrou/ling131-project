[noise]\nAm seven six K of envy [noise]\nToday connecting you\nBack again now with our special show scary thing\nThose parts of real estate that my view\nBy borrowing hundreds of thousands of dollars for putting down roots\nIn a way you would never do if you\nOnce you know the fact none of that is really scary after\nRecently I spoke about some of those real estate topics but go pumping the night with a lot of the men\nRealty in Columbia, Missouri and the president of the national association\nMy first question to Elizabeth was are you scared\nAway there's always Colleen is it is always a\nScary scary them but also one of the um most of the protests\n[laughter] oh ways I think ... is is always a scary\nScary than but also one of the most ... in front of in the air too\nSo what happens in Columbia, Missouri on Halloween Night\nTrick or treating you know trick or treating happens it's also the last day of October so like many communities the last day of the month is very popular day for closings with um homeownership and and so if people get ready to wrap up those mortgage payments and they move into a new home\nAwesome [noise] some people across America fought about buying a home but it's a little bit scary to them should it be\nBefore I bought a home I got home ownership was scary to me any repair or anything that might have to have a new house it was always two thousand dollars no matter what I was if it was a roof for it so it was a leaky faucet I thought it was going to cost two thousand dollars\nBut that's not the truth and certainly you know sometimes homeownership is scary because you realize not only are you going to now be responsible for your monthly payment to live you're going to be responsible for some of those ongoing payments and you know real ... that's a great place where you can use your local realtor who can connect you with\nThose experts in the neighborhood the plumbers electricians it takes away a little bit of that fear 'cause sometimes not everybody has those connections and they they need to I Will check it out make\nThose we make a really good point because you're not only paying the mortgage also paying for maintenance but if your house and you can maintain it so you can make sure it's done right\nAbsolutely and and maintain it the way you want to I think that's another one of the great benefits is now it's your home and you can do what you want to do with it and you can add on a deck if you want or you can put that picture in a while or you can decorate the outside for all those trick or treaters\nAnother scary thing is borrowing hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy the house for some people that just terrified I'm\nSure and that's one of the very first thing that's going to happen when you meet with a realtor you're going to have a conversation about the mortgage process and you know and in a row jurors are going to recommend some lenders in the area who you can talk to about what that payment means how you pay it back what happens is\nYou know you feel you can't afford it or you or you can't payment and how\nTo manage that process but it's their long term payments and if you're investing in you know you're not investing and someone else and with interest rates being lower rent being higher it's a very good thing to chicken too because it's very likely that you might be able to pay less in a home and investing yourself in someone else\nOn the other thing here is some mostly young people are afraid to get tied down they don't want to put down roots they want to stay free and that's why they don't buy a house how about that\nPart of one of the values of this country is freedom and being able to move and do what you want to do but in order to do that it does require resources and many times those or financial resources the best way to build wealth to have the freedom to do what you want to do is to own that home\nIt's an investment in yourself and your future and so um it's a great way to really establish your financial portfolio for life\nAs a matter of fact as one young person told me the other day they're going to buy a house but they still want to live in different places all across America so at one point do rented out and they'll move somewhere else solid\nAbsolutely I mean certainly want to check with your local realtor find out about the communities there are communities that rent better than others and so but it becomes an investment portfolio for you and we are seeing that you know as people want to continue to move and\nHome owners today also become travelers and are renters in property for vacation days so you get to have the benefit of both\nIs a tough one ten years ago the financial markets crashed some people are afraid to buy a house because they're afraid that's going to happen again\nSure that's where your local realtor really is important to have a conversation 'cause every market and different and every market has recovered differently from that financial crash certainly there's been different changes in lending that are going to help mitigate that for the future so there had been some rules and regulations that have been put in place to try to avoid that\nWhich will help our home buyers and that but you want to talk to your local real chore about the conditions of\nThe area where you're considering the by whether it's a first home or a second home you know our\nPrices increasing the inventory low or high you know that will give you more of a sense of a long term investment picture\nSo finally if someone gets passed all those scary things and they buy their own house we need to remind them that one of the most comforting things ever to sleeping in the home you know\nIt's what everybody wants to do the end of the day when you're tired when you're excited you want to go home but it's also the place you get to celebrate so many memories get to celebrate birthdays and dinners\nAnd you certainly get to celebrate hopefully all those trick or treaters who come to your door and and the costumes and the sun and the interaction with the neighborhoods and that's a great fun thing about this week\nWell happy Halloween it was the only men and all the EEO of ... in Columbia, Missouri and the president of the national association of resource\nComing up on research very you're saving

right now I look at\nSomething many people find downright terrifying\nIt's the number five\nA number of the strikes fear into the hearts of home buyers who worry about whether there'll be able to get a house if mortgage interest rates hit five percent earlier this month the interest rate on a thirty year fixed rate mortgage did just that it reached the five percent mark for the first time since two thousand eleven\nWhat does five mean for the housing market the big question of course when it discourage buyers buyers who are already facing rising prices and buyers who can't find a home for sale in many markets\nWhere they could be a discouraging factor but others point out that even a five percent interest rate is still historically low especially compared with the double digit rates scene in the past\nAs real estate today's bill Thompson tells us real tours lenders builders and bankers are all getting ready for five percent\nIn places like Reno nevada rising mortgage rates were already changing the market says Monica my talent with cold will bankers select real estate she told tape TV on TV\nFires are being more cautious you know they're they're not wanting to just jump on anything now they're actually shopping around and not feeling the urgency as they were before and they're getting a little bit more careful\nIn fact for many homebuyers a higher interest rate will mean a major shift in their purchasing strategy there is evidence of that already says Meg McGrath she's managing director at M. K. U. M. partner since she told Bloomberg News\nWhen they have are brokers that they're starting to the customers change their behavior in response to rate and what they're doing is looking at smaller towns are looking at different geography\nOf course the worry among many in the industry is that a rape that is now the highest it's been seven years might make some people drop their plans to buy a home all together and that grim the chief of operations with mortgage news daily told CNBC this is really what the market should expect\nThere's always going to be a few buyers a certain percentage of buyers that are on the edge of being able to qualify when rates go up as much as they have then that can actually push them out of being able to qualify for a home\nIndeed the industry has not exactly been blindsided by the rise in rights when our CEO Stewart Miller told CNBC the signs were there for anyone to see\nWe've been preparing in fact for some time anticipating interest rates going up\nWe've been seeing hearing that the prices that will be able to charge for homes and the amount that will be able to pass on those costs with moderate that's why we've been so focused on innovating within our business getting our cost structure down moderating has TNA moderating production costs and really focusing on the land component\nAnd higher interest rates don't just affect builders buyers and sellers with the right now around five percent refinance activity has all the dried up homeowners don't refinance when the going rate is higher than the one they already have\nAs a result there have been widespread layoffs in the mortgage business and Wall Street investors have taken notice when our stock has dumped thirty three percent year to date CEO Stewart Miller says some key facts are being overlooked\nNumber one we're well situated to a size and scale in local markets but number two don't forget the production deficit\nThat has defined the housing market we've been under producing normalize levels of housing for the past ten years that means a lot of pent up demand is going to come to market even while prices are going up and interest rates are finding their way to normal\nNow if he sounds optimistic it's because he is Miller is among those who does not believe that having a five and the interest rate is the end of the world New York realtor Ryan ... dos Fox Business that rates really aren't very high\nEveryone saying how high they are there at five percent which is still historically low but that's really only Fifteen dollars extra on a hundred thousand dollar loan on a thirty year fix\nDavid ... the c._e._o. of prosperity bank remembers that it wasn't all that long ago that he got eight ten percent mortgage on a house five percent doesn't worry him at all as he told CNBC\nFive percent six percent is not going to kill the housing market it's really ridiculous that bank that race where they're at today are are just it's too hot or not this isn't just a normalization of rice\nBottom line Tucson area realtor and mortgage broker Rob Sykes tells cagey un TV\nRate they're right back where they were ... ...\nSo right now even at five five and a

the most the highest paid players and I guess on the Dodgers highest paid player\n[noise]\nWas going to\nA hitter was set up your money once\nGot a lot of great\nInformation they're a special offered this week Allen is our tax guide two thousand Eighteen tax planning\nChecklist hit is so uh we are almost in November can you believe that I cannot two more months left to go and uh then we are in twenty nine to and I think [noise]\nSo if you want to email us you can go to your money on timecom or you can go to info at pure financial dot com where do most people email us through what channel most of them come through the Web site go to your money or west dot com and then click on the average Joe and be All right\nSo you can just go to our website and speaking of the website we got a couple of questions this week it get right into\nAll right we've got rich or from shy town [noise] hey guys thanks for the great show and entertainment well pick you rich [laughter]\nTime a few years from retiring and have a question about the three bucket withdraw strategy [noise]\nIf I understand correctly the first bucket is short term money cash one to two years second bucket his mentor money bonds through the nine years of expenses and then last bucket for the longer term stocks\nThey say this is good since the three the nine year bond bucket would carry you through a recession without you having a touch with her bucket of socks if correct\nMy question is how would this work if you had a large portfolio\nVia three million dollars and needed say fifty year doing the job would put you in an allocation of about eighty five percent stocks and Fifteen Percent bonds isn't uh too risky does the bucket approach makes sense for higher portfolios thanks [noise]\nQuestion buckets that buckets of money ... no fuzzy now that this was not the way with your show I think can see well maybe not [laughter]\nChicago San Diego guy guys I think for the great show he might have been talking about buckets of money that this is that\nI doubt it let's say you there we go what's your what's your answer of this ah\nWell let me see if I can sort of paraphrase the buckets money strategy so that I guess the idea is you have really safe assets in the short term bucket because that's what you're going to drop plan for the next year or two maybe three whatever the duties and not ... but that they're that didn't happen\nAnd then the second back it as kind of like ... and mid ... yeah that's exactly what was in the second bucket and that there was some missiles there anyway that's a whole other show topic how and then the the last a long term button bucket as your stocks the long term um money ... movies\nThat yeah the [laughter] the stocks and there I think\nAnyway the concept is fine we I guess we would say it differently so\nFast so I although I like the concept I'm going to tell you how we would think about this a ... which is kind of get rid of the buckets of money idea although it's not necessarily bad per se but but I Would I Would say this first first there's there's a couple of ways you can go about this one is rich to figure out\nWhat you're spending needs are and sounds like you already have that's fifty thousand a year okay so let's make sure you got to look out at least ten years of safety so that's fifty times ten that's six hundred thousand that's probably where you came up with a Fifteen Percent I'm guessing of the three million\nThat is the way but that's that's that that's the only one way to figure out exactly what you what that that you know that's one approach another approach going at a different direction which is the er the fifty thousand dollars out of your portfolio three million what rate of return to an eat\nRight and and the rate of return is probably relatively low at at fifty thousand and three million them probably\n... percent and a half maybe something like that lower than two percent so in other words you don't have to take much risk you could have a much higher bond portfolio if you want to you on the other hand\nBecause you've got you have not that huge of a need you could take bigger risk so now you got to go back to like what's your long term goal you want to grow this thing for your kids for charity or are you good with where you're at you just want to be safe you don't really want to be bothered with the\nUps and downs of the market you've got a little bit of latitude there right\n[noise] um [noise] I got a few comments camp\nYou know given the bucket strategy there's multiple buckets strategies um there's just an individual here used to practice and in San Diego\nThat had the the ... up a book called a ... says okay\nSo but no I like to strategy a lot actually um in regards to looking at having different components if you will\nJust say hey you know over the next ten years just be very safe because there's very rarely have you seen a ten year period where globally diversified portfolio has lost money death so make sure you got ten years of income needs and really save money that she can withdraw right regardless of what the market that they live but then I'm looking at this point he's like well wait a minute\nSo you got ten years of income needs and really save money that she can withdraw right in regardless of what the market\nIs failing but then I'm looking at Richard's point he's like well wait a minute and I don't need a ton of money right and if I got several million dollars does this make sense [noise]\nSo how do you have to look at it as a few different things that's kind of the first step it's like All right well yeah you need six six hundred thousand bucks that's where he starts that we are yeah right ... that's where you started in the you know like well wait a minute this is a lot of\nRisk here yes I'm 'cause you're telling me the rest in stocks that seems like a lot right so there is something that's called risk tolerance and was capacity we've talked about that a little bit in the past\nAnd it's like a lotta times it's the opposite where people have to take on a maybe a little bit more risk than what they're comfortable with\nBecause because they needed to higher rate of return yes they need to generate a four five six percent ready to return versus maybe just sitting there casualty bill ... and so there you have to push that individual that say hey you might need to take on a little bit more risk to all these taxes and inflation and accomplish the goals\nOn the flip side rich here he could sit in cash and accomplishes goals right\nRight but is that the prudent thing to do so I agree with you have thousand percent Allen's like All right well here I think you're fine [noise] what what you could do rich and say\nAll right let's carve this stuff about so I Know that I'm going to be safe for the next forty years he's only fifty six K. I. so then you know no matter what happens within the markets within the bond markets stock market you know you and your family is going to be fine\nYou throw a different what if they're you know a long term care stay a ... um you know all sorts of crazy expenses\nAnd then after that it could say well I still have the ... these dollars here maybe want to take on risk for that for your kids your grandkids for charities or or or things of that nature\nSo it really depends on his goals and what he's trying to do but here's what I Would say I would take the least amount of risk possible to accomplish their\nGoals yeah I think that's the that the key right so make sure you get ten years of safety and then take the least amount of risk to accomplish their goals and the rest of it right\nAnd those goals could be several goals that could be All right I Want to make sure that I have a little bit for my kids I Want to make sure I have a little bit for some charities for my church and blah blah blah\nYeah long term care and a lot of folks when they actually do retire they end up spending more they travel more right they have they spend more hobbies and it's like you're maybe around the house more and it's like oh gosh I wouldn't be there to be nice if I had a patio so then you go by the lumber you hire someone to do it and all of a sudden you're spending more money\nSo I Would encourage rich to spend more money but if you're fifty six and he got three million bucks\nHe's a pretty good saver right unless he inherited all we'd have to be a possibility for a company that has stock options are just filled it out other lucky or real estate probably save the diamonds lived for ... [laughter] I'm speaking of lottery did we find out what the hell when the ... billion dollars\nIf there was one one foot six I'm billion ... billion\nYeah with only six billion with a B a B six billion I think was the Malik like six something and I I don't I didn't see who won but somebody then you know\nSo that's our two cents which appreciate yet um [noise] tuning into us in a writing in [noise] ah got another email Chuck from Virginia we can get from all over the place there that's cool I've just discovered your Web reports\nI dunno what Web reports are Chuck I'm but I guess we have um al ... they speak to my level of expertise we have a financial advisor we're happy with what I Will check into you regularly\nBell thanks checkbook skipped without it and I was struck at the uh we we uh\nI guess in in and full transparency we do have clients were looking for clients but the truth is we do this for you guys to\nAnd it's it's like we always say that everyone needs to finance a plan not everyone needs a financial advisor and if you need a financial advisor not everybody needs to use us that if you're getting good information from our content that were happy\n[noise] but I'm Alan the most important investment we can make is probably my best would be making yourself effort that and you know what I Want to give everyone that opportunity right now but this investment will cost you a nickel for a very small handful of listeners on the show today what we're operating user retirement assessment\nIn this for a science review you'll discover hall lawyers savings will truly last and retirement highly effective strategy is to transform your savings of the income or they can increase your Social Security benefits with or that you don't even see in your statement basically strategies that legally reduce your taxes plus proven the principles to protect your life savings\nOr from this crazy volatility with that we're experiencing on Wall street do one thing to take control your money in your retirement this is it\nUm our retirement assessment is ideally suited for people who are recently retired uh looking to return the next five ten years to get yours you have to call us though are in the next five minutes\nAt eight eight eight nine nine for six to five seven eight eight eight nine nine\nI suppose but he's getting as well so that the first thing is if you actually need the money if you need all the money and three years then you don't invest that you keep it in a in a like a CD [noise]\nTrue but All right\nSo then he wants to take a ... a six percent distribution right at sixty three years old\nSo I don't know what do you think should be but\nProbably I dunno forty percent stock sixty percent bonds you sixty three ... traveling the money's going to be done and I don't know how long does he want it\nWell you say [laughter] to to catch our listeners episode what Joe just that he took a thousand dollars per month the need multiplied by twelve months that's twelve thousand dollars you divide that into two hundred thousand that's six percent that should be using right\nIf you listen to us and other advisors the standard is four percent which is by no means a guarantee of what the number should be it's just a starting point and you want to do some planning to figure out what isn't appropriate distribution right for you but at age let's say he'll be sixty two are sixty three at that point\nProbably you want to stay at four percent are lower so as a distribution rate and a and a distribution so now you're looking at or what maybe eight thousand\nSeven or eight thousand a year not twelve thousand per year that would be more realistic expectation as to what you could would withdraw over time maybe over the next twenty five years that's the kind of where that came up from and that that's a that's generally considered to be sixty forty portfolio sixty percent stocks forty percent bonds\nI Wonder where he got ten percent from well because that's a hundred year average at the stock market\nYeah OK you are tired of that [laughter] so anyway let's let's or to sense Viktor ...\nUm we got to jump from San Diego ...\nShe's an elementary school teacher that will get a ... pension when she retires [noise]\nUm I've been told that even though I have qualified for Social Security that I Will only get a portion of it because of my pension I Will be over sixty five when I retire in a few years so should I wait until I retire or start collecting the little amount of Social Security and then uh that's how the\nEmail cuts off yeah\nI always I always say this when it comes to ... and Social Security I get it right back to the well\nHere's here's the issue with casters coasters for those of you that are non in California it's a state teachers' retirement system I'm challenged for California\nAnd so John as a school teacher she's been a schoolteacher for I'm not sure how long um it seems to me that she has qualified for Social Security benefits at some point [noise]\nWhile they're there's two things that she has to look at something that's called Web or windfall elimination permission or so let's say she was an elementary school teacher for Thirty years\nBut she worked in the private sector for ten years\nSo she got her forte corners and this was a long time ago so she qualifies for some Social Security benefits\nBut for the other Thirty years she did not put any money into Social Security should put everything in the ... and now she's got a nice ... pension breath and so she's curious All right well here I Want to grab my ... I'm going to receive much else there's pension Bush should I start collecting my Social Security before she retires\nUm she'll be over sixty five but that's probably not going to be her full retirement age for full retirement age is probably closer to sixty six sixty six and two months or something like that that probably\nIn so if you claim your benefits even though it's going to be reduced price of your full retirement age then there's earning limits that you're not going to collect anything anyway so that doesn't make any sense\nIf you do wait until your full retirement age and you're still working yes you can collect your Social Security benefit\nDoesn't make any sense sure I mean it's it's not going to be reduced if you wait till your full retirement age\nI'm from the already wiped out I'm Out I Would imagine her Social Security benefits going to be a few hundred dollars ... gives us no information in regards to you know how many years that she has in ... I'm Social Security\nHow many years that she has um in ... we wouldn't need to know that information or ... or join you need to know that information that determine how much of your Social Security you're actually going to receive\nOr you can go to assess the dot Gov\nAnd you can put in a W E P windfall elimination provision\nAnd then there's the GOP government upset\nAnd so you can plug your numbers into that or we can do it just email us back to give me your numbers don't tell you exactly what will happen but these blanket statements is pretty hard\nUm but you can do it yourself if you just go to assess the that up and you can find out exactly what your Social Security benefits going to be but I guess you're real question is if you claim it prior to full retirement age doesn't make sense and the answers now\nRight so so there you go there but it's a long winded to say no [laughter] by the way it has and cheap P.

I've heard about I've never actually written with her you have right oh yeah so how's what's experience [laughter]\nLike I said oh you're the brakes it's like whiplash city [laughter]\nWell that's good that she has the ball yeah she's got a big one to has said it was probably pretty safe about little things everywhere around the park next door\n[laughter] so number eight is build a cushion into your financial plan not everyone is highly disciplined about spending and planning if you suffer a big gap between plans and reality is it causes anxiety ... so how do you create a cushion\nCash reserves I guess yeah that's tough to do I guess that means you have to say I mean we all want Christian sure since\nThey had to do it can't come up with what's going to be a little need your [laughter] I guess\nWhat he's getting at is probably for those that are not yet retired but thinking about it tried to save more say more save more to create a little bit of extra you know if you think you need a couple of hundred thousand maybe she for three hundred thousand or whatever the number is he got a little extra I'll go with that sure yeah [noise]\nKept number nine no your net worth but don't obsess over it well your net worth is what is networked\nIt's [laughter] you know we're trying to wave your conversation [laughter]\n\nYeah it's\nA all of your assets minus liabilities Alan ... that's that's like how much of the county yes but\nThe problem is that not worth it it's\nIt's how much income you could derive from your net worth I think it's more important than what the numbers on your network right give us example often is that let's see I had a farm back in Minnesota and it's worth fifty million dollars I can never sell it and it doesn't produce any income\nYeah so what does that get you write it gives me fifty million dollar network re re and living on top Robyn [laughter] means nothing so yeah the net worth is a good starting\nPoint just the organizer overall financial life what do you have an assets where your liabilities at what are your interest payments um you know how much money or you see I mean where are your ass it's located and so on and so forth I think it's really good to have the networks statement\nBut I agree with Kim here don't obsess over it because it it really doesn't do any good how are you going to create that network to do the things that you want it to deal\nRight I agree with that\nNumber ten have a financial backup person\nOr two because they might need a backup person like when I'm too old I was like yeah what a mix of armed ... [laughter]\nMy forget to pay your bills right All right so what a backup person might forget to eat your applesauce Sharon's right\nOkay backup person I haven't really heard of that term be talking about a second opinion I'll read the rest is very sick and the writing as to whether you comma a loved one or a professional comma\nBe clear who should oversee your finances if your\nNumerous no choice can't\nNumerous maybe that's number one that's your number one ... I Know\n[laughter] but I'm I'm I'm a Spanish [laughter]\nOh boy [laughter]\nI was just asking there too but\nUh um uh if you ever needed that decision made in haste and emotion can be as expensive as any [noise]\nOkay so let's just say it was like I'm horrible attorneys are talking about yeah so so let's just say so you're married back a person is your spouse right but maybe one another back a person after that or is it like a health care directive power of attorney for financial probably\nProbably is white guy and I would think so yeah so like I my parents I returned dumped him\nFinancial that didn't trust me on health don't really know either to southern finance [laughter] okay we finally getting to the end thank you remember oh this is talk ... okay you like to remember that anger slaves\nLook I get I'm getting angry I guess I did was like\nI got huge peace of mind when psychologists say apparently gets say psychologist a psychologist buddy how these trying to say it's just a friend he really gone from self taught me to live my actions as if I live forever and my emotions as if I knew I'd be dead in thirty days\nSo here's let me explain to the site of return [laughter] every time my anger I asked myself if I waste time over this if I knew I only have thirty days to live I never do it's calming anger slaves investors and you so if you're going to only live thirty days what's the point of being angry news\nTo learn like angry that only thirty days the live day probably be more angry [laughter] so that's our eleven ways to protect your money and vanity as you age alright well no I think you can fish or for that and lightning\nA piece he wrote and we have to say ... uh the source or it's yeah USA Today okay now we're looking over my shoulder and you think you\nWill um put a drop in the summer and they're showing up\nAnd speaking of our show what we're doing today has given our twenty Eighteen tax filing checklist you can go to your money on timecom download it for free right there on our website and you can listen in subscribe to our podcast for free on demand\nRight because all of this is really kind of on a lot of noise to be honest with ya [laughter] right well here in ... you know so there's a trade wars terrorists then you've got this whole crazy thing with Saudi Arabia I mean what's the hell's going on with that old thing\nAnd then right and it's like okay well what is that going to do the oil and then you have what Italy is doing their own thing with the euro zone or like hey we like to spend money go ... sand and then that's kind of your cousin friction and so right it's\nThere's the market totally overreact quite a bit and then you look we got mid term elections coming up tonight so I mean it's weird how these politicians kind of pull stunts [laughter]\nTrying to you know all of a Senate freaks people out and saying well I Want to go either right or the left because of what I'm feeling right now I'm I'm probably going to get a couple of emails for their comments and that's all right you know I'm being silent yes his\nContacts sure but here's what ... if you look at all of the different things that are going on right there's always going to be crisis is there's always going to be issues there is always going to be things that are not good in the media likes to play on that\nDay and I think that's always forget and you can go back six months a year five years ten years twenty or Thirty years there's always crises happening right and we forget that it's like it's just seems like it's never been like this like it's always been like this talking about right\nBut when when when you hear all of this stuff\nBut when the market goes up it's not really that's not that big of a deal but when you see market volatility and then people really start to focus in on it right I it's like ... the problem is is that when\nIndividuals retire and if they don't have a really good strategy for all their retirement and not necessarily\nThe the financial part part of it but you know we like to talk about the softer sign I mean they need hobbies people need hobbies because one they're retired in the living out their money what do they do they look at it more often than they probably should yeah I agree that if I continued to look at my assets and I'm looking at the news and then all these crazy AI be as is is unbelievable\nBecause you look at one stupid thing on your phone right on whatever feed that you're doing next thing you know you're bombarded by it\nYou know what's the housing inverted your curve or heard of that and then you like type that stuff up on your phone and then you get forty five articles on how the world's going to end the recession because of it in ... and there's all these\nExperts in and you think I'm not an expert they are so we've I've I guess right\nOh I Know I mean if they have an article on Facebook they're mostly a true [laughter] that's true [laughter] so anyway um\nWell I guess that's the takeaway is that when ... markets when they decline so self correction so we're we're we're in or near a correction right now that's defined as ten percent from the highs and that's that's normal that's usually on average as you said Joe happens one to two times per year we haven't had too many lately so this is this is kind of more the norm\nBut I think there's there's a lot of really good news too I mean earnings report are coming out um within the U.S some people have honored there's more companies that have very good\nThey're beating expectations are killing that tactic yeah yeah and then you look at the like Tesla for and what the hell did you learn must was what going bananas what a couple of months ago because why you're not the reports come out the guy killed the third\nQuarter either kill it and then we've got almost all time or a ... a low unemployment right finally got people working [noise]\nWe've got lower corporate taxes so there's more profits for companies and yeah some of that goes back to the shareholders but some of that three invested in buying new machinery hiring more people some more people are working there there's actually you're right there's a ton of getting the ... and the fact that what was in I mean what to me\nIf you want it to just write an article about good news you could write it and everything will be a hundred percent true and you go oh my gosh this is the best time in the history of the United states to invest and then you can also ... all the ... always been that way always always that's the takeaway\nSo you know I Want this market to continue to kind of shake things up a little bit of weight people up to give them a little bit more in tune I don't want you to freak out and I want you to do something stupid but I think a lot of individuals need to re look at their overall portfolios they need to reassess their goals what are they trying to accomplish\nIn and get tight ship fine tuned on on your strategy and making sure that you know how much risk that you're taking on him what types of risks are out there\nYeah I think it's true because I think a lot of folks they\nLike their four one K. for example maybe they got some kind of allocation from somebody ten Fifteen Twenty years ago and then they haven't really looked at it since then they don't even know if this is the right thing for them and this is sort of a wake up call you got to figure this stuff that you got to figure out what portfolio is going to make sense for you and your goals and make some adjustments them\nRight if you got a ten Fifteen twenty year timeframe I mean he wants to go down another ten percent [laughter] I get sick it's it's it's normal it's it's refreshing in a sense I mean if the things just kept going up at this has been the weirdest bull market\nUm I've been in this business Twenty years so I Lived you know I've got to feel any you know she's cut I remember two thousand three two thousand to read the dot com bust\nI've been in this business Twenty years so I Lived you know I've got to feel any you know she's cut I remember two thousand three two thousand to read the dot com bust and then it was like oh my gosh and then you see the recovery on that and then that was All right so now the stocks are good and then you'll get wiped out again from the great recession chair but it was like it just it was too soon\nYou know what I mean it was like I just lost half my money only like five years ago and then I live in a lose it again because the other half is still there was so much negative negativity within the overall stock market yeah and it took people for ever to actually trust the system\nI missed out on a huge gains so this whole bull market that we've experienced over the past ten years what up three hundred and some odd percent right is that it's been kind of\nLike a well is it really going to is it good is a bad and then then now it's too ... uh should we get out\nIt's it's never been like let's grab the bull by the horns no pun intended in the ... why this thing yeah um so I think a correction is healthy I think um you know a little bit of a bear market every now and again is healthy because then guess what you're expected rate of return is going to be a lot higher yeah\nBecause the prices are lower and that's what people don't understand that without prices are lower your future expected returns higher so and let's to find a bear market bear market as when it's a twenty percent down from ... to ... percent bear markets twenty percent some somewhat arbitrary whoever came with it up with that I don't know but that's that's not what we call ...\nSure but some people got to be prepared\nTo lose twenty percent of your money what is that going to do to your retirement do you have a plan to take dollars out of your overall portfolio but it's not going to affect your stock portfolio share do you have enough fixed income in place to have enough\nUm ... you know do you have a bailout we had yeah but other than they've assets that you can pull from while you wait for the stock market to recover so we encourage
