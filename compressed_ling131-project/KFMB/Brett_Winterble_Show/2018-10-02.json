interview as part of this and I think it's a visiting with that being said I'd like to get them because of unfair him this\nMaybe will hear the news on the right of allegations of misconduct however I Am Devon sixty one rather than the fact that judge Kavanaugh about let's try beer and breaking news\nFrom Maryland and drink beer [noise]\nI mean it is a very short walk from drinking beer to sexually assaulting people I mean that's the narrative that's been crafted and created here the problem is there are millions and millions and millions of\nPeople who drink beer who do not sexually assault people\nAnd there are people who are stone cold silver who will still sexually assaulting the alcohol can be a complicating factor no doubt you can lose your inhibitions you can decide that something is socially acceptable that is clearly not acceptable because you're for all your altered reality but you can't blame the beer in the same way that you can't blame the gun for the shooting\nUltimately the individual what the individual does with the beer with the individual does with the gun with the individual does with the individuals part that's all controlled by the individual\nThat's all controlled by the individual and that'll starts in the brain\nIs usually\nWalled off by a good conscience that'll keep you on the solid straight and narrow you know if you're doing something wrong Chris is investors starting us off this hour hello Chris what's on your mind sir\nHey Brad thanks for taking my call thank you Joe thank you sir go I I just I just happened in the car and I kinda got to tell them what what you were saying before the commercial break\nBut I think that solution at least in my eyes that I was telling your call screener what I Would call Kavanaugh calendar no I have two young kids boy and a girl ... and I think at least from my son wants to get the high school I think I'm going to keep a gallon or kind of a diary and just you know ask him on the weekend paid you know whose house where yet\nOver there you don't get much details you can and that way or something like this happens in the future at least you have something to point back to if let's say that person have a date right\nYeah that's a super smart idea I mean look as parents we don't see that responsibility until they leave the house permanently I'm saying right I mean you live under our house to live under our rules will serve Eli a little bit and will help keep you I mean gosh it sits come on it's a it's a really good idea Chris I cannot argue with it\nYeah I mean that's the best thing I can I can think of I mean if the climate is going to change the way it is I'm going to do with where it's headed I don't know how you can keep yourself safe and they keep your kids safe from something happened in the future where somebody just comes out with some random allegation that you know as an ... at least you'll have something they do every through high school\nThat are everybody's got to start wearing body cameras like the like the police [laughter] I mean since this is where we are I mean it's a great point Chris I Can't again it worked for I think it worked for Brett Kavanaugh will\nSee even even Shelley White House trying to come out and say oh these are all cold words for things you did look at all these code words right here on the map in San Diego a welcome to the program\n[noise] what's what's going on Brett how you doing I'm well buddy what's happening not much\nHey I'm ... the way I look at this is two fold one you know I've got kids that are in high school and all that other stuff and you just have to have very grim conversation about you know no means no and and I mean you know don't don't misconstrue in any\nYou know any leads to another person may give you that that's one but two the one that really scares me is what I think we're going to see out of all of this is that we will start to see some hastily passed laws and what will get is because you want to support\nPeople that have been sexually assaulted whether it's a woman or a man what you're going to get is you're going to get a\nA a law that is not found the wreck um yeah laws that are going to be better it's going to literally be ... be a person saying there's parts of the sexual assault B. singer arrested right there is no there is no answer for ... about it right so\nYou can be a and I'm not knocking this particular law but sure if your wife or partner says that this person abuse me at home\nThe cops don't ask any questions they arrest right right so what you're going to get drunk and then now what you're going to get on the worst part of that is the is you know a majority of it will be on the male side you know what you will get his you'll get the mail saying well wait a minute what about\nThis you know what about being falsely accused and I have proven yup right so then that law will later on much later I'm sure we'll probably be passed um where the person that's cleaning the sexual assaults right\nIs not you know it it is is being serious because they didn't have enough evidence now well you'll get is even more\nI'm not going to talk about it nobody wants to deal with it you know you're not going to have a good conversation all because of this was done emotionally and and I get part of that but also not to the standard of law\nWell you know ... or not\nYes but here's the problem the people that we're looking at that would write those laws are the people who were week ago said cabinet I needed to testify first about where he was for the entirety of Nineteen eighty two and then she'll tell her allegation afterwards they have it exactly reversed and that's a huge problem\nThat is a huge problem on that but that that's what they want so you know what will happen is we will lead the way the state of California ...\nAny to some news and they'll get in there I Hope not oh Cox gets in there but any to some notice him all gather it\nWe're going to pass a law how you're above sorrows gonna ride hundreds going to be the strictest toughest law in the history of law [noise]\nEight hundred seven sixty ... what are you telling your son's your grandson's you granddaughters your daughter's not this brave new world we're living in Brentwood herbal shall we have seven sixty talking breaking news Jim Chavez deadlines are learning today about a letter sent to Kavanaugh's staff from an ocean side woman claiming she was sexually assaulted by the Supreme Court nominee will have more details next\nAm seven sixty K. F. M. B. on Roger Hitchcock with Roger report\nMinnesota is a state kicking in the most refugees from Somalia the valley fair amusement park and Kobe Minnesota's about thirty minutes south of Minneapolis\nLast Saturday they were celebrating law enforcement appreciation day hundreds of local law enforcement officers and their families were enjoying\nThe amusement park when a group of about a hundred Somali men rushed past security an amusement park staffers at the front entrance and commit to start fights in the park and setting off car alarms in the parking lot\nHundreds of police officers responded to the fights inside the park trying to quell the violence\nThat what's interesting about this incident is that the media in Minnesota never mentioned that the mob invading the amusement park or civil use apparently there is a cover up going on in Minnesota that any violence by Somalis you'll never mentioned that if they're\nAfter all there's an election coming up and you don't want to stir up any anti refugee anti Somali anti immigrant sentiment among voters do that's Roger report this work\n[noise]\nUnbelievable Dan and Benita helped me out Dan my blood pressure went up like Seventeen points are helped me out with this stuff buddy\nBread that three daughters yes a\nAnd a wife and my mom still alive I run a business I said what man in their right mind would want to hire a woman from now on what man in their right mind my daughters play sports would want to coach a girl for the\nWomen or vindictive emotional as it is I can you imagine getting a girl out that in high school or college team and she can facing the coach grabbed my by\nMy daughter said oh yeah the on the male teacher to believe that the female accuser I said that right I said well let me tell you something we're going to send some letters to your school from oral accusing the male teachers of grabbing your bye And let's see how far they believe they can be that that the innocent or guilty or innocent lives out far that goes\nOkay let me go to your first point though and I appreciate what you're saying okay as long as the father of a son and a daughter and a lot of the husband or wife\nLet me say that what you set up front that is my biggest fear and I've I've had conversations at the dinner table about this this this fact that women have made a ton of progress in the last sixty years in terms of of getting into the workforce succeeding becoming CEOs becoming very successful people\nAnd because you've got a politically motivated\nEnvironment or a politically charged environment they're gonna be ... of people denied I think opportunities in the private sector because they're afraid you've\nGot companies and you've got small businesses and you've got folks who are afraid that they're going to be the subject of some kind of a of of a claim and\nI hear this I've heard this from a couple of business people who have said one business person that I talked to recently and I'm not going to say who it is they're not here in San Diego let me be clear about that\nUm they said they are only hiring people known by them and to them or known by their very close or or known to they're very close associates\nSo what you're going to have a lot of stuff happened now I think and it's a shame because I Want women want young girls I Want people to have access to opportunity on an opportunity economy guy I Want to see people reach their maximum potential but man I Do not want to see\nPeople like Dianne Feinstein and Anna Eshoo and Campbell Harris set the standard\nFor for for social behavior or business have your any of that because\nBecause these are people who are politically motivated\nAnd and if you're politically motivated by default your best intentions are not the fiduciary responsibility of running a business being employed by business or any of that sort of stuff\nYour motivation if you're a politician is to keep getting elected which means depending on the day of the week you say what you got to say to get people fired up to support you know that's it\nI don't want politicians setting the way business works and I have a bad feeling that Jeff Flake thing we all saw that last week right we saw what happened with Jeff lake in the elevator back on friday and he made his big decision well we're going to have an investigation and stand and we're going to do all this kind of stuff do you know\nWho the women who confronted Jeff Flake were working for at the Capitol\nWho sat for George Soros\nIs a group called CBD look it up mhm he's a group called CPT and they were there to protest\nBrett Kavanaugh they were being paid to protest Brett Kavanaugh they saw Jeff\nFlake there's a story in the New York post about this they saw Jeff Flake going into the elevator that confronted him and\nKnew that if they started screaming at a senator immediately cameras would\nCome over now is her story true I don't know 'cause I don't know her but I Do know who was paying her freight to be in that building for those hours last week okay she didn't show up at Jeff Flake\nOffice and say like some time with the senator to tell them about what happened to me she made sure to do what she did with our friends to block the elevator lock 'em in their scream at them tell them to look for in the aisle that kind of stuff to draw attention from the cameras to create head pressure on on on on Jeff Flake so that he would go into that committee and got rolled\nBy Chris codes fact and now\nChris Coons and Jeff Flake or running for president vice president the United states they're gonna run out of fusion ticket and they're going to run as a counterweight to Trump and as a counterweight to crazy Elizabeth Warren and they're gonna try to run right up the middle and go Clinton Gore or a you know Nineteen Ninety two all over again we're really moderate and good guys you can totally work with us we're super\nVial Paul\nHello

thousands of eight\nCorrect you're right you're right about that or as as well good good good good connecting those dots sits right that's true that's according to a real clear politics right now much later was talking about that earlier today Lindsey Graham says\nListen if Brett Kavanaugh doesn't make it on to the Supreme Court this go round Donald Trump President Trump should immediately re nominate him to the bank and make Brett Kavanaugh the issue in the mid term election in other words put Brett\nKavanaugh on the ballot in these red states John testy tester\nAnd of course they test you test or because he was very testy when Ronny Jackson got got named to be um a a a more senior post are with the VA\nRight so John testy test or a there he is a a pickle commie leftist senator and the state of Montana they're looking at ... put a Republican and Joe Donnelly there in Indiana he already says he will vote against Brett Kavanaugh Joe Manchin will feel the squeeze Claire McCaskill

and I happen to think it's a very good idea for more than one reason I think that it or if there are seats that are flipped\nA in the Senate this upcoming election and I'm personally persuaded that there is a very good chance that the Republicans can pick up some seats yes\nI think they all trees grow up here but apart from that\nI think if they pick up a few seats [noise] then\nWhoever is nominated is going to be a shoo in his hand I think it would be the perfect poetic justice for these lousy corrupt Democrats if they put gambling a back up there and he raced right through on confirmation it would be them find this middle finger you could give the Democrat Party\nHeck yeah would lay it when we would make them go bananas are you kidding me I'm In a hundred percent right leg great call see I like his prescription it's bold it's direct and it leaves no room for improvement it's a great idea uh Brian in oceanside hello Brian welcome to the program\nThat right I Am yeah thank you for calling what's going on\nYeah so I'm a Marine I try to be as impartial on that talk about the Brett Kavanaugh situation such as I can Yes sir uh just because I represent you know Democrats or Republicans I represent American served right on but there's a few point there's a few points definitely feel\nLike it to be highlighted and that's pretty much how the Democrats have turned the me too movement and they've weaponized it for their own game yeah and\nHow that a lose lose situation for everybody because on one hand you know the me too movement in its name need to is the post represent a community amongst women\nWho have been the victims of sexual abuse and harassment feel comfortable to come forward about what they've been through and I feel like what's happening with this if after seeing what's happening with Dr ward one\nWomen are not going to want to come forward it's going to have the opposite effect because of what she is going through whether she was telling the truth or not it doesn't really matter in that situation\nAnd at the same time what's going to happen is you're going to have men\nThat are going to be off the acute continually now turning that need to move into a weapon where you can say you don't need any of it and you don't need it an allegation and you can tear somebody that you have agreements with down completely because this is happening to U.S Supreme Court nominee\nYourself at least he has he has a Chinese years back there is an FBI investigation that's going to prove his case for your average now there's not going to be an FBI investigation now might get handled on a criminal Lebanon criminal level on a statewide a notion well for the most part it just becomes a status quo\nWhere you don't need any evidence whatsoever all you need is an allegation and your life and your profession professional ever pretty much destroyed that's a very dangerous place to be not just from mail for people who are involved in the me\nToo movement as well you know do what what I what I got social media\nAnd I try and stay away from as much as they can but I see people taking what they put out in the media fact he's the rate that she's a drawing he's done all these things to choose your columns rape trained kind of thing would you know there's no evidence or fat is high and richer and they just leave it\nAnd there are still so blind to see that this is also impacting a lot of women who may not feel comfortable coming out at the same time women who say you know what I had a problem with this guy in high school all I have to do is making it an allegation and I get my event\nExactly and it sends a very\nDangerous place\nWhen it comes to making things that are so serious and should be taken seriously like the me too me too movement and making it a political what\nHuge point ... ... people on the Democratic side June that's happening\nYeah well I mean you're you're Brian first of all thank you for your service in the Marines and thank you for calling 'cause you're exactly right on those are the values we have is a country\nInnocent until proven guilty a presumption of innocence and ability to defend yourself remember the most oppressed and endangered minority in all of society is the individual there is nobody who lobbies for the individual and when you decide\nThat that individual whoever it is for whatever purpose is going to be destroyed and you unleash democracy in quotes and a mom after them\nThey get to make that decision I said it a couple of days ago that is what democracy looks three
