dilemma do\nConservatives a strike of blow on behalf of of Brett Kavanaugh's avenge ing angels for the rest of the country who can't to strike a shot against Dianne Feinstein and do they vote for Kevin deli own or do you vote for the eighty six year old a multiple incumbent who\nIs a a going to be occupying that space I think for a significantly less amount of time that Kevin deli owners like fifty four years old who is a committed progressive in a sanctuary steak\nI how do we how do we shake out that race between di fire and deli on his conservative\nWell first of all let's consider why there's two Democrats on a no Republican\nDemocrat shoved through this so called reform that the top two vote getters from whatever party a well run off in November that now means we're either going

includes by the way this week\nThey say that if the the the uh the pledge that if\nThe Democrats take the Senate that she will open up a more Kavanaugh hearings right so no question that uh she's out

not a broker dealer certified financial planner or registered investment advisor enjoy the show [noise]\nWelcome to the show if your first time listening or we are fleas very pleased to meet you my name is Ryan and joining me today I I always like I almost always say joining as always every now and then later you get pulled out because he's somewhere and we have shown\nThat comes in with us but that is not today once you get what are we back to back to back weeks where we've been able to have Larry Larry Larry in Studio on the radio with us I got Larry Jacobson here Larry how are you doing doing great Ryan how're you doing this we do an awesome and for our listeners out there Larry is the top instructed online training academy and the director of instructor development\nSo it's easy to see why usually referred to him as the brains of the operation out here\nBut what are the things that I Love about the show Larry and I get really amped up for this we chat about it a lot will be getting ready for the show and the show is a ton of fun to do and how can it not be a ton of fun when we're just talking about ways where we can really generate more income inside of the financial markets and\nWe usually start to show off very similar way it's all about consistency cars at that point never changes right that point never change it's all about consistent income it's not about making money once right it's about making money over a period of time and having that consistent stream of income that you can count on\nFriday you can count on not something that well hopefully this works out raised up that that step by step process that can generate\nMore income in our lives whenever we're focusing on the consistency side of things we also have to take into consideration well we want consistent income we'd have a consistent strategy the market goes up down in the market also could go sideways right an unchanged market lately we've been having a lot of that down market we've been having a lot of those\nFour hundred point down on the on the U.S and people have are foreign point down on the Dow and even the other day you know what other foreign points backup and so it's almost like a a a a reminder of of springtime back in February we had a big drops in the big rallies or stuck in this area of volatility again is which is one of the things they call a traders market\nAnd it's a traders market because it kind of those by and hold situations can be a little bit painful and so having that consistent approach of being able to get in and get out as the market is kind of rocking back and forth\nIt's something that can be very simple but also very lucrative and so what are some of the things you guys are doing right now Larry with your instructor team really help people\nKind of harnessed this volatility and generate that consistent income inside the market's great question right you know at first and foremost I just wanted to say it's so great\nTo have some people listening and a lotta times are students are constantly focused on how do they get their financial futures back we just mentioned you know you've had this volatility in the markets and most people who don't know what they're doing a freaking out right now because they see the market goes down then it goes back up it goes down and they're waiting for a sign\nAm seven sixteen KF MB [noise]\nIf you're just doing it you miss Larry Jacobs and director of a structure development and top instructor it online trading ketamine shed some light on consistency in the markets were talking about generating more money we're talking about generating more income whether the market's going up down or sideways we're talking about how much the market drop a little bit ago you know it's been about a week or so since we had the big\nDrop in the markets but when you look at those opportunities they are they are that they are opportunities to generate any given generate more income and essentially give yourself a raise and it really is important to remember that\nThe more that money is made on the way down just like the money has made on the way up and so really we wiped out number one we wiped out three months worth of games on this last market drop\nIf we didn't know how to make money as the markets were falling if you do know how to make money as the marks were going down if you have that skill you're able to generate as much money in a week as over the last three months combined so it ends up being these great opportunities as one of the reasons why\nWhenever we have a market crashed there is a new wave of billionaires that come out of it yes billion with a B right billion with a B come out of it and a lot of times they are looked at as a\nA a not so they're like that with not such a plug light we could say because when they made all that money a lot of people were losing money you know a lot of people were losing money in there and those are individuals though who look at a down market as a bad thing now these individuals that were turning themselves in for millionaires and billionaires\nThey were looking at a down market as an opportunity they have that skill set they had that knowledge\nThey knew how to approach that down market\nSo to think about a job if you had a job where you got laid off one third of the time that wouldn't be a very consistent stream of income but a lot of times what the Bush biased with only making many of them are going up that's\nKind of the situation our income in retirement accounts or in if we are reliant on just one simple direction the markets go up down or sideways and if we only make money when the market goes up well there's two thirds of the time two thirds of the direction where where especially laid off or we're not allowed to go to work and so that's one of the reasons why it's\nVery difficult to follow the kind of that classic just simple bullish biased and have consistent growth you look over the last nine ten years we've had this great bullish move\nBut how much opportunity has been lost on those down opportunities how much opportunity was given back in two thousand eight when the market crashed and if we don't have that skill set going forward this could be the beginning of this next big downturn where we could give back fifty or sixty percent of our retirement account how 'bout instead of that\nInstead of going through that process again how about we understand how to make money at the market going down we start doubling up\nOn this stuff no absolutely you know it's funny because one of the things that most people don't understand they start trading on their own and they make mistakes all the time and here's why the number one mistake most people making their lives and it comes to trading if they want to try it on their own first and then maybe get some education a little bit later on well here's the problem that most people don't understand\nFive percent of the wealth right now is being shared by Ninety five percent of the population were Ninety five percent of the wealth is shared by five percent of the people so that means there's five percent of us who have understood the right way to trade how to make money and what's really scary right now and I talked to a lot of students says I asked him a simple question\nDo you work for more money or just money work for you and most people are working for more money they always believe that they're going to get ahead if they're going to find their freedom and let's face it\nPeople who start trading are people looking for multiple streams of income and most millionaires we discuss this ride have on average five income streams\nThey're doing so not because they're working harder they're working smarter they're figuring out how to work right and what that simply means is if there's a way to learn how to generate income without having to put more effort that's the best way to do it and most of the time\nPeople don't understand that training is like a system what's his system it stands for save yourself stress time energy and money love it if you learn how from professionals to do things the right way there's no reason why you can't be generating income as well most people either don't know how to do this or are afraid to do this and honestly\nThey keep going out there in thinking that they're going to attain freedom by working more and more well most people I talk to my students give me an example mc ... used to work in the workplace he quit he wanted to work for himself\nHe wanted more time with his family well if you can learn a skill that will allow you to make money the same way the banks to and you've shared district me many times Ryan J. P. Morgan Chase had only nine losing days in the last five years\nI don't know about you guys but I Want to be on that team that keeps making that money and the only way you're going to do that is by investing in the education and learning how to do that can you see how this could help lead you to spending more time with family which is leave a job you don't like any more\nYou had so many times individuals get caught up in the rat race and you start hearing people use phrases like time is money right and that that's what you're talking about earlier as is exchanging just time and getting a wage right getting paid for our time now\nThat the thing that we always like to focus on his money is money Ryan how can we make money how can we make money worked for us rather than like what you're saying working for working for money and that's really what starts to to to separate\nThe the the financially independent from the financially dependent out there are those multiple streams of income and a lot of that comes from having our money work harder than our body is working and that the whole time is money concept is something that I used to uh\nUh I used to say all the time and I worked for my dad's construction business I had an hourly wage and everything like that and so it was very normal thing for me to to to to\nConcept is something that I used to uh uh I used to say all the time and I worked for my dad's construction business I had an hourly wage and everything like that and so it was very normal thing for me to to to to to equate time with money but it started getting into investing I realized how bad of a mindset that actually is about easy trap to fall into because it's what we've been told our whole lives\nBut we really what we have to focus on his wrists or reward and having our money work harder than our body one of the ways where we can help a few people get started on that later if you're up for it as we can do a quick little give away with some of these tickets we got here let's do some more giveaways right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area that the classes where you see exactly what it takes really generate that consistent income up down or sideways\nSupplemental income or primary income inside of the financial markets all about how that money work hard rather than your body work hard right\nNow the half day classes about three hours long we called the half the class but you're really going to be investing about three hours of your time\nJulie raise that financial IQ and start generating more income inside of the financial markets included with your passes to the half the class is going to be our professional insiders kit packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional insider kid makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty we need you to call now and reserve those seats\nThe number is eight six six six three zero eight seven to three that's eight six six six three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free OJ class dot com and see if\nYou can score some passes there but there there are multiple types of income that we're just kind of touching on there but we have the passive income we have the the active income we have the a supplemental income we have the primary income was kind of a hot topic out there ... ... what do you see most people getting excited about as far as different income streams in the market right now\nWell the biggest thing they're realizing is by we help our students design a financial trading plan a blueprint so to speak and again it doesn't matter what your background is what's your experience with trading is how much money you have it really is all about how committed you are to changing her life and doing something very very different hopefully you can see\nHow this can possibly benefit you in the long run but so many of our students have come in and they've had a lot of head trash emotionally thinking the only way they can make money which\nStood out there and work second or third jobs and again\nMost of our students come to the academy because they're looking for freedom\nYes it's about making money we want you to make income but at the end of the day what could that extra time mean to you do you have time to volunteer would you prefer to go part time and do a job you didn't want to do you give me an example you know I'm about to talk about Gabrielle a single mom she came in right\nReally really concerned she wanted to put her two kids to school very very nervous wasn't sure she could do this\nAnd not only was she able to do this and learn rather quickly she was able to put the two kids through school but bought herself a new car so the thing to keep in mind when you're starting to consider these things one ... get rich quick schemes you're going to learn how overtime to generate money\nIf somebody doesn't want to be stuck where you are right now a lot of people just get stuck in life\nOkay it's not going to be for you if you're not coach of all you got to be open minded that there are people out there every single day making money and doing exactly what you do and the question I Would ask grind of all this did was really earn some extra money wouldn't be worth it\nRight right well and and then ties back into what can you do with that money as far as give you that financial freedom and and doing maybe the fun things that you want to do it it's kind of interesting over the last little bit as we've kinda got ready for our big conference that we do every year you know we we chatted with a a bunch of different students and started talking to them about what they what they want to do and it's amazing to me how many of our students love kayaking\nOver and over and over again like what do you do now with all the spare time you have kayaking I was like whoa we'll kayakers\nEar a thing where they were oh they do that the ... orders they're all real fit I'm like oh it's pretty cool but yeah it's it it really just boils down to being able to do the things that are the things that you love and I mean how many times have you bumped into somebody or you said\nHey would you rather go to work today I Would rather go paddle boarding and most of the time it's like well I'd rather go paddle boarding but I have to go to work and so it's all about doing the things that you want to do rather than the things that you have to do you do the income is is kind of that necessary product that we have to have in order to give us the freedom that we want but really it's\nThe freedom that we wanted but at the income that actually allows us to get there and one of the things we can do as far as helping a few more people get started before we get into this uh before we get into this next break is what we do another giveaway\nYeah I just have some people after you're thinking what would you do if you had more money and time\nYeah absolutely right now even half day class cut up in your area that\nHave their classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to generate more income inside of the market which is where it was just saying can give you that time back ... give you that more more time to do the things you love\nNow include with your passes to the half the class is going to be a professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors buttons on topics like enhanced the retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currencies and much much more\nThat I firmly believe that is because nobody has to live off of our accounts except for us right nobody has to live off of your account except for you\nNobody has to live off of Mike accept for me and so in the end it's kind of courses that can sound\nNobody cares right there's there's not an institution out there that they that they stay up at night going men I Hope I Hope John and Mary have enough money in their retirement account\nYou know what they say that because they want to make sure they have enough fees being paid to them as long as their monies in their retirement account but every day there's a new twenty two year old that opens a retirement account the replaces somebody who's closing their retirement feathers perpetual\nKind of ... income stream that comes from that anyway so at the same time though\nWe stay up at night right the average person has many sleepless nights over money but how much time as the average person\nSpent getting educated on how to make sure their money is growing right I I find the financial markets very interesting because we go to a a car dealership and there's a car salesman there and we really don't take his advice on what we should buy but yet we go to a car dealership\nHas be a financial institutions name on the front of it where they're selling mutual funds and we take the cells persons advice to heart we go well he's\nThe professional in the situation now with a lack of education that's kind of where we end up ah falling behind the eight ball and the financial world one of the things that we can do is we can help a few more people out with that 'cause we still got some tickets we can give away let's do it\nRight now we've got to have to a class coming up in your area that have to ... ... exactly what it takes to really take control those retirement accounts and have them growing generating more income whether the markets are going up down or sideways\nNow included with your half day class include with your passes going to be a professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors the professional insiders kit makes it so you can get started right now\n... when he did a call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight six six six three zero eight seven to three that's eight six six six three zero eight seven to three\nIf you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that builds up at free OJ class dot com and see if\nYou can scores and passes they're now they're still kind of on this retirement check I Know there are a lot of people concerned about growing their retirement how can somebody number one protect against this potential downside but also inside of their retirement account is there a way for them to continue growth as the markets are going down\nAbsolutely a little a lot of our students have figured out they can use other type of leverage assets to actually start accumulating wealth well our stock market isn't a downturn so this great ways that students can protect their wealth they can hedge against it they're learning about options\nAnd that's why they come to this three hour session to understand what's possible in the marketplace I can tell you firsthand talking to our students students like myself and you too we've been waiting ten years for the correction think about that\nMost people are dreading a correction we are\nFrantically waiting for it because it could be one of the best years of our lives a lot of people don't understand that again the markets go down there is an opportunity to make money just as the markets go up so imagine learning a skill right now to preserve your capital where you can lock in profits imagine you did that back in two thousand eight\nAnd you had money sitting in cash waiting to buy those bargain basement prices of stocks and they got back to two thousand nine well this is going to happen again it's been happening over and over again\nBut most people continue to do nothing and wait for something to happen like you said again the cavalry ain't come in and the reason why so many people are poor P. O. R.\nIt's just they're passing over opportunities repeatedly so all of this did right now by spending three hours of your time is help you learn how to preserve more capital city you can retire and the lifestyle that you're interested wouldn't that be worth it\nYou know we always look at things in the investing world is richer award how ... what do I have to risk and what's my potential reward\nWell your investment in this case is going to be about three hours worth of time or half day classes about three hours long so that's your investment that's your total investment is three hours worth of time so\nSo even if you were to say that's your total risk is three hours worth of time well what's the potential reward what if you ended up generating another source of income what have you ended up adding another couple of points have returned to your your portfolio every year because really your risk is only time as far as you're investing three hours of your time to come out to this half the class\nBut the rewards are potentially limitless that's a pretty good ratio and imagine\nThat you learned for the first time that you've been in the wrong things in your mutual funds and your ... can you can learn how to reallocate to give you that rate of return that you that you really want that's what a lot of students are really excited about\nIt goes back to some of those uh those unquote so we always like to throw out in here as far as you don't have to be and I'm going to do this one wrong or you take it it's yours ... yeah ... I used to always say you don't have to be great to start but you've got to start to be great and unless you do all use when a Ryan's is you don't want to spend your golden years at the golden arch absolutely I Love that one\nYou know and and it's all the we have these fun cliches things that we love to throw around but they've been around forever 'cause they're true\nRight we heard him so many times 'cause they're true no nobody ever says well no you you don't have to get started in order to be great you know you do you have to have to be great you have to get started but you don't have to be great in order to get started right it's awesome and\nAnd I love doing uh I get involved with a lot of different races were actually doing a charity race\nIn a in a couple of days are raising money for cancer\nAnd I always compare it to just race you have to cross the start line before you can cross the finish line it is necessary right but it is is a lot of fun and trading investing you can take this really whatever level you want but imagine imagine if\nI imagine if it just made that slightest impact in your life to the positive how worth it with a three hour investment be now before we can get people in the class they gotta have tickets we got to give away\nLet's do it All right right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area that they ... really where you'll be able to

tuning in humid Larry Jacobs director of instructor development and instructor at on training academy shed some light on retirement accounts we're really talking about how to keep those retirement account growing whether the markets are going up\nDown or sideways and and one of the questions we're asking on that on that last segment a little bit out your financial family or a radio listeners out there are you willing to do a little extra because really that's that's really all it takes you invest in three hours of your time to come out to a half the class and then and then putting a little bit of extra time to make sure your nest egg make sure that retirement account\nIs growing whether the market's going up down or whether the markets are going sideways it really doesn't matter the market direction as long as you have the skills and it doesn't matter if it's income for today and it doesn't matter of income for tomorrow and they're used one of my favorite cliche or things you want to make sure that we're not spending our golden years at the golden arches and that's really what this is all about\nBeing able to have that financial freedom and lived that life really that you've worked so hard for and that really you deserve\nNow we want to spend a little bit of time pulling back the curtain on the day a day in the life of a traitor and so whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show will get excited the best is yet to come and and there are a lot of our listeners are not quite sure they have enough time for you know to add investing to add trading into their life I mean you know the thing I always like to say there's only twenty four hours a day and right now we're using all of them\nThe other thing I was like to bring up is every time I see a movie on\nTrading or TV show on trading are investing they always show somebody sweating profusely in front of Eighteen different monitors taking hypertension medication right\nWhen in reality the thing that I Love so much about this and I was even telling my class last night a brand new set of students that are just coming out with them on a training academy is is when you're doing everything's pro active when you're proactively investing you're able to be strategic you're able to be logical you're able to be rational and you're able to set things up ahead of time proactive\nThe average kind of trader investor out there is more reactive something happens and they react to it which keeps them in an emotional state and the lesson last night with the class was was all about kind of a mental makeup that we need to have for to to really have consistent income in the market and it's all about being proactive rather than reactive and I also think\nThat that is a point to bring up in this conversation because the pro active side of it is what allows your lifestyle to be whatever you want your lifestyle to be\nWith our own money or the money of one of our many investors we have a full menu of mortgages to get the cash you need self employed mortgages we got it at a became short seller foreclosure no problem a paper investment

idea that is the imported from Canada that just needs to go back across the border\nIn Canada is common that\nPeople sign multi year obligations to cell phone carriers and T Mobile but very people did away with contracts now are experimenting with three year payment plans for cell phones\nIt's come to that because\nWith people getting excited about the new iPhones and the new Sam songs that all price out around a thousand dollars or so\nThe cost of people buying that a lot of people who are excited about the iPhones or Samsung they can't lay out a thousand bucks and they can't even handle two years of payments on a payment plan interest free which is still forty something dollars a month so now\nHere's this experiment offering three year payment plans okay this is a rotten terrible idea you end up paying more for the phone each month likely been for your service each month\nAnd so it means to step back and look at in spite of all the hype and all the ads and all that look at a more affordable phone\nWork at a use phone work at one of the mid priced phones are lower priced phones you can afford to buy instead of having to finance a phone for three years that's like an albatross around your wallet\nFalls a great time to change your old windows and put it into those expensive energy bill Newman replacing windows obviously there's a place to go you can save two

patio doors\nAnd go to that place instead of the other one that where she's actually attending and I was kind of hoping she'd say monster scholarship I'm gonna take it but she didn't but it was out there and that's the thing is to use the marketplace tier advantage and was state school systems\nThis very somewhat state to state for more and more states are now going to three tier or for tier\nStates supportive school systems where they will have what is for lack of a better term maybe sometimes used interstate the flagship state universities charge the highest tuition\nThen there'll be second tier third tier forest here is a community colleges many of which now offer a four year degrees each here has a different tuition level the greatest irony of it though the whole system\nIs that people who go to a first tier states school\nYour freshman and sophomore year will be far larger class sizes than someone who goes to a fourth tier community college and the state\nSo you might be in a classroom that has fourteen hundred students for eight hundred students or something like that at a tier one the flagship university in a state\nInstead going to a community college to deal with your pre wrecks as a freshman or sophomore you might be in a class with twenty six people were forty four people not hundreds or thousands so he had a better deal and you get more attention from the instructor\nChuck is with us on the car coward show hello Chuck\nLarge\nHow's it going that lab not bad at all how can I be of service the you\nWell over this last ... or a little bit longer up and get offers from companies that are interested in buying my house you know they're pretty persistent and so I just that let me\nLook them up and see what they're all the falls but uh I haven't really been able to find out much about them so I guess my thought is I'm a ... a lot of the sheer number shoes um if they are legit today you know do a\nA low low offer on your property and what are the dangers order risk in in going forward with one of these folks yeah and I'm I'm just doing it primarily right now for\nEducation to learn what they're about what their business model is like so that I can like on the farm decision\nRight so the the people who are approaching years your house a house in good condition and I are established neighborhood\nYes it is so go ahead and name who it is who is on your radar [noise] is there any particular company that you're curious about [noise]\nUm one of them call a a thing goes by name open door\nI've addressed open door on the air let me explain to you what this is about there are a number of companies that are sabotaging and they're racing to establish in city after city in the country\nWhere for um [noise] I guess you could refer to as mid priced homes in a market there's enough inventory\nWhere they feel like they can figure out what is a fair value for your home so with these people do is they guarantee lie in the case of open door and\nIts competitors they guarantee you that they'll they'll evaluate your home they may come in and they'll do that on line they may come in and do an inspection\nAnd then they will make a firm offered to you to buy your home and then with the idea of being the you've vacate really quickly typically within a month can be quicker but\nThey just buy it and they charge you roughly the equivalent of a real estate commission to do what they charge you about six percent\nOf all I'd say just for argument's sake they said the house was worth two hundred thousand they would pay you like one eighty eight somewhere in there and you're out and you're just going\nTo the question with any of them oh and the reason they do that is they believe that they develop systems open during his competitors leave they develop systems where they can properly price a house [noise] get it I'm dressed up however they need to end the landscaping or inside\nAnd get it sold quicker than you can when you going to a traditional real estate agent and having them market the traditional way whether or not these things are going to stand the test of time the market will decide but when you get out of it is here just\nYou know way whether or not these things are going to\nStand the test of time the market will decide but when you get out of it is you're just die if you like the price they offer you ma'am you're out no questions no gifts\nYou know you're done you don't have to worry about showing the house or anything like that I see\nOkay and you also have to decide the price that you were offered [noise] do you think they're low balling you or do you feel like it's really a decent offered they're making for your house all day does that make so\nYes yes it does I just wanted to have an idea what they're about whether or not you know they were\nTotally totally\nLegit no doubt that this is a a a real thing and the company's doing this I think another one is offer pat I think is another one and there's another one called knock\nAnd so with these companies they're learning how to price they're learning how to market their learning how to sell\nAnd then they add cities around the country very heavy emphasis on the south south west and west and the reason those areas because those are areas of the country that developed along the automobile have a lot of suburban housing a lot of ... a a subdivisions and developments\nBuilt with very similar housing plans and looks so they can more accurately price to house they're not interested\nAnd really high end houses 'cause they don't know exactly how to price them and how easily they'll sell and they're not interested in the houses they tend to be in neighborhoods let's say there in transition that maybe had been rough neighborhoods trying to get better or something like that\nBut it is the real deal\nAnd Tom is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Tom\nHi how're you doing stuff now corporate thank you Tom how can I be of service\nWell about a year and a half ago I got us will stay in the mail for a credit card from a small business and I thought well let me go and sign up for this 'cause it never hurts to have a backup card Kay she made it\nSo I I when I got the cars started isn't that because it actually had a better catch that war than the one I was using credit slave so that was gone fine one afternoon I got an email from the credit card companies saying well we've got your address change which obviously was a mine so I called him\nStop the stuff card milk sent me a new one the whole smear at that point I sue the cart into the two lifestyle and started using my original our Afghan and last September this last September I got the same message from the credit card company so I called them\nThey went to the old and so they sent me a new card and then it happened again in October ... three times as happened it's been a different addressed if a male and then the car to to talk of the company and they've certainly on the frog department and the whole thing I did ask them I said no other cars I have\nFor a second level security where they would ask you a question like you know who's your favorite rock group or a ... year old ...\nWho is your art rock group the purple okay now I Know the code to get any of your credit [laughter] I'm not you allow him [laughter] okay [laughter]\nBut they said they offer that said that they they they gave me some of lame excuse to say well people can guess that well maybe not but it's still should be a level of security they should offer\nLike there's an issue though that I Need to point out to you the reason the current issue or\nMay not care as much with a business credit card\nIs business credit cards don't enjoy the consumer protections said a consumer card does under pre existing law and the card act that was passed after the banking scandals\nSo the Congress carved out the exception to consumer protections for business cards so as an example\nLet's say a criminal did run up a lot of charges on your car and if they were successful you able to take it over and run up charges\nTheir credit card company with a business card can say oh well\nWe don't think they you time took good precautions and so we're going to hold you liable for the charges or whatever which they cannot do want to consumer car so I don't like even if you're using a card\nFor business purposes I like for you to get a consumer card and just use it in your business and pay for it from your business [noise]\nOkay so this is the best course of action then it was just 'cause I have this kind of close you know\nIf you've been hit three times by people attempting to take over the account", "show_name": "Brett Winterble Show", "year": "2018", "city": "San
