figure if they can get that first half the commercial half\nThen they'll go after the residential half the next time around because then you've only got half the people who are still\nAre concerned about it so it's you know it's an insidious thing right I just kind of builds on itself just puts more more and more and more money and the government and we know government doesn't spin as effectively as businesses\nAnd the thing is very complicated about that too in terms of the accounting is most people who are renting retail space are paying their share of ... of property taxes on a month by month basis now that that was up all the math all the way around la it's\nReally a hit for all business yeah uh but especially for small businesses sort of talked about if you have a restaurant\nYou absorb a lot of wage hikes and now all of a sudden you're you're paying your employees more 'cause you have to keep them and then you get your rent going up fairly dramatically and that that's going to have a a a ... really a a bad effect on business when\nWhen you talk to folks out there because you are you at all the meetings with with with the businesses and Tom you're there talking to these businesses um is there is there consistent concern across the line is it is a regulation is it the red tape sort of stuff that's really dragging well\nIt is in you know it just seems like every six months or some new big fangs so right now what businesses are concerned about is propped ten which is the ... the split rural rife but they're still concerned about\nUm some of the other things overregulation by government ... they're just really concerned about all of that because it makes it harder and harder to do business in the state of California\nThen you lose the good paying jobs because they move out and then pretty soon you're having to raise minimum wage because you don't have those good paying jobs anymore it's just a a very vicious cycle\nAnd and we're looking against the backdrop of ... when when it comes to property and property management certainly that's a very robust sector or here in San Diego a lot of people rent a lot of people are doing that you've got you've got back and forth happening would there be Indian shorter rental right on top of that you've got it I mean you've got development stuff\nHow how how did these how did these businesses function in this in this shark infested water environment here so to\nYour point you know there is no island yeah ... it's all in a related so it's not like you say I'm just going to fix this part of it or please I'm from the government let me help you out um it just doesn't happen though if you start regulating one part of it\nIt's going to regulate and ripple through the rest of it so you're exactly right the elections that are going to happen the impact of whoever's going to happen\nIn November we're seeing the uncertainty of right now right and I we just had a devise a board meeting last week\nWhere I Would say is the least optimistic a ... atmosphere that I've seen in the last half decade whether it's selling cars selling houses building\nI'm no one's running for the hills right but nobody's saying hey this is the best I've seen it in the cycle [noise] so I there's a lot of caution\nAnd you know a good example of that is um they passed that the legislature passed a no bail bond right\nWell so the government now has to create a whole new bureaucracy to handle monitoring people and doing all of that right which raises that government costs again and you're going to have to pay for that some way I mean I don't know why they don't have a higher the bail bonds people and let them do\nThat right which raises the government costs again and you're going to have to pay for that some way I mean I don't know why they don't have a higher the bail bonds people\nAnd let them continually are structured structure in place that have\nDone a pretty good job of that people show up for when they have to go to court and you talk to the judges that are saying we don't know how to make this work yeah almost impossible\nIn terms of um\nAnd and obviously is an important issue to public safety quality of life things like that are you hearing is that still sort of a front and center a issue for for for the\nBusiness owners that are out there well I I think it is because you've seen a lot of small chips being taken out of it and um whether it's a decriminalize the whole range of misdemeanors\nAnd then ultimately a certain level of felonies and you've got these people back on the street very different population than the homeless population where we used to write that affects business ... dramatically because around those businesses and a lot of these people know\nThey can go in and steel five hundred dollars worth of stuff and they're not even going to go to jail right so I think it's a big concern to business when you\nWhen you don't clearly think through these things if you want to reduce jail population you reduce it by getting rid of older inmates writer and makes you not ... uh do crime by and large\nUm but instead they take a scalpel and they cut the wrong part of the body off online so it's ... it's very difficult to follow and it's very difficult to know how to make it work\nThat ... that is such a great insight and it's not something that's talked about because you've got these people who are just like criminology criminology major's going oh we'll just let these guys out instead of these ... right\nWell I wasn't even now and it was government
