one right now is fourteen thousand strong\nHalladay moving or they walking or are they taking over\nAnd over is no they are they are predominantly moving on foot but they have been transported\nAlong

simple now if there if there were buses that you could squeeze eighty of these folks on each bus\nYes that's a hundred and Seventy five ...\n... yeah okay good point\nBut I'm not getting with the whole story is how they're moving as efficiently and quickly as they are moving so my next question as if there's Charlie fourteen thousand of these immigrants Mexico it it's no use to talk about it before Mexico\nDoesn't have a very favorable um they don't have the border policy that leaders right that that ten thousand plus immigrants have just lives right through Mexico on their way to the U.S\nAs we all know you've talked about Mexico to deport smart yeah illegal aliens in United States so how is this I I don't really understand how this is happening and how it's being allowed to ... and the\nThe lotus with which these folks are moving\nHere's here's the thing I'm puzzled by eight started at four thousand on friday and now it's fourteen thousand on Tuesday which tells me there it's not all Hondurans and Guatemalan\nIt they picked up a lot of Mexicans along the way or people that have been hanging out in Mexico waiting to hop hop on you know the gym or something and then

you get a chance to come out and hang out with us in our amazing sponsors um to come out and do it\n'cause it's a great sense of community we have to and so much of that is so important because in a highly charged in polarized political environment um there are elements in our culture elements in our country and yes elements in our community\nWho benefit when we feel isolated and that's been one of the core mission of the show as since I came back to San Diego in twenty Fifteen are doing this show and that was this idea that we could create a kind of a culture and a con activity with\nEach other because so many people feel like oh I'm just crazy I'm just uh I'm I'm just a loony tune my wife my husband my kids they don't want to hear my opinions on things\nBut when you get folks together and they start sharing ideas and and saw sin and laughter and you draw some of the same organic conclusions about the way politics is running in our state in our community and our country\nYou that isolation comes down that those those walls come down and you realize there's this huge support system of people that you may only meat or see once every six eight months\nYou may only see him once a year when we get together\nA at different events but it's important to have that stickiness and kind of activity because the cynicism that's out there and the political process benefits when you feel isolated because they've taken demoralized you one person at a\nTime and you never get together and hang out um it's a tough situation now we're watching what's taking place today the big outrage beginning very early this morning as we started to see the news coverage\nOf suspicious explosive devices being sent\nA not just a George Soros his house in Westchester County New York\nA couple of days ago but now today a there was an attempt to send them to ... to the Clinton compound and an attempt to send them to uh uh the due to the to the folks are over at the Obama compound in ... rama and all that sort of stuff all that sort of stuff that went on\nUm all that sort of the activity\nUnderway and that's that's what we saw that is what we saw take place and it's\nIt's disturbing to see that kind of behavior I don't like seeing a cable news channel have to evacuate because of a bomb scare\nI don't like having to see a former presidents of the United states have to be protected by Secret Service because there are people for whom politics is quite literally a life and death deal\nReally different and all of his patients agree\nIt's the people Dr hell we're going to staff provide

friends in the deep state\nI don't know I mean I don't know I don't know where any of this is coming from that's the problem right I mean we all we don't have a claim of responsibility which is kind of unusual [noise]\nI I think it's a little bit larger scale than just a single individual [noise]\nWhile the difficulty with the conspiracy as you'd have a lot of pieces in that conspiracy that can then crack or fail\nUh that's that's a problem and um you know the minute you get involved with more than one person and you get two people were three people were for people\nIn exponentially increases the likelihood of failure it's terrorism cells are so dangerous my lone wolves are the most dangerous right because they they conduct stuff on their own the minute you start bringing additional pieces into the positive [noise] you you run the risk of\nOf people figuring it out and finding out I I don't know what I find interesting is that there is no claim of responsibility\nAnd I understand that this has been labeled a terrorist attack even though no bombs went off nobody's been injured thank God uh that and these these weapons have been interdict it and I know that bill de Blasio and Governor Cuomo of New York and federal authorities are declaring this a terrorist\nAttack I I see an attempted terrorist attack I see an attempted bombing I see that\nBut I don't know that this is a completed attack this doesn't look to me to be a completed attack and if it is an attack\nI don't see a claim of responsibility honesty a climber responsibly from white nationalist I don't see a claim and I'm just throwing that out there I don't see a claim of responsibility from ISIS or al ... or migrants or leftist violent organizations or any of that remember when James Hodgkinson went to the ball field\nAnd was trying to murder twenty five members of Congress including Steve ... including Jeff Flake including Rand Paul\nAs he was shooting at these politicians he was yelling out this is for health care and this is for health care of this is for healthcare\nYou had an attribution to the asked why he was motivated to want to kill Republican so we do know\nThat's the

there's hundreds of different decisions that need to be made in order to get the most benefits that you deserve back\nThere was a former New York state employee who murdered a fifty two year old UPS bus driver because this guy was so upset that Trump was president ... humor that UPS driver\nSang a he told the play is called a shot and killed Donald Trump purposely intentionally intentionally and very probably you know he was so off the hook that he murdered a random person thinking it was Donald Trump you know and the media like that you hear about that story was there and our coverage about that no stinking point too\nYeah let me let me ... let me go one more let me go one more because it's important because this was New York city today and this was the focus of a lot of of of what went on a in the news and you had bill de Blasio and you add Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York and the mayor of Newark respectively\nThey were together talking about this terrorist attack talking about the most strongly implying that Donald Trump's responsible for this all that sort of stuff\nThese very man who it is seven days away\nFrom the one year anniversary of the who's back who decided to go on the murder rampage in lower Manhattan with a rented truck running over about ... seven people\nI still don't know if Andy Cuomo\nAnd bill de Blasio acknowledge that it was the religion of peace involved in that case\nBecause they will slow walk anytime there's actual terrorism in the streets of New York they will slow walk responsibility they'll say well we don't know what the motive is he rented the Truckee ran these people over you may have been an emotionally disturbed person\nThe guy that had the wires and the bomb on his waistband when he went into the Port Authority subway station and attempted to detonate it to murder people about a year ago they oh no they never know what the causality is but in this case they know hey this is a terrorist attack even though no bombs going off\nAnd be they know what the motive and they tell you what it is it's President Trump's fall\nWhich isn't which isn't saying because I'm Sorry bill de Blasio is a psychopath\nAnd Andrew Cuomo is a cycle that I'm going to tell you something that Andrew Cuomo said today and if I'm lying on buying everybody a beers okay 'cause I'm Brett and I like beer\nOn buying everybody ... if I'm lying to you Andrew Cuomo and his press briefing today after the attack at CNN in his in his words Andrew Cuomo claimed New Yorkers have dealt with terrorism for quite some\nTime the first\nTerrorist attack in New York took place according to Andrew Cuomo in Nineteen Ninety three with the attempted bombing of the world Trade Center so New Yorkers have been dealing with terrorism for a long time twenty five years\nApparently informed that knuckle dragging more on the governor of New York that Puerto Rican separatist\nBombed France's tavern wounding Seventy five a winning forty people are including police officers in Nineteen Seventy five\nNobody apparently has told Andrew Cuomo about the number of terrorist attacks\nBegan in Nineteen fourteen up until the current day that have taken place in New York City Andrew Cuomo thinks the first terrorist attack ever in\nNew York city was was in Nineteen Ninety three\nThat's the guy running the state I mean you're talking about a mouse breathing knuckles drag or of the highest order okay and that's the guy who's supposed to be bringing people together\nNo no you're a member of the lucky chromosome club baby you and your brother that dope on CNN who yesterday we play the sound who who said if we deploy the military to the border the ... army will kill migrants 'cause we know that's what the military does they shoot innocent migrants\nThose are the geniuses run in the media outlet and the state\nOf New York and they are dead wrong they're dead raw historically they're wrong\nThey're an accurate there they're misrepresenting facts and crews that have gone on so if you can't believe them on the actual certify Abul history and I put it out on my Twitter feed you can read the ... list of the terrorist attacks that have gone on in New\nYork and and and you can look at France's tavern and you can look at the things that have happened in that city including the weather underground bill airs guys uh they they were trying to build bombs in Greenwich Village in an apartment building and blow it up\nIf dads none of that is terrorism well that I don't know what that is ... but today interdict did explosive package is going to a high profile political figures were the motivation still TVD we don't know what it is\nWe don't know what it is and I think we have to be honest and we acknowledge that fact um\nThat is a certain terrorist attack which I to me is\nBizarre it's bizarre\nA salmon Julian a line six so Sam welcome to the show what's on your much\nTheir head you know I think this was before ... and because of the favorites

problem with our city council a big problem with our city council here lately because\nThey don't do anything we elect these people to do stuff\nReally what's the city council they're supposed to pass laws or ... or not I perform but they're supposed to do things really ... in the simplest form you elect these folks to do things to to come up with solutions for maybe new innovations\nLike the following things I'm going to talk about short term rentals that's a new thing that you couldn't have thought about five years ago or whatever and you say okay we'll let you guys to come up with the solution\nIt's been three freaking years and they haven't come up with anything\nNothing anything the other day they vote to undo vote and so now they're back at square one and two it was what six months ago the mayor was going to have his plan didn't do anything then they were going to do this didn't do anything we're gonna grandfather mission beach in there didn't do anything\nNothing gets done which leads me to my next thing the\nScooters nothing's getting done on that didn't want to put into this they want to do it to the next the stadium and mission valley that thing's been talked about for Fifteen Years they put it on the ballot is that what do you guys do you guys just send it\nTo the voters which I don't have a problem with sometimes sending things to the voters but you guys are the leaders are used quotation marks you're the leaders you're supposed to get things done so we don't have to worry about\nI really can't point to one thing to San Diego city councils done in the last year I mean good or bad I'm not even ... they ... they did the federal foam bat and the other\nDay that they really got it because they got that one of the fares are taught Gloria leaving leaving an effort to protect California wild horses from slaughter there you go\nOkay so they're getting what Todd go it's not even our city council So Doug Gloria doesn't do anything for us\nThey passed a Styrofoam ban is literally the only thing I can think of these guys are supposed to do stuff to things and they just either send\nIt to the voters or do nothing\nIn the short term rentals now let me tell you about ... why it's so important I said this last night at the taco Tuesday town home\nRight now in the San Diego city council it's five to four Democrat Republican five four he can say okay that's part of the reason things can't get done it's five before and you have a Republican mayor\nSo not a whole lot can get done but ...\nDistrict is going to be the toughest to retain for Republican all the districts will stay the same course gates gonna win his soda remain conservative but to others are Democrats running against Democrat so they're actually there is no chance of even the conservative winning Laurie saps however\nThere has been so much money dumped in by the unions and the Democrats for Gen Campbell who she's running against\nI'm Talking hundreds of thousands of dollars here lately\nAnd that is an important seat because if the Democrats witness it goes six to three super majority in the city council here in in San Diego and then they can override any veto for mayor of falter so then it's game on and so when we complain\nAbout California's a state being so democratic and we can always come back and say well the San Diego though\nWell not so much for much longer and so that's in an incredibly important seat and I know it doesn't have all the glamour and it doesn't have all the glitz and the and the congressional seats but that's such an important seat\nThat Laurie is trying to just fight foreign just trying to remain on so uh I'll be very curious to hear that also were monitoring\nPresident Trump he's in Wisconsin we're going to hear from him shortly as well also talk about the package or in the bombs I Will say you know as we talked about we took some calls in a no Brett took some calls in the first hour there's not a lot of new information out there\nAnd so you can either make your conclusion and say hey I think this was done by a Trump supporter I don't think there's I think this was set up or I just think this was done by a crazy person whatever but at this point we're just speculating\nWe have a neutral literally no no new information so as we sit here I don't have a whole lot to say besides that you're now you're right [laughter] you know and it's one of these things where you don't want to sit here and say well it's definitely this is definitely that because\nWe don't know at this point and unfortunately I Know you want someone to come on the radio and give some hot take and say this is what it is but we're not Alex Jones\nYou know there there are theories but ah no hard facts at the moment\nI mean so much so that I saw that the the the ISIS flag could even be on one of the bombs\nSince I saw the picture that are trying to those looking at it upside down around you like zoom didn't really far on\nThat uh the only way I'm going to take a break Brent went about going to be back here shortly you're on AM seven sixty talking breaking news jumpstart about what's coming up well San Diego had its own case of suspicious packages downtown this morning what police found next\n[noise] am seven sixty ... am seven sixty news it's supported by the auto\nBusiness needs fast secure networks to be efficient and profitable detail can help you keeping your data secure your business safe and connect\nYou guys have okay to first and second call me the ... okay I didn't know if this was like a normal thing you guys have it [laughter] and others are the odds by here okay rural\nAnd confusion let's go to line number one Russian bought in San Diego a\nMiles out I go and now I have a I\nHave a little bit of a military background and I'm seeing on them you're out of pictures of the demise yeah specifically the one that was addressed to John Brennan CNN and I've seen some really good pictures I mean in some weird we blur out pictures of it and there is an ISIS flag on the device\nSo yeah I saw it on the picture is that even that obvious again I'm not some I mean\nThey they have their point they're showing that picture where the detonation device that scares kitchen time or whatever that is mhm for the most part seems to be the one they're focusing on but on the opposite side of the kitchen timers side there is a very prominent ISIS flags sticker or act that's been taped on\nI don't know and that's not getting as much attention that they can probably at the narrative\nAnd it from a device standpoint wind chill wires are going in opposite end now not in your guy but I've been around explosives more than enough to know that\nTrauma and just a common sense bomb construction standpoint a command detonated or promoting the device getting one wire to go to a blasting cap or next shouldn't advice and then somehow my fingers or need those players get other wire to go through the other hand when I should just run through\nThe same and maintain nice\nClothes solid device for maximum ethic going to see\nIt just the construction is just really poorly done so what are you giving the spellings only address yeah and the fact that ISIS has been known for their high IQ [laughter]\nThank kind and chilies says like maybe there's something there because they can't spell they can make a bomb that works and it\nStill seems absurd and I'm not even going conspiracy theory on this with false flag or I mean now you can't even at that it's not worth my time to ISIS flying is something we should have kind of been focused on yeah\nWhatever you know people want to get mad yeah\nAnd I appreciate the call that's the Russian bought who just called and if you you miss the beginning of that is the thing is is you're right a hundred percent right and I I Am surprised but I Would say that the ISIS flag doesn't fit the narrative for small right the narrative that they want a fit\nAnd we'll see if this gets manipulated in their own for just doesn't work we'll see this play out in the next few days\nIs they want it to be a white male Trump loving Yahoo that got fired up when Trump said the the media is the enemy is said and CNN's bad and he went out there and he took it upon himself\nI'm gonna throw something out there oh\nCould this be Russia\nWhile I think there's any so when when right there when he talked about I don't want to get into conspiracy theories and I hear ya I don't want to I don't want to just delve off into something crazy but in this day and age when there are so much lunacy going on and so much crazy and we're just a couple of ... less than a week from the Saudi Arabia thing ...\nWhy wouldn't a foreign country try and come in here and just manipulated and just try and screw things up plus as well as I was\nTalking with Britain earlier um you know we we were talking about this in in one of us are just as bad you know that maybe this could actually be Russia or they could be infiltrating the elections and you know just trying to cause havoc because begging for hacking thing you know the\nBig cause havoc if our country and you know hey man things are pretty divisive in that country Russia's going screwed some more things up\nRight plus they're probably like you know why we don't really need an active time let's go let's go do something to own your own all\nThe old old school Russian uh tactics you know a hundred\nPercent ... ... is any possibility so that's why I'm saying here if you have any theory\nAlmost ... years because to me in this day and age\nIt can be anything he says oh gosh I couldn't be this this is it'd be a conspiracy theory because we're sitting here two weeks ago Brett Kavanaugh was accused of rape from thirty seven years ago and almost didn't get on the Supreme Court because someone just made something up that to me we're going to the conspiracy category\nIn that day and age now clearly that got the time of day that people actually believe that some people actually said oh no maybe this guy actually did it but to me that falls into the same category of anything in this day and age they'll try and do anything to swing votes to swim in the house to swing the Senate\nLet's got to G and San Diego gee what do you make of this\n[noise] I mean my first reaction was it was a little convenient I mean you are feeling\nOkay turning things around here it there's no way I mean it just seen a sort of a wrong for for for some guy by while they're\nBeing a sort of throw it wrong for the first time job at the wrong thing\nObama I mean we don't get it off\nLike a ... yeah what I don't think you know the answer um\nYeah yeah I can hear it Obama [laughter] yeah what are you going to drop it you\nKnow I wouldn't be looking at all you hear it [noise] yeah\nWell yeah no and I appreciate the call G yeah I mean listen if you're going to kind of go into that direction of this and you can go in so many directions with with this event here today you know it wasn't but over a little more than a year ago that you could have had dozens of senators die when Steve ... was shot at the the softball practice\nAre the kind of targets those are actual people that are making day to day you know decisions that if all those people would have died could have you know ... things wouldn't have been up to par for a long long time that could have caused havoc\nFor many months two years to to who knows how long it does seem like these targets are just like throwing like\nLike it's made up you know like these people pick these targets per se\nBut who knows I don't know here's what I Do know breadwinner bulls back that's the best part\nGoing to take a break going to get your guy back you're
