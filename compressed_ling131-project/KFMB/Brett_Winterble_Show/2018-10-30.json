F. M. B. on Roger Hitchcock with Roger report San Diego union Tribune for whom I once worked\nHas become nothing but a far left mouthpiece of the most radical socialist ideas floating around the American political landscape one of those ideas is that Donald Trump is a racist\nProof of Adam and Steve Greene editorial cartoon came when the president declared that he was a nationalist as opposed to a globalized\nTrump's at a global is to someone who puts the interests of the entire world the head of the interests of our country he stood by contrast I'm a nationalist that is I put the interests of the United states ahead of everybody else because after all he is the president of United States\nThe left saw all of that as simply a dog whistle validation of Trump's racist approach because of course nationalism means white nationalism no it doesn't nationalism in Trump's meaning means American nationalism putting this country first\nGetting grip really get a grip oh my gosh it's insane\n\nShepard Smith people request Shepard Smith from me all the time and when I when I have some Shepard Smith I like to give you some Shepard Smith like the shepherd I show a little bit oh you got Matty today he got well he went a little off the rails even going off the rails for about seven years here is a slap Smith\nAre over there on the uh what is it called the shepherd report the ... report what does that thing called the Fox news deck of a recall check out his or her check out his news ... news that\nIs what you call that chefs news that uh he comes in here and says the president cannot do an executive order on birthright citizenship\nAnd he he's really taken a swing at the idea of a changing birthright citizenship cut thirty one\nPresident Trump says he plans to sign an executive order to end the rights of citizenship for children born in the United states whose parents are not citizens and are not under and are undocumented immigrants of course he can't do that the reason the constitution\nWill get into that in a moment first here's what the president said Axios for an HBO documentary series out this weekend\nIt was always told me that you needed a constitutional a member guessing lime and you don't need a number one number one you don't need that nobody can sing to you yeah they're very much and well and you can definitely do it with an act of Congress now they're saying I can do just was an executive order\nHow ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to kill us it's ridiculous and it has to end\nNot the only country in the world there are thirty of them including candidate next door further constitutional scholars say in the event the president actually prize this move there would be an immediate injunction and his order would not ever take effect\nOkay so what would you have to do what would you have to do to fix this problem if you wanted to do it by the book jacket of orders not going to get it done 'em and and I love you see Jonathan Swan that's the guy interviewing\nPresident Trump he is such a basic guy\nComes over from Australia he gets himself a career covering Washington DC politics and that sort of that's not a slap in Australia just giving you because it's sort of his bio sort of his background\nComes over you start to cover in American politics you know he's got a heck of a career he builds for himself he sits down with the President Jonathan swan is very interesting character because I watch all the channels all day long\nAll right I watch I watch\nTelevision news I watch MSNBC I watch Fox so I'm watching all the channels all day long and Jonathan Swan will go on different channels he won't be on MSNBC six times a week\nSome days twice twice in one day he will be on on MSNBC six times a week and he will throw invective and and he'll he'll roll his eyes and how silly President Trump is an act like\nYou know he's just a totally Mad Men and we didn't yeah he's just won\nSo he'll he'll do all that and then what will happen is he'll go on Fox I talked to shine and Bream or Bret Baer somebody who comes off as you know that that's over there they're reasonable news middle of the road people they're not these editorial thrilled types like Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham Hannity\nSo we'll just put him on was Shannon Bream and we'll put on with Brett Baron look really reasonable and will do is go on Fox they'll be like\nYes yes indeed the president's doing that yes mhm and that's yes that is you know he's the president\nAnd it'll go back in the city and they'll go on drop dead White House or deadline White House whatever that shows called with Nicole I Want to strangle a U.S our Sanders Wallace because remember she didn't say she wanted to strangle Sarah Sanders I'm sure he'll go on there and I'll talk about Trump's crazy\nSo it was what he does so this dummy not the President Jonathan swan play this clip oh you can't play that part because we don't have that as a stand alone he says\nYou're going to try to do an executive order and President Trump says you have to have tried to an executive order yes an executive order and it sounds like he's affirming what the president is saying but here he comes in all we usually on the back end of it saying no no you can't do that\nHe's right I mean you cannot fix this birthright citizenship fourteenth amendment thing with an executive order it's inefficient it's not going to work but the good news is you have thirty one legislature's controlled by Republicans\nThat sixty two percent sixty two percent\nA rite of of of the United states uh legislatures are controlled by Republicans right so what you're going to have to do is you have to amend the fourteenth amendment it's going to be a big ugly Harry nasty fight a big one but it could be the sort of thing that could be far\nAround the twenty twenty election you could say I want to change the fourteenth amendment so that people who immigrate into the United states illegally without authorization are not allowed to benefit from the fruits of their labor\nLiterally and figuratively and that's what we're talking about it's going to take a lot of work you can't short cut this and the same way that Obama could not do DACA through an executive order\nI mean he did but you're not supposed to be there is a legislative process there's an amendment to the constitution process all that stuff\nIs is how that's supposed to work in a functioning democracy okay so here's Jonathan Swan and he's interacting with the president and the president thinks he's affirming what he's saying which out of this one is doing that thing that some people do\nNot real ... and they repeat what's being said to them so that they can then comprehend what's just been said to them so here to go\nIt was always told me that you needed a constitutional a member of on the other one you don't need that number to nothing to worry about it and it was an act of Congress\nEven did you see what you don't you don't so now the president things you've affirmed what he just said and\nAnd now you're like one of the dispute you don't even know if it's in\nDispute or not Jonathan you're just going along for the right because you're trying to get your stupid HBO show looked at by leaking out this clip\nBy if you wanted to reform the birthright citizenship thing this is a sort of thing you could set up for a fight in twenty twenty it's a sort of thing you could send into the states it's a sort of thing you can send in the Congress the house and the Senate\nThere's no short cut here I mean there's not a the fact of the matter is\nI mean I guess you could try to do something legislatively under the immigration naturalization act maybe try that but if it's going to run and if it's going to run into conflict with the fourteenth amendment and you just put yourself a couple of original list there on the Supreme Court and cabinet and Gorsuch it's going to that's that's a hard slog\nBut yeah I don't think you ... you you cannot just by executive order I mean you can't it's going to get blown up in the courts they wouldn't\nBut yeah I don't think you ... you you cannot just by executive order I mean you can't it's going to get blown up in the courts they wouldn't let him pause a migration from the terrorists seven states\nFor Ninety Days you guys you remember I mean do you remember that I

Howard turntable and being on an all free on record as saying this does not apply to foreigners and it does not apply to Indians\nAnd uh that's what el ... be Wilkins was all about an el was decided it was ... ... is not a citizen even though he was born in America because\nHe was part of a try what you think foreign nation matter where he was ...\nAnd uh then you have won cam aren't that everybody tries to use that oh well well why can't they weren't citizens and he was a fish well that was because at the time said or a Chinese immigrants could not become citizens right\nAnd he was ... but ... but his parents had done everything legal aid to become Americans they weren't you know they were here permanently there were here legally and they were part of the system but they couldn't be a citizen so that was changed for ... for ... ... now a thing as\nCongress because it's because this is a definition question on and on the constitution Congress has no jurisdiction\nAs where did it sounds prompts executive order is the only way to get started and yet his executive order even going to fix it and it's going to have to go to court and it's going to have to end the Supreme Court and because of the story to sizes\nAre the court is going to have to go back and say yeah this was the original definition of\nWhat subject to the U.S jurisdiction means which means allegiance to America and no other country and it's going to be river and instead of going back to what originally was I don't have an anchor baby until Nineteen eighty\nSeven I so I disagree so I disagree that Congress has no role here because Congress can a main ...\nThe fourteenth amendment they get amend the constitution they can they can put on a whole new amendment and they can put a standalone amendment that deals with the concerns of of citizenship for for foreign born people and they can do anything they want and that has done legislatively and through the states I mean this this is how I Know\nBut then it will take the state's ten years\nI don't care like I don't care white okay so because it's going to take a while we don't want to do the job well that's ...\nWell it it it nobody knew what jurisdiction man that would that would be the way to go but we already have it\nAnd I get it I I understand it but if you want to fix the problem once and for all we're going to fix the problem or not we're not going to spray or we're not going to we're not going to put flex seal on the constitution where they're going to fix it or we're not going to fix it and that's what's gonna happen\nOkay and this has got to be done in a way so that when president Hillary Clinton takes office or president Campbell Eris takes office or president you know a a by John Kerry takes office or ... of Cortez or any anybody who is running out they're Chelsea Clinton\nYou you're going to have to have something that's ironclad that they can't go in and just change\nAnd what you're gonna have to do is deal with this thing by amendment that's my opinion I'm I'm I'm late Brentwood herbal showed him seven sixty talk of recognition that with the latest\n[noise] there's been an arrest\nAnd the murder of a woman and side effects shop on midway district will have the details next\nAm seven sixty KF MB are you hiring was indeed you can post a job in minutes set up screener\nBusiness needs fast secure networks to be efficient and profitable detail can help you keeping your data secure your business safe and connect\nWe've been helping San Diego businesses since Nineteen eighty three digital can provide experts solutions for networks voiceover IP wireless and video security we can help you make the right choices for your business\nCalled detail it eight five eight five seven one thirty one hundred\nWhether you're networking four or four hundred systems we have the solutions the answers and knowledge to make it happen we have expert IT consult instead of experience in helping local business schools state and government with experts solutions such as voiceover I. P. systems from Cisco why and secure professional video surveillance solutions using top quality components\nYou know ... these are not our values the values of the modern Democratic Party or not their values\nOf Catholics yeah you know and I'm not Catholic myself personally but but most of the Puerto Ricans are short you know the the the the pro choice and all that you know the the spinning on you know traditional um you know institutions the way the ... the left has that's not who we are ...\nAnd democratic politics is what put Puerto Rico and the ... were saying before Iraq Lee yeah the corruption all of that that was that's all because the pilot\nExactly I mean look they can look at their own personal cases why they had to leave the island where there were perfectly happy why a lot of their relatives have died I mean I brought up the story before and I told the story of my my father which is obviously very personal to me\nThe Puerto Ricans were failed by liberal politics so if they're going to come here and basically destroy Florida the way the part they allowed Puerto Rico to be destroyed by continually electing these people\nI mean that's not good for America same thing is happening in California you have a mass exodus of people leaving California changing voter demographics in several states one of them being Texas because a lot of people were going for sure the Austin area they're going to Colorado to go into a couple of different places in particular I happen to think that that's the reason why\nAnd I don't necessarily believe the polls but that's probably the reason why they do is polling as good as he is against groups\nFor without a doubt you've gotten a lot of people who take their California ideals and environmentalism and values and they went they went um uh east to the state of Texas by this see this is the thing that I'm concerned about what Florida also is\nThat you got that Senate race and you've got the governor's race and to add insult to injury you have a hurricane Michael hitting the panhandle which is a deeply red zone a lot of folks who otherwise it'd be voting displaced the they're not gonna be able to vote their houses don't exist anymore they're not they're not living anywhere\nAnd I think that's a it's a double whammy in that state I think the president's gonna have to go into overdrive to try to sell it and Florida well\nI mean he's got to have to go back into twenty sixteen mode where he's heading up you know ... in one night and coal combing the states\nBut I mean it is possible I mean you know I think that a lot of people are going to see through you know the fact that the what the Democrats obviously the Kavanaugh saying it's going to play ...\nUm I think that the fact that the economy is doing better um I I think that that's that's something that's not in dispute I mean America is much much better place than it is but a lot of people are seeing Florida as a bellwether which is kind of not necessarily accurate based on the way the demographics have I've kind of shifted their\nIn particular I think they you know some of the other interesting races obviously the Senate race\nIn Arizona ... a lot of people seem to think that that may may be able to tell what's going to be happening with the rest of the country but at the end of the day\nI think voters have to ask themselves or you wouldn't have better position\nFinancially right and you were ... you know are they you know the rallying cry of the last presidential election as far as enforcing immigration laws that the big spotlight is being shined on that because it just is Jewish and with the caravan are we going to go ahead and allow all these people into our country if I Lived in this state\nI Would be livid with Jerry Brown and the ideas or even allowing more people given the conditions that the state is currently in right now I Would vote you know not necessarily for Trump or his policies but there's a situation where liberals have to say we have to vote against our leadership here at this point 'cause they're putting us in a precarious situation\nIt's a tough situation and say look there's been a war on the middle class has been waged in this thing\nFor for a couple of decades and you know you're starting to see the real impact of that as Victor Davis Hanson likes to say you've got all the guards on the coast and you got peasants inland and and that that increasingly shrinking middle class is is facing the pressure and and what that does affect negatively is obviously\nYou schoolteacher schools you got declining enrollment people that are not going to raise families here it's too expensive\nFor dollars for gasoline and I hope you brought your Nichols times of any Jersey because you're gonna have you're paying four dollars a gasoline man and when you find one that's like three eighty five you go ooh this is a bargain magnet and cheap gas today it's insane it's insane I'm against this backdrop that we can go back to Florida for a second\nWe got the case is Cesar ... rock we got this maniac in Pittsburgh and a half from over the weekend these these things complicate\nI think the momentum that that the president had and many of the down ballot races had in the Senate because this allows the Democrats to get back on on their messaging which is a Trump is exclusionary the Republicans were exclusionary we're not a welcoming party that sort of stuff how do you counter message that\nWas just basic facts and truth I mean the fact of the matter is in last April Trump dominated the first\nBlack I'm female brigadier general in the United States Marine corps I mean that's something that brought Obama failed to do\nYou know you look at ah just recently um ... Dr Martin Luther king's birthplace being declared a national landmark and that's something to Iraq Obama\nFailed to do I know you look at the fact that they didn't want to say that he's a white nationalist than that you know he's anti Semitic or anti Jew I mean his son in law for God's sakes is Jewish daughter his daughter I mean this is this has become a ridiculous you know a pushing of these the false narrative that the mainstream media is is\nThis is Jewish his daughter his daughter I mean this is this has become a ridiculous you know up pushing of these these false narrative that\nThe mainstream media is is more than happy to be complicit in pushing out to the masses but is it true you have to ask yourself at the end of the day do you want to go ahead and believe the truth or you want to believe the hype and that you know I mean between that the economic result yeah I mean there's a lot of great things\nThat you could say for Donald Trump is forest inclusion everything's young you know people were obviously point to this birthright citizenship rights and try to hit him on that but the truth of the matter is\nIf you're allowed a legal resident\nBirthright citizenship should that apply to your children if you're just came into the country illegally and you just you know nine months pregnant and you're dropped a kid yeah on American soil that I should not make that solve the citizens\nAre ... and especially at a time when so many citizens natural born and a and a naturalized are suffering because of of of challenges we're facing in the country are trying to undo eight years old out of our stay here or ... joining us he's the editorial director at reactionary times has contributed Newsmax\nThe real conservative or you can follow him on Twitter We're good friends on Twitter and Facebook and I always love having them on what you're talking about birthright citizenship straight at Brentwood herbal show I have seven sixty talking breaking news these gyms are met with the headlines with object\nWell Pittsburgh Jewish community began bearing it's dead today holding funerals for a ... family doctor and two fifty something brothers President Trump meanwhile arrived at the tree of life synagogue to pay his respects and encountered shouting protesters were signed such as words matter [noise]\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan says President Trump cannot and birthright citizenship on his own the top Republican says he certainly cannot do it with an executive order Ryan's comments come after Trump said he wants to end birthright citizenship for babies born to non citizens and migrants not authorized to be in the U.S\nA prison union official says the death of a notorious Boston gangster James Whitey Bolger is being investigated as a homicide officials were the Federal Bureau of prisons says Bolger was found dead this morning in his Bruce ...
