way you're respecting the the bill of rights\nAnd you're respecting the limited powers of the federal government which I Know you're not because you have to pass the bill to find out what's in the\nBill the upshot to a potential takeover by the Democrats have ALS representatives is the President Trump will humble her into a fine dust I mean he will just he will just be on the Twitter twenty four seven she won't be able to keep up with her with her crazy\nPolicies and the policies of the folks that are that are going to be riding shotgun with her including a such a such a hit makers as Adam Schiff Eric Swalwell a logic Cummings and\nMaxine Waters [noise] winter winters one at all there is a concern out there ABC News expressing this earlier today that there are limits\nBy which the uh about law enforcement officers are able to stop these mass shooters these people like Robert Bauer is in Pittsburgh and these are these these folks like got a Cesar ... that well they don't they don't have any way to they don't have any way to to to to stop them\nAnd they don't want to violate any civil liberties they don't want to do any of that kind of stuff that\nThey're hamstrung they're not able so they are the logical argument then becomes we have to grab everybody has guns because the cops are not able to deal with these lunatics who post crazy things on line\n... nothing could be further from the truth nothing could be further from the truth let me tell you something here if you stood on the corner\nAnd you started yelling out this thing's Robert Bauer is posted online or you stood on the corner and you were yelling out the the\nPretty yelling out this thing's Robert powers posted online or you stood on the corner and you were yelling out the things Caesar say Iraq\nWas posting on on Twitter and on his different social media platforms if you were\nYelling out kill kill all the Jews are ... kill all these people who are in the ... the Obama administration oh we've got to take him out we got to get killed and media kill Hillary\nGo all the stuff that he that he I don't understand if you sit around a quarter and yelled those things out one thing is for certain\nYou would very likely be visited by a cop who would ask you what's going on\nNow he's not going to arrest you he's not going to take you into custody but he might just walk up and be like so you're yelling out kill all the Jews like well what's going on what's the what's happening here on the street corner where your alarming people by yelling to all the Jews or kill Hillary Clinton or or killed Jim Acosta or kill CNN or whatever it is\n... what's what's going on here of anticipating okay and then we can help you with\nNow that's not a violation of civil liberties I set a violation of the first amendment you're not restraining the speech you're merely walking by going ... is everything cool are you okay and they didn't help us\nOut what's going on here for whatever reason law enforcement in a post black lives matter world in a post ACLU controlling the streets of Chicago and and the policing on the streets of Chicago a sort of world policing has become very defensive\nAnd I think cops feel like well we don't want to do anything to restrain speech because we don't want to get sued by the ACLU\nThey're our intelligence components of police departments around the country\nSome of them are just a cop that goes out on social media kind of checks things out some of them are a couple of detectives network that\nSome of them are big city police department I'm certain in the San Diego pd I'm certain in the San Diego sheriff's department there are people who keep an eye out for online threats of various sorts\nOr just because it's a part of a sort of patrolling I'm sure that's the case in New York City I'm sure that's the case in LA I'm sure that's a case in a lot of of a big time cities\nPittsburgh a big time city South Florida\nMiami that metro's a big time city the police are within their rights as far as I'm concerned to go out and just kind of walk to beat and social media and see what's being posted out there see what's being set out there\nIf you're pointing it out on Twitter if you're pointing out on Facebook and you're putting it out I gather there's no expectation of privacy sound like you're writing it in the journal and it's it's it's next to your bed in the night stand\nThen there's an expectation of privacy but the minute you go out on social media platforms in the same way that if you go out and stand on a sidewalk and yell out I'm going to go kill George Soros having to go kill the Jews I'm gonna go kill these people\nAnd people are entitled to come up and say what's going on or are you I mean what are you planning on doing\nSo I don't think law enforcement should be so defensive with this stuff I don't think they should hide from it and I'll tell you something if you really want to have an interesting kind of an approach\nTo a deterrent going and find a guy like this Robert Bowers that's posting a you I'm sure somebody on the Facebook account of the police department is more than capable of reaching out to them on Facebook on gab on Twitter\nAnd say Hi I'm sergeants Smith from the LAPD or the Pittsburgh TD\nEverything okay we just thought this post is kind of interesting that might actually have a deterrent effect ... whatever we'll show him seven sixty talking breaking news jumped Chavez with that\nWell there's a new report out on the amount of wildlife that has\nGone

of last year so and mentors are starting to go up and while homes are still selling fast in September of they were like averaging thirty one days in the market I think that some of the lowest like twenty eight or I think twenty six days\nSo I think you are seeing a slow down you're seeing more inventories you're seeing less of an appreciation you're seeing a\nUm you know generally are slowed down a but nothing catastrophic one thing you are noticing here is that you've got the big time cyclical nature of the market going siding with the seasonal factor which this is the time of the year with a slowdown anyway\nSo um the fact of the matter is prices they may they may come down a little bit but with the possibility of rates going up that that's the imperative for people to if you're looking to get into the market now will be the time to start getting into those ducks in a row get your paperwork are lined up because the reality is those rates they look like they will be turning up there on\nThere's always a silver lining when something like this happens it's silver linings homebuyers had been frustrated that they have nothing to choose from they can't find the home of their dreams in the neighborhoods that they want right\nAnd here with a live a slowdown I'm not saying it's a ... market yet sure but I Would say we're still taking a little bit away from a seller's market to more of a buyer's market in defending under certain neighborhood it could be a buyer's market it all depends whether you have a few homes\nIn the market in that neighborhood and all of a sudden the buyer can negotiate and you know put contingencies and and ride take their time deciding but as you said you're really if you have to have things lined up and getting pre approved not just pre qualified\nIs the way to go and that way you can make the best offer and get the best deal and close the deal\nFor sure uh one of the things that I've I continue to be very excited about watching the way things have loosened up a little bit um is is the banks statement loans because for for a long time a whole segment of people were kind of locked out of this market\nAt the bank said alone is a very nice alternative for people uh when it comes to to to putting in your application because you don't have to have the tax returns or transcripts right\nYeah San Diego truly California Southern California especially San Diego's a very entrepreneurial area a lot of risk takers lot of people are self employed whether they own their own business on ten Ninety nine commission business and the reality is\nIf folks like that and I've been self employed all my life ... you know the tax returns don't always line up they don't always show that your adjusted gross income after your expenses and doctors is high enough to qualify for alone but if you can show bank statements that show a steady\n... high enough average deposit yup then that can be used as your income minus a reasonable amount for your\nExpenses sure all of a sudden you qualify for refinancing or purchase of a property I think that's a very very big deal and I'm Glad that we finally have that to offer\nFor sure now at the other end of the spectrum from moving away from somebody who's purchasing are doing the ...\nAh for folks that are of the just the right age are getting right there against that age um the reverse

not have anything going into where yeah lower the amount of ... loan you can get because they did enough damage last year and you know they didn't raise the mortgage insurance premium either\nWhich is really good what they did put in something which I don't know who's going to affect too many people\nAnd that's the fact that they appraisals on these F ha loans are going to be going through a system work quickly reviews it and says whether a second appraisal of necessary or not to mitigate the list or you know risk to the program into taxpayers'\nSo the good news is only twenty percent uh our kickback or maybe flag is the right word to where you need a second appraisal and that's not too bad and so far since the beginning of October if I had about thirty days or a you know samples to review\nA twenty percent that\nHave been flagged when the second appraisal came in one third of the second appraisals came in higher wow than the original appraisal which is very good yeah\nOne third of the second appraisal of came out about the same level mhm and one third came lower but not by much sure so that thirty days sample through the federal housing advocates\nOf all ... and one third came lower\nBut not by much sure so that thirty days sample through the federal Housing Administration is very promising at this particular changed F ha loans\nA forward regular loans as well as
