this about the Saudi thing very quickly uh it bothers me greatly\nI Do not like the way the U.S government sucks up to the Saudis 'cause I Do feel like the the Saudis really are the heart of darkness there in the middle east are at the Iranian regime is horrible\nThey are murderers they are people who torture their own people and it's just it's a horrible situation\nBut because the Saudis are on the other side of it and because you know it's convenient to work with them and it is we should never forget Fifteen of Nineteen hijackers on eleven or Saudis okay and that was well hottest ideology that drove that stuff\nAnd they have never been forced to pay a price for that they have never been forced to pay a price they continue to fund ISIS they continue to fund the support al ... of the golden chain is still in full effect of funding terrorist organizations and they've never been held to account\nThey have it but my hope is at some point maybe there's a way we can uh wrangle or maneuver or or do whatever we gotta do\nTo change it up to change it up\nYou know and and to eventually bring freedom and liberty to that country I don't know under what circumstances that would happen but I also know that it was a hard thing to envision in the Nineteen fifties the Nineteen sixties for liberation and freedom to come to Russia without the Soviet Union you know and you had to keep working for that\nAnd it's an absolute monarchy and you don't have rights and you don't have\nUm you know you you don't\nThe stars that the president we do have is a president that has been committed to developing our own sources of energy where were the biggest exporter of oil on the planet now and we don't have to only rely on the Saudis you know we ought to be taking a lucky stars that were not more dependent on the Saudis\nOr on petrol states there in the middle east and we are exploring our own energy and and and make no mistake it is people like Al Gore hideous people like

investment returns you would like at will see Asset Management we use a proven strategy for investing that delivers that returns and lower risk\nAnd everything has been so strong the bond yields shot up recently\nUh and that is one we saw that a major sell off last week in the market so what we see for housing is okay housing has been hard for a long long time very strong economy and it's cooling off based on a lot of different data\nThat we see a I mean some of the data we see is backwards looking okay you're looking median home price of San Diego\nHit an all time high of five hundred and eighty three thousand dollars in August up nine percent from August of last year according to court logic\nBut since then you know things are starting to slow down from what we're seeing we don't anticipate the same kind of appreciation inventory is one big reason the inventory of single family detached homes in San Diego county in September\nUm was Twenty one point three percent compared to September of last year it that's a big job and you're not been talking for months and years and before you is Roger and and these image Tories have been going down down down down every month every year\nSo now you're seeing him and Tori is going up the average number of days\nAnd the market okay it's still very low it says thirty one days for September ...\nTo the association of San Diego says he Asia realtors oh but you know it was a little bit lower lower it was it was thirty days you know ah when you compare it to last year so everything is showing that we're most likely going to have a slower\nPace of appreciation more homes in the market perhaps more price cuts especially in areas where there are a lot of for sale signs up if you don't have that many for\nYou don't have that many for sale signs up you're not going to see too many issues because it's all about supply and demand in your particular neighborhood\nRight and it's a it's all about is all about the area that you're looking in there for sure for sure what are we what are we seeing in terms of the current rates the thirty the Fifteen five stuff like that and they were\nAmazingly low but about one percent higher than a year ago so we've got\nA conforming no point thirty or fish mortgage rates averaging are on foreign three quarters Fifteen year around four and a quarter a let's talk about this one five year around four and a quarter\nThink about this careful if somebody wants to buy homes as and on on these prices and now the rates up so much recently or get smart and get a half percent lower rate foreigner quarter which takes you back\nMany many months ago when rates were lower\nI guess what you will have an opportunity to refinance into a lower surgery or face when the economy eventually slows down and when we have it in a recession some people say it's two years away some people say it's a year away who knows but I Will guarantee you regardless of what President we have\nHow pro businesses policies are we will\nAlways always have recessions\nAn economic slowdown for friday reasons when that happens you're going to see lower mortgage rates so if you get a five year fix seven year fixed three year fixed five so seems to be sweet spot\nWithin a five year period chances are very very high you can go and refinance into a thirty or fix at a lower rate\nInteresting that's uh that's that's a good way to play it in terms of strategy\nI financed or purchase that's a good strategy\nOut after for sure uh in terms of some of these and the loan programs that people may not be aware of and and then when they get to the reverse with you I'm a ... some of the non qualifying where he just you you have these easy qualifier loan options that are now out there that we we haven't really seen in a very long time I mean it was in lockdown for a long time Iran\nYeah we've got so many people so sweet thanking us going out of their way to say I can't believe it for almost ten years I couldn't do any loans I've been in business for a long time and all you need to do is be in business for two years\nAnd show bank statements that show your cash flow and if you're\nGood enough average deposit you don't need to show tax returns or pay stubs or W. twos and all of that and you qualify to purchase a home or refinance and if you want to buy a rental property as long as the rental income covers your mortgage payment in some cases even if it's twenty five percent short\nYou know you can still qualify for that he's got a somewhat cash flow a show\nThese new products ... really really really make a big big difference and availability of financing for homebuyers as well as those who want to refinance\nAnd the reverse mortgage is something that's that's that's pretty amazing as well especially when you've got some of these recent improvements that they may not be aware of mayor on on these ... these reverse mortgages I mean you're talking about great new upper limit sin options when it comes to F. ha and and and the mortgage insurance tell us about that\nWell you know usually most of us do and say oh jeez I'm not so happy that I'm not old there\n[laughter] uh well I Do I have to be so young right well this is one of those cases where you can really want to be a little bit older right I'm liberal or you buddy you know a little bit more older than me but as long as you or your spouse or sixty two\nThat's when you can take advantage of it because I refinance and almost everyone has refinanced at some point if you get a lower rate a lower mortgage payment for cash out\nOne reason or another but the ultimate refinance is the one where you're refinance and the lender says you can pay two dollars a month you can pay a thousand a month you pay five hundred a month or you can pay nothing for months wow yeah\nAnd that's why they call the ultimate refinance with a reverse mortgage and if you have a free and clear home better yet\nNow you're fine as not refinance you going to finance but\nYou don't have to use the money you can have two hundred three hundred four hundred thousand dollars available on the line of credit or if you got a jumbo situation multimillion dollar home now we got multimillion dollar reverse mortgages which we didn't have not too long ago so the one fantastic thing well many fantastic things about\nThe Trump the economy is that the lack of regulation I made today you know the river and cutting right you know I\nUh you know not lack of regulation by the huge reduction in regulations has been the greatest boost to the economy\nMore so than the tax cuts and one of the result is all these loan products\nLenders were afraid and President Trump said it perfectly what an awful thing Richard Cordray did was she a freebie and he says he kind of enjoy putting businesses out of business\nI wouldn't be surprised if he enjoyed putting businesses out of business people were looking over their shoulder well if I Do this law and if I Do that long they're going to put me out of business now lenders are taking a little bit more measured dressed not crazy but measured risk and as a result we have\nBetter financing options available\nHuge huge change in the sea change and I want folks to take advantage of this and that's why I Want to encourage everybody in the Senate my voice whether it's for a purchase or re fi and especially for the reverse mortgage I Want to encourage folks\nTo give you a call may arrive at eight seven seven seven sixty eleven thirty eight seven seven seven sixty eleven thirty\nOr
