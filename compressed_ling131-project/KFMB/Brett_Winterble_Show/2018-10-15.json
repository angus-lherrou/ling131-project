Thomas driving I I Know they have some works in that but I Know General Motors has some great things going I Know that has some stiff competition that's all I Want to make sure they're keeping up with that because I Do personally believe that as the future for these\nOh yeah I'm sure the original Clinton manufacturers here\nAnd when they look at too as a A R and D how much input into that because I Would assume there are a day will be going into have got to catch up without the Thomas driving and so forth but I mean I I like the company I'm you're also facing the head of a rising interest rates here\nBut um I I like when I see in the company I I think it could be another long term hold but you also quite that what it was a six point eight percent David and while you're waiting so yeah I can be worthwhile looking into\nExactly and the other concern here Greg is that we're peak auto sales um but you know I I Do believe why we hit the peak I don't think we're going to have a drastic fall off here so yeah I I think these companies seem to make good money over the next several years\nYep so I'm All right how bad guys are great to have a good one to Iraq are right that close\nThe next several years yeah so I'm All right ... thanks guys for it at our Greg have a good one to Iraq\nAre right that close out all the phone lines where the second half of the show you went to Columbia first up one eight hundred seven six zero\nK.

fading in and out um but I think what you said you as you bought a Amazon sold about half of two thousand dollars now thinking about buying back into it is that is that correct they\nGot their own\nYeah yeah well yeah we can have just bringing up a little bit there so I\n... and congratulations on the the moving Amazon ... he did well in that I mean as it were not big fans of Amazon because very prices are going to go to the numbers here for you again it can be as Amazon singles eight and the end of\nThe racial and here's why we get concerned the hundred and fifty six versus forty eight for the industry prices sales for versus at one point eight price to book value forty versus twenty points seven\nAnd price a casual forty four versus twenty three so all the valuation racial very high and they had been a good job growing their sales and earning sales rep thirty eight point six percent about W initiates Seventeen\nEarnings per share up a hundred and Seventy seven percent versus forty six for the industry or the balance sheets not as good as it used to be I'm surprised on this but they have a current racial one point one versus at one point to that's okay but debt equities now\nAnd the industry or the balance sheets not as good as it used to be I'm surprised on this but they have a current racial one point one person one point to that's okay but debt equities now a hundred and thirty one percent\nVersus Ninety percent for the industry so the debt has risen quite a bit over the past couple of years here\nA return on equity is Eighteen point nine not as good as the industry at twenty five point for net profit margin is only two point six versus three point seven receive all turn over his twenty point to another surprise here\nAnd she's thirty one and then ... nine point seven versus six point five guys mother comments well let's find out first earnings from chaser yeah of\nCourse I I Know we did lose ... other stuff going through these numbers here she still listening yes that's the price is one thousand seven hundred and eighty dollars and sixty one sense particularly type two thousand\nFifty dollars and fifty cents fifty two week low nine hundred and sixty two hundred and fifty cents or something very very well this year course we'll get to the Seventy thousand Nineteen though estimated only for ...\nTwenty four dollars and Ninety seven cents for use of sixteen point by multiple that we need target cell parts of four hundred and twelve dollars and one cent so again well below that current price and this company has the the exact example of a growth company I mean no value to it\nAnd now when I was a ... some value to it but I Know yeah yeah some value to it but not a value ... phrased it and when I was at a investment conference there's a a manager there fund manager talking like no it's not personal shift price me I'd love Amazon I I use them quite frequently for for products and so forth but\nYou know software so I'll just price the price is way too expensive for this company\n... and ... points are going to bring up too is that it's not just the retail side what should they done a phenomenal job but actually competitions coming out I mean we got other retailers that are starting to compete with them we\nSee a Amazon's trying to open stores like whole foods started about other things but also to their aid W s which is there a positive and a which actually has been the big earning earnings driver for them not the retail side and I think people buy for the retail side not realizing they got all the money from the cloud business\nBut one thing we've talked about is that they have some retailers that have the club and some Amazon which I think they're saying hey let's switch over to you know a Cisco or somebody else that has a cloud business because we don't I give our competitors money so I I Believe they have topped out\nUm I think the momentum could be over for them or something we would never buy de because the fact she just way too high not saying it's a bad company ... stock it's just a growth stocked as well well above a comfort level for me\nExactly and I mean I did look after September two thousand twenty two that's as far as the numbers go on there is an estimated orange the sheriff's anyone dollars and forty eight cents I don't see how they get there to be quite Frank with you I mean that has some serious earnings growth and as a company as you grow it gets harder and grow those earnings when you are larger and larger\nBut even at seven dollars and forty eight cents for earnings roots August already so price of one thousand one hundred Seventy nine so you're looking\nAbout for four years out I mean that's even more difficult to forecast that you know when a reference specimens ... he's a father die investment I call them and I was reading this book and he said\nYou know these these people they justify the future earnings and I say you know at some point this company to be very very profitable mhm but the farther out you go the harder it is to forecast you can't forecast and come and competition you can't forecast competitors perhaps it aren't even out there yet right right\nSo ... and that's what we don't like what we like to have something to hold onto an Amazon could go to twenty five hundred a that's a possibility but the thing I've seen over the years of doing this that you get these high flyers a bit hot for your for maybe three four five six years\nAnd all of a sudden something else happens and and I wonder how they go back to trading
