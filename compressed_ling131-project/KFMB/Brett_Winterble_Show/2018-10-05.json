a holding pattern right now and this kind of an odd thing and I want to speak to a couple fundamental issues\nThat we are uh that we are confronted with will will will pick up the five at five or tomorrow or with Roger get his thoughts on on all this big stuff that's happened all week long but I think it's time for a very Frank and important discussion about who we want to be as a people and what we want to be as a country here's what I mean by that\nRemember what happened during the LA Riots and I remember being absolutely horrified seeing\nReginald Denny hold from his truck\nBecause it was in the wrong neighborhood and being assaulted\nAnd beaten nearly to death on the streets of Los Angeles and I remember watching football Williams and his friends smashing a cinder block onto this man's head and I remember at the time feeling so profoundly sad for my country\nFeeling terror and shock and shame for that or a man who had been ripped from his truck and beaten savagely in the streets of an American city\nAnd that image stuck with me it's stuck with me for a very long time and and I realized\nIt is an incredibly thin line between [noise]\nForget civility and incivility because that speaks to politeness\nI'm Talking about civilized and uncivilized behavior in is\nWe do not take to the streets with guns and bombs and swords when a lecture in stone go our way at least the overwhelming majority of us do not\nThere are lunatics and savages and more riders and walking talking demons who do take to the streets and engage in acts of violence against innocent people with whom they believe the politics is everything\nThere are those people they're called antifa there are those people some of them are the white supremacist the four white supremacist who were arrested this week by us attorney in a in the eastern district of Virginia fed and filed charges against them for what they did at Charlottesville\nThe overwhelming majority of the American people are not those people\nWe're not we do not make our decisions based on people's race we do not designed to decide to conduct violent actions on the streets because of politics and because of somebody's skin color or lack of skin color or sexual orientation\nIn an uncivilized society when you have the women's march every January with the pain cats\nThere would be acts of violence being perpetrated against women I have no doubt that in nations were which we are allied\nIn the middle east a gathering of women\nDisplaying that kind of political power would be met with brutal force which is the true irony of somebody like when does our sore who is a professional ... sales woman out running around claiming that she is in favor of women's rights but I digress\nWe have a choice in our country to be civilized and civil or to be uncivilized and uncivil\nBut again make no mistake\nMake no mistake one can be uncivil without being an civil\nOne can be passionate\nBlindly passionate to passionate\nAnd one could apologize for bringing a little too much spice to the argument right uh that's understandable and I think you saw that with Brett Kavanaugh when he was testifying a week ago was he disrespectful to the senator's\nShore\nWas passionate yes have you been accused of being a gang rape is yes had he been accused of doing unspeakable act so women on a routine basis yes he'd been accused of all those things\nEarlier fixed mortgage rates averaging foreign three quarters\nAnd fifty or it's closer to four and a quarter percent now for something completely different did you know

sixty talk and breaking news All right so what do we have right now I share it with your piece last night from a Kelly Paul Kelly Paul is Rand Paul's wife and in this piece she specifically calls out Cory Booker\nFor escalating and elevating the confrontational politics that we're living through in our country today and she basically says listen I go to sleep every night I have a gun\nNext to my bed\nA measure that I have a I have a I have a handgun under my pillow because I don't know what's coming through the door and I'm looking at the sheriff's patrolling near our homes and I'm watching a bounty put on elected officials heads and understand this is important folks because we've already seen the manifestation of this violent leftist activity\nIn James Hodgkinson the man who attempted to assassinate twenty five members of the Congress and Senate on flag day in twenty Seventeen\nJeff Flake was there\nAnd we would have been shot\nGiven the opportunity by this Bernie Sanders supporting socialist Occupy Wall street maniac and the bitter irony of that is Jeff Flake holds himself out as a moderate who works with everybody\nAnd he would have been assassinated\nAnd Rand Paul would have been assassinated\nA guy who has worked across the party lines with Cory Booker to work on prison reform\nBut that's not enough that's not good enough that's not appropriate it off that's not welcome we can't do that it has got to be this way revolution or no way\nKelly Paul writes in this piece that she says listen\nMy husband narrowly escaped being murdered at a congressional ball field at a practice my husband was beaten severely in his own front yard by a deranged neighbor\nAnd I think the implication is that it was motivated by politics ends up with six broken ribs firm a beating punctured lungs multiple bounce with pneumonia and she notes in this story Casey hunt on MSNBC lovable\n... happy young reporter who covers Capitol Hill and you would think knows Rand Paul declared on our program\nIt's my favorite story of the whole year Shepard Smith thought it was funny too that Rand Paul would take a beating in his own front yard and be hurt be injured\nShe comes out at the end of the peace and she says there Cory Booker I I think by extension with a lot of the resistance you guys need to step up and you guys need to take responsibility and you need to call off your dogs\nYou need to call off your dogs that you have deployed into the streets that you would have sent into the streets to intimidate and to fry him and to threaten and\nTo harm\nLadies and gentlemen one person\nOne person can stop all of this\nOne person can and all of this\nIt's gotta be Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer or better yet but rock Hussein Obama who is the peculiar head of this resistance movement\nI get it there is a desire to divide people into camps they're easier to manage its the George Soros playbook George Soros has never pumped money into a country in order to build it up and elevate its institution George Soros consistently pouring money\nInto countries to destabilize those nations\nTo destabilize those nations and to say listen I Want to break this thing apart so we can really make it in our own craven image\nThat's what's Soros does he does it every chance he get he was responsible for the largest outflow migration of migrants\nComing out of the middle east in the eastern and Western Europe in the history of humanity I think it was a greater movement of people then even in the aftermath of World War two\nThese are the people who are in league with these disruptor in the Congress and in the Senate when Maxine Waters stands there\nOn a street corner not far by the way because of where her district is not far from where football Williams and his amigos administered a nearly fade whole beating to Reginald Denny\nFor being a white man in that neighborhood in the wrong time at the wrong place\nMaxine Waters has been the single person to throw the most gasoline on this fire impeach four or five impeach four or five I Will go down there tonight and take him out\nCan you imagine the reaction of Maxine Waters if there was police scanner traffic at a major urban\nCity and and you heard a police officer said or another one go over there and take him out and that suspect was shot\nMaxine Waters says confront them get up in their faces threatened them harm them all that sort of stuff doesn't ever apologize is upheld as a lovable anti Maxine on the Maxine I'm just not Maxine no you're not\nYou're somebody trying to inside a riot with your words with an official position\nWhy she hasn't been censured by the house of representatives is beyond me Paul Ryan my point is if we want to BET Her discourse if we want to better discussion we have to demand\nIf there were a bunch of conservatives running around threatening\nLiberals\nOr harm or were shooting liberals I Would condemn it\nYou know a funny little thing happens with this tribalism idea if you're a black person or a white person there's almost nothing you can do about your skin color but if you're a Republican or a Democrat a liberal\nConservative a cartoonist or a free market person guess\nWhat you have you have within you the abyss\nAnd within you the ability to change you ever they needed the ability to change your alliances your allegiances your political outlook you have that power I Can't change what I look like I Can't change my I I Can't change my skin color I Can't change any of that but I can change my politics so how would it possibly better for anybody\nTo bring violence upon someone with whom you disagree when a person you might be able to change their mind off\nI never once remember doing do not see somebody should do something to him I Hope this happens to him I Hope that happened I wasn't that way but I I look at progress is how angry there if you're willing to go into the street and beat people up with a baseball bat or you're willing to surround somebody\nAnd try to run them out of a restaurant or you're willing to intimidate them at the airport or any of that sort of stuff\nWhat does it got to be like ... what what you got to be like in a progressive house\nWho's that irate you imagine\nLike if it wasn't his Warner candle Harris was your mom\nKennel Irishman or they just must be twenty four seven like a Jack hammer on a ... on a on a hunk a sidewalk\nTo I I think it's important\nTo impart in our kids the notion of a civilized and civic responsibility but not turning it into blood sport\nThis should not be\nChargers raiders chiefs this should not be Packers bears we should not turn or politics which is law making policy and all that sort of stuff it should not become a sport\nWhere we're going to win and we do whatever it takes to win and we have to chew we're gonna we're we're going to do that\n\nA higher premium needs to be put\nOn ideas\nOn solutions a higher premium needs to be put on all of these things I I I recall distinctly\nWith Mike Slater about his book right how to change someone's mind and I'm not giving anything away in the book I recommend you get a copy of it um but what what struck me about his book was it not confrontational right it's inquisitive\nYou try to plumb down into the depths to figure out why somebody believes is why does somebody embrace that why is somebody pushing this or that where do they where do they get that idea that the government should be this or that the government should be that where does that come from\nAnd by asking those questions you hope to get a looming nation from the person you hope to talk to the person and get an idea kind of where they're wired from and then you can figure out how to persuade them\nThat is a very mature attitude to take and in reality it's it's the way a good parents teach their kids are good parents should teach their kids in that same way why do you think it is that what I hold this apple and drop it it goes to the floor\nIs the best scientific inquiry is always the the road to discovery and that can be done with politics too that's what's so unnatural about going to a university with a doctrinaire ideologically driven professor who is\nJust sitting behind a desk or standing behind a podium and yelling at you for two and a half hours about why your politics are rotten your parents or Nazis tax cuts are evil and Bush's Hitler and I have\nHad college professors like that as many of you and the audience that\nMany of you in the audience have had that exact experience where a professor just\nJust yells at you and tries to reeducate you for the course of the class and you're saying I thought this was algebra too I thought this was statistics I thought this was business math I thought this was chemistry no it's not it's indoctrination and so the point\nWith our children is if we're going to be the first teachers of our children\nIt's up to us as conservatives but if you're a Democrat if you're a progressive whatever\nIts it blows you not to take your kid and fill their heads heads with hate and anger and rage and let them think that well violence is always a legitimate choice when you just are mad and can't win the argument just punch them in the face so that makes sense when you're three\nThat makes sense when you're a toddler and you're mad that your brother or sister took your ball or your pop tarts or you hit the ...\nThat that that's logical then but not for a twenty five year old and not for a forty year old and not for what is Maxine Waters the John what his name was ... eighty seven she's out there screaming made sure you get in their faces and throw them out of the restaurant\nThat's not who we are that's incivility and uncivilized behavior\nBut you don't like protest or you're gonna teach your kids about the right to protest that's not protesting that's mob stock\nThat's ... that's not protesting\nThat is the political equivalent of swatting where people decide to use a phony phone number tied to your address\nAnd and have a special weapons in tactics team from the police department show up at your house at two o'clock in the morning because somebody has called the cops use your address and said that you just shut your family and you're about to shoot the costs that come through the door that's how you get people killed\nYou know we saw this story about this Jackson Cosco guy in the last twenty four hours this guy's a bad guy he posted private personal information addresses and phone numbers of senators Mike Lee Rand Paul Lindsey Graham\nOrrin Hatch out on the Internet he ... them which is computer speak for dropping documents\nHe docks them to do what to make what point somebody tell me what point he was trying to make\nJust trying to make a point that someone some nut with a gun or something not with a knife would confront them in front of their houses because they've been overheated into believing that this is quite literally life or death for the republic Brett Kavanaugh kid and America no we can't\nNobody has that power\nNobody has that kind of power and least of all a Supreme Court justice\nThat's foolishness\nWe have a choice we have a choice in this country\nWe have a choice in our life\nWe have a choice in the direction we take we have choices\nWhat we choose to do with\nOur efforts is a reflection of us as\nMember as members\nOf this body politic seat the politics is not in Washington the politics is not in the Senate or the house or the White House or the Supreme Court the politics is us we the people are where the power is ...\nAnd so when you see these people take to the streets I was watching CNN earlier today and you add the people taking the streets they're marching with their signs and are they ... they want to take out cabin on Kavanaugh's bad\nThat's a fine expression of democracy if when you cross over that line of Reginald Denny\nAt a cinder block

Kavanaugh clearing a on the votes here we're just going to wait for the vote tomorrow\nSo Chris Hayes in ... from MSNBC come in and they show up and they're going to try to make her feel happy in good about all that that's going on here so I'm gonna give you a little picture and it is it runs a three four minutes but listen to how this goes this is the view on Kavanaugh go\nThere's something about cabinet um he wrote an op ed that was published in the wall Street Journal arguing he is an independent impartial judge after his testimony and nominees rarely\nDo that I don't think I've ever seen that why don't you think\nI thought it was interesting that he felt he needed to do that um because I think in speaking to people that are imbedded in the federal judiciary people that work around judges have court for judges are judges were judges\nAcross the ideological spectrum people were really unnerved by his performance on Thursday it was truly anomalous and truly disturbing and I think the message got to him\nThat people felt that way and have the cover himself a little bit without off of the\nInteresting thing is his comments were scripted here's here's meeting off of piece of paper so why Apollo he I relaxed again I'd like to have what is new thing right I mean there were some things that came\nOut of nowhere look there's an arm and I know where it within a year but\nIt was a term in the law it's called the attack on the\nLine it's something that three and four year olds do but it's also with Brett Kavanaugh usually through a full head yes and I think it was so unnerving then as the days went on even though he's someone who\nHasn't apologized for the way he clearly misled if an outright perjured himself and certainly had to take responsibility for much of what he did as you as described by other credible witness to what he clearly wanted to take back the Kathy\nOne question now let's say this goes through and they have an eye is confirmed up it might happen it probably will have\nFrom that in the mid term the Democrats more energized and I don't know yeah I think I think I think the pope they're wanting\nTo tell you we bono\nSonny Bono [laughter]\nYou're going to be hell no um no I think I think that there will be\nA tremendous amount of anger mobilization from Democrats and independent leaning women in response to him being confirmed um I\nDon't it's hard to game out frankly I think that there there's a lot of talk right now about how the mobilization to get him confirmed has been helping Republicans has\nUm but I think that if you if you win that fight I think the the people on the wrong side of that fight are going to be even more\n[noise] they're trying to cope\nThey're trying they're trying to do whatever they can with their coping skills what does this mean\nSomebody's put out on Twitter a picture of Susan Collins and as a caption on it Susan Collins rape apologist\nSmokers that's disgusting so as a polo

sixty talking breaking news [noise]\nSo bad that they would attack a person have no evidence no cooperating evidence whatsoever and then they would attack this guy a and claim\nThat there was something some substance there and there there was nothing from day one\nBut finally on the on the national front there and they want to get down to the issues here in the state I'm One of the thing that\nCame up there was a big deal and you and I sort of chatted about this and obviously we don't want any names or a anonymity guaranteed here but this idea that\nWell [noise] judges are immune from politics you are okay you judge as you're not you're not political creatures you're just log\nGuys you're just the people who read the law and interpret the law\nTrue false myth that you know that's the way we would want to judge has to be sure unfortunately over the last decade or two ... we began to politicize the bench both here in California yes\nAnd on the national level to the point where ideology becomes important\nFor some people's appointment right and you know I think judge it as such as judge Kavanaugh\nLess political in fact you can look at his face was like [laughter] you know he was a deer in headlights yeah uh he didn't understand what has been happening to the judiciary right um but the\nDemocrats in Washington understand clearly they're looking for ideologues to go on the bench that's why you look at the Ninth Circuit and you get these crazy decisions that the U.S Supreme Court has to go back and reverse all the time\nWhen you when you look at that though because obviously we had the same problem in Sacramento it if it's a swamp the swamp and there's a majority of Democrats controlling all about\nWell that right I mean we any of woefully outgunned so if if when you get elected to become the attorney general how you get an advocate that might help minefield\nWell you know there's the beauty of being the attorney general is that you actually sit on the committee and he's the governor makes the appointment right to the courts of appeal and to the Supreme Court right but the attorney general has an active role in uh approving knows\nAnd as your new attorney general I'm going to take a very tough stance towards judges that are going on the\nAppellate courts I Want judges that are focused on the law first\nI'm applying facts that have been decided that the trial court level applying those facts to the uh the law and coming to a fair decision I don't want activist judges California doesn't need activist judges we don't need federal activist judges\nOr Stephen Eli judge the belly is I'm a joining us here he is the candidate for the Republican a party for representing the Republican Party for the attorney general the state of California ... forty seven and ... fifty seven have been\nUnbelievably devastating for the state of California for the citizens that follow the laws everyday wait we've seen just insane explosion\nOf property crimes and drug crimes what are we going to do about\nThis well we've got to we've got to roll this back\nThe district attorney's and crime victims United have an initiative that will be on the ballot in twenty twenty\nI'm a strong supporter of mad initiative what it's going to do or a couple of things that are really critical one it's going to now make it a recidivist crime so if you go out and start committing petty thefts more thefts and and you get three of those\nNow we're going to turn it into a felony\nAnd once it's a felony now we can start locking people up for lengthy period of time\nAnd that's going to make it less beneficial to the professional criminals to go out and steal from our small businesses or large business life so that's one thing that needs to be done the um the second thing is if you are a gang of thieves\nIt's going to make that a felony and it does a whole host of other things are there changes that are rolled back and put some sanity back in\n... this whole area of of property crimes you know in San Francisco has twenty six thousand auto break ins in a year\nYou know maybe that tells us that things are out of control right and and if when it happens in San Francisco and the population of San Francisco is saying hey wait a minute this isn't what we bargain for when we pass prop forty seven every one in California is thinking that way\nBut in San Francisco you can't have a straw that you can't have a heroin needle\nOh absolutely you know the the biggest thing that they've got in San Francisco the most innovative thing in the last year is that app that tells you where the needles are and where the human wages him in a way says\nTo an unbelievable here in I'm here in San Diego as you're well aware of the perimeter case a egg egg came out of this this part of the uh of of the state\nAnd we have um many issues back and forth with sheriff's around the state uh regarding the second amendment and cc W's in gun control and all those sorts of things what about that judge Bailey uh where do you come down on the position of gun control\nWell I'm opposed to most all of the gun control um proposals that have been frankly past I mean you know if you are law abiding citizen\nYou ought to be able to possess a firearm in the state and that includes a you know I don't know you know I Know what the definition of a salt water a weapon is right but I don't know what us an assault weapon is I mean nobody's ever been able to define that\nUm but California thinks it can um so you know at at the end of the day you know a weapon as a weapon it ought to be legal for law abiding citizens in this state\nTo protect themselves to use in their hunting um those kinds of things are lawful pursuits I'll tell you what the attorney general out of the focus short al ... is that list of ten thousand names of\nOf felons and domestic abusers and others that are statutory prohibited from possessing a firearm\nYou know in last year the legislature the Democrats and the legislature appropriated thirty two million dollars for the attorney general to go out and and get those ... those guns away from ... you know how many they got so many three hundred wow three hundred names off the list\nI mean it was a credible a you know thirty two million dollars that's a pretty darn good pay day but you know the delivery is a business now it's not a priority to the attorney general it means to be a priority because those are the very people going out I'm submitting new crimes\nAbsolutely here's judge Steven Bailey Bailey for age gee that down like as in for attorney general Bailey for a gene dot com to get more information to show your support to him or you have that debate coming up here not before too long right with a with the attorney general\nActually he's you know been missing\n[laughter] actually I think there will debate that we're going to try to fend them out of ... I'd love\nTo see you guys square off because I think it's important to get his position on these law enforcement issues and on law and order issues quality of life issues all of this stuff\nUp yeah I mean he's he will tell you point blank he thinks the most important job of the attorney general's to fight Washington yeah and you know you you can't to dismiss that because he's got forty four lawsuits right now\nRight great stuff a judge Steven Bailey he's a he's running for the attorney general position to help save the state and I made California goals and again for sure judge Steven Bailey Bailey four H.
