yes it has some so let's let's talk about something that affects everybody right now that that is quality of life right in and and crime and things like that\nUh we're we're living in politically charged times I I Know that we've got a we we've got a a political orientation out of Sacramento there's a political orientation ... in the county does want to go orientation in town of that sort of stuff\nBut let's talk about the public safety issues because forty seven fifty seven of both had impacts on communities we've ... we've seen homelessness problem everywhere\nBut Carlsbad has done a couple of different things\nThat have come up as city council do issues and they include I'm a ... in terms of people going out there to protest to exercise their civic their civic rights or civil rights I'm you all have have implemented the the no ... no not wearing masks when you're out there protesting\nI'm like the ninja masks and the anti fought masks and things like that that we've seen that has been an issue that most people I imagine are supportive of also the license plate readers eyes is something else can you talk about those two issues\nSo yes I can and then those are two issues for myself and my opponent are are are just the opposite I'm obviously a safety is a big concern and you you just began to touch on it about Sacramento and some of the laws that have changed over the last two years and continue to change\nAnd it makes it makes our law enforcement it's it becomes more challenging every day\nAnd in regards to the protests and especially when we think those protests could become hostel um it's it's very important that people do not wear masks or any type of face shield\nAnd our officers strongly believe in that we need to see who who were dealing with and be able to do that in any proper manner\nLicense plate readers again um [noise]\nUm we both just uh have different views I strongly support license plate readers um we've had them in our vehicles for probably the better part of eight years and they ... prove quite successful and recently we put them throughout the city\nAnd then the first six months we did\nWe stop sixty five stolen vehicles made sixty three arrests solve five home burglaries\nOne of those home burglaries had a A R Fifteen and two other weapons taken we found those weapons within three day swap so um it has already um had great great response and\nJust the other night two nights ago we had a stolen vehicle come into town and I'm and we're able to catch it [noise] um we've we've actually backed off in that case because the person was driving very radically but um it wasn't long after we backed off that the the person run it into a guard rail and we apprehended them\nWell that's good to know that there are there off the they're off the streets there are so as you look forward ... into into this ... this coming year or if there's if there's one\nThere's one thing you would like to focus on a obviously we know homelessness has been an issue it's been a headline story um opioid epidemic everywhere in this country that's a problem or something that you're looking to work on new improved to to kind of focus on uh in in the near term\nSo one of the things that I when I listen to the community um we're getting close to our our build out cap and it's time for us to think about what Carl spent wants to be in the next twenty five years right call at our twenty shifty plan\nAnd that's actually on our agenda for October twenty third\nWhere we will sit and look and and look back at growth management what we've been able to calm accomplish in\nI'm ... and ... and see if there are any areas that we have missed or how life has changed and start to think about our future\nAnd this process will be settled and just one meeting but if this is something that will take several years for not only the council but the whole community to work through and give input so we can\nHave a clear path for [noise] for what our city will look like you know the years to come and most importantly it'll hope to give our children and our grandchildren I'm the same quality of life that we've experienced over the last

a long ways from Texas I I was on the right country\nBut not in the region but to Larry's back with us today if you guys are with us last week we had John O'Donnell he's the chief dollar jobs there and we kind of the rain maker haired on trade he gave me filling in for Larry's big shoes\nHere on the income generating show now one of the things that we love to talk about here is we love to talk about making more money hence the name right we're all about income here it's all about driving more income now it always ends up being\nIncome for retirement or income for today right we can use the income for for really whatever we want but it's all about having more income so we can do the things we want to do rather than do the things we have to do no inside of our financial markets one of the things that we stress a lot we spend a lot of time on this show\nIs how to make consistent income and that's that's one of the things I Love having Larry out here out here talking about he sheds a lot of light on that subject as far as how we can make consistent and come in the market and it really starts with a consistent approaching and all we mean by consistent approach is the marks go up down in sideways so we've got to\nHave a strategy we've got to have an approach that can make money up down her sideways right now we've got that Bush biased where some of the greatest consumers of all time but Larry what are some of the things you and your instructor team are really having a student's focus on right now to generate money and do people identify those down opportunities and they'll sideways opportunity\nWell it really comes out of the things that's about awareness and basically emotion right now so the awareness is a lot of people want to make more money they think that making money is simply working another job which is something we don't want it to where more importantly most millionaires you and I've said this over and over again have five different income streams\nWell you can imagine a millionaire and I want to go out there were five different jobs they learn how to generate income passive income or active income they just want to pay check coming over and over again and so a lot of what our students learn is how to go from being very emotional\nTo being very strategic and the way you do that as by following people who are already doing what you want to do\nAnd will course referring to the big banks and so a lot of what we teach our students is\nHow the banks make money and most of the ways to make money is not just by going long where most people learn a trade that way\nBut also by going what we call shorting the market\nAnd that simply means when the markets go down it's not necessarily a negative thing it's an opportunity and so ... self aware\nIs understanding that there's more ways than what you might have been taught to trade and as a result you now simply learn which most people don't understand that their way to trade money in the markets is really simple it's a transfer money for people who don't know what they're doing to people who don't know what they're doing\nYou're just tuning in you miss Larry Jacobs and director of a structure development and top instructor down they traded got me he's the brains of the operation here that's for sure you shouldn't some light on how to make money and the markets are going up down her side with how to generate more money to generate more income inconsistent income no matter which way the market is going\nYou're just tuning in maybe your first time must have you been with us for the whole show don't worry the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners are looking to really replace their income with trading and investing in some of them are just looking to you know fulfill that new year\nNew Year's resolution of upgrading their lifestyle with a little bit of it is of additional income\nUm you know some of them are looking just to kind of supplement things other people are really out in that situation where they want to fire their boss there's a whole whole gamut of kind of ultimate goals that people have when it comes to generating more income but there is that one consistency between all of these groups it all boils down to another source of income we've talked a little bit about multiple streams of income passive income\nActive income and I want to use as you were saying in the last in the last segment want to spend a little bit of time kind of diving a little bit deeper into these topics and when you guys are working with people specifically looking to to branch out their streams of income what's the what's that starting point and were that pathway kind of look like\nWell starting off with your whole idea about resolutions I mean we're coming up at that time of year I and we're going to start getting a barrage of videos and and ... and all this stuff about why we have to go to the gym you start seeing the commercials because one of the biggest resolution says what losing weight the second biggest is getting out of debt\nAnd this is something that a lot of students come in now the reason why most people are poor\nP. O. R. because they're passing over opportunities repeatedly we've been talking about this in the last segment you have to make a decision right now you have to shift\nFrom worrying about how you're going to make money to being able to think beyond just survival and a lot of our students come in they don't realize is a simple step by step process of how to make money like institutions do\nYou've mentioned this many times we talk about J. P. Morgan Chase for example this bank has only had what was it nine losing days in five years\nCrazy well a lot of people are constantly going into the markets uneducated not really understanding how the markets work and then scratch their heads when they lose money the market was designed for people to make money if you understand the rules\nSo a lot of times like anything else with a job out there people start working they spent time at a job they got better and better at it before they know it they're getting promoted they're getting to do other type of things and get more and more responsibilities\nWhat I've talked to students about the biggest concern is right now is what if we have another major correction where they're going to be able to make up that income\nAnd you know it's not a question anymore of if it's when we're already starting to see\nReminiscent of what happened in two thousand seven or the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates again we're starting to see housing prices going down again the construction industry is starting to to go down again so there are opportunities here for people to not have a situation happened to them again like it did before\nAnd I don't think anybody out there is on their deathbed going you know Ryan I Wish I could a worked another day\nYeah yeah that's not the it's not the norm when it comes to New Year's resolutions it's like you know we did a big New Year's resolutions be back in January on the show and then it'll be fun to do another one that's next January but one of the things that we we went through if you recall as we went through the top the top ten on New Year's resolutions and and one of them was like I Hope I worked like here's a hope I work till the\n... the day I die and and and other ones where I Want to downgrade my lifestyle and and and and unfortunately those are those are reality is that that that a lot of people end up in but they don't need to right they don't need to end up in those situations and it really just takes a couple of small two weeks\nI I did a I did a lecture I don't even know it was it was probably eight years ago and I stumbled upon a recording of it a couple of days ago\nAnd the whole point of the lecture was about how little things become big things\nAnd so you can look at it you can look at things where you say okay well well what if I could generate a little more income and whether it was five dollars a day right now at five dollars they could turn into ten dollars a day could turn into twenty dollars and it started with that five dollars a day and next thing you know a few years from now or maybe five years from now it's five hundred dollars a day right but it had\nTo have a starting point it goes back to some of the phone call you always throw in like the ... and stuff like that where I I and I might messed this up so if I Do correct me with it on it but if you don't have to be great to get started but you have to get started to be great writers there's all sorts of fun things like that\nThat are out there that are that are will call cliche but they're also so true but there is so true and they're they're they're they're necessary for us to say that if they're forced to hear but then there are also\nNecessary for us to take action on if we want to generate that extra income because that's really what ends up failing in our New Year's resolutions as we say okay well I Want to make more money I Want to lose weight well there's there they step by step process to both of those and at the end of the year the reason why maybe we didn't make more money or we didn't lose weight the reason we didn't is staring back at us in the mirror\nRant and really we've got to own that we've got to say okay I'm not going to let anything be my ethical and especially that person in the mirror is not going to be ... obstacle which just simply means usually changing similar habits and changing what we're doing a complete life overhaul but it's just adding a few more pieces and that can help it generates more income\nTo have the economy really spend a lot of time going through some step by step process is\nThat can help generate more income before you to see those you're going to need to you're going to need to have tickets so they'll let you in the only thing we can do if you're up for it as we give away somewhere ticket let's do it All right well right now I've got to have their class kind of in your area they have their classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to start generating multiple streams of income\nIncome through stock options futures currencies right multiple streams of income\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these classes so if you are driving now's the time to pull over and get that phone ready include with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top constructors lessons on topics like how to make money when the market goes down\nGeneration capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional inside her kid makes it so you can get started right now ... when you just call now and reserve those seats the number is eight six six six three zero eight seven to three that's eight six six six three zero eight seven to three\nIf you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that by his up at free OJ class dot com and see if you can source of passes there\nBut the multiple streams of income topic is one that I Love ... I Love how how you can really approached the financial markets you really can't pick out commodities you could separate commodities you can separate options you can separate currencies you could separate separate a dividend strategy and very very quickly you could build out four to five six even seven\nDifferent types different streams of income\nFrom the different financial markets that we have out there we haven't even touched on real estate or owning another business or different things like that that can be passive as well right here in the financial markets where all you really need as an Internet connection\nWe have the opportunity or we have the the access of generating these multiple streams of what are some of the what are some of the multiple streams what are some of the secondary streams are some of the passive type uh types of income that you see a lot of the students focusing on that are really helping them reach their financial freedom\nWell before I checked it out let's take a look again about just getting a second job people think by simply adding some zeroes at the end of their income they're simply going to be out of debt where most of the time they don't get educated enough and they're adding more zeroes the end of their expenses\nSo one of the ways you could look at this as as you mentioned are students realized that they can be trading and this is really about them so even if you're listening it's about you what are your goals right now what are you trying to attain\nBecause a lot of times you'll sit back and put you at a time machine like to say we put them back in the delorean right back to the future do you go back two years and you it's eight some goals for yourself how many people actually go ahead and achieve those goals probably very few edgy years from now what's going to make any difference that something will change instead\nWhat if you can learn a skill that allows you to generate daily income weekly income monthly income\nAnd you don't have to spend extra hours doing we haven't called three hour traders they get up in the morning when the market opens and they want to be out of their trades within a couple of hours and they got their whole day to spend with their family their friends taking vacations the key that I find is that it really is about like we've mentioned freedom\nWe've mentioned freedom how are you going to find a way to ease your time to lie to do the things that you want and the biggest single obstacle that most people have that prevent them from the company successful either financial your life\nIs fear and so we help our students kind of get past that by really breaking this down a simple way where students can figure for the first time\nHow banks make money and more importantly how they can make money to [noise]\nYeah and really procrastination ends up being the largest nation in the in the world right procrastination putting things off but you're you're touching on fear there and that's what made me think about procrastination procrastination is like the result of fear\nRight it's what happens when we're afraid we just we just put it off all you know what I'm I'm fearful of this and I I Know that I Need to do it so internally we say I am going to do it just not today\nWhen really that's just means we're not going to do it right so we were procrastinating we're putting it off and that helps kind of take some of the pressure off of fear but one of the things about pressure and that's how diamonds are created right diamonds are created out of massive amounts of pressure and when you think about things like that great things\nCome from that activity and it it boils back to a few more of the old cliche things where if you always do what you've done you'll always get what you got we could layer upon layer those those conversations but it really ends up being how are we going to react in those situations where we know we need to go we need to make a right hand turn even\nThough the left hand turn looks a lot easier right it's doing what needs to be done so that we can get the financial freedom\nThat we won't get imagine what your life would look like if you could actually achieve those financial goals are hoping for\nA lot of our students to give you one example and coming up in a break Ryan where her name was Maria single mom she wanted to put our kids to school very very nervous you wouldn't have enough money well she learned how to trade not only was she able to put her two kids to college but she bought herself a new car so\nPeople that have goals you're able to commit your coach ... you have a high probability of being able to achieve the things you want in life\nThey always say if you're why is big enough you will find your how that's right\nWell one of the ways where we can help you get started his by introducing you relate to the step by step process on how to generate more income and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is right now I got to have their class coming up in your area and they have their classes where you can see exactly what it takes really generate that consistent income those multiple streams of income inside of the financial markets\nWhen you're averaging your price backed up by these all time highs offsets all the money that was invested in that for a while and came back in two thousand nine and we're taking the\nAverage price up with us which which raises are risk exposure and lowers are profitability and in the end it's for one reason in my opinion my humble opinion and it's because Wall Street's businesses to sell us products and that's OK\nRight we just have to know that a Wal Mart's businesses to sell us products too and that's how they make money and I don't think they're evil right and they'll think Wall Street's evil but as the customer not client noticed I use the word customer\nAs the customer we have to understand\nThat what we're what we're doing when we're when we're engaging with somebody when I go to Walmart I realize that I'm not planning on making money I'm just buying something from them and if that's the same thing that that's happening with us with Wall Street we've got to kind of take that into consideration with the\nWith the kind of analysis that we're doing on the situation are we planning on making money on this transaction if the answer is yes\nHow do we plan on making money on this and usually the answer after that unfortunately is is I don't know but that's where getting a little bit of education on how the markets work can go a long way and I say a little bit can go a long way and it really can a little bit of education\nWill put you miles in front of the average investor one of the ways where we can help you do that as we got a few more tickets so we can do a little give away as long as I said it's OK let's do it right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area they have their classes where you can see exactly what it takes to keep that retirement grown whether the market's going up down or sideways have more income for today and more income for tomorrow\nAnd just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these half day classes switch phones ready and if you are driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhanced the retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more than professional inside of it makes it so you get started right now\n... century twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight six six six three zero eight seven to three that's eight six six six three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free OJ class dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nYou know we've talked a lot about the growing side of things with their retirement accounts really getting those retirement accounts to generate more incomes what about the protective side of things we've got we have a group of people out there who have made a bunch of money as the marks have been going higher than piling money into those accounts and what can they do to protect against the downside without limiting the upside\nWell most importantly you need to understand where you're right\nStand where your risk award rely so many people imagine if I took it back to two thousand and seven what if you learn a skill that have told you to go to cash back in December of two thousand seven and\nThen you would have had cash in your account\nBasement bargain prices buying stock back on the way up and that's really what banks were doing they had one of the best years of their lives in two thousand eight fact I stick to our students all the time they're waiting for the next correction Wall Street has been waiting for the next correction at some point they'll be another decade long windfall coming back\nAnd it's almost like you have the opportunity here to get a nice financial do over but most people again think they know best a lot of people I talk to you don't even know what happened to retirement accounts how much they're paying fees I mean what if I told you\nThat about thirty percent of your saved retirement money is going to go out the door in fees to your brokerage company that would probably infuriates you switch to start doing right now is thinking well\nIf I hadn't been able to put aside money right now learning how to trade for income enables you to start saving money what you can put toward retirement once you understand the right rate of return that you need to be able to compounded annually\nYou can start thinking about generating the money you need to retire the right way and again\nThis comes down to getting yourselves educated what I said before earlier is that most people make the greatest mistake possible try to wing it on their own by reading books are watching Youtube videos and\nYou don't see right right I I'm not going to go on line learn how to fly a plane from a Youtube video and then go up to age wise will go watch the Youtube video can I get in the cockpit right now and take off\nDoesn't make any sense well the same thing can be said about your money as as I Love from the movie the pursuit of happiness Chris gardener mother played portrayed by Will Smith once said the cavalry ain't come and you have to care more about your money than anybody else and that means protecting yourself by getting yourself educated as quickly as possible\nWhen whenever you whenever you bring up a the pursuit of happiness and you say to covering coming it always reminds me of another quote a and I don't know where it originated from but our our our friend Keely would always say over and over she'd always say this life is not a dress rehearsal\nOver and over I heard her say that a million times I don't remember where she got it from that will give ... credit for that one right now now one of the things about the fees that you were touching on that I just want to elaborate on before we jump into this break is as you were talking about thirty percent can end up going to fees and there was an article that I saw a little while ago that shows how the average person spent three years of their life\nPaying for the fees so if you make fifty thousand dollars a year you can expect to be about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in fees if you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you can expect to pay about three hundred thousand dollars\nIn fees one of the things you can do to avoid those fees is really take control of your of your money before you should do that you need to know how to do it\nWhat great place to start that just started that educational process is out of one of our happy class and we just happen to have a stack of tickets here Larry are you ready I'm ready All right well right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area and a half the class as we can see exactly what it takes really take control those retirements generate that income for today and\nMake sure that you have that income for tomorrow and it just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes so if you were driving now is a great time to pull over and get that phone ready\nNow included with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kitten is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors my favorite thing about the

the shrimp or there was an abnormal sounds a you know not the normal lip or so I looked at the screen or the associate with looking at and it said a do not sell this item\nOr an it printed out a little ticket it said to attach this to the bag of shrimp and call a manager or and so the manager came over and us but you know what this could possibly be and she said we really don't know we all we looked at the expiration date or wasn't expired didn't expired so next year\nI'm In and I said well you know maybe there was some kind of recall\nA and the manager said you know that that's entirely possible or the you know at this point we don't know so I've looked Simpson to see if there was a recall on any kind of frozen shrimp in there hadn't been won in a couple of years I'm ... is that maybe there's a recall in process and it just hasn't been announced yet but they would not let us buy that bag of shrimp\nBad is fascinating and it's a mystery maybe will unfold over time but that is

and television\nAnd um they are signing fine I contact but there\nWas no way it was no yeah [noise]\nStill be association are you in a mandatory associate and community\nYeah wow\nSo the the board of

the people cutting the cord across the country that all the experts said would not happen for years and years and years and years and years\nThis is a rotten idea that you need to stir up the

they do offer I don't really find if they decide to leak or move into another unit say downsized or one passes away into the apartment or something\nYeah I I have never been a fan of the violence\nAnd the ... to me or for people who are I mean they're extremely wealthy and this is not an investment obviously it's a lifestyle purchase and they can afford it and it makes them happy and it just means that um\nThey they don't have as much money potentially to give to charity later to their kids or whatever\nAnd they're comfortable spending that is a lifestyle spend big and do it but as if you ...\nIf you asked me the dollars and cents of it I think it's a terrible use the money\n[laughter] yeah my sister and I are wondering if there's a better option they want to be around like people to five and other community that they offer things that appeal to them they liked the on site medical care that isn't bail All right but they ...\nI don't know what else do it by then it had anything to
