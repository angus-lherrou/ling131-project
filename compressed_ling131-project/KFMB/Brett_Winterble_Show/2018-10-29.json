I mean they do have some higher and things where I Wonder if they have you know twelve months same as a famous cash kind doesn't it\nDo carry those receivables I mean they do have some higher and things where I Wonder if they have you know twelve months same as a famous cash kind doesn't have the things I Wonder if they carry that financing that's one thing I Would look into Paul to understand that balance sheet a little bit more 'cause that could be [noise]\nMake it look a little bit better when you look at it that way\nCurrent price so it was a hundred and Seventy two dollars and twenty three cents as well off as a two week high two hundred and Fifteen dollars and forty three cents between glows a hundred and sixty dollars and fifty three cents so has slightly recovered from that fifty two week low forgot to January two thousand twenty the estimated only for ... basis\nTen dollars and twenty seven cents would give us they target cell price of a hundred and sixty nine dollars and forty six cents so still enforced and below that current price I think there are a lot better housing plays out there that aren't as expensive and we've had home depots inexpensive for a long time\nEven with this pullback I feel a little pricey I'm not intrigued at this current level yet a into\nThings to one thing about it at home depot and this is kind of personal things I'm I'm a veteran iguana lows that they check my service state and so it worked fine Home Depot makes it so difficult oh you've got to have your service cart I go to the service like forty years ago [laughter] you know it's like I'm not going to my service guarded just irritates me sometimes they're not going to\nSay be careful because I Know maybe some home maybe it was just that person 'cause we did get a complaint but an enlightenment from a listener that\nSaid it was actually not one person because I I've been there three times I'll say no we got to have the same store or same store so I mean Howard management there so it'd be okay so maybe maybe maybe somebody else will be different listeners just got a got a fair okay so I'll just put that away as a kind of personally\nBut I Do look at the balance sheet and this and this is not good uh back in two thousand fourteen had fourteen point seven billion dollars of debt now\nDoubled to twenty seven billion dollars and whatever I really do not like to see as their equity a back into the un fourteen twelve point five billion\nIt is now shrunk to one point for buying it could be right there probably are buying back stock which can hurt that but still that kind of worries me and again I I I think when people is a great company but I Do not question the value of that fair trade act So Paul I got the uh we talk so much about it that do you hold or look at buying it\nNot used to I don't know that now\nYeah I I I I just can't get excited about it and and uh I Do stop and as you can tell sometimes but I Would not buy the stock\nThere and I didn't look at the cash statement they did buy back about seven point seven billion dollars worth of stock last year so far this year they bought back about three billion so they are on our aggressive buyback but it's just\nAn expensive last year at the Aspen Soviet another good good management move around thank Adam [noise] so probably would not say by it\nOkay then very helpful to have a growing by [noise] All right that\nDoes over on the phone line one eight hundred seven six zero\nK. F. M. B. that one eight hundred\nSeven six zero five three six to ...\nAnd you want to point out I mean a stock buybacks can be a great way for a company and the kind of boost its earnings per share it boosts your share of the pie of a company which is a great thing\nThe problem is you have to look at the opportunity cost is if they took that money may be invested in New stores are improving stores or something like that that could be more beneficial and also the thing you have to look at is that price of the acting when they're buying back the stock I mean it was trading I don't want to say like thirty times earnings\nAt its peak when they're buying back suck right I mean that's just that's an expensive company you don't want to buy back stock when your stock prices that hot you want to buy back stock when you know uh you're multiple laws you know ten twelve times running and that's a great by\nBut at home depots ... multiple edits elevated multiple where they find much talk I don't think it was a good investment\nAnd and what is wrong with the business saying you know what is our stocks are going to buy ... we can expand we're spending a good pace we have all this extra cash let the cash bail because you you're in business for a long long time sort of a taste for five years for your start to pull back down or for the economy to pull back down and you have you know ten billion dollars in cash\nI close the bounty on I don't think they have that much cash in the balance sheet but what is wrong with carrying cash if you can't do anything to do I mean apple does that for a long time and yeah we're not going to get an acquisition just to make an acquisition so they build up to what two hundred and fifty billion dollars in cash\nThere's nothing wrong business doing that if you can't find a good place to do it I'd rather have management to that then I got actually they borrowed money they bought my to buy stock I had just irritates me\nAnd I do I do think management has to be careful of course 'cause you can't come out and say really my stock prices too high yeah\nSo we're not buying back in time and I think typically management says oh we have better opportunities or be patient with the cash waiting for opportunities but [laughter] I don't think management would ever come out I think I was having a couple of times when the stock price or get way way out of whack with a seal my say Hi Chuck parts of the little expensive\nBut I mean it typically management does not want to come out and say yet we're not buying backstop because it's too expensive\nFor them the fact that I I wrote major and say we just don't comment on the stock price which is probably better thing because their jobs to run this talk to them start person to run a company\nNot were about a stock prices are the major I say it will take care of itself we do a good job managing the business the stock reflect a good business and not not to comment on it so ... thanks so [noise] um [noise] excuse me I'm All right to eight twenty six or eight twenty seven actually so let's go ahead\nAnd take a break come back to your calls her up one eight hundred seven six zero\nK.

[noise]\n\nHe's just a moment [noise]\nThere's a new report out in the journal of the American Medical Association that a large number of dietary supplements that were subject to recall last year are still being sold on store shelves and still being sold on the Internet\nLast year are still being sold on store shelves\nAnd still being sold on the Internet these items are extremely dangerous and uh in fact the wording in the journal the American Medical Association these products have the potential to cause severe adverse health effects\nI mean that's as clear as it could possibly be for somebody writing about medicine right and these supplements that are being sold that are very dangerous\nFit into three particular areas where items are being sold with extremely dangerous ingredients in them that can lead to heart trouble high blood pressure a number of things and they're most heavily\nA dietary supplements being sold to people that are trying to do a weightlifting build up muscle mass\nPeople they're trying to lose weight\nAnd people that are trying to help themselves in the bedroom\nAnd so those three areas which are that's one that's a pretty large segment those three of the dietary supplement industry and what I can recommend is what I've recommended in the past is that you buy dietary supplements that are us pay raided\nThat it's an organization that has a voluntary code of conduct in the absence of\nFDA oversight based on a law passed by Congress last decade dietary supplements industry operates removed from and protected from normal safety oversight and only after the fact that leads to recalls\nDoes the FDA have any power over dietary supplements so in other words people have to suffer medical farm before there's any action but in this case where there's been action\nThe companies selling dietary supplements are like oh we're not going to recall them where they can do to us anyway and they're still for sale we\nAre posting at Clark dot com the list of ingredients that specifically you want to make sure you are not taking an dietary supplements for any of these three purposes again weight loss in the bedroom\nFor weightlifting or building up muscle mass you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\n\nMessaging beta ... pi guys this may be the last time you ever have to think about hair loss 'cause I'm telling you bosley is the real deal they're given men their hair back permanently there real hair all takes to get started on the hair gain train as a single text message\nSo yeah you will face potentially higher interest rates but you can dial back the clock if you historically have gotten your vehicle alone at the car dealer\nAnd instead this time you get it at a credit union\nHe will likely drive the interest straight back to below what it would have been at a car dealer before interest rates rose cause the interest rate differences so gigantic between a credit union and a car dealer and significant between a credit union and a bank\nThe other thing is as you are\nShopping around for a vehicle I Want you to use the on line methods to shop for a vehicle if you're a member of one of the big warehouse cubs Costco and Sam's they both have car buying programs no negotiation and the marketplace\nSoftness is directly reflected in the pricing you'll see from those programs superior usa a member I Want you to look to buy a vehicle through their program\nUsed cars are completely different process\nAll talk about that at a future time but the key with a new vehicle ranger financing in advance preferably add a credit union and second do your shopping online\nNot add a dealer only thing you should be doing other dealers test drives and taking delivery I've got a guy that car dot com that walks through this fine process\nAnd one of the thing about transportation I keep forgetting that mentioned Hoover and left are offering free rides on election day if you would like to\nI keep forgetting dimension Hoover and left are offering free rides on election day if you would like to have them do the driving for you to the polling place instead of you having to drive to the polling place bail is with us on the Clark Howard ... show hello Dale\n... Ben\nI'm doing great thanks how are you are too\nYes I Am thank you\nSo you've got a question for me that how you're doing makes a huge difference potentially to how I answer the question\nThey may help in the long run I was just curious about the\nQuestion concerns about taking Social Security uh sixty two [noise] and possibly investing that whole amount as opposed to waiting for the higher amount as a later age I feel like with the right of investment you probably wouldn't be\nDoing better off than waiting till a sixty six and four months\nSo it seems like a whole chunk of change and the government handle and you could probably be doing something with it yourself\nStunner is a white investments earn today what savings are in today it is nearly impossible\nFor someone to take early Social Security invest that money and out or in what the computer the advantages to you waiting those extra for years to take your Social Security the reason is is it every year you wait\nYou get a Social Security check roughly eight percent larger and then as the cost of living adjustments occur\nYour cost of living adjustment of space for the rest of your life on a higher initial amount\nSo and also there was no taxi are going to go\nFor waiting to take Social Security versus taking it early investing the money and then if you do well investing you then have to pay tax on the money you earned investing so there are a lot of inherent advantages to wait\nAnd the most common age people take Social Security is what you're new to line right now at age sixty to write my advice is when you've got to have the money\nIs when you take it and in my case you know what age I'm going to take it\nWhere you know eight\nEight Seventy that's the last time you can take it and get all that build up of the eight percent products my extra each year\nRight and so I'm going to a hold out till the last minute so that I can end up with a much larger Social Security check at the time I take it\nSo if you gave the ah you gave the analogy of sixty two and your retirement age which you say sixty six years four months is that what she said\nYes so if you were still doing okay financially and you didn't even need it then I Would like you to keep kicking the can forward\nA plan on it I'm pretty healthy I'm not going anywhere I'm\nStill feel like I'm Eighteen so I don't think anything's going to stop me soon so probably a good advice it just seemed like a lot of money left on the table my calculations kept telling me to live in years to regain the money that I like go at sixty two\nThat's completely true but the big problem with um retirement years is later and retirement\nWhen we may not be physically able if we needed more money to go back to work we may have more medical bills I mean the fatter check becomes more benefits now let me tell you the risk I'm taking my brother\nIn January my oldest brother it will have live longer than any mail\nIn my entire family tree and as far back as any of us know ever and he will be at that time Seventy two\nSo you know that we are not a genetically disposed to live as long as guys in my family so can you imagine I'm going to wait until late Seventy [laughter] I may have no benefit I ever get out of the system\nThe mother of it's over Ninety and she's still kicking so I\nWill say in your case there is a direct advantage to waiting because what you really concerned about his way down the road so I Hope that my brother ah who also\nWaited until late Seventy that he ends up live in a really really really long time for many reasons not having anything to do with money\nNoble is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi how you doing\nThis hybrid talk you know big fan well thank you so much Yes sir\nSo you have had a nasty gram from a credit card company why did they do to you\n[noise] so I opened up a credit card or a store card I Know you're not a I Know you're not saying I'm a several years ago and I haven't used it in years and it's only got a limit of about a thousand dollars ... or anything like that on it but I got an email saying that\nUh if I didn't use the card by December wells that they were going to close the cards and I wanted to see is\nIt would be in my best interests at I guess in my credits best interests if I close the card\nThen or if I just let them closer or or or what we'll do that\nThat makes no difference either way but I wanted to ask you a question this store card does it have a visa and MasterCard logo on it or is it just for purchases and that store\nIt looks like it's just for purchases in the store\nThere is no real advantage to you having that if you have you have sufficient credit elsewhere abuses MasterCard as American Express discover\nOut oh yeah it's it's less than two percent of my overall credit\nAnd decided that we are I Would dump it just let them just like them kick you the curb\nIn December and be done with them because there's no real advantage to having store credit is looked at in the industry has junk credit right and you're not intending to use it again so let it just walk away\nOkay it it did have a visa and MasterCard logo or 'cause\nThen I went to then I Want you to keep it unless you go to keep it\nHow do some purchase somewhere or whatever you know five dollar purchase somewhere just something that takes it from being an active to an active card\nPoker then then it stays as active and part of your overall credit mix but when it is just a way that I think is referred to as a model wind where it's just for that particular store right those you don't want to have\nAll right well that sounds great I sure do appreciate you taking me on the call and I've been a big fan for years think very much\nFor your kind to say that thank you so much\nAll right well that sounds great I sure do appreciate you taking me on the goal and I've been a big fan for years like ... or\n... year kind to say that thank you so much you're listening to the
