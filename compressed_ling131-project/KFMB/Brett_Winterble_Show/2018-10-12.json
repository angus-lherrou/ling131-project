you doing man and doing great how are you good good to talk with you are so rich that we had you on I saw this in the voice of San Diego\nAnd I was I was like yes to every centered that read where you're browsing yes bass and this and is now the headline\nIs it's time to put roads over transit Richard I'll start with the why why is the time to put roads over transit\nBecause for far too long miles we've been putting transit above roads and highways um for all of your listeners out there that are stuck in traffic right now I don't want to make an even\nMore frustrated and they currently are\nBut the reality of situation is that ... percent of all of our local transportation dollars are going to train of it and yet transit only moved three and a half percent of all commuters\nHurt the highways are only Thirteen percent of local transportation and finding and of course a move everyone else I told her that here's disparity of funding for the reason your listeners are topic right now is because transit has given priority over highways\nAnd I read this and we talk about it here in my first thought is well we live in California it's gotta be some global climate change we feel better let's pat ourselves on the back let's take the Charlie though myself I I don't want to speak for you Richard but I haven't taken the Charlie I think maybe once in my whole life so why is that the the we allocate the money like that\n[noise] you know that that's the question it's a combination of factors I'm to be on a lot of it comes down to eight the feel good here there is is a great article in the the fat tire a paper the onion headline was Ninety five percent of voters approved transit or someone else [laughter] you know I think\nAll of us are all of us appreciate the the goal of transit which has to get cars off the road and to um help improve the environment but when you actually compare what trends that haven't been able to accomplish over the past Twenty years\nRidership is actually down so as any of the county's population has increased as we report and more money into transit projects and further subsidized transit fares\nRidership is actually down meanwhile condition is up so trends that hasn't been able to accomplish the goals are that were originally ...\nIt's so funny that you know roads have been around for a long time and it's just the traditional thing it's roads and I feel like as a society we love doing this oh let's find something more innovative and I guess that idea is nice let's try and always think you have to think ahead but sometimes it's just kind of the tried and true thing of hey\nIf it's a it's working let's keep improving it and let's go from there\n[laughter] well that's a that's a really good point about well what does the future of transportation and look like\nIs the future of transportation\nLarge empty buses and trolleys traveling along fix route\nOr is the future of transportation autonomous vehicles that are traveling in both along efficient route possible as determined by the writers in the vehicle [noise] um you know I've asked my or numbers this are you willing to bet your own money against Hoover and lift and ill on life and Jeff Bezos for Amazon\nUm if you're not willing to take your own money to bet against those parties\nAnd why we continue to use taxpayer money to double down on transit the future transportation is going to be autonomous vehicles and other vehicles will need a growth highway\nYeah and it's so frustrating it's seem so backwards it's going on no Richard I was\nThinking you know I was saying that I've been involved in politics really paying attention for less for three four years here at the station and\nOne of the biggest things that the frustration whether it has to do with

communicate with may have been relatively supportive overall\nThe students that were protesting you know these students personally\n[noise] um I don't know them well frankly um they are um part of and they don't come from any one specific program within the school they're part of an organization that cuts across the school um swimming in our lives\nAnd that seems to be the um the core of the protest\nI have attempted to reach out to communicate with them individually but um they're they're having none of that\nThey absolutely don't want to communicate me about differences in our opinions and I'm sort of I don't I don't have a means to try to resolve those differences with them\n[laughter] it's not even you didn't really I mean you read the quote right there there wasn't really an opinion\nOn accusers sometimes light that's not an opinion that's a fact of her as an empirical\nFact there's no I I wanted [noise] it's a I think uncontested Lee true and shouldn't really be controversial yet somehow it was\nAnd weirdly it was controversial to the dean of the price school [noise] um he's referred to that that comment as alternately um incendiary insensitive um hurtful inappropriate\nUh he indicated that he thought it was inconsistent with the price schools statement of values and I really have no idea why I mean I I'm a ... that's the deep mystery here to me\nWell that's what I was gonna say before ah I I was ... knew you were going to join us on the show here Jim is I was not going to put the blame on the students necessarily because from what I've heard and you can correct me if I'm wrong we've heard these crazy stories of the students\nAre in you know they've got their their social justice for your hands on and they just want outrage and they want to do it where I was most upset when I heard the story was the faculty was the dean was people saying okay that's great but guys this is a total factual statement this this gentleman just said we're not going to do anything about it and here's why bling bling bling\nBut it didn't seem like you had the backing behind you at least the supporters at least from the deans perspective\nI did not um I and it's it's a difficult for me to be really put out with the students [noise]\nUm I'm a ... I'm sixty years old and I'm a different person than I was when I was a twenty something\nMy values are a little different my judgment as a little bit better and I don't think they've handled as well but ultimately they do pay my salary so um I Can't help but have a warm spot in my heart for them even when they are um even when they are this deeply an error frankly [noise]\nUh the dean though um I obviously the dean doesn't seem much common ground with me um I I there are ... I have colleagues\nIn the school who some of whom are more libertarian and market oriented uh we're in the minority and I have colleagues in the school who have an agenda that I Would say if I speak euphemistic Lee is much more progressive\n[laughter] um the dean is certainly I'm On that list and I think that uh he must have deep philosophical differences with me that bubbled over in his evaluation of this exchange with the students but it didn't help it I'm sure it in ... I think [noise]\nUm inflamed matters a bit I think that uh\nBut it didn't help it I'm sure\nIt in ... I think [noise] ... inflamed matters a bit I think that um they felt that they clearly had the deans backing if they wanted to intensify their um statements of of anger or protest about this [noise]\nAnd so it it feels a little bit engineered frankly I'm icy and this is not something I ascribe to the university as a whole you know there is a big place lots of different moving parts\nOf clearly I have upset this man and so [noise] um I I think he must have been upset for some time and I think that he for whatever reason used the circumstance as a way of organizing\nHum or in inducing students to ah to organize this protest and I I'm taken aback um if we've got a chance to reconcile going forward maybe [noise] compare the note compare notes close the loop uh see if there isn't some common ground out there I'd certainly exercise would\nSurely he's he's made it pretty clear where he stands on\nJune more a up and us Jim what is it like in in speak onto it however you want here but we often hear about\nHow [noise] the the the campuses have gotten and we've talk we talk with Jordan Peterson we've talked to all sorts of folks just the political correctness is ruining not just society but certainly college campuses have you seen that or is this literally the first time you've been maybe I I Know you're really a part of this but it is really the first time you've seen that\n[noise] uh no I've seen it growing incrementally um I Lived\nFor twenty five years in a student residence hall and so I was watching the ... as a culture transition fairly incrementally over that time [noise]\nUm I our division of student affairs changed quite a bit during that period attended professional lives\nA hired a lot of graduates from schools of education those folks to point of view rather different from me I was I was very skeptical of identity politics remain very skeptical and there are faculty who share that skepticism\nOf they tend to be embedded in places like schools with engineering or schools or business departments of economics\nBut much of the rest of the applied social science and humanities faculties have moved [noise]\nI'm fairly I'll just go ahead and say just fairly a distinctly to the left and that includes embracing political correctness and it includes identity politics\nAnd it's made the University of much tens her place it's made a people with the minority viewpoint that is my viewpoint identity politics are bad [noise]\nUh I'm In a mate tomatoes I think a little bit defensive and um [noise] unlikely to speak up and circumstances when we might otherwise have a discussion about these sorts of important topics\nAre just seemed to me that the confluence of events associated with the ... the hearings gave me a chance to grab the students' attention and say something to them that I thought would help them in their lives [noise] um and I don't regret doing it but it's clear to me that it's expensive\nTo do it just about at any university you could name in the U.S right now [noise]\nAh I don't like saying that I don't mean to imply that I don't like life here at USC or I don't think you will see is a fine institution I think it's a wonderful institution if you gave me my choice of places to work\nUm I Would pick USC over Stanford or Berkeley er Cal Tech or any of California's other leading institutions maybe not UCSD I could\nHang gliding class has the um\n[noise] that would be that would be a a a competitive option but um USC is a great place to work and\nUm you know I Can't really bring my hands about the fact that the culture is changing in ways I don't like that it affects my large important institution it's just going to happen all I can really do is choose to try to be part of the process and contribute as careful and constructive way I can\nSure sure um gym so is it is it I Know we're talking about an event that happened so are you just there's no hearing there is nothing coming up you're just going about your job day to day normal\nThat is correct I've had a few folks away and an ask do you have any sense that there's another issue out there waiting to drop [noise] um I I Would be great for the university or to reach out and say something to me about this\nPerhaps they're waiting for me I don't know but [noise] pardon me um our provost has been a proponent of free speech [noise] um the campus had been Shapiro on campus recently that is a university had been ship her on campus recently and [noise]\nUm this there was a student controversy about whether or not he should be here but the position of the university and this was an unseated by a vice president for student affairs is that open discourse is the way to go and if you disagree with Ben Shapiro or think about why and take an opportunity to try to explain it on ...\nSo um I don't I I think you will see some sort of place where they we continue to prioritize free exchange of ideas in general and that's that's true at at the top levels of leadership here\nA little bit less true in the dean's office when the price school public policy\nBut uh fortunately the university is bigger than this one school\nSure well Jim I appreciate you coming on a so often when\nA folks not not just in the college ranks but just folks have a a controversy surrounding like this and they kind of have to go into that shell because lawyers because of this because of that and I appreciate you just coming on speaking about this and for speaking the truth or do these students so I appreciate it keep keep up the good fight\nIt's daylight only helps\n[laughter] things get more right there professor at you and the dust that is\nAnd it's frustrating I think we're going to come back I got some thoughts on that would love to hear

it's basically it's we're seeing the Duke lacrosse in the capital here yes the entire nation on TV\nThe TV um was basically the jury on the Duke lacrosse yes\nA case except sped up over thirty days twenty four seven to write for and\nUm you know there were there was a tremendous injustice then everybody can see that it's an injustice it runs completely contrary to what the progressive the

even getting into that everybody\nKnows that at some point in their lives somebody could misinterpret something that they've done\n[noise] [noise] okay you're right you're right about that and at the top of the next hour I'm going to get into this in greater detail on this idea that to me I see a distinct turn that that the people in the press or attempting to undertake\nAnd what they're trying to do is they're not content to want to defeat conservatives or Republicans or the other side or whatever it is they have a much more nefarious intent\nAnd so I I I think your theory is is is terrific bought me I think you I think you've got a great theory and I totally agree with what you're saying but I think it's even deeper than that\nBecause it's about more than politics\nThink about the think about some of the narrative you've heard over the last month and a half\nIt's all oriented towards either punishment or harm or physical harm they're\nNot content to win an argument they want to do lasting damage to the people that they target\nRight they want to shame administration officials to go to restaurants they want to run Ted Cruz and his wife out of a restaurant they want to physically threatened or Sarah Sanders they want to shoot twenty five members of the Congress and this is not about winning an argument or vanquished ... this is about doing lasting down this is about flavoring your opponent\nAnd leaving the scars on their back\nAnd I got a great evidence for this straight ahead at the top of the hour so stick around for that point for the call\nBill Cassidy is a senator from Louisiana\nHe's a great guy uh he he's a Republican he's also a medical doctor and one of the interesting things about Bill Cassidy is when he's not working in the United States Senate he does surgeries pro bono in Washington DC at the public hospital he's a surgeon\nSo he works all day as a as a senator representing Louisiana and then in his off hours she's scheduled in over at the public hospital in D.C he does surgeries\nAnd in fact his entire career he came up as a surgeon and the public hospitals in New Orleans and around Louisiana so he has a a heart for service in a heart for

starting to see a nasty pattern emerge here where it's Kathy Griffin with they beheaded Donald Trump bloody stumps jihad right you have all these sorts of things that that that are happening and why are all these things done because they're to execute maximum pressure on the president's personal life and marriage\nReally is what it what it comes down to think about the way Muller is reported to be sort of positioning any kind of prosecution well they're going after of aka the guy to go after Donald junior to go after Eric they're going to go after a Jared roll them all up threatened them with prison really make the president go nuts 'cause you know what\nThat's the objective anybody should have to make the man with a nuclear codes go nuts in the White House\nBut much of this is

speak for her\n[noise] can you tell us how does she feel these days with all these sort of done nearly for going on in the background she believes in her husband she knows her son's truth I don't even think there's a slight suspicion that is true\nThe next day this statement from the first lady's spokesperson I don't believe Mrs Trump has ever discussed or thoughts on anything with Mr Giuliani the only\nTime you have comments have publicly your office was when Rudy Giuliani came out and said your thoughts about Stormy Daniels claims visit she believes in her husband she knows it's not true true

behind closed doors they would have brought him connect search and it's been proven at a rally started to do that and how can I ask you did that one out of print than\nThe other thing that bothered me was the reaction column in the media\nIn college at the media area I I was raised with the notion that it was never supposed to be about people delivering the news and it's turned into how can I make a headline how can I make this\nAbout me and people were piling on with this if you can be more fearful in this moment I was just surfing the channels fans frustrated because it was so much of sanity and that'll office yesterday what do we think happened when you have to reality stars opposite frustrate me with the reaction on the theory and made it more about family and I actually was going on [laughter]\nIt hold on let let's recap what she's upset about she's upset that the president had ... in there she's upset that Kanye went in there she's upset that the media reacted angrily to the fact that Kanye went into it with the president and then she's upset that the broader debate in America is focused on\nThe issue of kind of go into the oval office to meet with the president and she doesn't feel like there was enough substance involved because after all these were to reality stars\nWhat the heck is she talking about ... first of all Abby\nI mean I I get it understand probably not paying close attention probably getting synopsis of the news when you get there to the view 'cause you're busy doing whatever your life is um\nNumber one the president released the woman from prison on the drug charge because ... and Ken came in and lobbied him number two the president hardened Joe Johnson\nA famous boxer accused of rape and posthumously pardon him why 'cause Sylvester Stallone helped lead the cause for that pardon\nThe president's making these decisions like I get it you wanted your daddy to be the president of the United states Jon Huntsman but he was so milk toast and so
