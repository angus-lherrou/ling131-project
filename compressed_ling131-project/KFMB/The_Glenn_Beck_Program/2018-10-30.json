all that you know all that stuff member of the girl that was going on yeah I Do remember I\nI referenced a study that came out from a Swedish university and its\nHead winning the lottery doesn't make you happier\nWhat was it was money does not make you happy but uh it makes you it makes it more satisfied more satisfying\n\nWas editors at rivers was it it doesn't make you satisfy but it makes you have no money really does lead to a more satisfying lot more satisfying life okay and that was a Swedish university and at the time I read it and it felt like something like you would just obviously think like I don't know how you would study that\nI'm not happier but I Am more satisfied\nOkay yeah okay\nSo it seemed like an obvious study [noise] okay so I got another one of these stupid studies that comes out a sweet and I think that they're all fake like I don't know if they're real\nFood I mean I don't know well I don't know what the I mean it's just like a Russia thing is this like Russia misinformation is this like Facebook misinformation\nOkay so here's your study is crazy\nDeclining trust among Americans maybe sending money to the grave sooner new research shows greater levels of trust linked to a longer life\n...\n...\n\nTrust in America is on the decline and it may be preventing many people from living longer lives new study finds people who are more trusting of others tend to have longer life spans than those Myers and suspicion well\nOkay is it that really just another way of saying positive thinking\nHelps you live a better life like don't they always say like and I'm not trying to isolate anybody here but don't they always say things like [noise]\n\nYou know people that go to church live longer like do you have this old people face people who believe in something

Twitter fighting people on Facebook doing all that kinda stuff you're probably not having a happy life for a drug called me to do\nNow see I don't think so I don't think this is my point is if you're a cynical person you're probably not going to live long\nRight\nYeah you're not going to live long if you're a cynical person\nYou're going to probably well I mean what's the word for it die sooner

know why you just said what\nEight hundred seven sixty calf I'm being\nCareful there's got to be a language caution language but Amazon miracle and it ties back to the study right that says look if you have a more trusting personality or your outlook is going to be more positive is going to live longer\nSee what happened to your super negative your whole life and then you flip it and you make it positive how do they quantify that you're gonna live any longer than if you were still negative\nLike is the damage from negative living so much that you can't even do it\nLike ... you can't drive I mean I don't know about you but I learned something very important watching Ferris Steelers day off a ha you cannot put your car and reverse up on jacks and mash the gas and have the diameter go backwards that does not work to make it go to make the dominant going to reverse\nI learned that from watching a movie um so I so I don't know that you can like can you can you undo the free radical damage of the negative thinking\nAnd live longer and what's the metric that you're living longer also what have you really positive your whole life you end up with like a heartbreak or a big let down and then you suddenly flip negative how do you know you die sooner it's like Dennis Leary wants to find about smoking\nHe said they tell you smoking takes ten years off your life but it's not the middle\nTen it's not like ten years in the middle of your life suddenly you go from thirty to forty overnight he says it's the last ten years it's the laying in a diaper in your bag ten years and I and and I looked at that and I said that's a very efficient way of social commentary\nDating because we knew it only takes ten years off your life but which tank and I\nSee what I'm saying it takes just a problem take two or three from every fifth and then why does smoking cigarettes take ten years off your life but if you smoke dope uh-huh\nYou don't care because you're not you're high [noise]

I think it's important for your forties to see what they can do\nTo prevent the next attack anyone says armed guards at many of your senator\nYeah that's that's a reality that unfortunately Jews face around the world if you go to London and it said God you are more likely than not to see actually a policeman or police car outside same thing in Paris same thing in Brussels and other places around the world that you don't want to see that happen in America I Do think that on high holidays\nWell Shawn and you'll keep port many synagogues you do have a local law enforcement authorities at least since nine eleven\nBut this was just choose going about their business praying\nAnd in a synagogue on a on a Saturday morning and to think that every single synagogue in America needs that type of protection protection is\nIt's sad but unfortunately at least for the foreseeable future it might it might be necessary not only to protect the population a but to give them a sense of security one thing that's important is for political leaders to speak out very very strongly against that I was very pleased to hear\nFrom President Trump I thought he had\nYou know what the strongest combinations frankly I have ever heard I've never heard of non Israeli non Jewish leader say those are those who try to destroy the Jews we will destroy them I've never heard that from any leader\nAnd not only was it that that uh did was I heartened to hear the president of United States say that but I was heartened to hear the appalls he got from the people who were at that rally in Illinois when he fit that\nUh and it's important for people on the right to spit out the extremists among them to David Dukes it's important for people on the left to spit out the extremist like Louis Farrakhan and others and to say that there's no place for this type of hatred in the United states\nPlano mainstream conservatives of never consider themselves for writer embrace David do we repudiate people like that but we do have a growing bbs movement in this country it's growing in our college campuses quite frankly it's growing in the left and there's haters everywhere every breed of every stripe and so forth and so on\nBut in some ways it's getting more and more mainstream the the UN is rabidly anti Semitic the bbs movement which is in mainstream did many with many corporations and many organizations and political organizations in Europe and even some of it in the United states\nThis again this is this is intended as an anti Semitic anti ... anti Israel movement do you see this growing to\nNo question about it I mean for many years to the un has been ground zero France Semitism and holding Israel up to standard holds no other nation on earth when you have you know two thirds of the John we've simply general assembly U.N General assembly resolutions against Israel\nThat's got to tell you something when you have more resolutions passed against Israel and the un human rights council that all the countries of the world combined\nUm that's got to tell you something and this is a deep problem\nThought it was a thing of the past it's\nNot a it's a very serious and it's growing and that's why it's so important you know there is a an old saying that you know it starts with the Jews but it never ends with ... we have always been seen as the canary of the ... in the coal mine of in a civilization so when you have those noxious fumes that are directed at the Jews\nUm it's not going to end there it's going to spread and that's why it's very important for people to frankly mark put politics aside and stand together whether you're on the right a conservative or liberal whether you're a Republican or Democrat\nAnd and say no to this kind of hate and and the lead by showing that this type of bigotry this type of hatred will have no sanctions and the United states of America\nYou know I agree completely with putting politics aside but I've been watching as I'm sure you have in the United states\nOur media and its politics first second and third it's politics morning noon and night it's politics is Trump responds to this is Trump is a Trump this is Trump this\nAnd this killer this mass murder this this Jew hater he hated Trump he didn't like Trump decided to many Jews around now you have in President Donald Trump made my view the the greatest supporter of Israel but any American president\nHe's knowledge that Jerusalem is the capital the president did that before he's moved our embassy to Jerusalem they promised they never did it before he took this Iran deal which was passed by Congress\nAnd the prior administration which gave tens of billions of dollars to the terrorists regime which has the United states and Israel and its sights he said no more to that\nI mean from my perspective as an American as a conservative who's who's been watching this stuff for a long long time this president has been the best friend of the Jewish state certainly during my lifetime\n[noise] yeah I mean I I I've said this before or we've never had a strong supporter of Israel with President Trump a and frankly it hasn't even been close\nIn terms of what he's done I mean you look at some of those things that he's gone you have a Nikki Haley ambassador Haley at the un pushing back against all this anti Israel sentiment obviously the decision to drop some in the case of Iran Iran all those anti Semitic regime and the planet they call for the annihilation of one and only two states have you have his ...\nOr ... that actually one of his bowl as leaders that a few years ago that he hoped all the games will come to Israel so we can wipe them out there so the president of the United states but up to the entire world and withdrew from the nuclear deal with Iran has storage tank tens and against Iran and\nIn doing so he is start this anti Semitic terrorist regime of hundreds of billions of dollars that would be used [noise]\nTo to kill and promoter uh Israelis are and and all sorts of putting all of our Arab neighbors and everything else one good thing that came out of that that nuclear deal it's bought Israel or in the Arab world closer together but listen we we've created very much in a very grateful for that support in like\nAnd the Arab world closer together but we we appreciate very much in a very grateful for that support it like I said I'm very grateful uh that the president forcefully a condemned\nOr the anti Semitic attack I think it is very very important I think people think it all of these things happen\n[noise] ah because of President Trump's election they're just getting themselves they don't understand the history of anti Semitism it's not only the world's longest hatred all this sacred it's the most malleable hatred I mean Jews are are\nHave been attacked and for being a capital for being a communist for being at the biggest stars for being the biggest hawks for being called for being called you know ethnic separatists\nHaters can always find a reason to hate inside it's been going on for a long time and I hope one positive thing that can come out of this horrific acts Cape stand together aghast at the Senate says President Trump is not the reason why you have a record\nAnd Europe or the head of the British Labour Party and anti Semite if not the reason why you have all these attacks and a half for many years and Europe against to unfortunately this thing is [noise] come here to the United states and ... and is now eleven uh worshipers and ... hill a Pittsburgh but\nIf anything can come out of it hopefully people can stand together and put politics aside understand that there are people who were anti Semite on all sides and people should stand together against his and call out the anti Semite on the side of the political ...\nNot just calling it when it's on the other side the calling it on your own side whether it's David Duke whether it was fair con wherever it comes out of college campus with people trying to think about Israel and fame and demonize Israel and make all these ... charges that Israel's in a park type state of racist state a perpetrator of tennis star\nWhich I think there's a lot of people put a level of hatred towards Israel to kick out the of any other country this demonization wherever it is people have to stand up to it and I think in protecting the Quds I think they're going to be protecting ever\nAlright invest in Iran drummer of Israel we appreciate your time God Bless them thank you sir thank you [noise]\nHe's really good ...

grandchildren\nDoes our lives\nAnd I remember the anti semi choose to lie a lot to ladies and gentlemen the nationalist in your piece to lie a lot to use to pedal stuff like this\nJennifer Rubin a Joe Scarborough enjoy rejoin read there's a last ditch amazing she's ... or ... somebody named Julia Ioffe from GQ magazine on CNN John Heilemann MSMBC\nAll of these people should be banished from the media see they support the free press\nAs long as that doesn't include Fox songs that doesn't include conservative talk radio as long as it doesn't include the Washington Times the Washington Examiner and investors business daily and a handful of others\nChildren for a free press as long as it to them\nThey're really not for free press [noise] they're not even for a constitutional republic you and I wore for free press corps for free speech so here's the president basically called an anti Semite and not see it all the rest and when he pushes back [noise]\nIt's his fault [noise] all of this on top of this horrific mass murder in Pittsburgh ... the media's focus Trump\nDo you remember when comedy was great it\nPolitical wasn't profane and it wasn't worried about hurting someone's feelings well after being gone for far too long great comedy is back saying see our TVs may comedy great again chore\nThat's because of Obamacare it's because of Claire McCaskill she won't support any plan that isn't Obamacare because she's a she's a big government liberal\n[noise] now she going on about Medicare for all or is she duct that one\nWell see if she tries to duck because he says he's open to it you know she's open to of course we all know that that\nWhere this is headed and we all know that that that she'll never vote against her party I mean she never does on ... any major issue an issue of consequences and you know my worry is look they cut seven hundred and sixty billion dollars out of Medicare in order to pay for Obamacare\nImagined what they'll do to pay for their government run health care scheme so you know it it is just a ... it will devastate folks who are or who have paid into the system that will devastate families who are just barely making it now and and trying to get a hold of private insurance and that this is part of the radical Democrat agenda Claire McCaskill's on board\nWith that you make a good point Medicare for all his Medicare for nobody because they have to abolish Medicare they have to ... every employer based private plan that's abolished all private insurance then basically turn us into one ... right\nExactly exactly and you know the fact is Senator McCaskill has voted all ready to cut that seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars out of Medicare that's money that goes to hospitals money that goes to home health services money that was supposed to go to hospice they cut all of that\nTo pay for Obamacare which of course is driven prices up through the ceiling here\nAnd now they now they want to cut further and that and take it all away and it's just part of their plan they all just like they want to throw the borders are just like they want to go back to a uh allowing trade cheaters to take away our jobs are this is the wrong agenda for this country and I tell you mark\nAll at stake here in Missouri because this is the race that may well determine control of the seven\n[noise] yeah and she has to see the people in Missouri for a long long time about her actual abuse and she is spending an enormous amount of money on commercial propaganda how's your ground game in Missouri\nGood it's really good I'm Glad you mentioned that we have\nI think it's going to be the best ground game that uh Missouri has seen in decades we've got thousands of volunteers all across the state knocking doors making calls you know Senator McCaskill got caught on tape the other day complaining that they couldn't get any volunteers to staffer field offices well we don't have that problem\nAnd I'm looking forward to uh uh just saying on
