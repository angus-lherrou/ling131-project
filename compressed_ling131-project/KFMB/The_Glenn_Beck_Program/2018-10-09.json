there but it's not going to work they do care there is no appeasing these people that take away number two [noise]\nOf all of a matter of fact it could be much\nOf their budget you know we're far from and give us fully seven seven\nListen to what David ask from Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an unbelievable difference in how I sit at my desk and how much time and\nDisgusting\nBut since they decided to do that ladies and gentlemen the left blue for themselves and opportunity\nAct the law school appearances the accolades the awards you can't very well sit and believe me I'm not suggesting this was a good idea this was discussing what they did to him but you can reasonably assume at this point that sadly Kavanaugh will be probably\nProtested for the rest of his life if Kavanaugh other family is listening at all God Bless you brother for sticking in there and fighting the good fight you have made enormous sacrifices\nAnd I listen I met anybody preacher anything but I I and I hate quotes because people will be she's close when they have nothing good to say themselves but I Can't say this one enough\nBernard ... and the natural you know the the book that they don't mean to a movie ... story\nBut he says you know the half the true happiness has to suffering you know we all live two lives one you learn from in ... and the one do you live after that\nKavanaugh's done with life number one the one he learned from he learned what the left will do that\nNow he's living the life after that and he's figuring out that the path to true happiness and accomplishment is going to be through suffering and sadly folks I mean this from the bottom of my heart sadly cabin on his family are going to suffer the rest of their lives just like Clarence Thomas and his family have suffered for the rest of their life\nThese are sterling individuals' Caesar patriots dedicated parents spouses coaches people who've been through more than you and I can imagine in many cases\nAnd for the rest of their lives are going to have to deal with liberal not jobs saying the most disgusting filthy things to them and their families\nBut they blew an opportunity because now Brett Kavanaugh's in life number two\nHe's learned a lot from that first life he's probably learned a lot from the last days of those first lives that end on that ah that ended on Saturday and life is now over he's now justice cabinet and he's going to have to deal with the left for the rest of his life\n\nChokes me up a bit sometimes thinking about it so good man so good man a decent human being the people I Know and I trust you know I worked in the Bush White House I did not know Brett Kavanaugh personally I I make a ... that make no assertions otherwise but I Know people who did\nYeah good\nAnd the people I Know who knew him I trust trust with my my car my kids my house\nAnything they swear by this man swear by this man\nWhat happened to him was an intergalactic embarrassment above highest order it was a cosmic imbalance of grotesque proportions\nBut they blew that and now Brett Kavanaugh is in life number two\nWhere he understands what he was dealing with in what's been put behind them those stores unfortunately are now largely closed for him\nBut what's ahead of them is justice freedom liberty\nAnd his seat on the Supreme Court bench to fight for those causes embodied in the constitution\nAll right let me take a call heroin I usually don't take calls on the first hour but because I always open the phones to uh people on the other side of the aisle to get their opinion and if you want to get his colleagues have seven three one three and one one I'm pleased to liberals conservatives whatever I take 'em all\nLet's go to Carl in New Jersey Carl what are you got for us\nHow are you a thank you for taking my call You're welcome and\nUh I I think it went on and on about Mr cabinet judge Kavanaugh I listen to the hearing before\nAll this stuff broke loose and I and many of my liberal friends educated all agree that he's perfectly fine to be on the court\n... stuff was nonsense and people don't really listen to you know you don't look at how they're going to vote one way or another you're not supposed to say another dumb lost something where the Republicans gained something the country again someone who could be impartial that being said I wanted to check your comment about\nUh your financial future in jeopardy if the liberals are in power sure and history and like I said you're screeners was last time we had a terrible economic downturn it was under a conservative president not\nWho is the conservative president\n... we had a big problem in a recession that we have a bank problem\nAnd yeah but who is the ... a weight on I'm ... I'm confused there was a kid who was the last conservative president Utah I I don't remember one of those George Bush Republican\nWell on par let's say listen I ... I I appreciate your opening and I promise I'll give you the chance to respond to try to be a jerk but\nI don't know if it's that you're a liberal and you don't or you aren't really reading on conservatism I Love George W. Bush I worked for the man I Would have literally given my life for him I was the secret service agent ... I'm not being hyperbolic I mean if that was my job he was a good and decent human being\nGeorge W. Bush was not exactly a conservative president okay the spending levels of the government spending was out of control we had Medicare part D I like George W. Bush there were some great things that happened the tax cuts package but I think\nIn ... he was a conservative president is a little bit of a stretch so let let me just stop you right he was more of a moderate Republican establishment type I think that's more fair analysis\nThat's like saying that's like me coming out and say and do you have Iraq Obama was a moderate he wasn't he wasn't moderate on any issue at all and I think you know that um so so go back to your your point is that the economy went south of their George W. Bush because of conservatism now\nLet me ask you a question if you don't mind\nWhat but it certainly divider deal whether it be limited government limited government spending limited government intervention the economy caused that recession\nOne word deregulation\nThought how how exactly do you figure that when deregulation or the repeal of Glass Steagall happened under Bill Clinton\nThe bank where all the regulator of ... you're right 'cause I've I've I'm as\nI Know I'm right but but the reason I'm right to follow this number one the deregulation you're mentioning happened under Bill Clinton number one and number two\nTell me the commercial banks that went under because liberal site this talking point often they said was deregulation and it was the splitting of investment banks from commercial banks so I always say to them okay well explained to me what commercial banks want under as a result the recession\nHit ... all the problems with the stock market and the mortgage industry and allowing\nCall no no I I we can't get past the first for me and you have a back and forth\nYou can't just bypass uncomfortable questions you said that it was a conservative president that had the last recession I disputed that it was a Republican president now what I'm trying to suggest you with the recession was not caused by what you said it was caused by and I'd like you'd wake knowledge that the deregulation happened under Clinton that's just the fact\nThat while the last now in the coughing you are right was under Bill Clinton and how it happened for many years before that because what happens is when you have regulations right what\nHappens is the the ensuing administration left and right who were bought and paid for by special interests over the decades years in\nDebt yeah but but the Carl your point you're making isn't even true I'm asking you if the deregulation\nThat commercial bank these these these scare some of the commercial and the ... joining of the commercial investment banks was the cause of the recession then what commercial banks there should be some evidence that a number of commercial banks went under the answer is you you can't answer because there there there's no answer to it\nSo I listen I Can't go on to all day because it's it's a wonky topic I'm going for the audience to that I'm just trying to make the point I appreciate your call though don't hang of it I I think you're a reasonable guy\nI just wish that whereas I can criticize some of the the policies by George W. Bush I thought were wrong\nI Wish you'd open your eyes to you can't just throw out something like oh deregulation that Bush was terrible and then not follow up at all and present any facts and data that's totally irresponsible that's not what happens\nIf you see what what happened is under Bush right at the very end the eight year in power this is when everything fell apart just prior to Obama being elected All right\nCarl listen I gotta run\nUp against the break I'm Sorry but listen thanks for the call but sorry folks that's not what happened I could go on about this all day we\nLost because we had we had a cheap money problem we had a bunch of G.
