appearances they had unlimited amount of time listen the parents is not is not going to assuage the left it's just not\nIn so we on the right we have to start to understand there so we constitutional is it's not about I'm a pass to find the media pacify the Democrats don't you understand they want to destroy what we believe in yes\nAnd so we can do twenty five FBI investigations unless there's one where they can hang our hat on it's not going to matter\nThis these are the same people who said the man is guilty it's a job interview and that he ... and ... and that the uh\nUh the due process doesn't apply because it's a job interview does anybody really think that if it looks better if the FBI interview that to others that somehow you'll bring over Chuck Schumer Chuck Schumer is a bomb thrower\nThat's what we're up against wherever against truly diabolical individuals' you're not going to be able to tease them under any circumstances probably right back\nHere's the truth about most home security companies they're like dealing with another bad cable company you spend hours waiting around for technicians hours on the phone to get questions answered and then when you're at your limit you remember\n[noise]\nUh let's go to Scott Omaha Nebraska the grades K O I now go [noise] hey mark I want to thank you for a Bush\n... do you have oh you are blessed with re elected and it's a great pleasure to be able to listen to you every day I Want to make a quick comment and that is a the carnage that these Democrats we'd be on our point thing that that should I'm\nSure hoarded a stew who these people really are when Donald Trump well if you recall this um\nWas told that hey this guy got old timers or this guy's got a match remember that whole conversation that took about two weeks of our time\nAnd none of these guys ever came out and apologize and they had expert after expert on TV telling us how I look at these facial expressions of the president hey look at the way he slurs those words look at the way he carries himself this guy's got problems right\nHere we are to your later I tell you that this guy is a rock star in a genius and and is is bearing these guys were just very very fun to watch but anyhow\nAnd then they carry for who he carries force that doctor that uh he\nSaid that was the one that did all this uh\nInvestigation on itself because tropic forced truck to go through all the medical groups [noise] and from that and this guy gets lifting garbage as well because he came out said they didn't have all that he was very sounded very healthy right right\nAnd what what a blonde joke just is it's maddening as you as you're conveying as well but ah anyhow that's a bunch of people that were working with nobody ever came I Apologize for\nFor saying that Trump was the manager or has all that crazy conviction\nThey're never going to apologize for it because they\nWell just for it because they never well this is a hit and run bunch [noise] hit and run budge now they got these tax returns or from two thousand two thousand one of those fathers taxes somehow they stole all those or somebody stole them and uh the ACLU zone around to help the ACLU is thrown in with the uh\nThe tyrants All right my friend thank you for your call let us continue let's see here uh let us go to Ken Long Beach California eight Seventy the answer go\nYes mark I my question is are there any a a Senate precedents or any rules of the Senate would allow a Dianne Feinstein to be declared a two week we choose herself for many vote because of the\nAlleged involvement\nWith no they would have to have a financial interest or family member I have a financial interest or something like this you know leaking and letters and so forth you know first of all you'd have to prove it so far they haven't proven it although we all know sheer somebody associated with her did it but that's not good enough\nSecondly I assume you would need a majority of the Senate you're not going to get the Three Stooges so be a sideshow\nAnd uh my my next question would be if you could give us a sort of a thumbnail sketch of what a what happened with faith Forman a Supreme Court I mean as far as voting for now ... or ... or a four person sorry\nWell if they vote for the for that means the holding in the circuit court below stance\nOkay and and there's there's there's no such thing as a recess appointment for Supreme Court\nNow there could be\nThat well I mean that would be it could have a recess appointment for court wouldn't last very long which is why they don't do it oh you do as you get a certain senators including Republican senators angry but uh you could do it but the goal here is a lifetime appointment not an appointment for a year or two\nThat just you know hopefully something that would be a phone in their side\nWe need to when you listen we need to we need we need to stop acting like losers and be on the defense here we need to ram this through now worried about recess appointments and recusal and all the rest these people need to be crushed\nAnd so if you really want to do something you call one of the Three Stooges are you'd be polite to them and civil to them and I don't have to be on the air but you should and tell them that this is very very important to you and you're going to be watching what they doing in the case of member ... Collins that you are you take this very very seriously\n[noise] All right my friend thanks for your call Frank Philadelphia, Pennsylvania the great W. P. H. T. go\nMark thanks for taking my call for me I'm I'm very concerned that I don't think so I understand the impact that this Kavanaugh hearings having aren't due process in this country and I and folks should be weaker out great\nBecause if your process is gone then the country's gone you have somebody who who are\nHere's judge Kavanaugh of\nA crime and rather than the burden of proof being on the accuser which is due process the burden of proof is on the acute\nAnd not only that but now the accuser gets to determine what is\nJustified proof he has a calendar well that's not good at all the witnesses say that that he didn't do it or he wasn't there that's not good enough we need an FBI investigation that's not good enough and then he's not even allowed to point to the inconsistencies of the accuser\nFord and all the lie that no no no you're not allowed to talk to her she's she's the victim mark if I can just go around accusing people you know mark you have women while I have a daughter yeah but that's not good enough well but I work with yeah but that's not and now it's up to you to prove to me\nYou don't do process is done and and I don't know Kavanaugh's I mean I Want Kavanaugh to be voted but this is so much bigger than just if Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court this is the country and I don't feel that folks really understand the impact that\nI think a lot too I really do maybe not enough that I think there's a rising tide here and you put it very very beautifully Frank very well put thank you for your call we'll be right back\nWhy are you thinking you're flip flops I Need to buy a used car but I'm kind of scary oh I see\nLike like things are different now now you just log on to the Carlsbad dot com used car express purchase for your car shopping do scary businesses who use carlen now there's nothing scary about political data or express purchase\nYou just fine line from the comfort of your own home and even calculate payments that work within your budget wow that doesn't sound scary at all oh only smiles at Twitter Carlsbad that easy easy my friend\nNow go click you flip flops\n... yourself out of a block ago right now get big savings on used cars or two in Carlsbad where we've been giving all smiles since Nineteen Seventy two news expressed purchase a Twitter Carlsbad dot com today\nYou come with me my shadow was a bit scary when you got a call ... ... no pressure here I'll hold your\n\nHave you been shocked by your recent electric bills compound our solar today and find out if an investment in solar makes sense for you and your family the number one thing that homeowners overlook is the importance of her panel monitoring do not sign a contract without the specific language\nHer panel monitor the word monitoring that's not the ... of different per panel monitor most companies don't want to be held accountable\nThat's why I trust Palmore so they do seven six zero five zero four zero three eight eight or ... or solar dot\nCom learn how ... design and remodeling can transform your outdoor living space with their next seminar secrets of the ideal outdoor living space Saturday morning October twenty of coal six one nine for for one Ninety three hundred or visit trust your home to US DOT com\nWith over Thirty years of experience and located right here in San Diego why would you choose anybody else but Dr ... for your oral health needs call today for consultation six one nine four four zero six three six for\nNow the new reverse mortgage loan can benefit you by calling a rump go or visiting our website today colleagues seven seven seven sixty eleven thirty again eight seven seven seven sixty eleven thirty or online at ...\nHis website pretty theories there when you buy three sixty six ...\nOne of the first to test drive the only redesign Lexus here now with remote Jews from San Diego county ... largest selection of the new Lexus Lexus girls bad dot com today puts Carlsbad I five ... port road car country Carlsbad\nWill be forty groceries\nFor news\nHere at the guy\nSeven six in New York Times\nYou know farm obviously we can't have\nI've never seen the media like the last two point five Russia could never can communism\nAm seven sixty talk\nTo protect yourself from ... to steal personal information email address is Social Security numbers medical card passwords and retailers are being compromised every day you can't stay vulnerable it's why\nI switched to my id care the best in the business my id carried coverage you for the nine types of identity theft providing best in class service and you can sign up at my\nId cared dot com slash mark my id care is taking care of fortune five hundred companies for years but just recently made their protection available to consumers Tom Kelly the c._e._o. is a genius it personal id protection plan start for less than ten bucks a month and only by id care often say money back", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "San Diego", "day": "05"}
