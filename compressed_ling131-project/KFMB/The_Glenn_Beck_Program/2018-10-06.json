starting to wonder aloud right well what are we gonna what are we gonna what are we gonna be onto next what's the next thing that we are going to a or B onto well\nWe're going to be on to the sort of culture war things that are going to happen in the in the coming weeks and months hey let me let me share this one we get let let's go from the chapter of tolerance can we go from the chapter of a left wing tolerance\nIs that of a life is that a man who\nWas captured on camera Sunday\n... vitally leap kicking a female pro life activist lost his job at a Toronto hair salon amid a social media backlash while the victim says she will pursue charges against him now the man an Jordan hunt\nHas been identified as the culprit behind the attack after a video of him spin kicking a woman went viral he deleted all of his social media accounts after the backlash by the way\nIn the video he seen approaching a group of pro life activist and engaging them in a discussion about abortion but so before suddenly kicking an activist and ripping a campaign life where I've been offered jacket and fleeing the scene\nAfter they kick hunter is heard saying I just kicked your phone while others shouts someone to call the cops Marie Claire Bissonnette a twenty seven year old woman that's the woman who was involved in this incident\nIs they use coordinator with the campaign life coalition and has since talked publicly about this ordeal she kicked me in the shoulder my phone went flying Bissonnette told the Toronto Sun I started shouting for someone to call the police before he runs away\nHe goes up to me before he runs away and I had a ribbon on my jacket indicating the leader any toward off my chest she said that they kicked left her with minor pain and that those who saw the incident were in shock\nWhen he began to pose and you can see in the video that he positioned himself for this I guess it didn't register because it's very sudden Bissonnette said\nYou would expect someone to start yelling in a loud voice will be aggressive before they would go and physically assault someone hunters uh Toronto hairstylist was shortly fired thereafter from his job when does identity was revealed\nIt's been brought to our attention that Jordan hunted been caught on camera assaulting an innocent bystander a pro life really we can do what his actions\nAnd he has been let go we believe everyone has a right to an opinion on the right to voice their opinion without fear of physical violence that company posted on Instagram wait and wait a minute don't you love the language of this thing is is phenomenal\nIt's been brought to our attention that Jordan hunters been caught on camera assaulting an innocent bystander at a pro life rally\nOr are the participants guilty at the pro life I really need to know that I Love Canadian because they can slice and dice things in a million different iterations and still try to be ironic but when you were an innocent bystander to ... libre goods for live rally and of course the perpetrators there with the signs you know save the baby's\nA a a life and not her choice those are the perpetrators or some people some some onlookers are watching those are innocent bystanders now if you want to kick someone I imagine you can go\nKick the person with a sign that's offending you but the bystanders don't kick them it's already been established the woman was part of the protest she had a lead or paint on her shirt\nMy gosh I don't think it's acceptable to show any physical violence to anyone who disagrees with your the perpetrators should know that the Toronto cops said the investigation is still ongoing and no arrest has been made but Bissonnette says she's going to press charges after the culprits arrested it's not the first time I've experienced physical aggression from people who disagree with our message\nShowed the newspaper I don't think it's acceptable to show any physical violence to anyone who disagrees with you the perpetrators should know that okay well let me do a deep dive for a second the second\nIf this had been and I don't want to do what about is because people get mad and and they call me and then they go in your country what about as to what about Islam okay\nIf this had been a rally in favor of sharia if this had been a rally\nI'm In favor of the ...\nThat guy would have been arrested immediately because he kicked the woman\nI mean even tempted guy it could go fifty fifty depends on the jurisdiction he kicked a woman in the shoulder and it's not far off to keep someone in the shoulder where where you're missing and you're hitting them in the side of the head or in the draw\nWhat a piece of garbage ... I just I just am done and\n\nI Am just stunned that this is where we are but I'm stunned but not shocked I'm stunned but I'm not shocked justice gusting my gosh it's\nUnbelievable the pro life would do anything we want to you well I mean look the gospels do say they do say they hated me so they will hate you I mean it is a is it pretty clear warning when you're somebody who's I think defending something important and uh\n... it just in the abstract a man is standing on a street a woman standing on a straight the woman is holding a sign in support of people being alive the manner responds by running up to her and kicking her and then are ripping up in a pan off of her shirt\n... what do you think she's on parole for there's my way or the she's on parole for\nI'll bet you it's strong armed robbery or better I'll bet you it is a strong armed robbery or better that you have a her on ... now I Want to know\nWhen the parole board and see I think this needs to start happening when ever a criminal is arrested for violating their parole\nI Believe it ought to be a part of the public record and in the news story a contact email address or number for the person at the parole board in charge of getting her parole\nWell a lot of times Brett as you know under prop forty seven and fifty seven we had a stream on the situation because of the overcrowding or the prisons and jails a lot of times you know it's just a matter of will next man up and then you just get parole\nOkay do you think that Cheryl violate Cheryl of socket and this is an important story because she could have come down here to San Diego she stayed in Stockton and did this but she's going to come to San Diego does that she was gonna start Robin in and and and and the jet dating people\nAre around our town and there's people there's plenty of people I'm sure just like her\nI bet you there are plenty of people who are just like violent Sheryl\nIs about criminals walking the streets she was on parole she's not a first time offender nobody wakes up in their bed and get a cup of coffee maybe have a morning beer I don't know John Dory sour or something like that for a single emerge a day off wrong\nAnd and nobody sits at the kitchen table I'm eating Cheetos saying you know what today today I'm gonna make me some money and unfortunately as I look at my cupboard all I have is a taser and on my chest day\nI have no way to get a job my clothes aren't right for a job interview plus I got that conviction on my record\nI just got to go out and skill some money from some people\nAnd so what happens right that it's what they do but nobody wakes up and does that\nSeat this is about\nPersonal responsibility as much as this is about and violet Cheryl robbing people on the streets of Stockton it's really about personal responsibility because you know when you see people\nWho are college here league in an altered state and I don't mean for mental illness I mean they are they they are college yearly using heavy copious amounts of drugs or alcohol like I got a guy\nAbout uh two miles from my house and he's always out on the on the on the freeway or a by the offering the freeway and he's got a sign and he does this thing right his sign says\nIt says to honest to steal too ugly to prostitute OK and that's kind of\nAside and and people people given money I've also seen another guy in my area who's got a sign that says why lie I Need beer now I\nI respect and I recognize the industry involved in coming up with clever idea you've obviously been able to put some ironic Fox together in your mind I get it I understand it I respect that\nBut I'm Talking about the people that are just a mess\nThe people that have clearly destroyed their lives on heroin or or or whatever drugs are doing methamphetamine\nYou don't wake up one day and just decide that you're going to get involved in in taking heroin or you know today I'm going to finally I've heard so much about it I'm going to go and start doing heroin I got to find a guy who can get me set up with a starter kit\nWith the needle and the spoon and the smoking ad or whatever to nobody wakes up and does that like nobody wakes up and does that\nI have to be a moment at which\nYou start making bad decisions and I'm guessing you transition into bad decisions and I'm guessing that violate Sheryl in Stockton is about six hundred bad decisions in a life and now she's teasing guys on the side of the street and trying to Rob them with them that you have to separate but\nMy point is there has to be personal responsibility some people should not get parole\nIf you aren't capable of putting together a scheme involving a machete and a taser pretending to ask for help and then you try to round the guy and use ... three times that somebody who should never really get Pearl\nNever get for all that you should absolutely never ever ever get for all should be locked up and that's it and do your time and when you come out will figure out another reason to keep you still in jail because you're obviously an evil person\nYou know you're you're you're obviously a ... an evil person who's got problems and there are probably the problem is I cannot be solved out on the streets of Stockton or San Diego\nOr any other place [noise]\nThe single greatest sand in our society\nIs is that we have lost the ability to be self responsible\nAnd it sounds like such a cliche now these kids today are just nobody is responsible but nobody's responsible anymore there's no more\nPride in Europe parents there's no more pride in a job well done and there's no there's no more friday that unless of course and I'm going to say something really an ... up the politically incorrect and you can call them and you could blow me up okay we just sent me an email you could blow me out you know where are you still see pride\nPeople who immigrate to the United states to work and build better lives consistently\nThose are the people where you see pride of all of a hard of a hard job done well ... and in maintaining what you have\nBecause if you've got the industry at home at the same time I use the word industry and the segment but if you've got the industry third time ah to to to be in some other country and fill out the paperwork and save your money and do the things the right way to come into the United states as illegal immigrant\nAnd yes there are people who have plenty of pride is illegal immigrants I get it because these are people who are coming into the country breaking into the country it'll work but\nSelf reliance self respect and pride goes a long way to saving you from being an idiot on a corner tasting robbing people with uh my check day it's acceptable self respect\nAn awareness of the world all of that stuff all that stuff is vitally important now we've got a problem because we're living in the hour of me too and uh do you know what comes up next\nStick around I'm going to share it with you

case\nBuildings I Am very much based on information on the arguments the information that provide you my opinions all based on information and one of the things I've been tracking from the word go the day after Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the United States Supreme court\nGallup has always tracked on Supreme Court nominees and you you may be a big whatever about Gallup but regardless of what you think of their polling it's instructive because if they do it every single day ongoing you can use a baseline to get a temperature ... temperature jak of public opinion on any given issue in this case\nOur use of Brett Kavanaugh\nOh what was interesting and the very first polling done\nOn Brett Kavanaugh after his nomination but President Trump we had four percent more Americans say that he should be confirmed in case of that the baseline that's where we started now after we had the first year\nAnd we had twenty senators on the Senate Judiciary committee and Spartacus do what they did coming out that\nFour percent more Americans thought that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed and not in other words despite the fact that a couple of months went by despite the fact that they uh you know what else for to kiss on them\nIt didn't change public opinion at all not at all now is interesting because as consistent as that was we did see with Christine for delegations a bit of a shift\nAs a Thursday morning yesterday but a week ago the morning of the hearing we did see public sentiment according to Gallup shift into negative territory and Brett Kavanaugh\nWe saw what was that image shift to three percent more people believing that he should not be confirmed then should be getting prior to the testimony alright that's after everything that the media and the politicians did to Brett Kavanaugh\nWhere are we today that's kind of interesting by a forty six to forty five Martian Americans believe that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed\nNow they're too soon to be learned in this entire process on this information to first as public opinion despite all the emotions all the emotions the old uh nonsense sport it gets to Christine for two gang raping whatever\nPublic opinion only shifted by seven percent seven percent top to bottom that set in terms of the opinion about that\nNow what's instructive inside of that seven percent we bounce back to pretty much where this country is one of the things I find fascinating is when we actually do have representatives in this country\nIs that us and in this particular case the United States Senate is doing pretty much what the American people want to have happen near by a slim margin Brett Kavanaugh\nEnded up receiving the necessary votes to advance the final vote tomorrow and we'll end up becoming the next Supreme Court justice on a narrow vote just as the American people wanted it so that part I think is it's like a graphically interesting\nThe next facet of this conversation is where to focus your energy\nBecause how many people are really persuadable politically one of the most common questions I ever receive has to do with persuading people politically how do you do it\nWell the easiest way to tell you how not to do it who is it that you are most likely to engage politically\nProbably the loudest people in your life that oppose you right how's that work out for you and let me ask you for the angry leftist but you argue politics with you ever get anywhere you just get angry\n[noise] do you think they're one of the folks as part of the seven percent there was ever persuadable in the first place [noise] so I Know we wish that we could change their minds especially if they are in our lives and our universe wants to be open minded first\nComing up next to talk about that in how to be persuasive and who can be persuaded and how not to bend your head against the wall and just become really unhappy I Am Brian my\nThe great one more glued to\nListen to what David ask from Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an unbelievable difference in how I sit at my desk\nAnd how much time and I have throughout the day and I was able to get a lot more work done David's absolutely right I truly love my ... and I know you will to trust me why don't you feel how much support the ex chair provides\nAnd then they come out and the economy's terrible\nAnd they weren't able to get a opportunity and so it made sense to them yeah\nYou know what capitalism this economy doesn't work we need change you know Obama probably made sense because hey that was what our teachers told us in here we are and things are working\nThey had never seen a good economy never seen a good economy we finally have it right now is one of the most important window of time\nWe have two really good opportunities to reach people\nEspecially younger adults that now do have opportunities three point seven percent unemployment are you kidding me right they're getting the wage growth the bonuses it's all happening and it's important to tell them how we got here\nAnd then it's also important in the cabinet situation\nTo articulate what's on the line here hey if somebody that you didn't even know came out and accused you of the sexual assault may not be awful right\nYeah it'd be pretty bad right I mean that's what happened here and and go through information only rather than just the emotions of yeah you know Kevin Oh anyway just a little food for thought let's go to Archie in Ventura, California Archie go\nRight and it's it's good to hear about your ah your history and and your experience so that tells me why work what attracts you to do is show\nThe three of you and I wanted to say that uh I live in very carefully to the uh [noise] there was a a a a colon senator Collins is a [noise] a dissertation about what happened and even though I'm a Democrat and I'm In California I was a quite impressed by it\nShe laid it out very precisely he was a very methodical started out a little weak but it went on from there and be able to\nSee what they were ... or do I get all the time she's getting a\nComing to her a conclusion with all the interviews he did and all the meetings he wanted to go I found it very edit flying and informative and uh her stock went up ... percent with me [noise]\nCouldn't agree more I was frankly shocked at just how detailed top to bottom on every single consideration that's part of this process I mean she\nWas on ... ... and point by point by point from the nomination process pointing out how many organizations were going to oppose regardless of who the nominee was that one\nOne of the organizations hadn't even filled in the name and they put out that they were opposing the nominee mentioned that even senators got out ahead to one of them even got out ahead of the name being announced when they were saying that they were opposed all the way through\nPoint by point by point why Christine Ford was not credible in terms of allegations even\nThough she did mention that she believed that ultimately she was likely a sexual assault victims no evidence whatsoever that it was Brett Kavanaugh and her she could have been the top attorney in the country the way that she laid out the details as she found them\nIt was about Fifteen minutes fifty fifty five minutes her speech and I would say that it is a must view if you missed it uh it is definitely worth catching the entire thing it was captivating and again I have never heard a senator deliver a better speech\nNot ever I didn't agree with absolutely everything she said but it was principles it was details it was well thought out and almost everything there was inarguable I just absolutely remarkable Susan Collins\nAnd goes to ... go to Jim Jim in Charlotte welcome to the show\nAnd Brian thanks so it's harder to a pretty much echo what the last caller so to go about my respect and admiration for senator callers I mean it's increased by ... fold after ... ... for about ... minutes after that I knew her vote was going to be a year and I'm a sticker driving down the road that\nYou know the only other thing bigger than what Susan called hosted a today was when the twenty of Maine other Josh what Chamberlain protect that there's a lot of the army Gettysburg little round top costs preserving the union so I really admire her and I'm Glad she did what you did\nWell that's a pretty big moment in history and I I agree that this is one for the history books as well by the way\nA how are the folks in North Carolina do and you guys are making the back\n[noise] [noise] oh yeah the skaters are kind of a rapid and big but a a sort of cold weather gets in on her a picture I think they should be like diminishing a little bit\nHow the folks over in Wilmington Robert Charlotte but uh\nWhen I was in the marine Corp for over ... over ... pretty good they're recovering pretty good but Jacksonville or your real areas there all the water retreated and recover various so I talked to a friend over there ... or ... back hope for slowly but surely that normal\nAnd appreciate your service thank you for listening and sharing your thoughts as well and may God Bless you know the folks there I Lived in Wilmington for a very short time than when I saw what was going on and heard that it was an island a pretty unimaginable so glad that the folks starting to get back together\nAfter the hurricane in North Carolina All right let's go to Jake Jake than California Welcome to the show\nAre hey ah yeah I was a I Would agree with your point about what could have chosen Ford and as far as er allegations that concern but I had a little different take on a not so much to go after her but to ah\nGo after anybody in the future that might think that they could pick people up to putting a\nFalse allegations and not have to pay a price correct\nI think that's the single most important thing and the reason why I'm not willing to just give a past even do Kavanaugh's can clear this thing\nBecause he's always going to have this thing that he's going to have to deal with there's a certain percentage of the population that's not insignificant but it's going to believe the allegations regardless and it's not okay to perjure yourself these are principles and again you know if we're going to deal with the rule of law for going to deal with the premise\nThat should be addressed and we know because of politics we're not going to see the Senate Judiciary committee pursue her for perjury\nConduct investigation that would be necessary to travel down that path\nBut it doesn't mean that it should go unchecked what she did was absolutely wrong because again when you say you I'm One hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted me and you have none of your uh none of your witness a\nWord now the witnesses period that cooperate any of that information I mean that's a problem that's not acceptable in this country appreciate you are you listening in and check and then coming up we'll continue the conversation and also share some of\nMy final thoughts on Brett Kavanaugh on the situation as we get ready for the vote are now under a day away will be approximately five o'clock\nEastern time tomorrow because once again this whole process has been much bigger than brick have

I never said and again I'm a student of history numbers student of information and at the polling age began in the Nineteen thirties\nSo we have information about what we've been interested in what we've been into mid term elections since the late Nineteen thirties right\nNever once not ever as the most important issue to the average voter ... in the United States Supreme court it's come up really high in presidential elections it was the number three issue on election day there were three issue and election day twenty six thing\nNumber one number one right now\nAccording to the Pew Research center Seventy six percent of Americans say that the Supreme Court will be on their mind\nWhen they go to vote however their impassioned do vote now\nWe are still just over a month away from election day\nPeople are fickle things can change Kevin gets confirmed tomorrow maybe the level of priority comes down because it's been taken off the table I guess we can say or maybe if people are still that motivated by because hey we got to have other Supreme Court justices that come up here over the next couple of years right\nThat remains to be saying well we are seeing right now and some of the internal data that's available\nWhat's driving us that's different than ever before you have the Supreme Court mentioned and then it goes to health care OK so after that a which by the way does that change the dynamic at all\nSo we're in this window of time that is different and anytime that politics that people are different the outcomes absolutely at the potential to be too so as we are now just over a month away from election day\nYou take a look at how many elections are out there\nThat could have the outcomes changed by seven percent seven percent\nAnd that is the potential for what could happen if there were a red wave that came out of this right now if you had seven percent that moved because of President Trump because of the economy because\nBecause of the progress or may because they are tired of what's going on in this country because of backlash about Brett Kavanaugh angle wind seven percent\nIn the first hour I mentioned that in this entire cabin off process entire process from the day after he was nominated until today\nSeven percent movement top to bottom in terms of public opinion on whether or not we should confirm Brett Kavanaugh that that is really what we're looking at here those are the people that are persuadable but seven percent\nEncompasses a bunch of elections across this country usually voter enthusiasm is exaggerated because only sixty four percent of eligible adultery even registered to vote in the first place and we take a mid term elections well I mean typically have around forty percent they actually show up to vote\nSo we do tend to often bake a bit too much into butter enthusiasm this and that\nBut it absolutely has the potential in this type of environment to make the difference which is why it's absolutely critical you want to make a difference you get your butt out there and vote but you find those seven percent\nYou use this potential inflection point in American history and you get out there and you're trying to make a difference because we do have a different landscape it's not all they are in the polling and the end the top level numbers that are discussed yet\nBut it has the potential to be and we're a little more than a month away so that is what you're in store for you get out there make a difference if you're inclined unlike those\nAngry people that were a paid and and shouting that Joe mansion kind of winning hearts and minds at least I don't think it's going to winning hearts and minds there is this window of opportunity a moment in time potential inflection point issues that matter more that never met her before in mid term election cycles so what are you going to do with it\nAnd the other way want to give you a heads up on something that uh you've definitely definitely should go ahead and ... on your DVR\nIf you don't already have in life liberty and live in an eastern Fox News channel Sunday night\nTalked about the media and one of my all time the best in the business and your Mollie Hemingway from the federal is going to be one of the guests on the show by celebrities live and\nSunday night cynical like Easter and Fox News channel are coming up we're going to continue this conversation get some of your thoughts as well is this an inflection point I buy mine and for the right one marketed that\nIf you take one Adam of nitrogen and bond with one atom of oxygen boom you're just created nitric oxide a miracle molecule your own body makes that feels your cardiovascular health keeping you vibrant but as we all age our bodies need help generating more natural nitric oxide\nAnd thank you sir [noise] hey I'm I was watching and listening to a center calling speech today and at first I was I was stunned I was amazed I was impressed\nAnd the ... started going to damage control\nAnd I started going wow I mean the American public and importantly to the Democrats the independents are getting angry\nAnd they need to lessen the damage and they do run damage control things less than the damage to the [noise] that's what I saw I think it actually hurts her speech was scripted she did not speak like the\nProtests was written so I don't I don't think that that was genuine I I think that they were really running damage control and trying to you know take the anger directed that they ... and less and [noise]\nYou know where I Can't necessarily get along with that ... the level of detail starting from the very moment\nOr that she depicted what happened at the time of the nomination\n... issue detailed and chronicled at every everything that she thought when a foul and I don't know that she would have\nHad that level of detail if she were just trying to rally here in the eleventh hour to try to save face for the moderates in the Senate\nI got this and what took place today was truly principal and and really was something that she was that series about every step of the way in in ... process including as you pointed out with all her other previous boats so\nI I hear what you're saying but I'm just not in on the conspiracy dog process that Susan Collins it\nWas not on the up and up I I really I got the sense that uh she was in the air and genuine throughout her speech let's go to Raj Raj is encouraging\nIn Virginia Welcome to the show\nTotal paying too much I Do appreciate his very strong emphasis on didn't fiction points\nI Believe the acting fiction point but not tested in the political lady now even the financially you know he didn't have any now [noise] that they changed the culture\nIs increasing and those are all the trends and I'm looking at a strong red\nWave [noise] on the other point to mention to vote on doing more to put up with a tickle system\nIt has to do with what's happening locally in D.C who people know that ... to ... seats [noise]\nOdd to be his right the poor thing party to both have to be the public and [noise] and that's why that's not seat in the D.C called collections or sway important tank you very much for all got to sit for an agency called how to live with you\nI'm guessing the year as big of a dark as I Am are you and analysts\n[laughter] ... have been an engineer or my life\nOkay I had a feeling that it was somebody who was a of a a similar type a thought process anyway I Am not an engineer though not that long shot I game and changes dire effectively just asked my dad about that one [laughter]\nThat that was one of the moments where I ... my background is in financial analysis and business outside of radio I've been doing this Twenty one years love what I Do uh but uh but the ... kind of warfare Lopez that way and what I ended ended up doing is taking Financial Analytics in various different algorithms and in formulas\nAnd figuring out that hey we have history with information we can do a lot of different things uh in in life with them or beyond just the financial markets for example so anyway ah good self ... let's go to Phil Phil is in Vegas welcome to the show\n[noise] good afternoon you have the two things that that I took away from that when I was watching everything this whole whole process with my wife the first thing when we saw the doctor giving her testimony we felt sorry for we really felt that she was emotionally disturbed\nAnd there we thought that was probably a whole plethora of reasons for that you know obviously saw sexual molestation but that one\nBut we felt pity we didn't show anger I have no animus towards the one but I think the biggest takeaway on this was the\nDebauchery that the Democrats ex expose themselves to the process that they would go to to prevent something that was normal\nWithin you know the process of the government and there should be some complaints from these attorneys who were directed to her by Dianne Feinstein who had animus towards President Trump\nAnd hid things from her like her being able to be interviewed in California or wherever she wanted\nThis is the thing that
