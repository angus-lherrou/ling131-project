E. C. D. T. V. but Florence was long term effects actually may not be that bad\nPeople that want to move here are still going to want to move here people are are are buyers are going to be concerned about homes that flooded and areas that my blood in the future they're probably going to have new concerns about a pine trees\nThat sort of thing so we'll we'll have another concern in the mix of the countless concerns that we already deal with\nTotal damage from Florence in North Carolina alone is estimated now more than one point one billion dollars is a seller's market over first American chief economist mark Fleming till CNBC that we are transitioning to a buyer's market especially in certain metro areas\nThe poster child at the moment I think is a market like the San Francisco bay area so I got a high house prices lack of affordability\nUm lack of inventory it's difficult to build their um those are really the challenges that there was a challenge or a stress I think in the housing market today will be our inability to build more housing units to shelter everybody in the United states today\nPlumbing also says he does not think rising mortgage interest rates will have any significant impact on home sales\nWill seems a price marked downs are not limited to your favorite department stores these days many home sellers have been cutting prices to real estate broker dribs and reports that in a four week period ended in mid September more than one out of four of the homes lifted the for sale price comes at least one percent\nRedmond says the price cutting is happening to the highest rate in at least eight years the trend is especially apparent in the western states where the price games have been hottest\nLike this calls that has plenty of me like the smallest issues but with the longer will base their new export model and over three hundred horse power on the gas engine I don't want him to say oh well that's nicer but the dealership doesn't open for two more hours

Carlsbad\nSeven sixty five and be [noise]\nReal estate today connecting you\nWith our special show going global\nAll about the international real estate market and what it means to you\nGoing to continue our index conversation now within international real estate\nThe state expert last hour she talked about bringing foreign buyers do your open house and now\nYou can buy your dream home falling away joining us now is to push a real poor in international film director with the\nYour global agents team at Caldwell banker residential real estate in Sarasota, Florida Patricia thanks for being back with us all unrealistic today absolutely\nSo now let's change the conversation to Americans who want to buy either across the sea or over the border where are we looking for\nA lot of Americans are buying in\nRetirement based or national now outside of our own country\nBut we think people going to Costa Rica to Panama to Mexico those are pretty big over the last ...\nUm we see them going to tax hey that was like the Bahamas and some of the Caribbean or spring but we have ... ... the area that we refer them to ... to ... them\nSo watch that process like Patricia what's the first step\nIt really is on the situation generally if I'm wrong they can't find you know they said no the area I'm not always but I Would say most people you know that worked in an area that friends that have been on holiday on vacation there\nSo they know where they are looking\nFor an eye I talked about well what exactly are you looking forward based in in the eighties or how how long were you going to be living that during the year you want to rent it when you're not using it so you know a lot of people by federal vacation homes and want to work for them while they are using them\nAnd that will help me understand what they're trying to a chain typically I gave a picture that information to life partner in the right location and the funny part is it could be more than one location I had a British dental and recently who wants to find something in Ventura learnt that Buddy Guy\nKnow you want it to look at how long he gets a little bit Costa Rica so we tend to tend to partners in both countries and have you thought they could have done when they find it on common law\nBut he felt confident with the introduction speak if they were so I'll partners in those countries that don't really have to prove themselves as much as they would have done it gets colder freelance\nDo most Americans who buy in foreign countries do they also go all cash by say either taking equity out of their properties here or cashing out stock or something along those lines\nYes they do because it's very hard for Americans to qualify for mortgage and the other color trade but usually they are cash fire but you're right and then the leveraging home equity line yeah or selling and we'll get yeah all that stuff don't spoil to buy it but they would typically be cash by it and the country\nBecause of the exchange rates and how they fluctuate if I put a contract to own a house for one million dollars in another country is it possible by the time I get to closing is going to be one million two hundred thousand\nIt could be one or two hundred thousand that could be eight hundred hours [laughter]\nMy my advice or with it and longer than vote\nWhen you when you buy in a foreign country or in a foreigner by yeah there we just talk shows but they're trying to actually own now in order to fail and cultural property but there's also the currency Trump auction and that way because they're they're very carefully\nSo you need to understand what's happening in your father's car I think part of their heads\nAnd now special companies right now that you can work with to help you with about farming situation ... to\nThe left someone who will educate ear about things that influenced the currency exchange rate it from a key indicator that are going to be published that might have an impact on the exchange and know how your quarter\nHow and when to change your money to that currently\nNo I understand there are companies that will walk in your exchange rate some of the changes you won't get stuck at the settlement table is that real\nNo absolutely it's real and they allow you to located occurrence facts candidate for a period of time\nAnd all I Do I I haven't spent a trade in my own and not look thin actually look in the exchange it for up to yeah\nSo it's something for customers to think about not just when they're buying or selling but also when they're looking at cost of ownership you know when they're paying insurance premiums back home do face at property taxes\nIf they can go into a year or whether they know that oh it's going to achieve a particular currency right back very reassuring for that\nI see in last question for Patricia is one of our listeners wants to buy a house overseas with all your experience what's the number one piece of advice they must know before they go forward with it\nThey use a local county love love love the tiny should not be in any way associated with\nAll introduced by a builder developed from real estate ... all the sound of that property that need to find an independent ... attorney to work with\nGreat advice Patricia and thank you so much\nWell thank you do any sign I can help just let me know\nPatricia tan real chore and international sales director with the your global agency called ... banker residential real estate in Sarasota, Florida\nComing up on real estate today\nWhy they are deeply involved in a global real estate so we're really hoping\nTo raise the bar on real estate of an industry across the globe coming up on our special show going global\nBut first it's time for real knowledge\nSpecial segment on real estate today in which we talked to a real estate professional economists\nJournalist or industry expert and ask them about things you need to know about and right now we've all heard the economy of the United states is chugging along strongly I mean after all the GDP is up\nEmployment is up and we all know the stock market is way up\nAnd that's apparently causing the Federal Reserve to look closely at whether they should continue to raise interest rates if they do and you're in the market to buy a house how can that affect you looked at to professional\nJoining us now is more in the chief economist of the national association of real tours Lawrence welcome to real estate today\nAlways Stephen and as you alluded to a communist one quite terrific guy in terms of GDP Growth in terms of job gangs wages are only rising stock market is still way up there\nStill way up there so there are brought signed up the very positive economic picture a yet home sales because of the limiting inventory is being held back a compared to what it could be\nAnd of course Lawrence for all those positive reasons that the economy is so good the fed is raising interest rates do you think that's going to have any impact on fires in the marketing the months ahead\nWhen the Federal Reserve raises interest rate first we have to understand they are raising short term\nInterest rates and long term most consumers have thirty year fixed rate mortgage so ah the mortgage rate may not move\nDirect relation with what the Federal Reserve maybe you're doing a less or some of the homeowners have the adjustable rate mortgages\nDanica change but fortunately over Ninety percent of Greeks shut homebuyers are taking on those long term thirty year fixed rate mortgage so they would not\nFeel the pain of any rising interest rates but to consumers consumers who are looking to buy a maybe the mortgage rate will inch higher end up for all forecast says\nThat I expect your mortgage rate to be trending higher maybe five percent average in the spring of next year from current four and a half and that is to not only to what the Federal Reserve is doing but the inflation is picking up at higher inflation generally are some means higher interest rate and borrow Matt\nSo we're really hoping to raise the bar on real estate of an industry across the globe which doesn't happen overnight but really folks are going to ensure that we had the quality relationship with the best professionals in place that make sure that those relationships a straw that by Britain will log into the future\nWill call and I got to tell you I think the international scene is so important and I really want to thank you for joining us today and talking about\nAbsolutely it's been my pleasure\nColon

D printed out a little ticket it said attached to the bag of shrimp and Paula manager or and so the manager came over and us but you know what this could possibly be and she said we really don't know we all we looked at the expiration date or wasn't expired didn't expired so next year\nI'm In and I said well you know maybe there was some kind of recall\nA and the manager said you know that that's entirely possible uh but you know at this point we don't know so I've looked since then to see if there was a recall on any kind of frozen shrimp and there had been won in a couple of years um some assumptions is that maybe there is a recall in process and it just hasn't been announced yet but they would not let us buy that bag of shrimp\nBad is fascinating and it's a mystery maybe will unfold over time but that is the kind of thing that's coming is that we will before we can get out of the store\nThere will be items that are still on the shelf that have already been identified as being a risk for whatever reason and before that item could end up at home you watching football and\nSuddenly not feeling so hot 'cause it's not 'cause your team last book because who shrimp or a a like a sack in your life or you got ... for a big big loss anyway you'd never had that happen\nNo and and you know I I think the manager out as I said you know I'm Glad this happen in and I didn't end up exactly where where you're talking about Clark\nWell the good thing is that whatever the issue was the shrimp it didn't happen to you and the fact that we're going to have more and more circumstances where we don't have to worry about as much the safety of the food we eat that's nothing but for the good\nThank you very much and thanks for having Brian's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Brian\nBy cartel you great thank you Brian\nHow can I be around you\nI have a quick and about ... fly home on it and they do and I bought some cows and still\nAre living at home on the Senate and the

television\nAnd I'm finding that sign a contract but there\nIs no way it was no yeah [noise]\nStill be association are you in a mandatory associate and community\nYeah wow\nSo the the board of directors wants to sign a ten year fiber optic agreement would stick\nCurrent and future residents owners with an obligation we'd go\nTill twenty twenty eight or twenty\nTwenty nine so I I Would never do that never what kind of\nPenalty is there if you know the market is changing so fast right now\nI think that like in science\nWhat kind of penalty is there a break penalty or break the\n... the association would have to pay if waiter or the president said the new board says this is a terrible idea we gotta cancel this thing do you know what the break for years or I mean I Do\nNot up to life than\nRight so\nHow far along the border they canvassing homeowners to see how they feel about the\nLaw is um they let it took a look that way I got to go forward with\nPolitically and they thought that all\nPolitical into contact but I Hope that the contract has not been signed a letter and they thought that they are like that and and actually that included though like the fiber optic um they claim that\nWell you know they're they're doing that survey that's not really filled the board\nAnd um it was only five percent of the ... for the day\nOr a way I Will do what I Do fast as you possibly can this is gonna sound so analog but I Would go print up\nAs many yard signs as you can and have people put signs in the yard note of fiber\nAnd and have a citizen uprising\nAnd in my feeling is that there's a good candidate for the bad idea because they'll pull you\nKnow no no no and if Iran on let me tell you something there's not a chance this is a bad idea it's this is a bad idea\nAt a time of rapid technological change\nIt is a major error to enter into a decade long agreement for technology like Internet and TV that is I mean when you look how much things have changed in the last year\nWith all the people cutting the cord across the country that all the experts said would not happen for years and years and years and years and years\nThis is a rotten idea and you need to stir up the membership and get people up in arms before it may be harms people's ability to sell their properties down the road\nRotten idea the sport especially doing a survey and going
