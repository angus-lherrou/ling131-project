they they started to do these pamphlets to get around all of that\nOne of the earliest printers not the earliest but one of them was Benjamin Franklin's brother and then later Benjamin Franklin\nThis whole idea of freedom of the press what do they come from it came from them\nThose white slave owners although Franklin ever owned slaves but you get the point\n\nThat for freedom of the press came from freedom and the press and freedom of speech was synonymous\n\nAnd they were promoting a republic they were promoting individual liberty they were promoting private property rights they were

sentence for this piece on box America has a massive growing racial wealth gap let me ask you a question [noise]\nWhy do people risk their lives to come here because that senses telling\nYou that America is racist and there's not equal opportunity in America that's what that sense it's totally [noise]\nWhy do people of color AKA non whites why are they flooding into America why are they leave in Guatemala and Honduras and Mexico\nIn one country after another in central and South America why are they leaving one country after another on the African continent why they leaving one country after another in Southeast Asia\nEven China why are\nAll these people coming to the United states if there is a massive growing racial wealth gap there is no opportunity for non whites is that it\n\nOne of the problems we have in this country thanks to the left weather in the media or entertainment and elsewhere is a lack of promoting assimilation a lack of promoting assimilation learning English\nLearning American laws learning American practices and bracing American culture I mean after all he came to United States to escape\nThat culture of your birthplace right isn't that what a refugee is isn't that what an illegal alien does otherwise white come to America and America you see is so racist as a country\n\nThat as Brock Obama and Joe Biden used to say by twenty forty four\nWhite people will be in the minority there are so race obsessed with America is so racist white Americans allow that\nBecause America as a country is not racist that's why [noise]\nPeople should be encouraged to embrace capitalism they should be encouraged to embrace entrepreneur shift they should be encouraged to embrace the private sector the profit motive creativity productivity rather than government government government\n\nBecause the vast majority of people do not succeed by getting a government check it destroys them it destroys initiative it destroys independent thinking it destroys the human spirit\nWhich is exactly why the left pushes so let's go back to this story\nAmerica has a massive growing racial wealth gap\nNow for the left of course that means more government more redistribution higher taxes more regulate you know\nIn more and more and more to govern\nGoes on the median white family today holds nearly ten times the wealth of the median black family\n\nSenator Cory Booker is introducing a bill aimed at closing that gap that caught my attention his idea is to give lower income kids kids\nA sizable next day nearly fifty thousand dollars in some cases that they could use for wealth building purchases like a down payment on a house or college tuition\n[noise] did you hear this where are you familiar with this\nThese they call them opportunity accounts they don't call these marches accounts they call them opportunity accounts what theoretically now this is the article this is the news article it doesn't say that it's an opinion piece\n[laughter] nice opportunity accounts with theoretically make sure all children have significant assets when they enter adulthood rather than just those who grow up in wealthier homes\nSounds cool right equality\nIt'll be a dramatic change in our country to have low income people break out of generational poverty bunkers set an interview with box we could rapidly bring security into those families lives and that is really exciting to me\nNow that will never be any discussion of where this money comes from never nobody cares\n\nKind of taxes will have to be increased who cares\nWhat kind of additional debt will have to be accumulate who cares none of it matters\nWe're talking about the quality of results economic equality we're not talking about liberty don't confuse us with liberty do confused as to what markets don't confuse us with opportunity no don't you see\nWe have a racist country\nWe need to take money\nDon't you see we have a racist country we need to take money\nGive it to poor people poor kids up to fifty thousand dollars\nSo they can move into the middle class who say\nThat simple\nWhite and I think of this why didn't anybody think of this these are opportunity accounts after all ladies and gentlemen were coming into the the modern era the modern modern era I guess economics don't matter that does it matter tax rates are irrelevant\nWe need an opportunity account up to fifty thousand dollars a kid\nWhat's the big deal at wall right it free college ... free health care and while we're at it open borders\n\nAnd why were added why don't you

has to figure out as best as he's able to\nWhat's in the best interest of the United states of America and the citizens of the United states of America\nSo he's not going to call a talk show or or get on a cable show or or pop off about about this that and the other and he's here he's been sort of adjusting his message is more information comes off a comes in and as he gets more advice on what to do\nPlus there are things going on in the middle East that he's involved in in his stamps involved in that you and I can't even imagine\nSo what do you want him to do more than let's say the royal families guilty I Know they're guilty or cutting off all relations with them was that make you happy\nNow oh I totally agree on the first part where you said but that last thing that you just set a second ago you're right it's an investigation found my the big point is you know it's not over get the information number one\nAnd then make some decisions right but he keeps defending those guys the Saudi they've got a nice guy either really bad guy they do a lot of bad stuff and why ... why do you get the fan and those guys\n... why does who keep defending those guys despise those guys\nHave either I don't think he's defending those guys I mean again I I've been sort of observing this from afar over the last a period of time since uh since the Turks put out the information that he was murdered\n[noise] don't seem defending those guys if he's defending those guys why did the old man the king step in and take the power back from the sun to try and deal with that situation\nWell you you you know he's already come out several times or he came out with that role ... early on\nThat let's so let's go wrong you know you have no evidence yet okay let me thought for all why are we so focused on this well because it's important it's about truth about honestly it's not that important\nOkay let me tough for all why are we so focused on this well because it's important it's about truth about honestly it's not that important it's a horrible thing that took place a horrible thing that took place but I hate to say this 'cause I Know it will be twisted in four thousand different ways\nBut for the United states it's simply not that important\nI mean giving a hundred and fifty billion dollars to the Iranian regime which killed which was involved in killing thousands of American Soldiers that to me is a big damn deal\n[noise] but you know the media and the lap supported that deal Obama supported that deal\nThat is a terrorist regime that is an enemy of the United states now I'm not making any excuses this man was Florida than a horrific way great\nHorrible horrible horrible horrible but I don't know why are the coverage is is is so massive and neither do you\nI'm just looking for truth period okay and I hear a great man no matter what\nThey say All right thank you sir\nThe truth is the Saudis murder\nThat we know\nAnd do I believe the royal family was involved certainly part of it certainly the crown prince of my I Do have a holiday do this without knowing some of them were his right hand one of them was his right hand ... and I believe one of his intelligence guy senses top forensic guy over there isn't really any doubt about\nThis no there's no doubt about it\nBut we'll wait for the investigation will get all the facts you know [noise]\nSo what do you what the president to do\nHe says that they're going to be some fear that a severe ramifications but he's not cutting off the military\nSo so what else do you want him to do\nI'm quite serious about this I hear that criticism any suggestions what do you want him to do\n\nAnd uh I understand the Washington Post is all worked up about this and so or other media outlets I got I understand it and I understand that people are upset about it I don't like it at all I think it's outrageous I'm no fan of the Saudi regime and I never have been\nBut I'm not talking about any of that talking about the reporting is over the top in the sense that it is nonstop\nAnd there's so many other things going on in this country in the world that at least deserves some attention\n\nDon't know that they'll ever get to the bottom is hopefully they will\n[noise]\nI'll be right back [noise] much\nAll here with us food fabulous the\nHottest fashion show good\nBecause they've got hundreds of
