delighted you're here so Carl how young were you when you bought your first real estate investment\nI was like twenty two and I bought my first one how and what was it you know it was as I said I bought\nA house or the rocks are probably the wrong time but looking back\nYou know it was as I said I bought\n\nA house or the wrong uh probably the wrong time but looking back you know I learned so much about ... just for that very first one that the wealth of knowledge was was well worth it\nInteresting so what did you learn very first property\nI bought was one that I saw was an investor\nWho wasn't willing to pull the trigger and what you'll find is there's a lot of people who want to be the real estate investor will actually have a lot of people who want to look at properties ... best it but only so many pull the trigger so I Try to take those wannabe investors who really are just using my time and leverage that to look at these properties and then by the ones that they should buy\nLike says it does make sense but to give them the first shot\nBy all means I mean the first at a second or third and you know when they walk away and I've had people what I said hey at this point a failure to buy this would you mind if I did it they they care I had one or scare I just don't buy the awesome or they might that might get to go over the edge as an unsettling ... you know I think it was up there to here I think you should do this if if you're not can't\nSo what was it was this a fixer upper\nYeah it was it was a fixture ever that someone else had called me about a client or of course not bad I showed it to them or to buy it so I thought this big it up theory for me the address was nine one one that was ... I should though\n[laughter] slow learner okay so you bought your first investment\nProperty when you were twenty two right now currently you're thirty seven years old so for Fifteen Years you've been investing in real estate how many properties do you have no\nUh I have like sixty one right now so he's sort of\nThing when they won in a while that is awesome Kyle sixty\nOne properties and now let's turn to your client on or you work with a lot of people who invest in real estate summer young summer old is it the same drill for all of them or are there differences between older investors and younger investors\nAre the young folks want to flip to make some money that folks who are a little older I Would say like retirement age they're caused by the along the long term rental the problem is this the person at least ... there's not a lot of good slip and come here and a lot of marching to pledge um the young person actually knows that renter right\nSo I have a twenty five year old or thirty year old investor there's fear that people are hanging with and so they know renters as hell fascinating\nYou know whereas the person who's fifty five or sixty which is fine they're out of the pocket of those people that there is somebody\nThat her grandfather run it with somebody who needs a rental tomorrow and I always try to work backwards and almost every property I bought not all of them but definitely over half of them I have bought the property because I already had the pet it if that makes sense does make sense so 'til they tell me and say hey I Want to write a property and I'm like who I can do your three that I'm interested in what's going on\nYou know kind of that is such a great perspective I never thought about that before [noise] do you have any idea who the youngest investor you've ever worked with is\nI Would say mid twenties for sure that younger than that\nOkay so let's look at the big picture a person in their mid twenties invest in real estate

portfolio that help pay for college or help save for retirement [noise] yeah I bought my first property because\nSomebody told me in my office I should buy property and I hadn't sold them all because I had somebody else tell me I shouldn't\nSell them I should keep them they all say this wish I'd learned ever sold that right I just didn't want to be the person that would say that\nKyle I got to

tour in his early thirties who's been buying investment properties for nearly a decade and essence experience grows he uses that to help his clients so young and old become successful investors themselves\nJoining us now is still a Becker real tour and founder of Becker properties in San Antonio Texas in two thousand for dean Philip perceived to pursue just dirty under thirty award from and they are and among his investment properties use one in the U.S Virgin Islands\nPhillip welcome to real estate today they travel it's David\nAnd among his investment properties is one in the U.S Virgin Islands [laughter] Phillip welcome to real estate today\nThank traveling it's even it's great to be here\nWere divided you're hearing by the way a good choice on where to locate your investment property [laughter]\nNot not a bad place to be beautiful son and Sandy beaches\nExcellent so Philip how old were you when you started investing in real estate\nWell and I bought my first investment property Steven I was twenty four years old wow it was a piece of land outside of San Antonio Texas what I did is I bought the land built a house on it and turned and sold the house and made about eighty thousand dollars profit\nSo fill up you also help your clients invest in real estate does your personal experience really help\nOh yeah absolutely especially with novice investors are people that a lot of people think you have to be cash heavy to get into the investment game and you know when I first started I wasn't my first investment was an owner finance deal when I bought that land with just ... percent down and so\nI help a lot of investors especially being younger myself I'm thirty two now but I was twenty three when I got\nInto real estate in two thousand nine\nAnd I have a lot of younger people that are able to help with investments and it's great to show them how you know things like solar financing and even used responsibly financial products such as hard money loans can really help younger people build their portfolio\nI see no one at twenty or thirty something comes to you and says they want to invest and they have no idea how to do it how you help them\nI think just with every other Clyde it starts with you know a buyer counseling session\nAnd one of the big things I tell my client is don't be afraid to invest outside your market\nYou know even for people that are just getting started especially if there are a little bit low on cash they might not be able to afford their first investment property and the market where they live and that's why\nI mean being involved with you know the national association in committee such as the unprofessional network has helped me grow realtors that I trust throughout the country so a lot of times we send our new or investment clients to other markets where we have a great a referral partner that can help them as well\nSo here's a question of all the young people who you help become real estate investors how do they tend to pay for these places it does\nKind of range across the gamut but it reminds me of one specific young lady that I help she was about twenty four years old when she came to me winds by her first investment property she did not have\nAmazing income but she had a fantastic credit in her case we did do the hard money route we bought the property for about sixty nine thousand dollars\nAll and we were in for a total of eighty seven and she was able to turn that being a for a hundred and twenty seven thousand dollars making of a doubt a thirty thousand dollar profit after closing costs on her first investment which was for her about an extra year salary at that time\nThat is amazing and Philip you just mentioned getting hard money loan which is a private individual or a private group who fund the mortgage without the requirements than a major national bank would have so tell us how do you find a hard money loans\nWhile they're there actually are lots of different hard money lenders and for the audience out there that's not the only way to accumulate properties outside of the traditional financing that it's also portfolio allows but as far as the hard money loans it's really just about networking\nAnd finding other people that have done it we started group called the broker underground and the San Antonio area and it's been a great resource for over two thousand fulltime agents and brokers that share referrals such as hard money individual so we've\nGot an entire list of different people as well as feedback from agents good or bad on how the experience was for the consumer and for the agent working with that hard money lenders so again I think networking is is so key for trying to find these individuals that become your business partners and I can help your clients\nFill a pet is such great information so let me ask you if someone starts investing in real estate in their twenties what's that going to mean to their life and their financial security in the years that\nThey're simply ahead of the game you know there's that old Chinese proverb that says the best day to plant a tree was Twenty years ago and the second best day is now\nWith the people that are older you know what I mean for the people that are older\nIt's not too late but those that got started in investing in their twenties there simply ahead of the game and they're going to be able to stop working for money sooner so that their money can start working for them", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "San Diego", "day": "15"}
