about outsourcing\nOur jobs and just remember the black Democrats will say this about you is what happens when they grow don't read there it is\n[noise] that's what happens when Kanye West's was ripping on George Bush after Hurricane Katrina this guy was brilliant\nSo revolutionary mind of the black community this guy was unbelievable he was he was the love of the Democrats life because he was a powerful black man with a lot of talent who was challenging a white president United States of America who clearly doesn't like black people\nBut now oh now you're just a black dude didn't read\nKanye West's met with Trump in the oval office he also talked about his childhood and when he was growing up now again this is the ... there's that new line is the president is taking it\nTrump in the oval office he also talked about his childhood and when he was growing up now again this is the ... there's the new line is the president is taking advantage of a mentally ill white man\nAnd exporting that black man as a token black man of his racist White House that new line that we've seen come out in the last half hour\nKanye West is a black man that can't paying for himself and and clearly the only reason why it's thing for himself was because he has a mental issue and\nSo then the ... the United states of America is abusing this black man and I guess the Democrats saying we need to bring you back to the plantation to the mental hospital right\nThat's what we got to do\nThat helps you\nThe\nYou know my I I Love and he said that he goes he's talking about how to make America great again how he says my own friends tried to bully me people to come after me they attacked me they threaten me\nAnd in a way it gives me power where the ... of course now that definitely means that he is a negro that that they can't read or doesn't read I guess since it 'cause it's even more insulting if you say the negro that doesn't really tell you what is what happens when they grow don't read there it is yes yes that's what it is\nHe talks about how he explains that he likes wearing the make America great again hats he understands that America should be something we should be proud of that we should say that for the African American job unemployment rates all time was or a good thing that was the last administration was doing was clearly not working\nBut Donald Trump now what a what a terrible person he is exporting this man\nHe is exporting him he is exporting him and he's using him he's a terrible person here it's a disgrace what they're doing one eight seven

doing well sir uh you know it it's a shame because all over the TV today and I'm In Staten Island New York which is you know it's it's I Would say probably about Ninety percent Trump world right here in Staten Island of like the rest of New York is terrible but I'm watching TV\nAnd every place that literally this kid a fishing is on is not on his medicine that it's horrible he's going against the African Americans um he can't get a break uh it's\nJust it's despicable what to do with the guy now because he's a Trump fan and it's it's horrible but these people do it\nThis is this is the public shaming and the assault which is exactly what he's explain what explains so well I mean you you look at the last week you bet to celebrities that have gotten into politics right you had you had Taylor Swift who comes out for a Democrat and says she's terrified of Congress woman running for Senate\nIn Tennessee Marsha Blackburn and it terrifies her what would she what she would do\nIf she got elected to the U.S Senate\nAnd Democrats came out and said this is a brave\nIndependent woman they threw down the woman card right this is this a brave independent woman she's brave she's a role model every woman should've should've should look at her and teach your children\nAnd your little ... daughters and your and your grand kids to be like Taylor Swift because this is what a strong brave role model of a woman looks like then telling you what comes out for Donald Trump and now he's a token negro that doesn't read he's mentally ill he's an Uncle Tom\nTerrible and and and the things that these guys they shave out and it's it's really really bad I mean it's unbelievable it's like they want to put in a they want to institutionalize the guy now you\nKnow they they want to kidnap him and they want to bring it back to the to the plantation of the Democratic party and then lock him up in solitary confinement in their mental ward so they can control the black man because right now they can't\nControl and then when they can't control a black man who's who's speaking truth to the world they'll tell you they'll undermine you and say\nYou're mentally insane [noise]\nYou're mentally insane God Bless you good to talk to you my friend ... filling in for mark who have been a lot more coming up we'll be right back\nEvery time you go on line your Internet provider an advertising companies can track what you do and sell your personal information so how can you protect yourself computer\nThat's what they're saying and don't forget\nNow Taylor Swift the beautiful white woman is a role model and a brave woman because she came out and supported Democrats Kanye West comes out for Trump and he's a token negroes mentally ill Uncle Tom\nWho clearly is being used by the president United States of America\nNot only that you look at and people in Oregon and everything they've done to all the the peaceful Republican rallies their to\nTheir ... they were directing traffic this last week is screaming at why people they didn't take their owners you saw that on TV\nIt's nuts and and my question to the American people is at what point are we going to say enough is enough let's stop this must be done and let's wipe the freaking slate clean\nWell I I'm waiting for the the the Democrats to say the socialist Alexander Cortez\nUm\nWho claimed the electoral college as an institution that has its roots in slavery\nAnd by the way the Democratic party has its roots in slavery so\nI'm just curious are we going to eliminate the Democratic party as well because the Democratic party has its roots in slavery but this is a woman that literally claims electoral college is an institution that we should abolished because it has its roots in slavery just like the party that she's a part of and this is also a woman\nWho came out and said that she is going to be integrated\n[laughter] [laughter] I'm waiting\nFor a Democrat to say this is what happens when you don't read the constitution when you don't understand how the country works and when you don't understand how the world works this is what you look like\nNo\nThank you sir nice to talk to you appreciate the phone call one eight seven seven three one thirty eight eleven let me go to Tony you're on the ... show a calling in from Caroline nice to have you with us\nAs I said it's been ... I've met them articles and show it's a it's a habit of mine I was my own job sorry about that go ahead\n[noise] uh yeah I write songs that kind of a rat\nAnd travel back to get it because you got to have to drink like ... ... each other all the time travel I think I think\nI Want to say I mean what kind of wrestling\nPotential to grade and kept it under his back about we have to lie about directly founding fathers had in line what line world\nWide Web correlation\nWant everyone to fly kites ... ally with why we're conscious of which we think God I don't care what the law if that's the way they got into that by going by doing so a\nLot when in general which with it then the um\nWhatever that was about to skate through\nAll the last group like the Democrats tend to laugh I think I Want to say that\nWell it was real it was wrong it was unscripted\nAnd and and now we're we're the Democrats probably way last\nNBC a in and say why did a terrible thing by putting a mentally unfit man on the TV show exporting his popularity or yeah there were there were nowhere to be found were they last week nowhere to be found\nMe last week was the week that they should have been out there saying how dare you take advantage of Kanye NBC Saturday Night live how dare you put him on stage and his mental state 'cause that's what they're saying today\nI didn't see anybody at NBC News saying this is what happens when when when a negro doesn't read we say come on Saturday Night live Saturday Night live I tell you that's what happens\nYou know you you this is this is what you need to understand this is a you know you're an educated ignorance pool\nIs what happens when they grow don't read there it is\n\nYou just don't read you don't agree with us we will try to destroy your life and say you need to be in a mental hospital ed you're on the mark of an show been focused and would you go ahead\n[noise] hey ban uh this is ed from Minnesota just up to the city's listen as an African American I'm rarely rarely just disgusted by what the Democrats did\nI shouldn't be surprised because this is the playbook see I like Tania it used to be you know democratic a party believer until I fell off the Democratic plantation just probably three years ago\nShe said well you don't think in the black community like they want us to think where an awful time whereas sellout\nWere or whatever they want to call us we don't think we can't read\nBut I can read and I understand I understand exactly what's going on what's going on here is when we don't do what they say they will do it whenever they can to be a little less to destroy us to try to uh to make whatever it is that we have to say\nAnd and make it small I support the president I like what he's doing I like the fact that the African American unemployment is low once it's ever been\nPretty much I like the fact that we have jobs in our community the nation is driving\nAnd I don't like what the Democrats are selling\n[laughter]\nWay I look at the Democrats and I'm like what are they selling and and I didn't I didn't talk about this the other day\nUm with some college kids and I said All right what is it the Democratic party can run on this time they they they can't run on the economy being bad right 'cause they're using the party of doom and gloom they can't run on health care\nThey can't run on unemployment they can't run on on race or an African Americans being left behind or Hispanics being left behind so they have to make it personal\nAnd the way you make it personal is anyone that you don't like you turn them into a racist or a gang rape is Brett Kavanaugh\nYou you turn them into a mental a ... a mentally insane person Kanye West you you turn Donald Trump into some sort of unhinged individual that out of control and can't be trusted with nuclear codes or the economy but you can't say economy anymore because the economy is killing it\nAnd so what you do is the only thing you can run on this time\nOr join the economy but you can't say economy anymore because the economy is killing it\nAnd so what you do is the only thing you can run on this time it because you can't fear among right it's hard to fear mongering country\nAnd just saying you must smoke for us because we're gonna make the economy better that doesn't work the economy's killing it right now and everybody knows that you can't you so so the only thing you do is you have to undermine the legitimacy of the person\nYou have to undermine the legitimacy of Marsha Blackburn intent in Tennessee by the way the Taylor Swift it you know she terrifies me I cannot imagine thought\nA it scares me and makes me want to get in a fetal position because she couldn't attack or on the issue so you have to attack or on the\nI'm I'm afraid of you you you you attack to present the same way you say that well the president's really not in charge of this country the Russians and they looted together\nAnd we're going to sell that until we can't sell anymore anymore and this man needs to be a peach\nAnd then you do the same thing with Kanye and then you don't like the fact that Brett Kavanaugh is when the Supreme Court so you scream and yell and your throat things that centers home then you surround them at dinner and you and you look like an angry mob and then you say it's ... it's it's unfair to college the mob that we are not an angry mob but you are an angry mob and you are\nA scary person and I should be afraid of you and everybody else should be afraid of you that that's what they're running on their running on personal attacks and emotion because there's not a single issue\nAt the Democratic party can run on right now that they can win on you I mean the main core issues you can't tell us we're in an unjust war and innocent people are dying and we need to come home because we're not in a big war right\nRight right I have had that they had that for years that they ran on you know you want to get to that you want to stop spending all this tax money Iraq Afghanistan you want to give kids a good education and you want to stop spending money on the fence and start seeing these poor boys over to be killed and these women to be killed and since most wars you don't have that this time\nRight you're right\nThat the playbook kids make it personal undermined the individual turn the individual into a scary scary person Brett Kavanaugh's ... here's my\nQuestion to you here's my question to use for interrupting regret what we do conservatives and especially of African Americans in your opinion to try to stem the tide track I hate to say\nWell it wasn't Democrats Democrats I Do believe would have taken control of the Senate if it wasn't for them over playing their hand with Brett Kavanaugh and I think Democrats are angry they're inspired they're\nFurious and they realize it another four years of Donald Trump being president\nCould destroy the Democratic party as we know because if you have an economy that's doing this well and it keeps doing well and you have trade agreements are being changed and you have American Jobs coming back and you have well when in point in numbers it's extremely hard to beat that person\nThey are terrified of but what what I Would say is is that we have to go out there and vote and not sit at home and be passive and I think the Brett Kavanaugh as

world of being a outspoken conservative in America today\nUh I I have to protect myself with a gun I'd been targeted I've had to use my gun to protect myself a I've had a significant number of legitimate death threats I've had people that come after me and my family um that is the intolerant left\nThey will come after you with everything they have a ... and there are no rules anymore and and and Brett Kavanaugh's proof of that when I say there's no rules anymore what I did to Brett Kavanaugh what they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh by saying every\nDay every day it was something else well he's you know he he he didn't write me but but he planned rapes well then he was he was involved and gang rights but didn't game right me but he was playing the parties the gang raped me well then I think it was a gang rape is any drinking college any drink in college and I think the game right people in college\nOr a sexually assaulted me we didn't actually sounds to me but he might have been the room when other sexually assaulted me\nUp for ... for somebody like Brett Kavanaugh who look perfect gentleman I mean this book is probably the best American claim of a person over I'll bet on a high school or college\nIn Arizona I I don't think he would say I think he was probably a jock who was the captain of teams who drank and partied with his friends and that doesn't mean that you're a rapist yeah\nYou know and and and today it was interesting 'cause on the view today they were having a conversation about this you want to talk about mob mentality or and and and I we I appreciate the phone call but they were talking about this mob mentality Abby Huntsman\nOr was defending Maloney as me to comment saying call for evidence and and the view show exploded around her\nMaloney a Trump talked about the me too movement and she said you know in this exclusive interview with ABC News that she stood with women and the me too movement but added quote that we need to have really hard evidence\nThat if you're accused of something show the evidence you cannot just say to somebody you know I was sexually assaulted or you did that to me because sometimes she said to me it goes too far and away they portray some stories it's not correct It's not right and I agree with millennia\nWell you know the view of course took on Trump's comments and and sunny house then took a swipe at Trump claiming that the first lady is telling women everywhere your word is not enough um that's that's not true I mean it's\nI Can't support the me too movement while also saying that we need to make sure that the me too movement is held to a level of accountability that our court system says is a is adequate incorrect you must have\nEvidence you can't just destroy someone's life you don't believe me look at the kid whose parents are now suing a five high school students who uh falsely accused their son\nOf sexually assaulting them destroyed his wife\nDestroyed his friendships destroyed his entire life they everybody's walking around saying and then they finally recanted their stories and they're suing as they should\n\nThere are people you know there was a star football player recently there was a ... a film I think it was on HBO down about him he went went to prison missed out on the best years of his career because he was falsely accused of rape thing a girl and it came out they finally that he didn't rape or\n\nWe should believe in the presumption of innocence over guilt but the mob guilt but the mob mentality of the left is if you are a woman you must be believe no matter what\nAnd the man is guilty automatically\n\nUntil he prove his innocence\nIf that's not a mob mentality I don't know what is\n\nYou can go out there and and accuse somebody of doing I mean Abby Huntsman said today evidence should always matter\n\nEvidence should always matter\nI had no problem listening to Mrs Ford I had a problem with her story when that didn't add up\nTake emotion out of it the ...\nNo problem with saying to Mrs Ford I had a problem with her story when that didn't add up\nTake emotion out of it\nThe reason why I didn't believe Mrs Ford is because she got to hand pick the people that were in the house in the room and people said the president was mocking Mrs Ford it that campaign rally when you know she said you know Brett Kavanaugh you know try to ... murder me and raped me remember that\nWhat you were to happen I don't know where it happened I don't know how did you get there I Can't remember how did you leave I don't know if you tell anybody know\n\nMillennia Trump said exactly what ever and this is where I Believe the midterms are going to backfire on the Democrats I Do I really do believe that there are too many mothers out there that have sons\nThat have husbands that have nephews that have dads and\nThey saw what they did that Brett Kavanaugh based on a political assaults and nothing else and the assault is still going\n\nThe assault is still going Democrats are saying elect us to one of the houses put us in charge of the house or the Senate and we will impeach Brett Kavanaugh\nNot based on fact based on emotions in a mob mentality based on the fact that got nothing else to run on so let's turn every Republican into a racist or sexist sexual assault\nIndividual turn them into a gang rape is that's what you gotta do to turn them into that\nTurn them into that\nOne eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven one eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven when they go to Steve thanks for waiting you're on the market then show than Ferguson filling in and I go I had\nA band thanks for taking my call you're on a great job to the steely eyed mismanaged today thank you\nI'm a ... you know it just kills me I'm a you know when they ... well what they said the con ya was basically what the gentleman said was you know he doesn't understand the histories he's um learn it or whatever is exact comment was that our call\nI'll ... I'll happily play it for you because it's this is what happens when a black person gets off the Democratic plantation tell you what is what happens when they grow don't read up there you go\nOkay well here's some don't read for him you know then when the demon crap party as I call them is the party of slavery they are John Wilkes booth was a Democrat and took out Lincoln who they take is their number one hero\nOr they were the party of the KKK [noise] and er Jim Crow segregation okay those are things we're all supposed to know but I learned just recently that the Democrat Party not one party member voted for the passage of the thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth amendments that ended slavery\nSo what does that tell you basically they're not the party of freedom and that's been the problem for a long long time and it's time Americans just grab the bootstraps and we do something about it because it's never going to end with these people they're the plantation owners\nAnd uh somebody like Kanye leaves the plantation then all hell breaks loose pardon my my uh French but ah you know they're the anthrax Freedom Party a\nWell you look at you look at you know search suicides in records has the face of the Democratic party she said the electoral college is an institution that has its roots in slavery\nSo therefore it should be abolished where the Democratic party has its roots in slavery and it certainly we already of slavery right and so shouldn't we eliminate that institution as well using her logic\nParties still exist okay after World War two [noise] what do you think [laughter]\nWhy wasn't the Democrat Party abolished you know why because Lincoln was assassinated had Lincoln not been assassinated on saying things that I'm sure a million Americans are just you know thanking them selves right now\nWhat if it had he lived what what if the Democrats what if the confederacy would have won the war where would we be now I don't think it's a country we'd want to live in\nRight while the Democrats are telling you right now the country you're living in as an evil country control by evil why rape is\nSo ... development man but narrative yeah well the narrative as I again can you run off the economy if you're a Democrat now you can't run off the economy if if it's impossible you can't run off black", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "12"}
