we'll bring a damn back to talk about about Dan former Secret Service former NYPD nobody better to talk about this than anybody else you've been watching the coverage what do you make of this\nAll markets seems like a very amateurish operation I mean just look at some of the hallmarks of these devices that were sent I mean number one is the obvious one Mark I'm none of them thank God I'm actually detonated in an unexploded again thank the lord that happened\nUm but certainly not the hallmarks of of of someone with experience in this in this space but\nOther things as Well Mark which seemed to indicate one of only two possible options it was either a really amateurish operation or someone seemingly wanted to get caught um outside of the not detonating also when you look at the photographs we painted the devices mark\nYou see a just hallmarks of of of of just a rookie type behavior like excessive postage which is all I mean it's all over the front of you see the big turnout height on\nThe on the label you know if you're trying to create a device into a mail system to God Forbid detonate in front of a male and war the target\nYou know huge hype that's going to draw attention to the package you see the um one other thing mark they had uh one of the packages was addressed the John Brennan CNN well\nI mean John Brennan doesn't work at the end and that's quite obvious to bake bake Internet search would have produced that information worked at NBC which I mean this is it it's really a there's something not right here it's a very suspicious operation very amateurish right now\n[noise] phony ask you this question is it possible he has such a a devious minded worked at somebody wants to look so amateurish\nIt's certainly parts wife said there's only one of two scenarios here I mean either somebody wanted to get caught um for some reason or show amateurish that it it it it speaks to some kind of a motive we haven't yet it's just bizarre\nAnd then that that the selection of the of the target of course there's people\nKind of a you know motive we haven't yet it's just bizarre and then that that the selection of the of the target of course there's people want to you know if people all over the media right now are given out these ... especially if you're going through these other networks who are desperate to prescribe a motive to have no idea\nBut I Would encourage all of them take it very very slow or because I when I Would I be mark and my experience than the space especially with the secret service and all of its mail processing system is people who are Syrians who have these Savage animal minds want to do this kind of stuff\nThey are very tactically efficient in the way they do it and none of the ... tactically efficient of planning where in orange ... this is a highly highly suspicious or operation I mean none of them even detonated again thank God but that is that\nCertainly doesn't speak some expertise in this in this space\nTo investigator and you're looking at this I Would think you would make no a imagines a\nScenario is that you would just try and get the evidence and follow the evidence and try and figure it out that way rather than while this motives that mode of and the other mode we're really you're you're just getting down to the forensics\nAnd that's what guys like you what I Do uh we're always hesitant to jump to a motive before we actually have the facts and the data there I mean this is with comments that reasonable people do but of course when you know with the with the current environment and and the media hysteria they immediately want to prescribe them a motive remembered mark\nThe most important of all the W. using this right the who what when where why and how the most important thing obviously you to get it who the actual person we'd have no we have zero close right now at least publicly as to who that person that I suspect\nKnowing how these investigations go and the availability of initiate are on these devices which usually leads the signature that they're going to get someone relatively quickly but you have no idea who it is and when you don't have to who you have no idea what the motive is\nAnd I got to tell you it's grotesquely irresponsible for\nThese people out there already were absolutely convinced that that that they know exactly why this happened it's just it's been than it\n[noise] but you also find it a really gut wrenching sickening that every time there's something a terrible that takes place in this country they trained tied to Donald Trump sounds gross Donald Trump yesterday was compared to Hitler multiple times on cable\nTV [noise] he was said to be a racist multiple times on cable TV because he used this word national listen I'm going to explain this later in the show\nI'm aware that where it actually comes from comes from the progressive actually comes from Theodore Roosevelt his new nationalism speech but I don't want to jump all getting into that later just shows you how ignorant people are but they were going on and on and and now these same\nHosts the same guests the same contributed call them whenever you will are talking about the rhetoric is too hot things need to take coal do they understand the media have led this this this battle with the vicious rhetoric\nPart they've they've accused the man of being a Russian trader\nA a a guilty of trees and we've had we've had so called air quotes you respected commentators accused the man of treason accusing him of being a Nazi and there you have Maxine Waters and others talking about getting in people's faces\nMark what are the things you Sean and the people in the industry has always been clear on on the conservative side people are responsible for their own actions\nThat maniac who shot up these college and the baseball field\nI that guy's responsible for his own action but having said that the people who are out they're calling for confrontation and aggressive confrontation of public\nHave to be more responsible but that's not conservative than the fact that they're trying to turn this around immediately and painted on Trump and make it some kind of a political issue without having any of than hounding factors disgusting\n... one of the key advisors to Hillary Clinton during a campaign some ... whatever his name as\nHis guy yesterday on TV I think it was on TALK shows refused to condemn people getting into the faces of members of Congress and other public officials in restaurants that was just yesterday\nI heard if I saw the exact same what you're talking about but that's who he is the fate of him before mark ... who he is I was not surprised\nOne time my brother well we appreciate having you on then you're great friend God Bless you will be right back\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations and oneself gas for a little bit less you go to that one it just makes sense every little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save\nThat same me that promotes this go ahead what\nAre you looking at a missed the boat\nWhether you're looking at a a what a second place where the king of Saudi Arabia now all of those individuals or comes on the phone they're individuals who came within their societies that not working with others outside of the society has\nWhen they were there those societies because you can do when their goals of what they're looking for [laughter] so that was a very dangerous words but I think it's a very very\nDangerous word nationalist so very very dangerous or you got to listen to me throughout the program I'm going to hit this very very importantly in the next few minutes go ahead we know this president is\nAll I Want to be precise a congressman you're making your parents and between the primary in the United states than Hitler I'm and I want you to explain exactly what you mean 'cause obviously this is a this is controversial\nWell what I'm saying is that using the word of nationalism and NASA was meaning that you know when you listen to him he was talking about German from the German uh and that's\nI'm On\nAnd Franklin Roosevelt was looking at America for the Americans\n\nThese are historically illiterate human beings that we have to listen to these not alone Max Boot on CNN yesterday cut Eighteen go\nDisturbing historical echoes somebody well now nationalism I spent a lot of things over the years\nIn the nineteenth century it was primarily associated with liberal movements people like feed or hurt so the founder of ... figure of all day who helped to create a state or federal air\nBoulevard who helped to create the states with Colombian Venezuela but on the twentieth century nationalism taken on a much darker much more negative connotation bingo so ... fascist movement and you think of national is to think of people I've Franco and were selenium Hitler and\nPinochet not exactly people at the president of the United states which I forgive you have your wedding and that's why it's very hard for me to think of people and us history probe describe themselves as nationalist says not popular term okay\nOkay well I'll explain one very big one who was in the twentieth century in a moment and then we have Joe Scarborough really low some really low some individual cut Nineteen go want to read this this is\nKind of a this is this referencing nobody\nPlease my my bluff and viewers out there too nice\nTo not draw parallels between what is said here in the body\nSo he willingness to attack Trump and he thinks he covered by saying don't draw apparently well why else would he be doing just to give us a history lesson on Hitler\nGo ahead isn't that would hurt me\nWe very deeply and you don't want to hurt me deeply I don't want to leave on the shows this doesn't relate to anybody whatsoever it's just [noise]\nIt was going through rains and rains and volumes I Love World War two and they are big Churchill fans love what Rosa\nSo I was reading this this is\nFrom um ah do you not as bad as a strategic services in his ... he\nJust happened to come across as late as Jim because when you think uh Joe Scarborough you think of a historian particularly when it comes to World War two don't you\nNobody sent this to him or put it under his rather huge bobble snows no no he found this on his own go ahead\nFile and there's only pertains to Adolf Hitler came so nobody else I can I just said that enough is enough I mean this is what they had for Adolf Hitler's\nPsychological profile and for those of you in the midst of reading World War two\nReports you'll find that fascinating is primary rules were never allowed the public to cool off\nNever admit fault or wrong\nAnd that if I can see that there may be some good and your enemy never leave room for alternatives and never except blame\nOn one enemy at a time and blame them for everything that goes wrong people will believe a big life sooner than the little one [noise]\nAnd if you painted free ... that you know\nSo there you have ... comparing Trump the Hitler even though he denies that that's the entire purpose of this\nThen Don Lemon on CNN cut twenty go wow [noise]\nIssues that we're we're going to talk about that word tonight it is a favorite of All right and is loaded with native is and racial undertones and global as well global is everyone uses a slur\nOf sorts sometimes even against ... and the administration often with anti Semitic overtone\nOkay now keep in mind he's or media figures\nThese are hosts some claimed to be reporters\nAnd listen to how they talk is this cooling\nDown the rhetoric is this bringing the country to get is this news isn't even news\nAt all\nAnd there's Peter Alexander White House correspondent on MSNBC um getting somewhere with this folks please stick with me I Can't do this stuff and quick soundbite cut Twenty one go\nAnd Peter to ask you also about his hazing that weren't nationalist by saying you know out loud I Am nationally and how does the president has conceive of that term because it doesn't in any way have racial undercount\nRacial undertones racial overtones the word nationalist\nGo ahead\nAnd tell them that are not just racial they're just being a phobic because this is something to the presence of sort of shied away from in the past obviously nationalism was a phrase it that the ban and a sovereign embrace over the course of the campaign and a lot of the president's opponents tried to ... you get the draft\nAnd there's many others so yesterday Trump is compared to Hitler he's a racist he's have you seen a photo he's all these things\n\nAll the this is the media or\nThe media using selectively guests to say these things they know what they're going to say\nThe media\nAnd tonight they're out there saying toned down politics is divisive it's too late now they're reporting and they're not really reporting\nSlowly but surely they're aiming at Trump\nI Am not a nationalist ladies and gentlemen I'm a constitutional is [noise]\nI Am not a nationalist ladies and gentlemen\nI'm a constitutional is [noise]\nI Believe in Americanism not nationalism [noise] to the correct Max Boot and everybody else who heard speaking\n\nOne of the leading progressive or the last century progressive he ran as a\nThird party candidate is the head of the progressive party was Theodore Roosevelt\nAnd on August thirty one Nineteen ten those of us who actually do study history Scarborough he gave a famous famous speech\nYou know what he entitle the speech the new national as\nThe new national news\nAnd in this speech the new nationalism Theodore Roosevelt borrowed\nFrom a gentleman by the name are Herbert cruelly if you have my book read discovery American as we know what I'm Talking about\nHis his essay is famous essay\nIn something called the outlook magazine promise of American Life this had an enormous influence on Theodore Roosevelt the progressive movement was really borne out of the Republican Party early on\nAnd it's great leader would become Theodore Roosevelt\nAnd then there's new nationalism speech I said he called it his new nationalism speech he spoke about the new nationalism\nThe object of a central government that need for a ubiquitous federal government they need to be interfering in the private sector\nA rejection\nOf market capitalism in many respects a rejection of the ... I'm telling you the truth I reject the declaration of independence has written a rejection of the separation of powers that can finds\nThe ability the federal government to help people\n\nAnd it was on the on the left on the progressive left new nationalism\n\nSo\nWhy do these people in the media compare Trump to Hitler why do they call him a racist when he uses the word nationalist the criticism should be that's a progressive term that progressive own\nIn the twentieth century\nBut\nDon Lemon is a moron Joe Scarborough is a moron Max Boot as a fake Gregory makes is a moron Peter Alexander the White House correspondent a more on\n\nOut and so the I guess\nYou just received your highest electric bill ever ... has this illusion goes over in ...
