sure folks on the left and then I wouldn't be too happy if ah we flip the script and we did that with a\nJohn Lennon um reference to what they tried to call it a tunnel yeah I'd just like it was thoughts on\nOkay so here my thoughts on that Daniel uh I thought that was a low rent play by Don Lemon to go after Kanye and to use is dead mother a last night saying his mother will be rolling over in her grave that is a despicable disgraceful things sex raise your hand if you know anything about cutting his background you know can use to anybody know\nCounties background so so he's a really accomplish guy he comes from a very accomplished family\nAnd he had any had a point where the knee get shot through the mouse at one point in the ... that I don't know but\nI can tell you this Kanye West ... mother was a college professor allow Kanye West father was the first black photo journalist for the Atlanta Journal constitution and for a while when he was a kid he grew up\nIn ... he was he lived in China with his family and at age five you started composing poetry this is not a guy\nThat you would dismissed as ice chests another I mean I I'm I'm going to use a loose term here\nThis is not a guy who was a gangster rappers just some rappers just some he's actually a pretty thoughtful\nGuy now with that in mind\nThink about the boxes that ... just in the abstract like Don Lemon wants to go after him and say that he's a dirt bag ... hire a comes out and says what is it that's what happens when when the negroes don't read that was a term that she used her one of the people on that panel said that which is so disgusting\nThat is a disgraceful thing to say about it I don't give us a political enemy\nYou don't you don't use that kind of terminology in polite company on TV right and he is not illiterate ... billion dollar company Tara ... billion dollar company Don what do you have all the fancy contract with CNN\nSo let's let's drill down into its like think about what Kanye West that has put together first of all he's married into the car dash it OK marriage into the car dash he didn't have\nVery complex situation he's part of a reality TV empire he's also part of his own empire from music and fashion and things like that\nHis father in law is his mother in law\nBruce Jenner Caitlyn Jenner\nHis the father of his daughter ah the father of his wife defend that OJ Simpson and Robert crashing in that in that trial this is a guy who was at like so many crossroads of the culture and the changing culture\nIt's ridiculous this is a family that shoot up and spit out Lamar Odom destroys basketball career Chinese weathered it I mean think about that for a second so I don't think he's an idiot did\nI disagree with what he said about George Bush hates black people yeah I thought that was terrible back in two thousand I don't think that was an accurate description of George Bush with a response to Katrina I think George Bush did the best job he could with the response to Katrina which was like the worst disaster to hit a place that was previously disaster in the history of anything New Orleans\n\nBut it's going to come over and say I agree with conservatives on like these three or four thanks like he's against stop and frisk case against Harry stops\nHe doesn't think that stop and frisk will save lives in Chicago I disagree I think it will\nI think all you have to do was apply stop and frisk for a few months we toss the bangers figure out who's got guns get them off the street fight it out in court but you see your confiscating those guns from people that are walking on the streets of Chicago that should not have a firearm without\nCall it an emergency I don't know whatever you want to call it I disagree with him on that I agree with him on opportunity I agree with him on economic gross I agree with him on the desire a budget to to to work on prison sentencing reform oh yeah Brecht you just said crazy stuff about ... hot springs yes I did\nBecause that's twelve time rapist that's different than some Eighteen year old with a bag a doping his back pocket who got you know like Fifteen Years\nI think that kids can get a second shot\nTwelve rapes in front of spouses and boyfriends at knife point that's that's really not rehabilitate up\nAll it's just not but this idea that like you dismiss ... he's just he's silly

and and I\nDo wish you well I'm ... and decided to scale morality uh I think you're dealing with some very amoral individuals I I Would say that if we're talking on the scale of one to tend the folks that you are dealing with probably starting out around the three and so I don't like your chances of ever getting very far with those folks but uh hey uh you know if for now\nWe're going to try to find those folks who are at least at least you know five six is on our overall sliding scale morality by the way if you missed it\nAt the onto the show kinda my theme that I'm taking things into today\nI like to say there are two sides of stories one side effects then you have the premise of the premise of anything is falls in the built upon it will fail to but they're also was a sliding scale of morality and so we're on it\nWe exist and we'll read or best maybe we're good people will read or worse maybe we're not quite as good but the differences are we've somebody will end up hurting others what we see in today's world we got a lot of folks that are willing to hurt others and we have a whole political party right now that is willing to do that as well and\nA lot of that happen through misinformation\nSo let's talk about the employment situation again for a second record low unemployment for minorities\nBlack unemployment rate at all time lives\nIn somewhere along the way you have Donald Trump that brings out the best and many of these minority communities you have somebody who actually sat down with Kim ... which many of us were skeptical about at the onset and something constructive came out of it\nNow you have Kanye West who goes into the oval office and\nSomething constructive might come out of it\nBut more to the point the more open minds we have in this country the better the employment picture\nOr minorities the more opportunity not only politically that comes with it\nBut the better the opportunity for the entire country open minds\nEqual better opportunities and a better chance for a more moral nation because if we adhered to pull politics and the people that start out on that sliding scale of morality from a really negative place\nWhere are we going to be taken for the people who wanted to believe for example Christine Ford and Chuck Schumer who said he believed her Dianne Feinstein who believes her people believe them\nSo you had people that started out in that sliding scale morality and an amoral place and have taken their politics and those folks left with them\nThat's not good Donald Trump taken whole minority communities including black adult women Hispanics\nEven Native Americans to new heights economically that they had never seen before dance that change change it and that's the difference and that's the irony of Donald Trump who in his own personal life maybe not the most moral man\nAnd the grand scheme of sliding scale morality\nOne politician has kept more promises inside of two years then that man that always told me that the there are two kinds of people you've got people who will tell you something and you can't believe it and you got people who will tell you something and you can take it to the

... big rushed him nothing happened to be a capitalist they built the better mouse trap but anyway I digress whoever's on goes to Fifteen dollars per hour and then you hear the the folks go\nEverybody should take Amazon model now I Will point out some of the obvious here\nFor people actually understand economics there are many other businesses that operate in retail which happens to be a low margin business they were getting crushed by Amazon ironically enough are going to have a harder time increasing wages because Amazon at their size scale and ability to deliver the way they're delivering\n[laughter] they they are killing the profits or take a look at any number of you'll retail companies that you grew up with that are dead and dying as we speak now\nThan I was standing\nThe number of people that actually earned minimum wage I went back and actually check my research on this and\nIronically enough the last time it was a really big issue it kinda like coming off the Occupy crowd indeed twenty fourteen mid term elections I happen to be about four years ago that we had the the big minimum wage conversation and hey you know what\nAre the folks in the country had a point because they did kind of thought you know for eight years of Obama we average one point eight percent economic growth we never even got close to an average US Economy\nIt was to an average US Economy so yeah okay but even then what percentage of people on minimum wage yeah number in your head\nHow many people back in twenty fourteen you think earned minimum wage ready one point eight percent even in Morocco bombers the God I mean it was only one point eight percent what's more is the average age of somebody who earned minimum wage happened to be twenty two and have it it'd be working part time\nJob I mean you know that the people that were heads of households that were you know trying to raise a family and uh you know they needed a living wage right\nBut that was it and we've got the best economy in a generation we've got the lowest unemployment rate in forty nine years weve got record low unemployment rates for everybody but pretty much what he white people\nAnd how many people actually earned the minimum wage\nYou're ready according to the bureau of Labor Statistics point six percent point six percent\nThat zero zero point six percent now what's more is that Ninety nine percent of those people be point six percent are under the age of twenty five and what happened\nAs soon as Amazon raise those wages we got the minimum wage conversation come up again\nOh one of the great fraud perpetuated that's out there the living wage is funny what actually happened a good economy economics Amazon dot com props prospering and they had the financial wherewithal to be able to increase wages\nJust like what we're seeing because here's another little factoid oh by the way\nWe take a look at the average amount of money that a person's backing not only are we finally just about three percent towards a wage growth by the time yet and bonuses goes over there by the time you add in your tax cuts churns out to be about another Eighteen hundred bucks for the average person working this year\nWhat the average Jeanette take home pay now up six point seven percent year over year you have to go back thirty two years to find the last time your income growth\nThat good [noise] so the living wage [noise]\nFunny what happened we actually have a good economy you're living wage and the minimum wage\nAs just a bunch of BS selling Medicare for all\nSuicides stories one set of facts will continue to do a lot more\nThe factual stuff right here I Am Brian ... is a great one Marshall that\nEvery time you go on line your Internet provider an advertising companies can track what you do and sell your personal information so how can you protect yourself computer\nTax cuts savings has gone through a combination of bonuses and employ you raise is thirty five percent twenty percent has gone to a debt reduction which makes sense we've seen interest rates rise companies that have dead they should paid off that helps the company the gum more stable lessons their debt burden with rights rising\nFifteen Percent Fifteen Percent on share buybacks ten percent upgrading software five percent upgrading get a upgrading equipment and five percent have increased the evidence so all in the combination of sheer bat buybacks in David in payouts\nTwenty percent that's it and even then you\nProbably benefit because once again something that is not perpetuated informational lead by our friends and media generally fifty two percent of Americans own stocks and by the way despite the volatility of the past few days way with the greatest wealth creation machine\nHistory of the world is your United States stock market so I don't apologize for that anyway but the biggest beneficiary is you\nEmploy but [noise] you know\nI I guess convenient like that that message has just been missed I Am sure that any day now it's going to be a big story that will be reported on and again\nCNBC they're the ones with that story\nHow even NBC when one of their\nNews outlets hasn't decided to actually run with their own story from their own CFO council one of these days I'm sure it's just oversight All right let's go to Ross in South Dakota rough go\n\nAre we doing all good\n[noise] well I see it as kind of a few core problem really I mean you get a single payer healthcare system and you're going to basically just keep these big hospitals in ... the smaller ones they're not going to survive you know they're not going to make the money that these bigger wants to make it out because they can't cut costs that the government wants to cut them down to for\nA lot of this stuff that the first part I see\nThe second part I see as we need to adjust something in the hospital they know what it costs to manufacture up one thousand cc bag of IV fluids\nI Would think not much I'm guessing you know\nA dollar I I did the research for my call just to make sure I had the members right and you know what they charge you for it in the hospital\nAnd a lot more memory hundred dollars\nWell and and so Ross and I appreciate the call and you have a ... a good point but a couple of things that we should discuss when we're talking about insurance generally\nThe biggest problem and affordability and healthcare is health insurance\nThe problem is we have been brave the idea that health insurance equals healthcare\nThat's not the case one of the more remarkable statistics in the wake of Obamacare has been the lack of people that could afford health care with health insurance\nAccording to the Kaiser Family foundation hardly a conservative organization they still to this day are proponents of Obamacare I mean after all the kind of have a vested interest\nBut here's what they found in their research there are forty two million Americans forty two million Ben have health insurance they can't afford healthcare you think about that for a moment\nThe average health insurance plan eighty five hundred dollars now if you don't pay all that it might be because your employer sponsoring it but that's the only the average cost of health insurance right now\nSo would you be better off\nIf you had eighty five hundred dollars but you could use on health care\nOr would you be better off if eighty five hundred dollars which for health insurance and then after that you got to see how much you had to pay out of pocket before you hit the deductible which often happens to be a high deductible plans which state and you can't hit which is why people can't afford health care\nThat's all part of the financial fraud\nSo the number one way to get to more affordable health care is to break the back of the insurance first model haven't embrace it was the first thing that we did that was a big time mistake\nOnce you do that you are going to get to the crux of what you were talking about there which is consumer price transparency the most bang crap crazy thing I have ever seen in my life\nIs walking into a medical facility being handed a piece of paper that says and so many words that whatever happens in that facility\nWhich you have no clue generally yet what that's going to be in whatever it happens to cost which they generally can't even tell you\nAnd whatever your insurance company doesn't pay for which they also can't tell you you'll pay for how\nIs that you mentioned walking into a store\nBuilding a car with stuff not having a clue what any of it costs and signing a piece of paper that says some point later we're going to tell you how much you're gonna pay us for this and that is bad crap crazy but that's what we have with our insurance first model right now\nSo you break the back of it we get to the way the way we use insurance for everything else in her life how is that well what we do if we have you know the chemical problem with our car well we we do pay and have it fixed\nIf we're getting a big time accident we fall and insurance claims were already at the point with health insurance to where it's essentially catastrophic care for tens of millions of Americans right can't afford to use health care the rest of the time\nOkay so why don't we go to that place to where we use health insurance as a catastrophic plan which by the way is what the president's new plans the ones that are called skinny and bad plans and but the Democrats are are sitting there you know what I'm saying is the worst thing that's essentially what they are as catastrophic care\nWhich is cheaper and better for people who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford to use the other more expensive policies anyway\nBut at that point you're able to do what you're able to be a consumer we are incredibly good consumers when we have an opportunity to shop all we can find the best deal in the world on MTV or whatever else it is will sit there and we'll take a look at yeah best deal boom done\nBut with health care we never have a shot we never have a shot at doing it one of the things I Do somewhat routinely I'll take a look any time we have research that will show the cost of a procedure from one place to the next um I had a\nI had a minor surgery years ago that had I gone through my insurance would have cost a thousand bucks decided to shop around\nPaid cash and it was five hundred dollars come to the point there\nWe never know because we find pieces of paper those ads something's gonna happen here and we'll pay you for whatever the insurance company doesn't so they'd be if you really want to get to the crux of it not only is Medicare for all financial fraud but frankly the\nBiggest ally of Obamacare is not the you know you've got to be cheaper and you can keep your doctor and all that\nIt's an insurance equals healthcare insurance doesn't equal healthcare insurance is the antithesis of healthcare for tens of millions of Americans will continue the conversation coming up next I'm Brian mud and for the great one\nAsk any a Mac remember what they like most about belonging to the
