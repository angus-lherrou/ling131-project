reason\nGiven three different\nAnswers as to when the assault happened mid eighties early eighties and all of a sudden actually was the summer in Nineteen eighty two after she lawyers up\nYou have to believe that she\nWaited\nWaited really until now to reveal that the individual who assaulted her was in fact judge Kavanaugh never said anything to anybody else although her husband now has circled back and said oh I remember her telling me doing marriage therapy okay we'd like to see the notes they won't return they won't release the notes so that's not believable\nShe can't remember a key details about the night who invited her to the party\nHow she heard about the party and how she got to the party how she left the party where the houses exactly with any specificity and of course most importantly how she left the party with whom she left the party how she traveled back home when she got back home\n\nThe alleged assault has not been corroborated by single person including none of the people she's named including as well her lifelong girlfriend Leland Kaiser that apparently is not change based on reports today she hasn't provided a consistent account of the alleged assault\n\nAnd she had big trouble remembering important recent events like in her discussion with the Washington Post reporter whether she actually gave portions are therapists notes to the report and others in July the whole copy of the therapists notes read from the therapists no she doesn't remember\nShe can't remember if she had an actual copy of the therapists knows when she called the Washington Post or she had gone to her therapist's office and read them now I\nCan't remember any of that she won't provide the notes to the committee\n\nShe won't provide it to the committee she can't remember the day that she had the polygraph but this is very reason just what a month six weeks eight weeks ago was it was on the day her grandmother passed away or not she can't remember if it was video or audio recorded and the committee would like to know they want to see\n[laughter] in fact she was traumatized during the course of the [noise] excuse me lie detector test if she claims\n\nHe talks about the psychological impact that had that she doesn't want to fly she has difficulty flying now we know that was a flat out lie\nAnd say that yes a flat outline\nShe's flown west coast east coast east coast the west coast she's found to Hawaii French Polynesia Costa Rica all over the world\nBut when she was asked to shop for a hearing she couldn't fly\n\nAlthough it is said that she was already on the east coast [noise] she didn't know that the Senate Judiciary committee Republicans the majority had offered to go to California to interview her\nIn any form\nAnd uh\nWhy didn't you know people say her lawyers must have withheld that information maybe the large didn't withhold the information maybe she just didn't give a forthright answer\nWe know from her ex boyfriend\nThat she never mentioned Kavanaugh's name she never mentioned sexual assault in the six years that they live together and the few years before that that they dated we know she had no problem with claustrophobia because she had an apartment that was five hundred square feet that's a small apartment\nThat's a very small apartment\nWe know that she never mentioned Kavanaugh was named to her boyfriend her live in boyfriend have six years so you have\nTo believe the unbelievable to believe\nHer testimony against Brett Kavanaugh you have to believe the unbelievable you must spend your reasoning and now that I've gone through this she's not the bubble lady\nShe came forward she said it was her civic duty she's presented herself to the American people that we get the judge said it's not the only body that gets the judge you and I get the judge and we don't have to self censor him to be rude and hateful and all the rest I'm not that and we're not doing that\nNow what Kavanaugh's say that was so unbelievable that contradicted absolutely nothing that I'm aware of what that he may have had more drinks one day then another day he's the one who showed up with this calendars\nHe's the one who had witnesses who said he was never there\n\nYou see the FBI didn't interview Henry Ford now according to forge lawyers who are very upset and of course the Democrats are all one in the same but that's not the nature of this investigation it's not a criminal investigation\nThey testified in public under penalty of perjury there's nothing else for them to say\nSo why do we continue to play foot see what the Democrats we should play brass knuckles where the Democrats say enough already and Mr flake and ms Collins and ms Murkowski view on that's wrong with the Democrats go ahead\nAnd what the Democrats go ahead we're having a vote this is over we're not going to participate in any further sham we're\nNot going to participate in now and the trashing of the FBI not talking about the senior people at the FBI now they're trashing the FBI after lecturing us for Eighteen months about the FBI\nThat's not the senior officials in the FBI who are doing these interviews these are special agents I have no doubt the hard working men and women in the FBI that the Democrats claimed alike but they have a law enforcement let's be honest\nSo enough so now we don't need to deal honestly we don't need to deal with people\nWho are diabolical diabolical\nThat includes flight that includes Collins that includes mccaskey who brought us to this point I guarantee you if I were their husbands are flights wife court being treated this way they wouldn't agree you know what maybe we should extend this for a week\nWhy\nWhat took place this week an endless speculation endless analysis of what\nThe insanity is ubiquitous\nIt's all over the media all over the media I'll get to them later as I always do to actually believe Dr for Israeli to suspend the
