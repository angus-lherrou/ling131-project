great one must live in and the media the left the liberals the Democrats they don't want you to use the term mob\nWhen describing their mob tactics stopping traffic marching in the streets clawing at the door of the Supreme Court screaming with a bullhorn on your front door invading private property but restaurant disrupting people while they're trying to have dinner\nA no justice no peace was what I heard from them in the past and you've heard Hillary Clinton say we can of civility until the Democrats take the house and Senate back there you go that's the threats so what are you going to do to stop them because if you don't do something between now and election day twenty\nSeven days from now that's exactly what will happen the mob will be in charge and here's the president Saturday Night\nNight in his rally right after the vote confirming Brett Kavanaugh as the next Supreme Court justice this was brilliant here's what he said\nYou don't hang magazine is\nOurs has and you know you are doing and we left wing ma and that's what I [noise]\n\nTo extreme and two days years ago are\nFalling you believe in the rule of law\nNot the rule of law\nThere you go that's it and it and when he said that Saturday I'm telling you Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi the hierarchy of the Democratic party in this town who exploit those people out on the street who use them and harnessed them as they're based based on the president say that and they thought to themselves oh crap\nThat's brilliant because normative Americans do not want to hand power over to those people\nThat you're seeing in the streets there the directors of our society they don't deserve to be in charge of our house of representatives in the United States Senate bats the winning message and that's why suddenly you can call them a mob so what do we do to stop this Dan in Las Vegas Nevada your first stop on the market within show\nHey how you doing today\nAnd good Dan but I we need to win we're going to win well I'll tell you what I'm going to\nDo how many ... uh I started out in life or as a young Eighteen year old uh I joined the army or at a high school because in my era or Jimmy Carter was president one of the job to be at like a bomb or you can find a job if ah somebody paid you to find a job because we've\nTurned the corner Dan I'm Sorry I didn't give you enough time but we'll try to get back to you in a moment for the rest of you eight seven seven three one three eight one one what are you willing to do to stop the mob from winning Barry OConnor on the market wouldn't show\nHow I Am Cairo Cox and I so custom bonds on my website ... dot com white most of you when I spend money I Want the best value I can get I sort of blind stir in two thousand ten\nYou're using coded language the your weapon I think the word against them well hell yes we are you're lucky that's the only weapons and that should be used\nWe will weaponize that word we will paint your party as the mob in the streets and so you stepped up and condemn the mob only then can we actually have a civil conversation in the meantime if you're a mob if you're endorsing the mob if you're supporting the mob\nThen we will warn the rest of this country that if they vote for your party they are empowering the mob so election is twenty seven days away\nWhen mark live in gets behind this microphone for weeks from tonight\nWill he be talking about the majority Democrat Party and what the next two years will look like or we'll be talking about the historic victory of the Republicans holding on to power and make no mistake\nAnything less than the Democrats winning even if they only win by one seat\nAnything less than that is history\nA momentous victory for the Republicans and for President Trump's so what are we doing to stop that Joyce down in Florida Ocala, Florida or you know I don't know where all colors you are you near the hurricane Joyce\nI'm now I'm I'm okay I have to say that these people are so to ... and ... how are they teach their children and victory factor that ... the cops\nAuthority I don't understand like how they do that and are they happy about that that they teach let children I have three kids I don't care how well they are even if they were fifty there were street why would I Would flip out actually when I taught them\nI'll tell you I think there's two aspects of this first of all I mean you saw this with the kids in the high school that had the shooting last year down in your state\nWhere you know they almost immediately it looked like they were media trained professionals with the anti gun anti Second Amendment narrative and that didn't happen by accident this is what they learned in school in our public schools they they they learn all of these talking points in tactics they literally do [noise]\nUm but secondly ... for those who are not so plugged in and so organized and so uh you know the fed into the Olin ski tactics that we're seeing on the streets choice\nJust for your average person who leads to the left\nInstead the left they've been told for the last two years that America just elected Adolf Hitler\nThey've been told for the last decades but the Republican Party is this close to being the Nazi Party in this country if they truly believe that the Nazis are in charge I it makes sense that they would protest the way they do doesn't it\nBad dividing the country they they are\nYesterday our fire absolutely right to do is I\nThink and this fifth disrespectful\nAll right so what are you going to do to make sure that Rick Scott comes to the U.S\nI I tell every you know my family because everybody watches CNN and everything else and that's so again and I can't even believe that they're selling gas from Fox\nNews everybody talked about that but you know what they tell the truth they talk bad about him or read about him but they tell the truth most\nMostly joys All right well I Hope that your energize out there I Hope you realize how important this is I Hope you do what you can to make sure the Rick Scott is a plus one for the Republicans down there in your state of Florida I also hope you stay dry and safe\nHow about a Peggy also in Florida saint Petersburg is kind of close to the action there Peggy you are next up on the mark within show\n... yes I I Am and oh by the way I mean tell you something let me tell the world some things that first time I seen Donald Trump shakes team people fight him my husband didn't believe me when I said you are looking at our nominee it goes\nOh my God I think so I said no I don't think so I said I I Know cell count like I knew and nobody believed me when I said the bucks or going to win the civil [laughter]\nI don't believe that the box and I don't watch [laughter] but I\nWant [noise] and I watched\nThose men play a couple of times they wanted their so badly yeah what the first time I've seen Donald Trump on stage and I heard him say all of us were thinking and Jack Lemmon Mary's shakes ... other people on stage\nPeggy Europe profit your profit it's amazing\nThat I'm not a profit but I I Know or or um or every average day American women think and when I heard Batman steak\nWith baking exactly what the ... that's what thinking oh man he was saying that he was saying oh and by the way we're Scott well where her on different as well where they will [noise]\nAlright Peggy no America is\nCorey we are fed up with more than you are right now with you and your\nCase that crap [laughter] thank you thank you for what city are language and thank you for the past ... thank\nYou for the call it's hard sometimes so sweet I got to pause myself of the middle of certain for it [laughter]\nPeggy is ready in St Petersburg are you ready or Dan let's get back to Dan in Las Vegas I I had to cut him off as an army vet by the way I should ask is Peggy knows who's going to win the games then I'm going to be in Vegas I fly out there tomorrow I should have gotten a couple of hot tips from her before I came out of your time [laughter]\n[laughter] well\nI tell you what I'm going to do in my family were willing to share Republican ticket that's what we're going to do\nYeah [noise] yeah that that's that's what's needed\nRight now and and it's sad you know honestly then I think most Americans they don't necessarily just vote straight wind party this party or that party like like in England or a parliamentary system but in this case this election isn't really about the candidates it's about which party were giving power to\nExactly exactly ah you cannot give Trump is right President Trump is right when he said that you cannot give ... to ... you know you just you just can't do that I mean these people are only ... they're not thinking rationally\nAh oh God Knows where they're\nComing from and you you can't have that in a in a civil society you kind of have that it's just it's just not uh\nThat's right yeah I don't I don't think we Americans I appreciate the call and thanks for holding down and I don't see this weekend up there in Vegas with my brothers that's gonna be it's a scene trust me every year my brother's may be in Vegas it's a scene [noise] uh then I I don't think normative Americans in watching what transpired here which watching what happened\nWith Brett Kavanaugh and the the solemn process what used to be a solemn and dignified process\nOf confirming a Supreme Court justice what they saw the Democrats do and then what they saw the ah their supporters their base the mob do in reaction\nDuring that entire process an add to that what we saw them due to Sarah Huckabee Sanders in a restaurant Ted Cruz Senator Cruz in Texas from restaurant ... plowing into a restaurant screaming under the secretary of homeland security Kirstjen Nielsen disrupting her meal as well uh in this is not the country that any of us want\nGod Knows I have been disappointed and unhappy with the leadership of this country in times of my life various times in my life [laughter]\nGod Knows I have been angry at Washington DC and politicians who represent their own interests or the interests of people that I Am terrified of being in power\nI'm not going to join the mob I'm not going to start a bonfire and a riot on a college campus because I don't want a person to give a speech\nAnd I'm not going to plow in the ... role restaurant disrupting people's meals and scream and the restaurant until the person leaves no one wants to live in the country\nSo it's time to step up\nIt's time to actually put ourselves out there beyond record to day what are we committed to do it's got to be more than voting\nYou know who's running you know who's in your state in your district you know what needs to get done so what are you going to do eight seven seven

are also share on my Twitter Larry O'Connor [noise]\nUh this one tells you how the hidden hand of Mike Bloomberg is behind it all\nThe headline is how Bloomberg embed green warriors in blue state governments it's by Jeff patch it real clear investigations it's a very well researched investigation is a long article I'll give you the synopsis of it though in New York University school of law program funded by billionaire Michael Bloomberg\nWho by the white wants to be president he's officially he will be running\nFor the Democrats there's going to be like twenty twenty five nominees running for the Democrats their first debate\nIs like in six months it's going to be in spring of twenty Nineteen I Can't wait it's gonna be phenomenal to see them all you need each other alive and try to be a ... as socialist as possible to win the nomination it's going to be a complete disaster for them and I can't wait I'm popping the popcorn now\nA Michael Bloomberg is placing lawyers in the offices of democratic state attorneys general and paying them to prosecute energy companies and challenge Trump Administration policies on energy and the environment\nYou understand what the opening something said\nThis is a program at the NYU school of law it's funded by Bloomberg and they place lawyers in the offices of the state's attorney general\nAnd and their job they're getting money from the NYU law program not from the state but they're working in the state attorneys general office\n\nTo sue the Trump Administration and energy companies\nNine states continuing down the article nine states and Washington DC including New York Illinois in Pennsylvania are participating in a multi million dollar program\nFunded by the media magnate an ex New York city mayor who re registered as a Democrat this week amid expectations of a run for president in twenty twenty the fourteenth current fellows in the program report to the attorneys general but they are paid\nBy NYU's Bloomberg funded state energy and environmental impact center where these these these socialist groups all have these insidious names\nThe state energy and environmental impact center it's just a big slush fund to pay lawyers to disrupt the Trump Administration\nAnd to make life miserable for energy companies state AG offices hire these trained lawyers not students but season professionals with years of experience as special assistant attorney general D.C Howard city assistance\nThey're special assistant attorney general they don't work for the state but the answer to the state attorney general\nUnder terms of the arrangement the fellows works solely to advance progressive environmental policy at a time when democratic state attorneys general have investigated ensued Exxon Mobil and other energy companies over alleged damage due to climate change\nAlthough many government agencies have employees funded by outside sources critics say using special interest money for targeted government action is inappropriate yeah I'm One critic who would say that\nSince outrageous New York Pennsylvania are you happy with this\n\nHorner a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute who wrote a report on the NYU center said the fellowships come with specific strings attached quoting him now the age you offices must agree to use prosecutors to advance progressive clean energy climate change and environmental legal positions Horner said\nDavid Hey is the center's executive director did not respond to multiple requests for comment I'm sure he didn't because we got we got 'em dead the rights we got um red handed\nBloomberg throws millions of dollars at this NYU program the NYU than fires attorneys\nBut then ... years attorneys hired guns places them in the offices of the attorney general the attorney general doesn't come out of his budget doesn't come out of the state budget\nThey answer to the attorney general but you know who's bidding they're doing they're not doing the bidding of you the voter you the people in those states they're doing the bidding of where the money's coming from\nThis program at NYU funded by Bloomberg that specifically then sous Exxon Mobil Chesapeake why what whatever oil company in this country\nOr sues the PTA and the Trump Administration trying to shut down progress trying to shut down our economy trying to shut down fracking or oil drilling\nSo that they can do the bidding of the well funded environmental wackos\nAnd this is going on in your state and it's disrupting the progress of our federal government and the EPA that
