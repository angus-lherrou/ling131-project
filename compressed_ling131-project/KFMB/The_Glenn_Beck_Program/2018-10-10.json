would violate the Fourth Amendment right to live in the world he going to be a cough into your one perfect it and they're bringing them up affects you it don't make sense\nWell I think I think are in the case of a Terry stop which is what they called us to stop and frisk a I think given what's going on in the streets of Chicago a cargo police were actually allowed to police the streets effectively you would be able to reduce the amount of of of of shootings and killings of a you know it's unfortunate but\nYou know it's kind of thing where listen go do the Terry stops do to stop and frisk and then finding out in court and go on a court by court basis and that's what you got to do but something's got to be done with people who are thinking that it's okay to murder a murder fellow citizens on the streets of Chicago William it's an epidemic at this point\nI agree with that but yeah there's no you can't violating often than not right\nNow I I don't know I don't know that it's a Fourth Amendment rights violation because it hasn't gone to the Supreme Court I like to hear what the Supreme Court has to say about it\nWell now we now we get right back to the cabinet\nYeah why what's

out we're supposed to go with interview every single person than ever than ever said boo dog I mean come on\nWhat a lot of weight on the way of thinking and I think the fact that\nThere was one of the time to seek the truth would have been for ... for a Dianne Feinstein who was penetrated by Chinese spies\nWould have been for Dianne Feinstein of hand that letter to the FBI and not engaging concealment the reason why people don't trust the Democrats willy is because they have a tendency to lie cheat and steal at nearly every single turn they lie about what they have they steal elections and they cheat every chance they get\nThey could have gone straight up put this letter in the hands of the FBI and let them investigate without having to humiliate or or or harm either a Kathleen lousy Ford or or or Christine Blasey Ford or poor Brett Kavanaugh and instead\nDianne Feinstein because she's a craven political person decided to play games willy\nAnd there's a consequence for playing games sometimes you get burned\nShe tried to burn the American people she got burned right back and it is my sincere hope she's brought up on ethics charges by the Judiciary Committee by Chuck
