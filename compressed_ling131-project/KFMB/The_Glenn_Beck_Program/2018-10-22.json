you and make money and you're really using\nTenants and what not to pay the bill was it things work out properly\nOh I Love that because you have a mortgage on the place might as well let someone else paying\nSo what happens is that you've got a property let's rent it out and you know you do have expenses and whatnot but if you buy properly or your income exceeds expenses but because of the tax code ... ... the property which helps self employed people on their test your church\nSo having said that you get to the pre she ate on your tax returns now which again help self employed people and then you get to use the property\nAnd the cat shelter and then you have income retirement so if the property is strategically done that's paid for by retirement or during or Italian land\nThat it's just income less expenses equals profit you don't need to own something on Madison Avenue of city mhm to do this and to do it well\nMaybe it's a rental property Cape Cod of each from Cisco places like that but you like to go visit it should only be calm but it's a good place when I'm In ...\nThat is such a great plan So Peter I'd like to ask you how one of our listeners would get started but first of all let's circle back to something you just said which is planning it out so that you buy the property earlier in life and then it's paid off the day you retire\nThat's the ideal playing when I have a new rage in there somebody comes into real estate school and asks us you know what to part of what I teach somebody to do is is that it's almost like a life plan\nThis is how you do your business to pay your bills and keep the lights on and feed your family but this is how you build towards retirement and that's one of the things that you look at it as you know you can do it you can save now one of the greatest place to start out first one of these a lot of the author\nOf twenty something that just graduated college\nInstead of paying a landlord to live in some ... downtown la to hurt him all converting warehouse that's really cool because there's a lot of money why would you buy it to family a family on the outskirts of town I live in it for a few years and then keep their best\nThat's the the real really\nThe simplest easiest way to start it\nAnd that's really smart beat or because you know they always say invest in something you understand and if you own that house and lived there for years you know didn't sign up\nTo look like and this tax benefits while you live there so it's a win win it's a win win\nWin win [laughter] that is awesome Peter we have so much

furniture for one thing as we're really getting into football season how about oh ... bar right there in your living room hot or not that's not\nThe wet bars can make a living room look really outdated\n[noise] remember is the countertop along one wall in your living room with brass accessories and a giant near in the back with your wine glasses this ... this was popular in the seventies and eighties maybe we have in JR ... from the TV show Dallas but I think\nThat one [laughter] but our began drying up as open floor plan gained popularity the kitchen sink is only steps away so there's really no need to have another staying in your living room kill [noise] also worth noting here the wet bar in general is still hot\nElsewhere in the home instead of the living room now they're popping up and more outdoor kitchens basement or even the man cave\nThat is so interesting similar so again as we're talking about football season on the way a lot of people are going to be settling

circular squid all chairs and courteous accent tables or automatic\nOkay they're currently paying six point six percent he'd get thirty three thousand clash endeavor that\nI see so Cynthia that's pretty comparable investing in a region or a brick and mortar property except the brick and mortar property would be more work\nThe ups and downs of repairs collecting a friend and I love roller skate that's what I Do but I also watch investing in real estate investment trust because it does the same thing and at the end I come close to getting the same meal\nYou know that is so good to know that your bottom line could be very similar but within reach you can be playing tennis golf and be on the couch with your feet up\nAnd the one last thing I'll leave us you have to be in it for the long haul whether you're owning real estate or you're owning the shots because of the ups and downs of our market\nThat is very true Cynthia because whether it's reached or an actual brick and mortar

R. E. S. designation it stands for seniors real estate specialist and they have the training the expertise any experience older people need when they're navigating buying and selling property\nLet's talk about that now with an expert\nJoining us in Peter Crouch real chore and associate broker with macaroni associates in Alexandria, Virginia Peter also serves as an advisory council member to at home in Alexandria a senior village in Virginia\nAnd he was just awarded the national outstanding service award by the senior real estate specialists counsel at the national association of real tours for community work on behalf of seniors Peter thanks for joining us on real estate today\nAwesome I appreciate the opportunity to thank you\nWe are glad you're here So Peter tell us about NPR's\nSeniors real estate specialist designation now once it take to earn the S. R. E. S.\nBasically means that you take an education and the training to work with seniors at different ages and nobody wants to be called older except for like the four year old wishes\nHe was five years but the designation kind of runs from baby boomers I Need\nA little bit earlier people who are just thinking about\nThings like downsizing all the way up to folks who are almost a hundred years old there's a lot lower planning family conference saying things like that that go on them and the typical sale and there's a big need because sometimes people are taking advantage of\nI see now according to its very definition the seniors real estate specialist designation is meant to help people fifty years old and older\nWith all their real estate needs as you said so one of those needs may well be investing in real estate in your later years so tell me is that a smart idea or is that something you're better off starting\nIn your twenties thirties and forties\nMy opinion is is better off starting it early\nBecause that's the real estate basically as four different areas of possible game\nThe first is appreciation of property obviously rises in price over time as area around it does as well second profit center is that the ten it increases your equity by essentially helping you pay your mortgage down three is cash flow\nRead better bigger than outlook and depreciation so in order to put all for those two words you really want to get started early\nMhm to be a first time a desperate real estate as you get older I Would say hesitate or perhaps a look at things like we each real estate investment trust that you can basically purchase through an investment advisor more like a a security than a real estate purchased itself\nBut that makes a lot of sense because after all a real estate investment trust is more like buying stock and you're not a landlord and you don't have vacancies you don't have to qualify for a mortgage it can make a lot of sense no matter what your age is\nAbsolutely it's kind of one of those things that if you believe that real estate boats appreciation generates cash flow which\nIt has historically done that's a great way not to be the only one on the hook you know being an individual owner of real estate is is kind of a you know you're the person in a ... year spread out what's hundreds of other people buying larger blocks with investment property and professional property management\nI see so that's good advice here if you are already an older person it might not be the best move to start real estate investing at your age but for all those people who might be a little bit younger than that it can reap great benefits in the years ahead\nAbsolutely interesting fact the last forty years appreciation and we still do it in Virginia area has averaged about three percent per year\nCoincidentally or maybe not the wage growth in our area three percent a year ... so if you believe that our economy is strong enough to keep wage growth unemployment on track [noise]\nThere's no reason that real estate pricing at least closer in shouldn't keep pace with wage increases", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "San Diego", "day": "22"}
