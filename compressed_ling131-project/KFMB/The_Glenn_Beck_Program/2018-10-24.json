the country ... percent of murder sentences sixty percent of traffic ...\nNumber three this is a daily wire almost fifty percent of federal crimes committed near the Mexico border\nA report from the department of justice in twenty fourteen found the following via judicial watch\nAnd it gives the specific statistics\nNumber for illegal immigrants account for nearly Seventy five percent of federal drug sentences and twenty four again this is according to the United states sentencing commission which also found that illegals were involved in nearly Seventeen percent of drug trafficking sensors and over thirty three percent of federal sentences overall\nOr how do you know these people are committing crimes while I don't know about specific individuals but these are the statistics I thought big government leftist watch the pistons\nNumber five a disproportionate amount of illegals are in state prisons Peter cursor now remember the U.S commission on civil rights lawyer review statistics from the government Accountability Office and do Research Center and\nCompared the number of illegals and not illegal in prison for murder related offenses any twenty Fifteen National Review piece some of the findings they're almost Seventy thousand illegal aliens in prison for every one hundred thousand illegals in Arizona\nLet me correct that there were sixty eight point five seven\nAre illegal aliens in prison for every one hundred thousand illegals in Arizona compared to fifty four point oh six citizens and legal non citizens and it goes on but you can imagine what the statistics are\nPersonal knowledge that while comparing murder incarceration rates as an imperfect measurement it's difficult to contend that illegal aliens or more are law abiding by legal residence at least when it comes to major crimes\nBut the more disturbing fact was the approximately two thousand four hundred and thirty illegal aliens who are in prison Jasper homicide related offenses in California alone\n\nNumber six tens of thousands of criminal illegals have been released by ice and aren't large in the country in twenty Fifteen ice released almost twenty thousand illegals that committed sixty four thousand crimes that evolved over twelve thousand drunken driving convictions Seventeen hundred and\nTwenty eight cases of assault two hundred and sixteen kidnappings and more than two hundred homicide remains Laurie convictions and this is why when you have a fool like the mayor of Tallahassee Gillum who says that they will not turn over\nConvicted\nIncarcerated and then fried illegal aliens to be deported by ice they will not turn them over to you understand that Florida you understand what I'm Talking about [noise] you've got a radical coach\nWho wants to be your governor I've got more when I return\n\nAnd not to mention the shedding with backing the carpet three times a week credit with scratching all night long bouncing on the side of the day keeping me awake the whole entire night from all the scratching and chewing it kind of makes you never\nBut you wouldn't know that\nBecause when the president raises it\nAnd he's done a lot of work on the stage for them is Thirteen Ghosts attorney general Jeff Sessions ... the U.S attorneys all across the country when you raise it they blow it off well everyone is not MSL what's the big day I was only a small number yeah everybody's not MS there these insane in Maine arguments\n[laughter] [noise]\nThe hearts of them is Thirteen of extended of Brentwood community and Long Island New York and they've committed horrendous crimes in Virginia on Long Island and in other cities the west coast around LA\nNumber ... century cities have hampered law enforcement of cracking down on gangs the great Heather McDonald documented the frustrations of Los Angeles law enforcement officers all the way back in two thousand for when they couldn't touch known gang members because of their status as illegals\nWe can't even talk about it says are frustrated LAPD captain people are afraid of a backlash from Hispanics and other LAPD commander in a predominantly Hispanic gang infested district size I Would get a firestorm\nOf criticism if I talked about enforcing the immigration law against the illegals\n\nThe issue is that these gang members tended to sneak back into the country even after they were deported for heinous crimes and police officers couldn't enforce immigration laws against them would have to resort to surveilling these gang members until they commit a crime number nine\nCrime is also increased among major cities that are immigration hubs\nDeli wire editor in chief Ben Shapiro's written quote David from the Atlantic no hard core to immigration opponent and a kind of a coup but anyway\nWrote in twenty Fifteen that as a twenty alive and there were twenty five thousand illegal immigrants\nServing murder sentences and nearly three million offenses committed by illegal immigrants between two thousand three and two thousand nine including Seventy thousand sex crimes and hundreds of thousands of other violent crimes\nAfter years of welcome declined from pointed out crime rates are rising in immigration hubs including\nHouston Milwaukee Phoenix San Diego you got that Gloria border you idiot\nAnd New York it was thirty four percent Arizona seventeenth birthday present during those years criminal aliens accounted for thirty eight percent of all murder convictions and the five states have\nCalifornia Texas Arizona Florida and New York well illegal aliens constituted only five point six percent of the total population in those states now there's no denying the fact\nYou've got a guy running for governor Gillum in Florida but doesn't that problem with this\nWas a criminal illegal alien is released from prison rather than having a dead painter do hold on for the feds to deport them Gillum says abolish ice and now we're not gonna work to get a dead painter now think about that Florida\n\nThinking about that ladies and gentlemen this is the official position of the United states the ... Democratic Party the Democratic party it's the official position to abolish ice actually official position that localities in states local and state law enforcement should not work with us\nThey've smeared eyes\nI says and even the border patrol ice protects the interior of the United states\nFrom a legal and criminal immigrants and you're supposed to hate them\nNow you know actual facts if you're watching cable TV is the news parts of cable TV so called\nHe didn't hear any of this instead all your herd all day today and yesterday was trashing Trump\nThat's what you've heard\nYou've heard reporters yell at the Trump do you know for sure there are terrorists among the seven thousand what kind of a stupid question is that\nMy response to the reporter is do you know that every one of the seven thousand haven't committed crimes that none of them are terrorists the whole point is there a legal way only they're not going through the vetting process well the president said they're criminals among them they're terrorists among them well I have no doubt they're all\nCriminals\nKnow what they're doing parents know what they're doing what we have to wait for them to do something\nBut that's not even the point\nThey're not allowed in our country as a matter of federal law\n\nThe media do not have the same compassion for American citizens who violate federal law they don't have that same compassion for an American citizen\nA passion for American citizens who violate federal law\nThey don't have that same compassion for American citizens who may get their taxes wrong or maybe violate Obamacare and\nSo forth and so on\n\nWhat's happened in this country is the Democrat Party in the media have romanticized illegal immigration that romanticized illegal aliens\nThat's the propaganda that's going on in this country\nThat the illegal immigrant is noble or better more hard working then the American citizen\nAnd these fools in the Democratic party in some of the Republican Party but let's be honest really the Democrat Party is a near monopoly on this little legal immigration these photos on the Democratic party these phone calls and the media at least for an island\nWhat\nThey're doing to this country is on parallel it's unparalleled\n\nBelieve a president who calls it like it is we have a president who's trying to address his hands are tied by ridiculous lost his hands are tied by the Democrat Party the media try to beat him down even though they fail\nImmediate desperately wants the Democrats the when the electric\n\nAll the free media the Democrats get incredible they desperately want the Democrats the when the election they reject the results of the twenty sixteen election to the media even heard this Gloria Bolger\nOn CNN's it's twenty sixteen all over again he\nShut up you idiot\n\nWe know the vast majority of these people are Democrats and liberals poll after\nPoll has shown and they can no longer conceal their ideology\n... what kind of people what kind of citizens for illegal aliens to come into your country and they don't know if there's any terrorists and they don't know if there's any criminals what kind of journalists do this sort of fraud and phony that's what do the sort of thing I didn't write\nBack [noise] month\nOpen enrollment for health insurance is here and the deadline is only weeks away you already know there's a healthcare crisis rates have exploded insurance carriers are leaving unexpected medical bills and the duct tape balls are at an all time high and it's only getting worse when we have great news there have been significant changes to the health care law under the new rules you may qualify\nTo get better coverage better benefits the freedom to go to any medical provider you want and saved thousands on your health care starting today license advisors are standing by to take your call but you must act now call us at eight hundred for eight to twenty six thirty one and we'll listen to your needs explain your options and get you into the perfect\nPlan even if you're short on time called and less schedule a time to speak at your convenience\nCalled buy health insurance dot com at eight hundred ... two twenty six thirty one your family's help is our number one priority that number once again is eight hundred for a two twenty six thirty one call now eight hundred bore eight to twenty six thirty one\nVoting is you're right you're right to to voting is your boy it opens the door to awareness information in democracy not registered no problem it's easy bitten registered to vote that he a dot dot org calm ... re four five the beat me voter information\nDid they ... not ... not done that election don't forget your right your boy you decide the\nPecker parked filled to capacity then imagine you have the microphone you have the chance to tell them all why they should do business with you you don't have to imagine anymore\nSeven sixty K.
