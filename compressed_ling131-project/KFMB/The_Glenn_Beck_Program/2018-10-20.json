rough two years and I have an idea\nI'm Talking to your string color and I said that a good idea that they should do is they could show Detroit which ran by businessmen like Donald Trump stay in Henry Ford and the strength that Detroit once had and then what Democrat liberal take over\nAnd how it just falls into corruption in squalor and just show them side by side and then even better for my own state I think they don't tell their mouth\nIf we let politician and take over you get Detroit if you let Republicans take over\nAnd have ideas we get Foxconn and he's beautiful jobs that we're getting a little shocked and I yeah I Wish that more and more and more and they don't\n[noise] yeah and you know Josh I'm Glad you brought this up because I I Love Wisconsin and I think that a year Governor Scott Walker has done some great jobs than it is an incredible turnaround what he's been able to achieve in that state and of course they all said that people would be fired and people would be starving in the streets and no one would get an education and it's been phenomenal\nYeah we saw this constantly remember and Madison there were all yes and that took on our capital and we fought right short and look at what we've been able to accomplish that strikes is second half of the tournament Donald Trump if it if we fight the good fight and vote on November sixth that'll happen\nThank you Josh thank you for the call appreciate it thanks for coming into the market within show ya I vividly remember those mobs taking over the capital occupying the capital of Madison during the early years of the Scott Walker or the governorship of ... that was back when I was working with Andrew Breitbart and Andrew Andrew got on the plane\nThe next day he sent us all a text message I'm going to Madison in the winter\nIn Southern California guy Andrew why are you going in Madison looked at what's going on there look at the mobs look at the riots look at the ...\nLook at the Scott Walker needs

is not going to win the Senate seat\nIn Texas [noise]\nAnd it's all made for TV we've seen this game before every\nTwo years every election they tell us about the new rising star in Texas has finally going to take paint Texas blue you know when Hillary Clinton was a deciding not to do any sort of polling or appearances in Wisconsin Pennsylvania well not Pennsylvania she did appears in Wisconsin or Michigan\nOr that she was actually at that time\nContemplating spending more money in Texas because she was so sure she was going to win Texas\nGeorgia and Arizona and she ... she wanted to to this was going to be a transformative election with Hillary Clinton and the remaking of the map\nWe hear this all the time the ... but it's not true\nIn Michigan there's this guy John James last poll there showed him in single digits now this guy a running against Debbie Stabenow I mean he is he's a former military uh did combat in Iraq\nUh this guy is African American this guy is conservative this guy is right on all the issues here I Want to play a little bit of of him because because this tells you exactly how the media so corrupt\nBecause all they care about with federal Rourke it has to do with two things it has to do with forcing this fake narrative\nThat the Democrats are really I'm not the Texas is moving blue Texas is going to be a Democrat state Texas is not the same Texas because the Democratic demographic changes because uh uh because of all of the radical conservative policies that have hurt that said which I haven't I mean\nPeople are flocking to Texas people are flocking to Texas because of the economy there is one of the only state to persevere through the eight ... years of ... because they had Republicans in charge of that state there's no way that people have Texas would reverse that trend but also because they hate Ted Cruz\nThe media hates Ted Cruz because he's so good so smart and so conservative so they're they're they're puffing\nDiverse that trend but also because I hate Ted Cruz the media hates Ted Cruz because he's so good so smart and so conservative so they're they're they're puffing this beta will work guy up and meanwhile listen I got a little bit

I Want to hear from you are you sensing not as well or your friends telling you that or is it quite the opposite of what I think that I'm seeing right now the women especially women and Republican

point out the difference between me and the\nPilot pilot act out they have it off at ... am it what it says it was ... and I I cannot believe that there are people out there that belt or act it out you\nThank you ... you made a great point and coming from your perspective as a feminist from ... or ... you know growing up in the feminist movement as a baby boomer of this whole thing is the\nOpposite of empowering women it's painting all women as victims I'm Larry O'Connor the mark within show\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations in one cell gas for a little bit less you go to that one it just makes sense every little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save\nExplodes [noise] uh the the the best\nGift you can give to a young person in your life who are just getting out of college maybe or starting to establish themselves in the world would be a subscription to while the podcasts of your favorite talk radio hosts\nA because that's where things happen that trip things change so ladies thank you but I Am lifting the or the gender band here I Want to talk about this\nThey're calling it a caravan [noise] what what is that a caravan a caravan sounds like it's some sort of a fun little vacation\nWhere all you and you and your mate so you know you you you all take your separate cars and you follow each other down the expressway to get to the campsite oh\nCome on we're going to ... to the beach but it's all ... and up to the mountains will go fishing it's going to be a candidate it's terrific have you seen these pictures have you seen the video\nOf the they all have by the way everyone in this uh this migration this this is the invasion\nThis reprehensible international crisis ... make no mistake is absolutely organized these things don't spontaneously happen it's impossible\nAnd if you if you go to your favorite search engine and type in Honduran caravan organizers they'll give you the list of several names couple of them just got arrested in Guatemala the Guatemalan government arrested them and send them back to Honduras\nBut there's still people organizing this of course that have you noticed that all the people in this they all have brand new backpacks\nWeird isn't that odd\nThey all brand new backpacks full of all their personal belongings and they're all waving the flag of their nation our Salvador Guatemala and Honduras and they're demanding entry into Mexico and they are saying to whatever reporter will talk to them we are going to the United states of America and you can't stop us\n[noise]\nAnd if you listen to most of our elected officials guess what their rights we can't stop them what are we going to do you know the Democrats and sadly many Republicans on Capitol Hill don't hesitate to criticize\nPresident Trump for his policy of securing our border enforcing immigration laws as they are written prosecuting criminals who break our immigration laws deporting\nCriminals in this country for violating our immigration laws\nIt's a very clear cut policy by the way one that believe it or not used to be embraced by Democrats too and Republicans [noise]\nUntil\nThey figured out that they could get votes and or campaign donations respectively\nFor being an international list for being all about open borders for being compassionate [noise]\nUh you know what's compassionate compassionate does not enabling people to continue\nTo follow the same broken destructive patterns that they have year after year after decade after decade you know what's compassionate wanting the Honduran people to be empowered to alter and change the Honduran government or the Mexican government\nYou're terrified for your life in Honduras I get it gets what we were terrified for our lives hundreds of years ago here in America we made a change [noise] but they remember when we all love the Arab Spring where we had people rise up against their governments\nAcross the middle east because they were fed up and they were done I is it time maybe for a Central American spring why is the default obligation\nFor America and for the mainstream media to be all things are awful in these countries\nCome when we got shipped back why is that suddenly the definition of compassion why is that suddenly the definition of\nBeing a real American oh if you don't open up your borders and allow anyone into this country you're anti American you're not really upholding American ideals are values are you kidding me\nSince when and how many by the way this is a caravan of four thousand if we let them in do you think that'll stop it hasn't for the last five years it hasn't they keep\nComing why because we left that man [noise]\nThat's an earlier today I actually got to speak with a Democrat Senator Ben carton\nOr he is the senator in Maryland here in the greater Washington area is running for reelection and I asked him that I said you know what what should we do to stop these people from coming into the country led listen 'cause this is very this is very indicative of of how they think and how they talk what should we do to stop that should we stop that [noise]\nWatch when one of the reasons we've had a program to try to improve the living conditions in Central America oh it's been supportive bipartisan but Democrats\nWe've had a program to try to improve the living conditions in Central America oh it's been supportive bipartisan but Democrats or Republicans it's rooted in President Trump's budget or we want to improve the living conditions for those of our neighbors who live in Central America\nHere and he goes on on this and and think about what she's saying here and this is this is considered to be the the the highest level of statesmanship in Washington DC\nWe've got thousands and thousands of people who make no Bones Are secret about the fact that they are a demanding entry into our country because they hate the country they're living in\nAnd the politically correct acceptable wise old man on Capitol Hill response is well how many billions can we get to that government down there to improve conditions\nAnd by the way we've sent billions and billions and billions and billions already and somehow it hasn't solved the problem\nAnd and think about what the basis of this argument is to stop people from invading our borders we must throw billions of dollars to their countries it's extortion\n[noise] they\nWere driving them we're bribing the government's down there to get control of their own citizenship and then you get the Mexican government leadership and for that matter Honduran that all of these countries in Central America where their citizenship is leaving in droves to go to another country\nAnd they're angry at us for saying no they can't come in let's say about that for a minute you weren't elected official you've been elected by your population in El Salvador in in Guatemala in Mexico you've been elected to represent them\nYou've been elected to run the affairs of the country\nAnd the people who elected you are leading your country\nTo go elsewhere and your response is not gee maybe we're doing something wrong maybe we need to fix our country no your responses how dare you America not allow my citizens to fully my in apt to corrupt government to come into your country\nThese countries spend more time focusing on our policies then fixing now and then you've got a Democrat like Ben Carson who enables vets who enabled zip by throwing more money at it\n\nSo I came back we went back and forth on this earlier today\nAnd if you want you can get the whole interview over at a my radio station W male\nDot com but I came back around and I said All right listen I Know you want to throw a bunch of money at this government and you want to do all of these things on the ground to keep them from going but that's not going to stop these four thousand okay there on the way\nAnd frankly whatever money you send down there you've already sent plenty and that hasn't fix the problem I don't know how much more money you got to spend\nBut let's focus on what's happening right now 'cause you have a lot of criticism for President Trump for saying he's going to send the military down there for saying he's going to cut funding if these countries don't stop their own citizens from playing yeah you have all this criticism of him for actually trying to protect our borders so what would you do your senator for crying out loud\nWhat the solution how do you stop these people from coming into our country when they reach our border what are we supposed to do\n[noise] but I don't know if I'll agree with you on on that statement I I I I've been embedded with the FBI down in Central America I I Know how dangerous the\nBirds are by the way I real fast let me just ... these ... I had just said that there's a criminal element that there are dangerous gang members who are coming along with the than we know that to be true he's telling me that it's not true\nIt was fine you did you you were you reach your own conclusion I report you decide do you think maybe there was a violent criminal element over the last several years that came along and cross the border\nWith these unaccompanied minors don't or they were all seven year old children\nReally they all had tattoos ... we quibble\nA I have interviewed a gang member who actually came to the United states has set up sister gangs including in Maryland so I I I understand the danger factor as it relates to these gang activities\nI think most of the of the families that show up in our border or people who are see themselves as desperate they're trying to escape Central America and in some cases they have a legitimate fear of their lives should be able to seek asylum\nRight okay so fine so so let's say they're coming to this country to seek asylum what do we do", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "San Diego", "day": "20"}
