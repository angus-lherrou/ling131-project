way the way that it's All right along with the president comes out now now all of a sudden we're talking about birthright citizenship ...\nWhat do we look at this from the from the legal perspective or how does this all shakeout ya\nWell this has been talked about by conservatives especially over the last many years now a but it's it's never been talked about in the way that President Trump has said that is that he wants to and thinks she can do it by executive order that is having a you know people who\nAre illegal in this country will give birth\nBecome citizens she thinks the jacket of order will do it unfortunately is not correct but I mean he's just not Eighteen Ninety eight the Dred Scott a cage was ruled upon by the Supreme Court and absolutely uh shut the precedent that yes um\n[noise] you know all persons born in in the United states really are subject to the jurisdiction here in the United states for Citizens United states and uh where they reside but you have so much

and the Supreme Court again ruled on that I don't see it happening uh yes it can happen by constitutional amendment\nMaybe Congress can squeeze in legislation on the Supreme Court will buy it but quite frankly I just don't see it and quite frankly in the executive order which the policy order\nA subject to change by any president it's going to get to the Supreme Court it probably won't leave a

not true\nI you know it's interesting because he he he look I get that this is this conversation is coming up because we've seen this migrant caravan we\nUnderstand that there are a number of

called our police and as I told you um well I'll tell you what he wrote [noise]\nHe wrote this book was created for young people with the hope that it will help them look upon the police as friends guardians protectors who work hard and tirelessly to keep our world safe and secure and as with all his books\nHe asked me to write a little preface to them [noise]\nAnd um [noise] here's what it says\nGrowing up as a young child and then teenager on the streets of Philadelphia in the twenties and thirties [noise]\nMy father Jack into fond appreciation for the role of the police [noise] my parents taught us from a young age to respect the police and they're difficult job in fact two of my uncles served in the Philadelphia police department uncle willy was a motorcycle officer an uncle Jack was a traffic officer\nMy father is a deeply patriotic man with a great deal of common sense you understand set in all walks of life and in every profession man's imperfections present themselves\nBut having witnessed recent events in related news reports painting police officers police departments and extremely negative liked he felt a book especially geared to our young people was essential so that they learn to respect law and order\nIs it not plain English is not as clear as can be that it does not include alliums that does not include foreigners that does not include families are within bachelors or foreign ministers\nSo the author of citizenship clause intended to count foreigners alien to those born to a bachelor's foreign ministers as outside the jurisdiction of the United states that senator Jacob Howard he knew as his reference to natural law indicates\nThat the Republican base has little are Republican basis for citizenship\nIs consent ten cent of the country you can't south and my great\nYou can't claim jurisdiction because you happen to walk into the United states senator Lyman Trumbull chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a powerful supporter the fourteenth amendment\nRemarked on may thirtieth Eighteen sixty six that the jurisdiction\nClause includes those quote not only allegiance to anybody else it's only those persons I'm quoting who come completely within our jurisdiction course subject to our laws that we think of making citizens and they're going to be no objection to the proposition that such person should be citizens\nThat this was familiar language the civil rights act of Eighteen sixty six\nDefined citizens to the United states has quote all persons born in the United states and not subject to any foreign power excluding Indians not taxed unquote\nNot subject to any foreign power it is universally agreed that the immediate impulse for the passage of the fourteenth amendment was the constitutional wise constitutional eyes the civil rights act of Eighteen sixty six\nIt was an attempt to put the question of citizenship\nAnd matters of federal civil rights beyond the reach of simple congressional majorities that said it's clear the idea of allegiance not subject to any foreign power quote unquote was central to understanding the jurisdiction clause of the fourteenth them\nDown back what what is the bottom line here what's ... none of this they wanted to make certain that former slaves\n\nWill be treated as citizens of the United states\nBecause certain states we're still resistant\nThey wanted to make sure that former slaves would be citizens of the United states they exempted Indians because Indians still certainly back then were often considered citizens of particular tribes\n\nBut these actually were very forward looking individuals they specifically excluded aliens and foreigners now more on this when I return\nAre you worried your identity could be held hostage you should be

begins extending\nA offers of citizenship to Indian tribes or most of which agree so you're a citizen of a tribe and they citizen of the United states [noise]\nThere's a Supreme Court opinion and Eighteen Ninety eight United States versus one Kim arc we've talked about this I've written about it\nAnd that declared the fourteenth amendment adopted the common law definition of birthright citizenship [noise] um but the decision conferred birthright citizenship when a child of legal residents of the United states\nThat the majority is broad enough to include children born illegally in the United states as well as legal immigrants but that's not what the court decided it wasn't even presented to the court and so of course you have individuals\nFor trying to read it in to the court has never decide\n[noise] that illegal alien that is the children of illegal aliens for automatically [noise] citizens of the United states think of the absurdity of [noise] those who passed the amendment specifically rejected the idea we know who would apply to the freed slaves\nAnd we know that in the Nineteen sixties at some point the interpretation change for the executive branch if\nYou or someone you know is struggling with addiction please call this toll free number\nFor a hundred and Thirty years there's an uninterrupted stream of case law including cases written by the one came all arc justice Horace Gray saying that if you come here without consent\nAnd you do not have legal status it is in the most literal and physical sense as if you were standing outside of our boundaries in terms of access\nTo the courts in terms of rights in terms of everything so literally you are not on our soil and and that is settled law so when Congress nearly cut and paste the text of the fourteenth amendment in Nineteen fifty two they could've never fathom that such an egregious argument\nThat someone who is in Nineteen fifty to the constitution was not interpreted as giving citizenship to the children of illegal aliens\nExactly it's like saying proved to me that the fourteenth amendment didn't mean to mandate gay marriage well I mean no one would have thought that and and and that's the thing here what are the best I can see from my research is that\nFor most of our history we didn't have too many illegal aliens in the early part of the twentieth century it was in the sixties and seventies and eighties it started to grow\nAnd there was never an active decision what happened was because most people\nUm are born here who who are born here are obviously legitimate citizens and we believe in birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants hospitals never asked any questions and H H death on the Social Security administration never clamp down on it on the back end how do I know this is true\nBecause everyone agrees that children of diplomats are excluded right I mean that's the whole point that they are not subject to American law they everybody agrees\nChildren a diplomat tourists\nWho just come to the United states I mean real tourists not not the the shame that we see taking place in some of these places but just because you're a tourist in the United states you have to give birth doesn't mean that you then a seed a burst birthright citizenship to the United states if you say from Canada\nExactly exactly I mean that's that's the point so you know there is evidence that there are plenty of children of diplomats that are also being handed a citizenship papers and the path administer agents had been extremely lax\nAnd in that case everyone agrees they're not entitled to it so again this is a passive act Trump is actually restoring the real law I'm this dates back to the U.S this as grains attorney general or just a couple of years after the fourteenth amendment passed he said very clearly\nThat this means people subject to complete jurisdiction not aliens with parents born abroad um there were two other cases before then it said the same thing this justice pray overturned that inexplicably and this is just the stuff that nobody is willing to talk about\nNow let's make something very very clear about this they say it's a dubious legality for the president had to do this was an executive order let's walk through this together so\nIn the Nineteen sixties and seventies the bureaucracy starts concerning citizenship when the children of illegal aliens not based on the statute not based on the constitution it takes hold throughout the federal bureaucracy who's in charge of the federal bureaucracy Daniel ...\n[noise] the further than\nThe president you know so it presidents and you know what I\nI I'm going to stop that some of the river then including the leader of the Republicans in the house they say you can't change the constitution by executive order you know that's what Obama was doing we don't do that kind of stuff\nYour point earlier he's not changing the constitution by executive order he's not re interpreting the constitution by executive order he's getting the executive branch under control and saying this is what the fourteenth amendment means\nThis is what I wrote my book stolen sovereignty literally we have stolen sovereignty the executive branch made this decision imagine if the people would have voted or Congress would have conducted a vote\nWe're going to give citizenship to hundreds of thousands of people every year who break into our country against their consent no one would have ever voted for that that was a bureaucratic creation\nAnd again let's zoom back to asylum to many other changes Trump is making he's merely merely restoring\nThe constitution and the statutes he's overturning the other administrative\nA lawless acts of previous administrations you know very well marketing and you do this as well as conservative review we are not in lockstep with everything that any party does we'll call the president now if we disagree with something\nBut everything he has done an immigration is actually the base statute is well past administrations have done this a verdict that he's changing\nSo I mean as the head of the executive branch he doesn't need a statute or to reverse what the executive branch did without a statute doesn't\nKnow know unless Congress the only thing that could happen if Congress with their naturalization power could explicitly say so give US citizenship to all legal they they could do that\nBut until they get ... isn't the problem though that the courts might aren't the courts out of control even these so called constitutional is on the court [noise] um\nYou know to say my on popular opinion here I mean this was my concern about Gorsuch and I think we've seen that in a very similar sovereignty case and divide the sessions um I I don't know if we have five votes I doubt Roberts will be with\nUs but I don't I I don't I don't think a cabinet would be with us\nI I think yeah I mean I I Know Tom is would be based on his past writings and his understanding of sovereignty but but here's the broader question\nIssuing citizenship birth certificates that is an executive power who's to say that the judiciary has the final say this is not something you know IBM versus Microsoft case or controversy this is the most foundational national question\nAnd the notion that we're going to see that to the courts\nBut the problem is the courts sees it for themselves look what look what they did to the president when he was simply trying to have a six month respite so we could vet people coming here from six\nMajority Muslim countries that are spreading terrorism in those countries where there's civil war in those countries it didn't even included majority Muslim countries where the vast majority of Muslim population and look what happened in these federal district court some circuit courts here you have to hold your breath\nOh in the end by the way since Trump won in Trump via why in the Supreme Court subsequent lower courts have come back and basically repeal that Supreme Court decision\nThey're just totally disregarding it and putting injunction on very similar policy this is what happens in I\nI don't know the answer for this one as a society as a body politic both the executive branch and member of the Congress of both parties say let's see what the courts say well I mean if the courts are not a concurrent power side by side but standing over then we have North Korea and there's no elections\nSo this is the problem yeah I don't think this will do well in the courts but again they would say the same thing if Congress were to do it\nStill elections so this is the problem yeah I don't think this will do well in the courts but again they would say the same thing if Congress or to do it just last week a district judge said that a statute of Congress\nMaking it illegal for local communities to for federal immigration law is unconstitutional not the president statute so I don't know what you do with that\nMhm [noise] well here we are but one of the things I'm very pleased about is it sounds like the president is taking this on now I hear some of the race Bayer is on cable TV well actually cable TV filled with race players and I heard one of them said recently that today\nThe president brought this up to ... division president even bring it up he was asked about by by a reporter who was interviewing him who got word that they are quietly looking at this and the counsel's office or maybe the department of justice even said I don't know how you got that information and they turn it into what race issue of course they're going to write\nMark you know it's tragic about the race issue\nAnd and this is really ironic and really said the fourteenth amendment was crafted to ensure that the declaration of independence would actually the vision would actually be actual alive and the bare bones minimum writes life liberty and property will be given to black American citizens that should've been citizens for many years they were here for centuries\nAnd instead that is being back there dies to subvert the actual meeting and disenfranchise\nAll American citizens black and white and everything else at the hand of of of illegal immigrants it it makes no sense as a\n... minute let me just say that I have to go so let's let's be abundantly clear about that amendment was for black Americans\nThat amendment that amendment was for former slaves that's it\nDone and it was to make sure that they were treated as equals citizens the whole point of the civil the post civil war amendments was to protect\nFormer slaves had nothing to do with illegal alien same sex marriage this when that when are they are nothing whatsoever so the left pours a gender the

on election day in Michigan tell us about your race but the key issues are and your opponent to of\nCourse well ah the key thing about this race we have the opportunity to ... get forward I'm a combat veteran a wire veteran West Point graduate or who served in Iraq and Operation Iraqi freedom over seven a guy who's seven hundred and fifty hours combat\nOr over there and I came back to grow my family business\nUm for thirty five million dollar thirty seven million but most importantly created a hundred shops and around the country I Believe that having experience a in combat helped me to understand national security\nI'm In a way that my opponent camp and understand veteran issues in a way that my opponent has failed to but also I'm a business standpoint understanding how to grow our economy but also create economic opportunity for people who have been failed for\nDecades my opponent is a forty three year career politician who spent Twenty years in Washington in Eighteen years as a senator and in that Eighteen years she's only accomplish getting five her\nYour career politician who spent Twenty years in Washington in Eighteen years as a senator and in that Eighteen years she's only accomplish getting five her co sponsored bills into law three of which are to rename buildings I truly believe that we have folks in Washington or legislating regulating teachers are not going to be a part of\nAnd that this will not change until until we stand up and take our government back\n[laughter] that's amazing how long has she been in the Senate he's been in the center for Eighteen years and she's been in state government forever to right\nYes she was actually I'm a first elected a forty three years ago in Nineteen Seventy five one nasty near the Vietnam War officially ended yet a number of weeks ago she stood in front of a veteran service organization\nAnd said that she was unaware of veterans issues that they weren't all her radar screen\nWe have been at war over a decade and a half and we still have a welcome to Vietnam veterans back properly and this didn't make a bet on her priority list that's unacceptable I get to Washington I'm going to make sure that we prioritize our veterans that we prioritize healthcare would prioritize education to make sure that everybody has access to the American dream\nNow your website is John James for Senate dot com so people want to contribute to your campaign all over the country and people in Michigan want to get involved in the last week the campaign they go to John James for Senate dot com correct\nThat's right they can also follow me on Facebook and Twitter at jobs and and I mean let me tell you I'm this racism play with my candidacy\nOut when we first started out we were twenty three points out and I as of last by age that's going down but as we all know the liberals have done a wonderful job\nOf shaming people and bullying people into not expressing their opinions and so given the fact that straight ticket voting is not no longer allowed in Michigan and the fact that conservatives don't poll we vote I Believe that we even closer than that\nUm the last quarter we always Debbie Stabenow Bruce point six million are three point six million to her one point eight or ... up there and between October first and October seventeenth\nBecause of uh of your listeners in some very faithful grassroots army um folks were on the state and around the country we raised two million dollars to her a four hundred and Seventy one thousand we have the momentum and his race and uh by your help and assistance or we're going to win this thing up to ...\n[noise]\nHow many are telling me about the the two or three or four issues that you think are paramount\nUh well I I mentioned them a about veterans' issues I Believe that our veterans are facing\nNow let me let me let me address it this way economically the president seems to be doing the the right thing your your opponent opposed the tax cuts I assume you would have supported them\nAbsolutely your opponent\nSupports a massive bureaucracy with massive regulations without a legislative authority from Congress that that affects Democrats Republicans and every kind of business whether it's car manufacturing or small businesses I assume you support the the direction in which the administration is going\nAbsolutely and this is part of the problem uh right now uh you have people in Washington my Debbie Stabenow who are trying to legislate a ... legislate industries they'd never run a business before and right now the over burdensome regulation the over taxation\nIs creating a environments that are actually shipping jobs off\nA two to places like China and Mexico in Turkey a and then selling those goods into compete with us or that they're going
