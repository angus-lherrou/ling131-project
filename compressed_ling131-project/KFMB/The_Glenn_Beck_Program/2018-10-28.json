the world\nJust happens to be Salem, Massachusetts where in sixteen Ninety to the infamous which trial took place\nIn that year some three hundred twenty six years ago two hundred people were accused of practicing witchcraft and twenty of them were executed\nBut the years since I've been very kind to Salem because now it's a great town and a booming real estate market it's location just north of Boston and right on the water is a top destination for homebuyers but to those people know about its past\nWhile yes yes they do so let's find out all about Salem now and it's real estate with a local

hot\nSo Pam do people really moved to Salem because of its be wishing past\nAh it's actually huge and people didn't live here because of that we have a large population which believe it or not is a real religion people don't realize you're kidding no no and we had a lot of a story and things that cater to that population here so it is a big draw\nIs that right so a typical homebuyer comes to your office and says I'd like to see what's available in our price range in Salem, Massachusetts how does that conversation go does the which thing actually come up during your talk with them\n[noise] comes up a little bit to be honest with you but most of our history is based on merit kind and um you know are Eighteen century architecture\nI see so tell us a little bit about that what what I find if I was looking for a home in Salem and if I was looking for some of the local attractions\nWell homes and families can range anywhere from things that we're both at sixteen hundred wow too you know converted laughing downtown to war with actual maple ... level homes\nI see and you mentioned its maritime passed I imagine you have a Lindy interesting seaport area\nOh it absolutely stunning in fact I don't know if you realize sailing supposed to be the capital of Massachusetts\nIs that right it is but uh fortunately our harbor wasn't enough\nInteresting so as we mentioned Pam Halloween is this coming Wednesday when you see a lot of visitors to Salem because of his past involving the witch trials\nFor sure [laughter] Eric tour buses throughout the month of October but Halloween day we can easily double our population if not more\nIs that right stretch for that one day\nSo if I come there and I'm interested in sort of learning more about the witch trials are there things to see are there places to go\nOn many places to go many tourists that care toward a felony or local cemetery that you have a memorial marker if there are museums in reenactments reenactments\nYeah [laughter]

bed\nSnowing yourself going into the transaction can shine simulate those dark little corners of mortgage lending scary things might lead to come out to make you feel uncomfortable\nThat's coming up on our special show scary thing [noise]\nBut first it's time for our smart home technology report\nSingle one of his does every single\nDay right there and our very own homes charging our smartphones it's an important topic because after all so much of our lives and our real estate happens on our phones these days\nSo you need to keep that phone all charged up but you know how phones keep getting better and better well part of those improvements involve charging improvements that can help make that daily chores easier and faster than ever\nThere are two types of new charging jak you need to know about one is high speed charging the other is wireless charging we'll talk about both of them starting with high speed the company Qualcomm came out with what it calls quick charge a few years ago and many of the more recent phones habit\nBasically a charges your phone from zero to eighty percent in about a half hour now that's really fast and then this beep slows down to protect the battery and the rest of the charge takes about sixty minutes\nNow not all phones have it but you can find a list of the ones that do that the Qualcomm quick charge website just search quick charge\nOkay so quick charge is great but you still have to plug it in right well right but that's another area where the tech has gotten better\nThe old us be many conductors word the industry standard but you had to plug the men right side up or they wouldn't go in\nToday's us be seeking actors can be plugged in right side up or upside down and they work just fine same goes for the very latest thunder both connection called ... three\nOkay so that's high speed charging now wireless charging wireless chargers don't plug into your phone at all rather there cradle or desks or square blocks and when you get home just put your phone on it\nDone no plugs no cable just put the phone down and let the charging begin\nWell knowing yourself going into the transaction could shine some

scary thing our annual tribute to Halloween which is this coming Wednesday and of course one of the scariest things in real estate is coming up with a down payment down in our first\nHour we talked about new research from the Urban Institute about barriers to homeownership and how coming up with that down payment is so frightening to some people\nThey don't even try to buy a house but those fears are largely unfounded because sure some people are not ready to buy but many who are\nThey think they need more money than they really do and amazing as it may seem most people don't know that their state or county or city probably has down payment assistance programs ready willing and able to help homebuyers get into that house\nLet's talk about that now joining us once again is Rob ... with the organization down payment resource Rob launched downpayment resource to connect eligible home buyers and eligible properties with hard to find a down payment programs Rob thanks for coming back on real estate today\nIt's great to be with you again okay so Rob let's talk about those down payment assistance programs\nFirst of all it's not just for first time buyers every time correct\nCorrect and I say that for two reasons one is that\nPart of that is because the definition that's normally used for first time homebuyer is that you haven't found a home the last three years so you could about over the past and not own a home for three years after these purposes is still ate the first time homebuyer requirement\nAlso there are in our database probably about thirty six percent of the programs do any first time homebuyer requirement\nInteresting and another thing Rob about down payment assistance programs [noise] you don't have to necessarily heavy starter wage to qualify I understand that people can actually be making a really good amount of money and still get the assistance\nThat's absolutely correct a lot of it has to do with where you live because they a household income limits on these programs they not only the area from program the program but they vary from state to state city to city region to region so if you live in high cost areas\nThe area and median income is higher than low cost areas so depending on where you live you might be able to make over a hundred thousand dollars in your household\nAnd still qualify for one of these programs\nThat is amazing so Rob\nHow to our listeners learn more about down payment resource and the down payment help that might be available to them\nWell they can go with the down payment resource dot com and\n... button that says find programs and to her about six or eight pieces of information about their\nHousehold\nAnd then the festival tell how many programs are eligible for and tell us about those grabs\nCat ... find that money most importantly right by that you're eligible for money you better at a pass to get there and and it's just that it will tell them that they'll tell them not only where the where where to find the money where the participating lenders participating education spiders and so forth\nI see syrup let me back up just for one minute if I learned that I Am eligible for down payment assistance they don't just write me a check right all that happens during the mortgage application process\nExactly exactly so it's really important when you're looking for a home to find a lender as Leonard before you go out looking for actually that that's the first step because you don't want to get excited about trying to figure out if you go for Ford it or not right\nBut when you're talking to different lenders thing that you are they sure do is ask what downpayment assistance programs they participate in\nThat I like to participate and have lenders that don't necessarily participate in every program the most large metro areas have dozens of programs so really find out first when he talked the lenders how that can help it with these programs\nSo really find out first when you talk to the lenders can ... it ... the programs\nThat is great advice and Rob I really appreciate you coming on the show today and talking about the latest report barriers to homeownership by the Urban Institute\nAnd also the ways that down payment resource can help people find the money they need to put down on a house thank you for being here\nI guess David

brand name products company Proctor and gamble makes a lot more things than that\nBy the way a diapers or big with them toilet paper paper towels it goes on and on and on and so those brand name items\nFor the first time in a decade or really moving up in price and the quantity sizes are shrinking with a lot of products at the same time is what you pay if the checkout is going up\nAnd so this time right now is the strongest and probably a decade\nFor the argument that I make that you should buy private label or store brand instead of buying the brand name because I mean who's money is it's your money\nAnd so I'm very experimental\nWith private labels and tried different ones and we accept or reject based on a basically a collection of opinions within the family\nTeeth so that's another

I'm from two different companies I work for the past\nUm one that's currently sitting about Eighteen thousand some change and the other one around seven thousand um of course a longer work for them and the company I currently work for does not offer a four O. one K. [noise] so I guess my question is what do I do with this money to ...\nWhere do you do have the option of just leaving it and were those big companies small or in between that you were with before\nOkay so the one with Eighteen thousand is on I'm most concerned with a smaller company and I'm worried if they go out of business what happens to that money for\nThe money would be okay and the four oh one K. but if it's a small business there's a different issue and that small businesses tend to have very high cost for one case right so I was scared at all that money out\nQuickly and move it to one of the low cost providers and have an IRA with one of them the three big low cost providers for having IRAs are vanguard Charles Schwab and fidelity investments [noise]\nOkay than we have them and let me tell you something do not call the administrator of the four oh one K. and say hey I Want to um move this money out and do an iron they'll say great what address you want to send you a check never take a check 'cause what they do\nIs they would serve track thirty six hundred dollars from the check they send you and send it to the IRS says withholding\nAnd you have to make up that thirty six hundred in the next sixty days or you end up paying massive tax for not being able to make that up so what you do with whoever you would go with\nIs they'll do paperwork that will move the money directly from the old employer's plan straight into wherever you're going to have the IRA\nAnd you recommend an IRA or the Ross are it\nNow you have to I just I hear you talk about you know I just thought\nYou said the story is you can't take money there was in a traditional four one K.\nAnd put it into a Roth without having a big tax bill because all that money they don't want him was pre tax correct so you go into a traditional i._r._a. without money not a Roth IRA okay and you can over time migrate the money\nFrom the traditional to her office you could afford to pay tax on money each year or you just know you got money that they are that's going to grow over the years that you're gonna have to pay tax on Sunday so let's talk about the other one the seven thousand is that in a big employers plan or small\nA it's a very large employer or their trail the stock exchange so\nIt was a big employer the odds favor that that will be an extremely low cost plan probably lower than you could find in an IRA okay so are the only exception to that would be if they have that money administered\nBy an insurance company for them the four one K. or buy a bank\nIt's it's it's it's just through one of the three that you mentioned\nEarlier and you could just leave at seven behind him move the eight\nBank it's it's it's it's just through one of the three that you mentioned\nEarlier than you could just leave at seven behind and move the Eighteen\nOkay and then as far as contributing to that ... and you're able to contribute straight to the IRA versus trying to go through that\n... a great question so let's say let's keep those simple I in fact let me let me really think about this who is the company that administers the plan for the big publicly traded company used to work for its vanguard so if you wanted to keep it simple\nUm move both of them to ban guard and an IRA\nAnd just be done with the old employers for one case 'cause if it's with vanguard the costs will be low enough as an individual anyway and then you've got the simplification of just having an IRA there and then at vanguard open a raw for any future contributions to you all have the twenty five to grow\nIn a vanguard IRA\nAnd then you open a new account with vanguard for Ross in any current or future contributions he may go into the raw\nOkay and then those can be so just so I'm Sorry I I'm not a hundred percent up to date on all these states but a raw is post tax correct\nExactly yeah and you're already going to have twenty five grand that center pre tax account you want to have money in a post tax accountant or raw truly great to have a mix of both but tilted more towards the Ross\nThis will be a way for you to do it you simplify your life you just have an IRA vanguard a Roth IRA vanguard old money and the IRA new money and the Roth IRA and that would be a good way for you to build up money going forward\nChris is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Chris\nHey Clark thanks for
