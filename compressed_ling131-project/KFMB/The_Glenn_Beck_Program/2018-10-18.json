Michael Moore\nDuring his weekly general audience and the St Patrick's square now I don't know the pope who doesn't read current events doesn't read newspapers maybe didn't know Michael Moore was and Michael Moore simply worked his way to the front and how to what the pope is if he was having a meeting with him Michael\nMoore is a left wing radical extremist he's a a contributor Planned Parenthood that kills about three thousand developing babies every day he's a ah certainly an individual that does not reflect American values hard work perseverance fear of God love of country so if the pope knowing\nThey are certainly an individual that does not reflect American values hard work perseverance fear of God love of country so if the pope knowingly unwittingly met with Michael Moore I got a problem with that because especially is abortion feelings but nonetheless until I find out if the pope knew who he was and\nIt's hard to criticize him and secondly and lastly big fight with a couple of weeks ago with Kevin ... is largely over\nBut I did some statistical work on what was one with a cabin all Brett Kavanaugh and what lies ahead the Supreme Court which I've not had the honor of appearing before takes about eighty cases a year\nAnd the nation's highest court decides another fifty cases without oral arguments general unanimously\nAnd they normally take cases where there's a conflict between the Thirteen circuits that is if the second circuit as a conflict with sex or the night with the seven they'll take a case to resolve the conflict but just keeping your mind eighty cases a year they\nTake for oral arguments eighty cases each year by contrast the U.S circuit court of appeals handled fifty one thousand eight hundred and thirty two cases in a ... month period fifty one thousand eight hundred and thirty two compared to eighty\nSo if you throw on top of that the millions of cases and the ... district courts\nYou're talking about maybe a million cases below the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court and handles eighty cases so whether it's the hot button issues of immigration or gun control or or crime abortion whatever\nIt might be the the ... Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of those cases are decided at the ... circuit her district court level Ninety nine above nine nine nine nine percent so to break it down even further there's Thirteen U.S Circuit court of appeals\nOf the Thirteen eight are controlled by democratic appointed judges only four by Republican one district is split\nAnd so the most important one is the U.S court of appeals for the district of Columbia which is one Brett Kavanaugh came off of the Democratic appointees they're of a seven to three majority seven three one vacancy is now available but that can be one of the stray so it's going to say seven to three\nSo Ninety nine point nine nine percent of the federal cases are resolved before the Supreme Court level and all those about Seventy percent are controlled by democratically appointed judges\nSo before you get too far enough about Brett Kavanaugh I Want you to hold those figures in your mind Supreme Court takes eighty cases the U.S circuit court of appeals handled fifty two thousand cases\nDistrict courts about a million and so the great majority of the action is well below the U.S Supreme Court even with Brett Kavanaugh they're the only hope we have is normal God fearing Americans as for Trump to be in office another six years\nAnd if he stays in office six more years with the Republican Senate for all six years he may get as high as Fifteen Percent of those appointed by Republican judges so that is the mountain ahead of us don't get too high don't get too low\nSo what I'm saying is if Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of the case it never gets U.S Supreme court\nAnd those that do generally deal with the conflicts whether Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch are there or not it's certainly a great thing encourage more of it but it would take years and years of Republicans controlling the Senate and Trump controlling\nThe White House or parents after Trump to make any dent in the fact that about Seventy percent of the federal judges or appointed by Democrats and only about thirty percent bother Republicans and the reason is the last two or three years of Bush forty three Chuck Schumer refused to do anything in the Senate he shut down completely\nAnd should two weeks from Tuesday\nDemocrats when the U.S Senate which appears to be a pill at this point but should that happen there's going to shut it down again and they won't be any appointments for the last two years\nOf Trump's first term in office I said first term continuous more fun becomes available we have two lines open to be a

had conversations with authority plans and his entourage around their range than getting a half dozen guy though and if you look at recently I'm John Brennan the last past two days and then NBC confirmed that through his CIA operatives so I think [noise]\nUm yeah we are complex and even though we didn't have involvement in the murder and we did not warn him and that's what a big issue on the bottom point\nOut on on that point do you believe al Jazeera any more than you believe CBS\nWhy why do you rely on al Jazeera which is an arm of the extreme Muslim Palestinian Authority why do you believe outages era out of cutter why do you believe them I wouldn't believe one word they said\nOkay I hear what you're saying but when they're right there at the\nSame for twenty four seven out of

the fifth member crew you cannot do what you see what your own I Am I going\nTo hold on Cape assuming those things happen and and I certainly except they're true is not not nearly as bad as a few hundred Americans killed every year by illegal aliens how come we're focusing on that awful murder and not what's happening inside of our own country\nBecause we don't want to work for the cause of it from what I voted for planet down he's trying to change the narrative\nCars\nThat when I'm Jeff Jeff came out that the Saudis finally had to pass it on a lot of dollars worth of weapons that they thought\nThat was great for people to work in\nA cave case there's ten thousand Americans killed every year inside of America do care about any of them let's investigate cage timely let's investigate about seven hundred murders in the south side of Chicago not so how's it going to invest in those murders but then on the political diatribe against Trump right\nNow I'm watching I'm not sure that that's the corruption out of me when I gave some but not just like some officers are just got killed about an hour ago and Kurdish hiking I Will not require that in the U.S me if I'm Talking about one hundred percent on your side we just need to get\nLet's investigate that how come the murder of Assad citizen in Turkey it's such a big deal here why\nBecause way man complicit with Ben Bernanke on the planes that were not complicit were crap we're not complicit with anything come on man come on we're not to\nSee you are you one of those characters whatever bad happens in the world America's complicit what does that mean complaints it what does that mean while still but was it for the sides to kill them in that fashion almost on videotape that\nWas stupid that was real stupid and I hope we're not stupid but\nEven if it happened the way we think it happened frankly my dear I don't give a damn compared to what's happening in this country every year\nHow many times are killed two hundred cubs are murdered every year in this country that CNN go into the murder of police officers and why that's a horrible thing how come CNN when I covered the murder cops but they're covering some sun citizen in Turkey why\nI totally agree with you just like we have three hundred and Seventy five thousand abortions every year I'll tell you I'm totally rich\nNo big deal and what they're just using this as a country will there be trumping the head with his if we care and I don't care compared to the murder of cobs\nThe murder of the innocence ten thousand murders cage timely hundreds of Americans killed by legal aliens rapes in robberies how about investigating those things so that makes sense\nIt makes perfect sense and it's got the weight while still investigating how the Saudi they're blowing up innocent children and that's just a bus with us made weapons saying we're not going to that so complex that\nYou you mean in Yemen\nBust just got killed that guy blow advice weapons with Saudi Arabia to focus\nOn wait a minute he's saying we're complicit in that too because we sold a weapon in somebody Smith in West complicit if one of their weapons kill somebody\nWhy bother coming under\nFire bombing of course country in the middle east with us weapons\nComplex than in any of that in his parental complicit in one of their weapons is use their own ... kill somebody

Chris in Atlanta Georgia Chris in Atlanta Welcome to the ... show and Chris please go ahead Chris how are you\nI'm doing well are you\nGreat day to be an American please go ahead\nAmen to that so just a quick question you mentioned earlier about um I I don't I\nCan't paraphrase what you said about the pope specifically about him being a man of Christ or what have you on earth would you say you have a problem with a meeting with Michael Moore hell yeah okay well I mean just just out of ... I mean I'm just some sort of playing devil's advocate with us so\nBecause I had an issue with it too but\nUm if if we believe 'cause I'm I'm Catholic so I Believe in being the vicar of Christ justice Christ man with with sitters um what what is your what is your what's your\nHow I agree with that to Chris but the difficulty I don't think Michael Moore went there to get the pope on video talking to him as if he was a center wanting to be confessing to and\nReceiving grades from the pope I think Michael Moore went there has this huge to capture the pope\nIn a moment that he could use for his own political purposes against Trump and Michael Moore is that some catharsis like pulling the road to Damascus and said okay I've seen the error my waves I've seen the damage that cause the police officers in American Soldiers\nI see the damages caused by three thousand innocent babies killed every day in this country and I'm going to the pope for forgiveness for what I've done I'm with you\nBut I think Michael Moore probably went there with the pope today in order to get a photo opt to use politically against him that's what I think\nI I I agree wholeheartedly with you with that now that just curiosity you not feel that um maybe he'd already knows Michael Moore is maybe a personal agenda as background um\nYou know Chris a pope is given interviews which he says he does not read newspapers is not watch TV and he came from Argentina now in Rome\nAnd we'd like to think in America we're the only country that matters but I guess if you spend your life in Argentina Brazil and Central America South America and now you live in Rome you probably don't read newspapers or watch TV\nThere is but I guess if you spend your life in Argentina Brazil and Central America South America now you live in Rome you probably don't read newspapers or watch TV\nAnd how would you know Michael Morris and so I you know I guess I could work my way to the front of the line and get a picture with the pope but I Would like to thank Michael Moore is not one of those characters are pope would be familiar with and if he was I Would hope Michael Moore was able to convince to confess as many sense\nSure I'm absolutely I\nI think about people maybe give him credit for um just 'cause I I there there's a little bit about him that strikes me as odd and\nUm you know I like to be supportive of our our there's there are there are a lot of things that that really strikes me about him and to me it's not it's not surprising when when the weather is fairly harsh\nThat no question he's not the last ... now he's not Benedict he's Francis and he's a socialist he's left wing er and er\nAnd this whole uh precisely scandal was something that I Hope it's not up to his eyeballs in it from uh South America and I hope he's clean but do what he did with my care and what he did with the world didn't excite me too much and um\nAnd I I just hope there is no there there are what Chris we gotta go thanks for your call let's continue now calls from Texas Virginia New York coming up and about forty five minutes\nI spent some time with the president when he was in Cincinnati, Ohio I broadcasts from a couple of days ago and um and share his thoughts with you coming up about forty five minutes or so forty eight minutes after they are still counting end the great American in for the great when Martin live in a month\nEvery time you go on line your Internet provider an advertising companies can track what you do and sell your personal information so how can you protect yourself computer\nExperts recommend using a V.
