if there is a solution\nIt is Republican is\nThat the cancer is democracy and the pure the worst\nBecause that leads to ... an anarchy\nAnd ultimately\nAutocracy\nSo you see ladies and gentlemen defending the constitution they explain what they've done in order to present this faction which they viewed as a cancer\nWe've created divided government\nA divided federal government and the federal government would divided powers with the states\nHave federal government with specific ... powers and all the other governing powers left to the states why\nWhy\nBecause you have a diverse people he diverse geography he diverse pre colonial history and diverse populations\nAnd the way you bring them together\nIs to not may I say molest their diversity that is attack their diversity\nIt's to

really well here\nJane in New Jersey and the great WABC how are you\nI'm very Well Mark thank you and I just want to say before I make my comment I Love life liberty and lived in and I was mesmerized\nWith your interview with John point and I thought he was going to stumble a little bit but I could not tear myself away from that interview because\nIt's so refreshing that you ask a question and the person actually had an opportunity to answer the questions you\nKnow you know let me let me tell you this my friend\nExcuse me my microphone corruption let me tell you this [noise] I've tried to develop something unique chair which is a long form interview program where you have one or two guests said most and you ask a question you actually sit there and listen to the answer\n[noise] and I listen to the person across from me and I looked him in the eyes because I'm listening to every word they have to say the next question isn't written down ready to pound the next question may well be a question based on what they just set\nAnd these are people that I'm bringing on the program who in many ways are unique or the heavy side to them you haven't seen\nA we had a wonderful guest on Sunday unfortunately it was eleven pm eastern against my wishes and it is a it is a program it as a format\nThat some a broadcast folks executive folks and other folks are just they have trouble wrapping their mind around it and yet when you look at it not this Sunday the Sunday before we had the highest ratings\nOf any show\nOn the weekend on Fox\nCNN and MSNBC this isn't to brag this has to make a point that this model works that the audience is smarter than you think that the audience wants to hear people speak\nAnd you don't have to just keep doing over and over and over again the same format the same model and just may get louder and louder as if that's going to make a difference anyway go right ahead well\nYou just touched on the comment I was going to make I think the ... they the problem with a clip of in this country if they have it in their mind that they're morally and intellectually superior to the rest of us\nAnd you see these debates on\nUh those other stations that I don't watch and they'll have tone sometimes twelve people and then other people standing behind them and they're stealing all of their\nKnowledge on you know that the American people are just too stupid to get it and if it wasn't for them or we would be bumping into each other on the street but I have news for them and pay I I I Believe this with all my heart the merits\nAmerican people are not um we're not stupid or able to\nTake some of them are I mean after all how the gym or wind up in the Senate but I get your point most of us or not\nOr Menendez in New Jersey but um we we we can think on our own we can see what's going on and with every one that I speak with everyone is so fed up with is\nNobody even bother to listen to it anymore so let them put out their hatred and their anger I I I Believe in the American spirit I Believe in in their ability to discern right from wrong\nWell an all in favor of believing but we better get off our butts and vote otherwise none of this matters\nWell in two thousand sixteen they have Hillary Clinton up by sixteen points on election day I'm well aware I understand that but um\nI Am saying\nThat we need to vote\nAnd we cannot rely on what happened in twenty sixteen rely on what happened in twenty ten of these people are more fired up them before and we need to be more fired up than them that's the bottom line\nAnd we are inside of your listeners to go out and vote and I have a ... at this very great sense of calm I was getting aggravated\nI was getting to a point where I couldn't even watch the news anymore because like I just couldn't deal with it anymore but the more people I talked to they feel exactly the way I Do and that's people in New Jersey and this is a blue state [noise] um I\nI Will find out I've been involved in a lot of campaigns in New Jersey on this program and I think we've lost every single one of those\nSo we'll see All right my friend and I appreciate your ... look I'm not I'm not against people being positive [noise]\nBut that's not enough\nDone enough to talk about twenty sixteen and twenty ten and the poll said they don't care about the polls I don't care we're talking about a battle that we're waging now\nA battle and the time the strike is when they think you're going to lose this time the strike is when they think they've got the upper hand\nThat's the time to make sure look here's how I view this every one of you listening to me right now you're precinct work\nFor your family for your friends\nAre your colleagues for your neighborhood\nI don't mean formally I just mean election day and it's too early to say this but I'm saying anyway for election day you make sure that the people you know we're going to vote the right way to vote you get on
