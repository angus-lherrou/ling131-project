let me let me say this real quick let's go back something you said the beginning and then and then we'll continue on on your\nYour your turn to Saudi okay\nI don't act like all legal immigrants are are coming here to break laws I Know they are\n[noise] okay every moment and we're still with facts not emotion so Kay is it a fact that if you come into the country illegally every moment of every day whether you're sleeping working whatever it may be that you are breaking the laws of the United states of America\nAre saying we're going to do this\nBut when they get Michael Michael it's a simple questions on a trick question you called me okay I I didn't call you the idea that you say I knew you were going to say that again\nAnswer my question you act like it is um some how ridiculous that I say that every illegal immigrant is a law breaker\nThat is their intent to break American law that's when they break into this country and they don't have the paperwork and tried to come in this country is an actual legal\nMigrants which I have no problem with you try to act like the the breaking of the law is not breaking the law so you say well I Know all you all you talk show host you act like these people were all wall breakers\nThey actually are Michael I'm not saying they all have the intent to ... to rape or to murder\nI Do think they all have the intent to steal cars they're stealing from America when they come in this country legally\nThey're stealing from the American worker they're stealing jobs they're not paying taxes the right way many of them under ... jobs and make money in cash and the number one stimulus Mexico's economy is illegal immigrants who take the money and send it back to Mexico so to act as if\nThe action of breaking into a country is it means that you're not a law breaker ... it's absolute auditor insanity\nSo I'll start back with a question you ... you said that you talk show host act like these people are breakers I'm not I I'm not the one that made the wall the law is the law Michael the law says you cannot come into this country illegally\nBy that definition they are all breaking the law when they hear the entire time there he is\nA law that\nSays companies lied on that though is the legal for them to hire only\nI'm In favor of e verify I'm In favor also of going after those that hire illegals I've said for a long time if you want to clean up this country and get rid of illegal immigrants you don't have to deport any of them\nAll you have to do is start seizing hotels restaurants cars the equipment on job sites when you find people that are working and employing people illegally\nI agree with you we have a problem with hiring the illegal immigrants but you have a bigger problem with that you believe that these illegal immigrants or somehow not breaking our wall when they come across the border illegally and you act like it's at propaganda when it's not it's fact it is propaganda to treat people\nLike they are doing nothing wrong when in fact they're breaking our laws that is propaganda started\nFortune of all with all these companies that are really the oil outcome\nSo let me get a straight Michael why can't we starting forcing all all the way the president wants to do which is start enforcing the law at the border so these people don't even have the opportunity to come in this country illegally and then get work illegally why why are you still get that why\nYou're exactly right with that but when it comes to federal\nThe federal level all these other constituents there you know\nThe politicians that money how big is Monsanto\n... I I look I don't know how much money they make I don't know why you're keep focusing on one single employer there's there's there's Fifteen million illegal immigrants in this country maybe even more than that I'm giving it a low number here there are thousands tens of thousands of companies you know I'm not I'm not saying you're crazy listen to what I'm saying\nLet's focus on one employer one person let's focus on the factors tens of thousands of employers in America\nThen employ illegal immigrant labor labor I agree it's a problem but if you cut\nThe flow of the illegal immigrant Les ... immigrant labor\nThen that is a great starting point to get this under control why would you ... it's a two part solution I'm In favor of that but when you have four thousand plus people coming to your border right now the president's job and ... and they're broadcasting it live on social media they're literally walking with the Mets\nTheir border right now the president's job and ... and they're broadcasting it live on social media they're literally walking with the middle finger to this country saying we don't care about your in laws and were coming into your country and we're going to work and your country and we're going to undercut your wages and we're going to hurt the American worker\nAnd there's nothing you can do to stop us and this is how arrogant we are screw you America\nThat is the president's job\nTo make sure that those people are in handcuffs if they cross our border and immediately sent home\nAs far as far as that a news story or whatever it is a milestone now is that was rehearsed I wouldn't say I want to go as far as saying that the Democratic party at that rehearsed\nOf course they do Michael I this is all propaganda for them in terms this is all propaganda for the midterms Democrats want to come out saying we love people we love illegal immigrants we Nancy Pelosi the only time she basically gets pissed off as if you were actually advocating\nFor eight ... if you are trying to be a law and order president or a law and order congressmen that's about the only time that energy policy really gets mad at you because she stands up for the illegal immigrant now the American worker she stands up for people to break the law and not be able to abide by the law\nAnd then she threatens people when you get in her way just like she did this week\nDonald Trump put out a minute by minute ago hey down ... ... you know remember when they threw a big party at the White House\nThis is coming from Nancy Pelosi celebrating them passing their bill to get to get protections for people with preexisting conditions I mean she's talking right now about health care to try to move away from the other issue which is she's threatening the American worker the American family with her propaganda which is to give illegal immigrants the ability to come into this country illegally\n\nAnd ... and do that with no repercussions and it's for one reason she desperately need them to be able to vote\nThat is what this is actually about the Democrats are\nTerrified that they're not going to win back the house and Senate and they were gonna do it before they did the same character assassination and Brett Kavanaugh and it woke up conservatives who honestly we were kind of a sleep\n\nWe'd had a big when we think alright Donald Trump's doing a good job I maybe I won't worry about voting and they woke up a bunch of people and I believe without the Brett Kavanaugh character assassination we would have definitely lost a Senate I think now we're headed in the right direction it's not over yet but I think we're at least had in the right direction and Democrats are terrified\nThat they're not going to get the house in the Senate and they need new voters in this country 'cause they don't have enough right now to win this thing I mean they want I mean Hillary Clinton for Donald Trump you\nDon't think they're freaking out right now and they need new voters and the way to do is get illegals in here and give the man has to amnesty and then they know they can win every national election\nThe moment he goes on the market and rich charges only two percent total not the six percent commission your local broker expects get started now by calling eight three three rex home batch eight three three R.
