ladies and gentleman\nAnd this was sent to me by a buddy of mine the New York times and other news outlets keep referring to this guy is a registered Republican right\n[noise] but he's previously been convicted of felonies according to their same store and these other stores\nSo he should have been removed from the voter registration list because he lost his right to vote in Florida\nYou know the Democrats and the blue states in the blue cities they keep pushing for the rights of felons to vote after they've served their time you've heard it over and over again you're heard Gillum mentioned it and one of the debates summer even pushing for the right of felons to vote while they're in prison\nBut let's talk about the facts here it's Florida\nHe should have been removed from the voter registration list because he lost his right to vote and it could not be restored until and unless he applied to the Florida clemency board and was approved\nFlorida is one of the states that does not does not automatically restore the right of felons to vote when they get out of prison even though it's to Mike by the way because select but a referendum on the upcoming November ballot Arnie ... to do exactly that\nSo unless he had his right to vote restored he can't be a registered Republican quote unquote so I asked\nOr warm spots on your floor\nAs your water bill kept increase even though you

totally know Felice accountability\nBut law enforcement society cannot work quite frankly law enforcement can do each John if it does have a ... relationship with the community at the time that a law enforcement official and to go for a weapon to a gun to all the time to a taser and they have already have to go too far by their very presence\nBy the very trust that they had a fire in community and in society is supposed to be able to bring most situations you\nKnow this is sick and this man is sick from a a philosophical ideological perspective eased a radical\n\nHe's sick from a philosophical and political perspective he knows this not to be true\nYou have criminals in society including in poor neighborhoods who cannot be reason with rapists\nMurderers wouldn't be rapist would be murders robbers wouldn't be robbers and so forth and so on at the time that a law enforcement official has to go to a weapon toward gone to a baton to a taser then they have already\nGone too far by their very presence\nBy the very trust that they inspiring humidity and its society they're supposed to be able to bring most situations to heal\nHitters to incredible\nAnd Debbie Wasserman Schultz has no problem with this she thinks she's great because at a news conference today in\nSupport of Andrew Gillum here's what she had to say cut twelve go\nI just want to share with you [noise]\nWho are taking care of the people I represent every single day\nAnd deal with that kind of her [noise]\nWhile serving like insects\nAnd so we're going to make sure\nIt's one of the reasons that we have to like the Andrew Gillum\nGot\nA story that we can stand up for the values of the community\nAnd the values of the community is to trash the cops even in the face of\nThis that's uh\nDoes it have any ... in the values of the community is the trash the cops even in the face of this\nThat's a press conference today\nAnd they weren't Debbie Wasserman Schultz to know that she's a victim that her staff\nOr staff victims\nBut so it was Donald Trump junior a victim and so is there a Trump a victim and so it was Donald Trump effect and so as Lara Trump of it and so was Marco Rubio victim and so Susan Collins a victim and so it was General Mattis a victim\nAnd I just don't remember all the outpouring of anguish by the media I just don't remember it day in and day out\nNow this isn't about moral relativism or anything of this or this is about absolute bold faced boy ten hypocrisy\n\nAnd Steve ... was actually shot and almost murdered as others were shot\nLuckily this coke either didn't know what he was doing or didn't intend for these bombs to go either way he's a terrorist and the New York times tells us he's a registered Republican I'm trying to figure out how that can be\nI'm not saying he's not I just want to know more\nBecause once you're a felon and Florida you're not automatically return to the voting list you're not allowed to vote unless you go specifically to the foreign clemency board did he do that did he get approval I mean this guy two thousand two\nIn two thousand two he made a bomb threat [noise] he made a bomb threat in two thousand two\nHe's not a clean slate\n\nThe way he was the perpetrator before he was caught was portrayed\nThe insinuation from Schumer and Pelosi the insinuation from CNN and MSNBC was there was a direct line between Trump and his rhetoric\nAnd whoever was doing this\nThat was the insinuation that pushed him over there and that this is what causes it sort of know it doesn't that has multiple felonies in his past the guy threatened to use a bomb and two thousand two\n\nThat's pretty uh long before Donald Trump even flirted with the idea of running for president United States\nHe was arrested in two thousand two according to the Associated Press on charges of threatening to throw place project the discharge any destructive device\n\nAnd it was pointed out in the Washington Examiner he made the bomb threat because he was angry at a Florida utility worker St people do not make these threats\nAnd commit these other felonies and I suppose would be governor Andrew Gillum Matt ... Andrew Gillum\nWhat say well the police should pull out guns are tasers or Billy clubs\nOr anything of this or no no no they should figure out how to make the guy he'll be more you know community relations but community relations\n\n[noise] I'll tell you what [noise]\nI'd like to know a hell of a lot more about the situation I really would\nNot from a conspiracy perspective or anything else just want to know more of the facts\n\nAnd I'm sure now that the New York slams the Washington composting constipated news network MSL honesty and all the rest of them are working feverishly to figure out how he became a registered Republican or retain that than I think the New York times is obligated since it was the first report\nIs to tell us how [noise]\nWas because Florida [noise] is not allowed to clear up it's a voter rolls because of all the left wing are suing is because uh [noise] people on the Florida clemency board give us registration at what exactly are we going to rethink this idea that that one should be able to vote\nAnd I'll be right back when you take\nOne atom of nitrogen and bond with one atom of oxygen boom you're just created nitric\nCall screeners down why don't you give me a hand and tell me the number one if we ever live and number two if not if we have a regular American\n[noise]\nMike in Maryland the great WMA or go hey mark great talking to you or or time caller on ... on the war rhetoric going on um\nOne thing I noticed that some things to push the buttons to push a guy but was that\nYou know it's the first time where supporters of a particular candidate have been directly account of attacked and attacked regularly for a long term and you know and that's it solve things that people when they when they die and then they're attacked by that\nAnd that's my point is you know they're going back and forth that if the if the rhetoric between what Donald Trump that and and what the media and the Democrats say\nIt it's true it's directed to I don't ever remember Donald Trump I'm doing something that the supporters of the Democrats the way that the Democrat\nI think I think you're giving this not way too much credit CERN two thousand two he threatened to bomb a or a public utility because he was angry with a worker\nSo I'd be very very careful about playing into the less hands that this is uh some guy who who's angry about what the left is doing and so forth and so we're all angry about what the left is doing but we don't send real are fake bombs to a bunch of people\nNo I don't and I don't support that at all the more the case of you know you're you're asking why do we push peoples' buttons why go there anyway why ever attacked orders that doesn't have the right way to do the same way that we're fed up\nWhile the media like to do this they attack or all the time because you see Mr Zucker over to CNN and uh the clown that runs MSL us they they've decided that they are political operations in that they want to um [noise]\nUh they want they want to play to a base the radical left coup Democrats face and that's what they've decided to do\nUh they're not really news operations they know damn well that are down limited as a joke they know damn well the Jake Tapper more and more has become a joke like what they run at night Steven Kobe or the Spock of ah\nWhat the goofy years may I guess I Will the Spock of a late night comedy it's not even comedy stupid and look at Kimmel and bits\nAnother more run by the way several of these people are including cable in bits and others have done blackface I'm a ... if you'd call it that in the past how come they're not fired\nLike making Kelly's fired how come they're not fired how come join Reid hasn't been fired from MSL as the given everything that she posted means seems a little odd to me thank you for your call sir seems a lot odd to me\nI'm not interested in the in the conspiracy theories Mr call screener like call our number four that's just that's the sun um called different shows I'm not interested in that that go to a Todd Rockville, Maryland WCBS and go\nMark ... talk to you thank you can I have one solution I have I done the math on this and

an\nHour let's let let let's let on you say there's a moral issue here so\nI don't think people should be able to pay their way out of their illegal behavior or not somebody and and watch all also sees because many of them are and very little in terms of wages and many of them get paid under the table or because the employer doesn't want to be revealed as a crook what\nI'm saying is I don't think this would work because it's already lawless and so you're saying okay let's tax as well as such already lawless and they're not paying any taxes to begin with the employer and so forth then how do how do you push them into that system\nWhile I'm thing even for legal immigration coming to this country we gotta have something going in\nFor the phone while we need is to limit the number of people coming into the country legally and illegally that's it\nNo this is not Nineteen Eighteen twenty Eighteen at the new ball game\nI don't know what that means I mean if the new economy we can't way of bite the tank\nBearing the Nineteen twenties during college is presidency we had a during that period before and slightly after we had like a twenty year respite on immigration you aware of that\nI Wish it was to some extent\nOr a matter of us being able to just slow things down a simulated people within our system to take a look at how it says shaking out in terms of our school systems\nIn terms of law enforcement terms a local health care in terms of jobs and so forth but what's happening is the left is flooding the field more and more and more we've never had a fifty year period of immigration like we have right now never in American history\nWe actually have a political party that cheering illegality\nCheering so I I I don't but I appreciate your ... people come up
