or we pay a lot of people who want to be in a resort community\nAnd that value that idea of luck in the late ... the Congo or something and the maintenance frankly in the way they can come and go and enjoy that leisure time here and not have to worry about how he might\nThink that that though a lot of your parents especially from ... where I learned that the premium and then maybe for political condos in their home country actually like the idea of owning a single family homes yeah being a little bit is Larry ... and the extra a privacy that out of four\nSo it really does depend but one trend with the lord anymore off now especially with European by as\nIf they want walk there like the ... the one to dry it wouldn't be able to cut out of that home go shopping restaurant to go and grab a cup of coffee and want to be an outdoor or they won't walk sale at one of the adult bike oh\nThey just flown enrolled walk book we understand a lot of times that drives them to vote for downtown like areas and again that's part of the cat's been buying a condo rather than a single family home\nIf you have a property listed for sale and five offers come in and one of them is from an international buyer are they more competitive because often they use all cash or they just one among many\nWell it's true still loading right and the Golden Girls don't buy it like gosh\nThey tend they however very educated by it so they're going to the age you know out of their properties back up again competition wanted that really were and some culture back cultural I'm In a kind of it's automatically make a low offer and negotiate up from there so\nQuite often at that stage do they lose if there's five other offers on the table\nYeah and so we have to educate them and say I you know I understand this is how are you in your country\nBut wearing his fellow market right now it's happening in our market so the relative shortage re educate customers about how to win and how to put folder strong offer in that particular ... at that time\nHow do you actually find foreign buyers to show my house to watch your process\nWhat we do is we pick that particular thing and we went to a broader audience through our international network\nOnly got rave that you know because it's just another listing of Ninety probably we're blessed thing people can find on line\nFor one of the things

started buying homes we still aren't doing so at the rate that jet actors in baby boomers day when they were our age so I spoke to a few of my renting friends about the top reasons why they haven't joined these aimed ranks of homeownership public sounds awesome\nFirst money they don't have enough of it the teams like the obvious one and you know at the seller's market and homes are getting more expensive and that means the down payment or getting healthier and half the year\nMost of these people could easily have mortgage but sky high rent and the majority of my friends in D.C are paying between sixteen hundred and twenty four hundred dollars a month it making it near impossible to save that initial big down payment ...\nNext a lot of people I spoke to aren't sure where they're going to be in the next couple of years and millennials get older and we're in our thirties now well hopefully start settling down more but for now many of us need to go where the jobs are\nThe recession meant that most of us started our careers a little later in life than those generations so that means we're still stuck in entry level jobs cheating the stable mid level jobs\nAnd most are willing to move that that's what it takes and that means buying a home may not make the most financial than interesting\nFinally one of my friends said that there is no way he can afford to buy a house that is
