you\nKnow you're not investing and someone else and with interest rates being lower rent being higher it's a very good thing to chicken too because it's very likely that you might be able to pay less

tough one ten years ago the financial markets crashed some people are afraid to buy a house because they're afraid that's going to happen again\nSure that's where your local realtor really is

Halloween which of course this coming Wednesday and right now I look at\nSomething many people find downright terrifying\nIt's the number five a number that strikes fear into the hearts of home buyers who worry about whether there'll be able to get a house if mortgage interest rates hit five percent earlier this month the interest rate on a thirty year fixed rate mortgage did just that\nIt reached the five percent mark for the first time since two thousand eleven\nWhat those five mean for the housing market the big question of course when they discourage buyers buyers who are already facing rising prices and buyers who can't find a home for sale in many markets\nWhen that could be a discouraging factor but others point out that even a five percent interest rate is still historically low especially compared with the double digit rates scene in the past\nAs real estate today's bill Thompson tells us real tours lenders builders and bankers are all getting ready for five percent\nIn places like Reno nevada rising mortgage rates were already changing the market says Monica my talent with cold will bankers select real estate she told take TV on TV\nFires are being more cautious you know they're they're not wanting to just jump on anything now they're actually shopping around and not feeling they're urging me as they were before and they're a little bit more careful\nIn fact for many homebuyers a higher interest rate will mean a major shift in their purchasing strategy there is evidence of that already says Megan McGrath she's managing director at ... partners since she told Bloomberg News\nBoy did they have our broker that they're starting to customers change their behavior in response to read and what they're doing is looking at smaller towns are looking in different geography\nOf course the worry among many in the industry is that a rate that is now the highest it's been seven years might make some people drop their plans to buy a home all together Gramm the chief of operations with mortgage news daily told CNBC this is really what the market should expect\nThere's always going to be a few buyers a certain percentage of buyers that are on the edge of being able to qualify when rates go up as much as they have been that can actually pushed them out of being able to qualify for a home\nIndeed the industry has not exactly been blindsided by the rise and writes when our CEO Stewart Miller till CNBC the signs were there for anyone to see\nWe've been preparing in fact for some time anticipating interest rates going up we've been seeing hearing that\nThe prices that will be able to charge for homes and the amount that will be able to pass on those costs with moderate that's why we've been so focused on innovating within our business getting our cost structure down moderating TNA moderating production costs and really focusing on the land component\nAnd higher interest rates don't just affect builders buyers and sellers with the right now around five percent refinance activity has all but dried up homeowners don't refinance when the going rate is higher than the one they already have\nAs a result there have been widespread layoffs in the mortgage business and Wall Street investors have taken notice when our stock is down to thirty three percent year to date CEO Stewart Miller says some key facts are being overlooked\nNumber one we're well situated to a size and scale and local markets but number two don't forget the production deficit that has defined the housing market we've been under producing normalize levels of housing\nFor the past ten years that means a lot of pent up demand is going to come to market even while prices are going up and interest rates are finding their way to normal\nNow if he sounds optimistic it's because he is Miller is among those who does not believe that having a five and the interest rate is the end of the world do your grilled or Ryan or had dose Fox Business that rates really aren't very high\nEveryone saying how high they are there are five percent which is still historically low but that's really only Fifteen dollars extra on a hundred thousand dollar loan on a thirty year fix\nDavid ... the c._e._o. of prosperity bag remembers that it wasn't all that long ago that he got eight ten percent mortgage on a house five percent doesn't worry him at all as he told CNBC\nFive percent six percent is not going to kill the housing market it's really ridiculous that think that race where they're at today are are just it's too hot or not it doesn't isn't just a normalization of rice\nBottom line Tucson area realtor and mortgage broker Rob Sykes tells cagey un TV\nRacer right back where they were ... ... so right well even at five five and a half they do it
