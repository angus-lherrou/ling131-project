sitting back kitchen back it was tough those two cards I had to fill out and I put it all in there\nAnd I only had one stamp and I'm thinking I'm is that discrimination against poor people that I had to put an extra step on my envelope to to vote 'cause I mean it was tough I mean I I don't know what I was going to do you know I had to get up\nGo actually by another step yeah I'm I'm just wondering if that's discrimination like trying to get id to vote is that like trauma in you know follow up on or should I just you know [noise] you know written and Barrett um so how should I Do\nI Want you to call so here's what I Want you to do tomorrow and then I I Want I'm going to ask you to call me back I Want you to call the voter of the restaurant voters or been in a county tomorrow want you to do it tomorrow and I if you have to say on hold for forty five minutes an hour you got to do it\nAnd it's an hour you got to do it I Want you to call and ask them and that I Want you to report back to me so if you're going to call my show with a question like this I'm gonna put you to work\nAnd I want to call the words ... that's how it's going to work buddy you want to call like you want to call my show and you want to make an argument that an extra staff is discrimination well let's find out if it is so I Want you to call the register voters and asked them what the policy is on the extra stamp and the cat right it\nCan write this off on my taxes or that uh\nOh yeah oh yeah you know the problem is see you are kind of a head\nAnd then we we go into this or we go to John in San Diego ...\nJust so happy called that thank God God Bless you that you are just really\nYou're a guy who makes the show really special and when you call you always bring it and uh I got to applaud you for that I really do eight hundred seven sixty calf I'm be eight hundred seven sixty five or six to ... show am seven sixty talking breaking news them to go over to the gym sure of that for the last headlines check what's going on Jim welcome to the show\n\nOr you know what I'm gonna keep talking um so if you're gonna if you're going to or if you're gonna if you're gonna bring it you know what I'm going to request is and you're gonna be a color to the show\nUm go ahead and you want to bring your a game right leave it all out there right there on the table just come on out firing but it's got it's got to be right on topic and if it's not on topic figure out how you can kind of position it's all going to topic\nAnd then and then it'll work better I think when you're a color that's my advice for John in San Diego and and really anybody else\nBecause let's be honest and extra stamp is not discrimination that extra staff is not a there's not anything that is a a a a barrier this is my guess is even if you mail late\nWithout the stance is it'll probably get to the polling will probably get to the to the voting place because I think the folks that men and women at the post office in fact I I I feel like mailing a ballot ought to just be free because it's a civic service\nI mean if it's if it's jury duty notice if it's if it's a ballot it ought to just be free to ship it out\nBut you think wow I

after the\nWe listen to Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new genocide sunspot director she wrote I loved the genocide sunspot correct there it is might go to product every day\nThan

website here\nI mean his son and a negative way but I'm sure as liberal listening it'd be like no you got that from uh some right wing slanted website there there was just trying to manipulate the facts just from ... okay\nThe top one percent pay thirty seven cents of every thirty seven percent income tax load the bottom line the only pay thirty\nWhy it's so sensitive to make us liberals are frauds they keep talking about this fair share some as John Kerry doctors vote in Rhode Island to avoid paying taxes what if we had Al Sharpton at his tax debacle we have a you know Bernie Sanders what do we find out he pays less than twenty percent of his income in taxes\nTo lead by example we buy sample if you believe in what you're saying there's no hypocrisy here for Republicans we think taxes sock because we think outside of our military and our courts you flush the money down the toilet bowl you don't know anything about the economy and you waste\nIt which you prove us right all the time we would rather donate to charity and let the free market and ... and charities handle it who can actually help people locally but no you suck up all our money you get a big tidy both flush and you flush it down to Paul and I'm Glad we got a president who doesn't accept this premise that all\nFair share not out they don't they already paid to us cut their taxes let them put their money to work in the economy grow jobs in the economy yeah\nWhy do you like them apples how do they taste\n\nI got some more numbers freebie maybe ask your where does this come from well obviously I'm Talking about the authenticity component but Trump he didn't apologize but if I can be candid with you folks for a moment\nThis is the first year of my life that my wife and I really you've done well um my show the book things did well they did thanks a lot of you by the way things just did well I mean they'll need to go into the details\nBut talking to my account and I was absolutely floored I really couldn't believe it\nWhen we found out how much money the government I was astonished I really was that will be fine I mean we you know we keep money aside to pay for we don't we don't live a frugal lifestyle at all I mean excuse me a spendthrift lifestyle the opposite we actually kinda cheap or anything but we just that we work a lot\nA lot so we don't get to go out I'm telling you I was floored I thought he had a decimal point wrong\n\nAnd I play it straight you know because I I'm like you know a lot of liberals like John Kerry report their boats in Rhode Island place straight so whatever my bill is I don't like the law change it but if the law steaks you still got I got to pay\nAnd I was floored this is the first time my life I thought to myself\nI'm Serious folks and my wife probably going to kill me for talking about this but it's okay I I mean it because I think this needs to get out there\nI grew up\nAt the lower end at best the middle class and being generous 'cause I'm not I'm not a sob story\nThe low end of middle class at best okay\nLike at one point the bologna for dinner kind of you know what I'm getting out of their middle class like yeah we will they be steak was not I was a hot commodity mind when it was it was ... we were not eating rabbis okay McDonald's was like the restaurant to go to\nI worked my butt off with it was the the police department and the cemetery in the supermarket and the secret service and you finally\nGet to a point your life and for the first time you make what could be legitimately of life changing amount of money right and you want to do so many things I'm telling you we had so many ideas and some of them were so\nYeah I mean we're going to be able to do I don't want to be dramatic about this but you think to yourself\nI got to give it to these guys these idiots in D.C to do was to do what were these\nTwo are you serious to do what I don't mind if I can I Swear to you on my life the constitutional role of government I military guys take my money [laughter] is\nWe need courts I get it that's why we have a constitution but you weren't flushing your money down the toilet bowl the people who have no idea what to do with it\nWe need we ... we need seriously some constitutional controls on their ability to take our money they are they're just burning it\n\nIt's the first time in my life I thought I could I could have bought my mother in law house and it said I'm giving it to some bow tie wearing bureaucrat in D.C to flush down the toilet bowl\nThe worst unbelievable and I I think it's because I grew up at the lower in the middle class and then in\nThe secret service middle class and upper middle class later on I guess I mean I don't know I don't know what the categories I don't care and making them I Try to make the story more dramatic than it needs to be [noise]\nBut I guess it said I genuinely respected dollar because I Know what it's like and then when you finally get help other people right you're like gosh I can do so much with this and you're forced to turn it over\nAnd they just mega amounts to the government for me at least probably not for anyone else who's really rich which I'm not but I just I'm paid by every ounce of it it just sucks so bad\nBuild my business everything we can hire new people to write for the website ... and we can't 'cause I've got to give it to these guys and ladies in D.C to burn\nRight\nSorry I get off track you can tell I'm kind of hot on this topic is another number about the fair share that liberals don't say we\nPay the top fifty percent of taxpayers top fifty percent\nPay Ninety seven percent of all income taxes ... percent the top fifty percent of earners pay Ninety seven percent Ninety seven cents of every dollar of taxes Ninety seven\nNinety nine point seven Ninety seven percent why does that matter\nIt matters folks because the bottom fifty percent of taxpayers total logically then pay three percent the top fifty pay Ninety seven percent the top fifty percent of earners than about sixty three percent of the tax code\nSo this Bloomberg peace they did it interesting analysis they said well let's figure out what percentage of the highest\nEnd or is it still makes sense for the second I promise what percentage or number of the highest end earners also pay and equivalent three percent of the tax code like the bottom fifty percent of the earners\nIn the country\nLadies and gentlemen the evil rich that the left talks about the Bernie Sanders types\nI'm using their terminology show how this pure stupidity of their comments you're never going to believe is the top zero zero one percent of income taxpayers in other words just fourteen hundred people\nFourteen hundred not fourteen thousand one ... for ... for the lips fourteen hundred the fourteen hundred top earners in the United states\nPay the same percentage of the tax load as the bottom fifty percent of income taxpayers in the country\nTell me again please with a straight face\nWith a straight face how they're not paying their fair share fourteen hundred people pay the same equivalent percentage of the income tax or as the bottom fifty percent of earners in the country and he got Bernie Sanders a one percent or of so you're not paying their fair share really party do you even know these numbers\nThat is insane fourteen hundred people pay the same percentage of the tax code as the fifty percent the bottom fifty percent of income taxpayers in this country that's amazing\nNow you understand why we got to just break the narratives completely you read it for the rich no no no no no no I'm In it for the economy and you have no idea what the numbers are fair share you don't even know what a\nFair share is fair shall we used to be able to make us\nDon't be stupid talking point rich don't pay their fair share they don't pay pay as much as the bottom fifty percent of the country are you crazy\nA man of fire to buy the say are if you want

got to go out and like live my life when I drive past them I'm thinking about picking up my\nKids from my daughter from rowing I'm thinking about like knock it out of work out in the gym spending a date night with my lovely wife who I don't get to spend enough time with at all and I wish I could spend more it was so look forward to it I'm Serious I mean that I Love her to death she's the best I'm\nNot thinking about your stuff dude I don't care what liberals why are you so obsessed with other people success why does it bother you so much why is it so off putting that you need to lay claim to other people's stuff constantly\n[laughter] [noise]\nIt's a serious question why are you in title to other people's stuff why how much of it and what did what Thomas\n... who I I don't know probably know\nThe economists slashed philosopher he's both I admire more currently alive today than Thomas or was it in ... said at one point I I Can't remember between conflict divisions and visited the annoyed and all this wonderful books I read is\nWhen a PHD report he did on ... love Thomas all he put to think there was a well how much of my stuff basically titled too and why or\nWhy I don't get it like why do we owe you anything anymore why\nWhy why do we owe you a ... call\nPaul could not have been more illuminating\nReally I Am thankful she called I usually don't take a to love the first call on them so much liberal he was kind of a moderate that Cathy that was one of the greatest calls ever because that really sums up liberalism in a nutshell they have no idea what the numbers are they don't understand\nThe facts they don't understand the economic data about tax policy they don't even know what marginal tax rates are they have no idea\nThere convince other people have taken their stuff but when you ask them how exactly they took their stuff they can't tell you how exactly did rich people take your son well he's talking well how what stuff that they take they took my money what really where where is that they're worth a billion dollar how did they get that money from you\nKnow I don't know I don't just sounded good Bernie Sanders told me it was true\nThey're hypocrites there total fraud I remember\nRunning for office in Maryland I Can't tell the story it up I used to go there there's a the the Maryland in Montgomery County fair and I'd sit Montgomery County or a very very liberal County Maryland\n[noise] I Would sit there at the fair in front of the G O P boots and shake hands with people and one day this staffer for Chris Van Hollen used to be represented and now he's a senator from Maryland [noise] he stops and he's you know he knows who I Am so he's given me kind of the smart smart guy attitude\nAnd he starts getting it to me about tax policy has no idea what he's talking about he doesn't have any grasp of the numbers at all he's completely clueless so I got tired of listening to it so I said listen I have a really simple question for you\nSince you believe government is is that good right and we should all transfer of wealth to a bunch of bow tie wary bureaucrats in DC you don't give a crap about your money or anything else for that matter please explain to me that you think this is a net good for society and you should ask this of all you're liberal friends how much money\nArgued donating involuntarily higher tax payments to the government did go how much the answer I can almost assured you with near certainty\nIs Ciro matter of fact not only are they not turning over extra money they are hiring accountants to avoid paying the money they owe themselves to the government\nConservatives this is not a problem we are not\nWe know that government is full of waste we know the government can't spend money with any degree of efficiency so we do everything in our power to legally avoid giving the government any more money that we need to liberals make the exact\nOpposite argument now the government it's such a force for good the rich people should get more\nMoney to why me why please explain to me how we haven't been paying into these anti poverty programs since the great society and sixty five in sixty six and a percentage of people not working in households with an eligible member of the work has gone up knocked down\nWe have not move the poverty rate in any significant way at all it was actually going down before the great society and government intervention Phil Gramm had a great piece of the wall Street Journal about this last week it is now almost completely stabilized\nWe are transferring on average something like thirty thousand dollars in equivalent transfer payments over to people in lower income categories and the number of people working that of eligible family members the number of percentage of people are working has gone down in some of these households\nThe percentage of household with someone else would work that don't have anyone working has gone up dramatically please explain to me how this is evidence of government compassion effectiveness and efficiency pleased with a straight face try not\nTo laugh\nWhile you simultaneously hire accountants like John Kerry and Hillary Clinton remember our real estate thing where they hired accountants to avoid paying extra taxes to the government why did you do that why\nIf the government is a source for net good things in society turn your money over to them dopey of phony but you can't if you're a liberal listening to the show doesn't that anger you that you're such a fake\nNo serious that you're a fraud when you look in the mirror aren't you like wow I'm a real phony I Love the government you know I Do everything in my power to pay accountants to avoid giving the government money doesn't that make you a fake how do you live like that\nNo one serious I don't have that issue\nI look in the mirror go yeah the government really sucks tax I don't want to give them any more my tax money I'm telling you outside of our military courts and the constitutional role of government whether it's mass consensus they spent they waste money like no tomorrow government if states it's a disaster\nI have no issue with that\nI look in the mirror know yep I Do everything legally I can to pay as your tax dollars as possible\nBut not you frauds you don't pay extra you want me to pay more you don't do anything because you may say well than a couple of people do voluntarily Patrick I read a report and if the numbers are wrong tweet\nMe I'm happy to hear but I read the report a few years ago that the record amount of money the government and brought in up until that time involuntary tax payments voluntary meeting people just donate extra money the government you're never going to believe it's number\nTwelve million dollars million billion certainly not trillion twelve million dollars we have\nThree hundred and thirty million people in this country\nAre you telling me if I say let's be generous I'll play down the number for the sake of making it easy on the liberal say there are thirty million liberals there's probably more than that probably costs or forty or fifty who would classify themselves liberals say there's twenty five million if each of those liberals just donated a dollar to the government\nThe government they worship that they send you flight in front of that they've they've they almost consider an act of religion and faith if you just donated a dollar they would double the amount that voluntarily paid to the government the paltry twelve\nMillion dollars that's it so lives step up stop being such frauds stop being such inauthentic fake since frauds wake up tomorrow morning call your account did and do the right thing air quotes right thing because it's the wrong thing but you say it's the right thing\nRight a big fat juicy check to the G go do it call your account and come on five thousand ten thousand the government's a force for good daddy\nTook things take two gangs take life did she\nGo had knock yourself out set an example\nFor the conservatives out there you think are Neanderthals focus labs we donated an astonishing hundred billion dollars of voluntary tax payments [noise]\nNice job liberals dumb move but nice job at least you guys have is fine\nWe she stood for something your big frauds phony phony he's fakes look your cell phone\nLook yourself in the mirror and say I'm a big fake because you are\nI don't want to pay extra to everybody else does why why I give to charity I don't need someone else to do it\nI give that we we my wife and I get the charity we sell short shorts on our website\nWe donate the money why I don't need anyone else to do it I don't look for other T shirt bankers because we think we're helping somewhat I don't need you to do what you said the government is helping people out to you not why do you need someone else to do it\nJust don't give a speech pop\nLike Spike Lee fed to the right thing lives step up you won't bunch\nOf fakes folks on their budget you know when for more than when he was calling seven seven three one three at one of them will be right back [noise] was", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck
