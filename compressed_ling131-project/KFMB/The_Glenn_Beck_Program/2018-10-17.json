Chinese are not stopping what were complaining about which is stuff to us and electrical property and all the other concerns that we have so there's a long way to go before there was a resolution or\nAdditionally we know the Nikki Haley's obviously departing US ambassador to the United nations at the end of the year on the Chinese have been sanctions violators when does this come to a dealing with the Russians when it comes to dealing with the north Koreans the Russians have been sanctions violators when it comes to the north Koreans\nUm what what what about that component it seemed for awhile Nikki Haley was a tremendous voice advocating for maximum pressure on the north Korean regime\nAnd we sort of a a faltered and lost our will\nUm to to make sure that there is compliance drew discomfort [noise]\nI I don't know if we've lost our will read but certainly we are not pursuing sanctions or with the bigger that's necessary if President Trump just before the meeting with Kim Jong on in Singapore on June twelfth\nSaid that he was giving the north Koreans are one shot opportunity to do the right thing and to\nIn order to create a good atmosphere of Trump sort of what the pressure off so we've squandered an advantage best not to say that Trump can't put the pressure back on but it means we really need to do that because the north Korea are violating the sanctions the Chinese the Russians the south Koreans are it's open season\nSanctions you know this is intolerable\nIt's the wild west his bloody Kansas everybody's looking to get rich job ... with with the with the ignoring of the sanctions\nUm in terms of the economic picture we see that America is sort of been on a roller coaster for the last ten days right we've seen our markets take these wild swings today we're up five forty eight the unemployment picture's looking really good you've got you've got a great profits being posted but you've also got rising interest rates\nAgainst that backdrop we know that there are real internal pressures inside of China\nHow can the president go about exploiting some of those internal pressure is obviously the raising of rate that has an impact obviously the the the the terrorists impact the ability to purchase goods and services inside of China and most Chinese people\nAre there in the country do not have available cash reserves or access to credit like we do so so what about exploiting that to try to get cheated come to the table\nWill certainly I mean we should be posing many more terrorists because the Chinese are not stopping their stuff to us and electoral property that certainly will shake\nThe Chinese regime so actually this criminal investigation of wild way technologies for violating Iran and North Korea sanctions um when we imposed does Iran and North Korea sanctions on ... ... the Chinese telecom equipment manufacturer that really shook\nNot ... not only the tech sector and China\nNot only the Chinese economy but also the political system and clearly imposing the same cost on while way would have I think pretty much the same effect so there are a lot of things that we can do that we're not doing at this particular time we're trying to give the Chinese an opportunity to walk this back but there are shown to be ... so\nWe just need to put much more pressure on China\nAh Gordon Chang joining us here on the show talking about are all things China North Korea and the threats\nAnd the threats that we're facing from those geopolitical challenge is final question for you a much was made over the weekend though it was sort of lost in in in some of the uh the other news stories out there of a of of ongoing confrontations between the U.S navy and the P L A navy or the fact that we got within what a hundred and forty five feet\nOr near collision with ... with with the Chinese are with the Chinese vessel it's certainly tight quarters there in the south China Sea which the the PR see regards as sort of their own lake well what what is the state of play there as relates the free or the free transit navigation and ... for\n... some extremely dangerous tactics crossing the ... of the USS Decatur within forty five yards [laughter]\nI'm clearly the Chinese are are trying to drive us out of the global commons we can't prevent that because the south China Sea\nIs part or international aerospace and international water 'em and China is using very aggressive tactics and unless we want a very different world world very different from what we've been putting together after World War two we need to push the Chinese back\nThe Trump Administration is starting to do that that's a very good thing\nAnd we just need to continue it great\nStuff from Gordon Chang we always appreciate your insights into this I Know that ah ah as we follow this uh the stories are going to change moment by moment but we really do appreciate you are giving us some clarity on these issues thanks so much for coming by today

part of\nA no I mean I ... it was out there in the bloodstream last night when the judge came down and said that the defamation suit was being dismissed or that the president had the right to say the things he said because it was considered\nA part of protected political speech I I think this is a president wanting to settle a score with somebody that he finds to be put ... kilo early annoying and you\nThe Stormy Daniels situation and it checks sort of all the boxes right you've got Michael Cohen involvement there\nThat's an annoying to the president it's Stormy Daniels herself as in their ah his his wife is a part of that story that's an annoyance and a half a on top of that Michael ... who's constantly on TV taunting him Michael ... who was also a great source of discomfort for the president with the a judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation fight\nI I think this is a ... an intersection\nOf stories and topics that make him nuts\nThey make him go nuts and he's going to take

now we we know there's no real conclusive proof that she has a Native American identity [noise] setting is Jeff deal [noise] the\nAlso known as cannon fodder in the Massachusetts Senate race what happened happened Massachusetts once upon a time not all that long ago there were some symbol it's a primary to Elizabeth Warren\nAnd at this point I here's a question\nJeff deal the Republican in this race has been traveling on average somewhere in the neighborhood about twenty five points is there any chance that the backfire here's enough to move the needle even reasonably\nJeff I ended up calling today and Elizabeth Warren to drop out on the back of her being Pocahontas and her entire test backfiring on her quite spectacularly but you'd take a look and I mean not to project anything on to the good folks was questionable voting habits in Massachusetts right now\nBut I take a look at at New Jersey we got a senator Menendez he he's still leaning in the ... what happened what does it take you actually have to be inside of a jail cell before\nYou'll not be voted for if you're a Democrat Massachusetts or er Jersey or what happened people come on now and got to be some since left in there somewhere so anyway Jeff deal uh everybody should have been gay because for many including potentially even some folks to Massachusetts might be the first time you've even heard the guy's name but\nHe's trying to give 'em credit by the way I Am by muddy informed Michael then you catch me and Brian my radio and talking about the bond that the president has had on back of Elizabeth Warren's botched rollout of her test probably\nThat those high cheekbones she talked about really had something to do it at president doubts windy today said Pocahontas the bad version\nSometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren\nIs getting slammed she took a bogus DNA tests and it showed that she may be one and one thousand and twenty four Indian is what he's referring to there are less than the average American now the Cherokee Nation denies her DNA tested useless even they don't want her phoney\nAnd he continued you went down there he had a lot of fun just worried that now that her claims of being Indian Indian heritage have turned out to be a scam an ally\nElizabeth Warren should apologize for perpetuating this brought against the American public Harvard called her a person of color amazing God would not have taken her otherwise and again\nThis is the important point here we're talking about the Elizabeth Warren deal is not just oh it's another politician line it's not bad number one it is a lie it is a fraud that she has kept up her entire adult life\nBut secondly it's not a victimless situation she committed fraud for personal gain every single step of the white educationally professionally she even went in because and couples steps along her career path\nNeeds Ivy League institutions and identify her as a Caucasian\nShe made sure that she was always referred to and had it would have changed that she was Native American or a person of color in the areas\nHe is like seriously\nBut in in the president's tell us that does is it fake you to the Cherokee Nation forty dealing that Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas you can just see him and and hear him saying that to gang is a complete and total fraud and again\nYou don't have to listen to me you don't have to listen to the president United States all you have to do take it straight from the tribe that she claims to be part of\nA kind of tough it's tough for her to rally back from that one way the the president in terms of choice holy cow he had all kinds of moments today including moments in with the story Daniels\nNow to be referred to as I guess horse face\nThat that that happened today but uh we we have a bunch of other stuff obviously it's been going on in the news including the Saudi Arabians situation will be discussing that a little bit of a leader in the show we have the oh by the white Honduran caravan parts whenever there's there's three point oh\nThat is on its way here and this was a really cool thing president waiting out\nThe United states has strongly and formed the president of Honduras but at the large care of and uh people heading to the U. S. is not stopped and brought back to endorse no more money or aid will be given to Honduras affected immediately well thank you this is one thing I've never understood about foreign aid\nWhy is it that we get foreign aid to countries this girl is over and over and over and it gets\n... billion and a half bucks per year\nA billion and a half bucks out the door and government for [noise]\nSo they take it and then\nSend people out to try to crash the borders [noise]\nUnreal anyway president paying attention and if he does stuff you have a step one recovering when you're being victimized by mud and for the right one Margot there\nAre you worried your identity could be held hostage you should be because ransomware does exactly that this is Tom Kelly studio of my id care making every American safer from the effect divided up as a tall order but that's my goal so here's a tip the best thing to do to help protect yourself from ransomware just to back up your computer often\nEverybody worked in paying into it what do you think happens if we put a hundred percent of people on it\nHow's that work since ... already doesn't work in twenty twenty six uh any questions I mean that's just kind of stuck on stupid if you travel down that rabbit hole and I don't I've never smoked anything\nSo I wouldn't know bond guessing there's not enough dope in the world to have that math makes sense so anyway let's go to Joshua in D.C the great W.

I like the the thing that really frustrates me that and the young young thinking person is white cat uh these politicians make their careers based on their own merit on their own talent on their own way to them or their connection with the people and how to solve issues and stuff it it's pretty annoying\nGod Bless you that this is the first time you've gone through a mainframe amen brother [laughter]\nI bet they miss is one of my my all time favorite calls quite honestly\nA Twenty one years of doing radio this is the moment that makes my heart saying you're twenty two you were in science and you're in Washington DC and you're making political sense how did that happen in and do you have any friends\nI have plenty of friends or where there is a small revolution uh but uh uh I have to get a lot of credit and my parents you know yeah invested a lot of knee and not just to frustrate you need more uh the word pedigree\nIs actually a like a technical term that we use in genetics and it's because people don't really see the difference between our animal than people in the same thing so that was your pedigree for people and animals\nOver time so you have a says dog you and me baby in up in ... mammal anyway or ... amazing Josh I mean really\nA long live view and spread your wisdom to as many people as possible board knows we could use it they're a great call great gal All right let's go to a Peter and Illinois All right Peter I uh I I Am it's a tough act to follow so you've got to uh\nUp your game now was a pretty impressive call there\nWell when you were talking about the brain dead voters in Massachusetts you have to remember that the the same people who after a Teddy Kennedy left a woman the ground and the bottom of Chappaquiddick reelected him six times back to the United States Senate [laughter]\nYou raise a very important and interesting point in fact the only thing that he did get caught disqualify problem was ah well ultimately his presidential bid at that point to add to your right if you can also going to get away with Chappaquiddick and you still get reelected in Massachusetts\nAh you know what I ... that is uh that that is an excellent point which by the way that that whole thing in the end it's fascinating by the way every now and then uh because of the last name people will think that\nUh because I'm In broadcasting and I am directly related to the person who helped break that story one Roger Mudd back then and I am not I'm not a somewhere in the very ah outer lying to a bar a genetic silver pedigree you might say there would be a some overlap but actually\nI Am a more aligned with them for me a ... there is one\nInfamous member of the the family that I Am directly related to him that would be Dr Samuel but\nWho may be familiar was one of the uh co conspirators in the assassination of Lincoln he was a doctor actually fix booth flag and end up having a whole kind of interesting deal where you went to the door to go and\nYeah then that's the story for different day but anyway that is my relation not Roger Mudd who broke Chappaquiddick which by the way it's kind of interesting people thought after that\nOh Roger must be this this Republican guy now\n... best I Know to this day he's still a Democrat it's just that he was doing his job and that you that back then he actually has some people in the news business that did their job and it got like you know yeah\nYeah the Kennedy was running against a quarter they're\nKept in pain that it'll friendship the guy that was my nickname for him in in Georgia by the way from suburban Atlanta so a nickname was always kept them being in fact one of my favorite parodies from many years ago was that I remember the mountains and all I'm enjoy commercials\nYou know sometimes you feel like an egg I kind of had some ... like that you know sometimes you feel like and that sometimes you are one you know in the plenty of Jimmy Carter is um so you could throw in there are so anyway it just a as an inside but yeah so that cleared the path for Jimmy Carter\nTo uh to win the nomination again for the Democrats and get his butt whipped by one Ronald Reagan so that story at least was happily ever after for the country now so heavily out ever after for Massachusetts or for the United States Senate ah because to your point he continued to win time after time after time\nAll right how show a couple of things here\nWhen we are taken to like three weeks away from election day\nThere's a lot to keep in perspective and one of the things that I Will frequently point out you um have hurt me anywhere along the way you you've probably heard me say things like there are two sides to stories that are one side to facts tend to be pretty a\nParticular about the facts you know you don't get it's kind of like you know ... we're really not having a conversation about you being a Native American Elizabeth Warren because what you are not\nRight so you you you can't you would that would embrace the false premise which then takes me to the premise of the premise of anything is false than anything built upon it is as well\nLast friday I introduce the sliding scale of morality which means that people always wonder how is it you don't have somebody who under best day seems like a pretty good person and then several underway wow they really are awful and they're stabbing you in the back in their line\nAnd and that's because you have some people that have a moral compass that is stronger than others you know let's say that on our best day we're in eight out of a one through ten ten being perfect which none of us are well if you're in a even a bad day you're probably not going to be worse than a five therefore when you're at your wick is George I'm going to go out of your way to hurt somebody else for your own personal benefit\nWell then you bring it to somebody like ah oh\nI don't know Elizabeth Warren clearly clearly under sliding scale morality one of us both warn\nPretty a moral person because she is willing to hurt somebody that's just that she's wanting to commit fraud it's that she is willing to hurt somebody for personal gain and once again not a victimless crime because somewhere\nMany times over all throughout her academic career throughout her professional career leading up to the time that she was the United states senator she took the thought of it acts on Native American\nSo somebody did get hurt it's pretty moral on the sliding scale of morality that is the willingness to hurt somebody for your own personal benefit ah so you put\nIt all together two sides histories one side of the facts the premise and the Saudis go morality ultimately get is that yes Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to was Pocahontas is\nA bad person who is pretty amoral and again two sides to stories on side effects if you want to be the person who defends taking this law to the actual Native American\nAnd you can justify that bringing on we'll have that conversation when we can also talk to the Cherokee Nation as well because they have a few things to say about it we'll get to the conversation non by mud in for the great one month\nI've had my share of mechanics calling me saying well they found something wrong that needs replacing when I've taken my car in front of oil change

backslash Levin today I\nTwo weeks as to\nWhether you like it or not to\nHe walked into that building and there was no video of him walking out so either he still in there somewhere or he's that that's really the only explanation for it and there was any of them are leaving the facility I think common sense tells you the Saudis were the producer who did it how they did it I think we have to assume the worst and we'll see\nHow they are very straightforward Marco Rubio kind of laying it\nOr a Britain formerly known as that Jamal Pataki alright so as the situation plays out I laid the groundwork by saying\nProbably the greatest accomplishment of all of the Trump Administration is actually the one we think about the least day to day because we're not dealing with the problems you every day we seen the benefit of the economy we got in front of us\nBut we kind of forget that yeah\nYou know what we didn't used to have all those domestic radicalized terrorists all the time we haven't had his problems to play\nBy the way I'm not superstitious though I'm not trying to jinx anybody year but guess what that does that mean that they don't happen around the world I referenced ... we've got some problems here there was a real education that I undertook after we went into a rock\nDie a I went along with the narrative that hey you know uh yeah I mean Afghanistan's to target the outcome of bin Laden but hey we we know that uh\nWe know that we've got problems there Saddam Hussein bad dude if he goes down I mean yeah that that that makes sense and the people that could be free they don't want to be free not understanding all the complications\nSo once things didn't work out exactly the way that we all hope to and we're kind of led to believe that they would I decided I was going to go straight to the source and read the karate\nStarts out by the way and they'll give you the Reader's Digest if you're not familiar starts out kinda like sunshine law Bob didn't by the end it's kinda like hey if you don't see the world the way we do a you die and by whatever means necessary\nThe groundwork ultimately the groundwork under ... now you have is our practice obviously many different sects some of which are positive but three is not true law in all forms is evil\nAnd by the way if you want to argue that story laws not evil again I I guess you can but then you have to make the case that women are subservient to demand that if a woman is raped for example she should still be stoned to death because she had sex with the rape is\nI mean just details you know that if you're homosexual as well it was about the left are you still like to come out and don't understand Israel for for ...\nIf you are a homosexual against what he gets do because you are homosexual or a you know these days they they they just got I sometimes they don't get the whole formal stoning thing together they they just all show buildings or whatever\nBut the part of the problem in us being somewhat immune from the realities of Islamic terror\nWe can take for granted the safety that we have day to day that is not present elsewhere in the world a little detail for you that you probably were not aware of how many Islamic terror attacks do you think of happened that have been documented around the world so far in twenty eight team\nSay about it for a second got number ... probably one thousand\nHundred and eighty nine [laughter] probably a little bit higher than what you thought to get today for example in Mali you had a terror attack a woman writing her donkey blown up by Islamic terrorists\nEarlier today in Afghanistan U.S forces as citizens that were bombs by Taliban\nYou probably didn't even know that yesterday in France you had a man attack somebody with a chisel raising all probably didn't know about that\nSee even sometimes in countries like France [noise] it doesn't get reported over here there's a lot more to that story\nIs that the root of it and guess what\nThey're still tenets of that in Saudi Arabia\nFor the situation becomes that much more complicated\nWe'll say in the conversation was just getting going on by mud in for the\nThat\nListen to what David ask from Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an unbelievable difference in how I sit at my desk\nI was calling them you know I think that these people with the Democrats are ... are trying to do is basically turn this country to Mexico or or even bring in swat I'm someone who I Am here in the United states under the ACA program and it I think I think it really sucks you know that there's these people have the nerve\nTo actually put themselves make themselves look like oh we're wondering when are you guys just to try to get sympathy from anybody and anybody who who actually cares\nYou know you have your ... how long have you been here ...\nI have been here since I was about eight years old\nOkay and uh how old you know or ...\nRight now I'm thirty three\nOkay so your view of the United states as a child and an adolescent to to today what what's changed in in what's your perspective\nYou know what I'm like in any any like any race there are good people there are bad people I've had good experiences and really bad ones too but overall ... ... people have in this country if it's like oh let me let me just say\nThe the privileges the ... everything that people have in this country a lot a lot a lot of the most if not everybody in the Democratic party picks up for grabs her\nYou know if it ... it just to me it's frustrating because\nWhat I what I remember when we're in first of all the trouble of our president all everybody all the celebrities said all we're going to leave this country is\nFighting never knew they always say and they never do so does how\nWould I Would love to take my recovery has power ... or ... what's his name ... if you if you saw on happy I'd love to try to spark\nWell Colin Kaepernick is wait making way too\nIt can way too much money being the role of the the victim who who sacrifice everything making what about asked me to a hundred million dollars\nOh just a little bit more they would have made as a backup quarterback in the NFL so yeah I mean he he fully has a capitalized on his victim status and Isaac I appreciate the call into perspective you know it's interesting\nI'm here in South Florida and blame on filling in for more calls in by the way and in in South Florida\nHispanic means about thirty different things\nAnd people always over simplify it is part of the reason why the way you have a lot of folks that get Florida elections wrong because you'll have some of these ah pollsters oriental is out there who will say you know hey nationally Hispanics break X percent for Democrats and bases that hey we have a very large\nHispanic contingent in Florida\nAnd then you go all those people are going to break for Democrats at this present well hold on\nHold on for just a minute [laughter] you have to figure out all the different interest in all the various different groups that are here all the Caribbean islands that are represented\nMexico yes you do have south and Central America is also represented on the things that I found to be most interesting kind of like a Isaac was\nIndicating there you're on DACA\nFor many on the right there are stereotypes and in some sense for example if someone's ear on DACA ... they probably are and Obama type a Democrat is they don't like Donald Trump ...\nWell not not necessarily a big misconception that white kind of like hey you know X number of Hispanics will break this way regardless of where they're from or what their interests are gotta get to know what the people and I've found\nAre more often than not\nThat people who really sought out the United states true immigrants bell wanted a better life overwhelmingly overwhelmingly are more conservative than not certainly socially more conservative than they did Democrats have been in a very long time\nBut even in terms of economics I mentioned earlier this hour\nYou have a lot of the younger folks you have millennials for example are starting to have their eyes open to why this economy can do once the United states economy is capable of\nThey didn't know before because they became adults during the recession and then the Obama economy so now they're just starting to go wow you know things can be different\nI've seen it even around radio you ... with some folks that have been here over the years like wow you know really can't get better yeah get you can same deal with a lot of Hispanics\nA lot of different backgrounds lot of folks that want a better life if they can uh paint and they're going to want more of that is that what we've actually been seen increasingly ... is a trend towards the\nTwo of the most watched districts in the country did a a BBC special on the mid term elections they wanted to highlight six different regions of the country and the ... elections\nAs the case may be in South Florida here we have the two most heavily democratic districts currently represented by Republicans to the United States House their districts twenty six and twenty seven in Florida\nAnd district twenty six you had Hillary Clinton win in that district in twenty sixteen my sixteen points\nBut you had Carlos Curbelo the current representative who's a Republican win by five or six points\nYou know how does that happen that wouldn't happen in other parts of the country right\nI mean being the there too many people which is both a ticket if you're for Hillary Clinton how close you vote for any Republican\nCongressionally again what I was just mentioning not as a\nConventional as the not so ... a conventional wisdom or or why use thought ... would have you think there's\nA lot more to the story and we started talking about Hispanics and immigrants do want a better life\nAnd death for twenty seven you have\nHillary Clinton having won that district by twenty points twenty points and you had deal retiring early in the Ross lightened when that district by ten\n... the difference here and that's why it's important to break the odds with these stereotypes to really understand some of the dynamics many folks do not support the left in what they've been doing from the immigration stance or in in many folks that are here on ... got a disproportionate number one in\nSouth Florida I've talked to a lot of them over the years they might surprise you politically so anyway you just a little food for thought as we're three weeks away from election day let's go to Ryan who wants to take me to task Brian in San Francisco go\nTo a a you you mentioned that you know ... people who smoke\nPot or all the um whatever or not or are not educated or\nNot buying new he kinda\nCame across that I made a stereotype about it yes but you're you're here to tell me that's not the case you and your ... are are are on the right to do but\nI I work my ass off I actually got a good um you know I got my crumbs back from\nThere [laughter] [laughter] there you are the land and empty Boise yeah\n... exactly right and I'm going to vote read up and down ticket\nAmen brother that I'm actually going to look\nInto all my city council people now and me and asked them because I only got Twenty one days left so I got to get going\nGod Bless you brother and a duly noted duly noted I did make kind of a a nasty stereotype about that do smoke and folks and and maybe or how they would vote so I Am\nThis is a really interesting show we're having here because managers have a twenty two year old biology student last hour from Washington DC which by the way Ninety One percent of Washington DC votes for Democrats\nIn and he is a thoughtful pragmatic conservative and now we've got someone who is a you know and the ball from San Francisco\nAnd he was a conservative I mean you know moving mountains and is your Donald Trump Republican Party\nIt's a kind of interesting kind of go All right I'm by mud in for the great one month\nHere data is everywhere data breaches Facebook breaches big companies
