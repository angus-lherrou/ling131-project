again now is Peter ...\nReal turn with bishop west real estate license to Massachusetts Vermont New York and Florida he's been a real tour for Thirty years and he carries many of NPR's advanced certifications including\nThe certified commercial investment member designation Peter thanks for coming back on real estate today\nIt's by pleasure to be back thank you for having me\nWell Peter I appreciate you coming back when we left you in our first our we had just finished talking about a tried and true real estate investment strategy in which you buy another house but you keep the one you're in and rent it out that seems like a great way to start\nEspecially if it is a rental market for example where we are in Venice, Florida right now there's a terrific went to the market because the air being the murder is so strong yeah top dollar\nBy renting out of the Arab Ian be as a weekly or monthly rental and as a annual rental mhm but an annual rental is slow and steady slow and steady wins the race\n[laughter] that's always going to either for Peter\nIf someone's leaning forward and listening to this and they're fascinated by it how would you advise that they find a good property that will continue to generate a good amount of rent\nThe first thing that you need is a good realtor that knows the market and not somebody that you know from the gym or the country club that's nice to you a realtor that specializes in\nInvestment property and understands somebody that's willing to sit\nDown and go through the course and explained the pros and cons some states it's easier to our residential rental property than others\nYou need to look at regulation and what the landlord business is mhm but the next biggest critical piece of advice because we knew the into real estate for investment let us residential\nVacation rental office retail industrial you've got to know what you're doing what I mean by that is you need to know the landlord tenant laws\nIn that state is how it pertains you understand that part of the business of lentils you will be on top of his game already Seventy five percent on the way the successes understanding the rules\nThat is such great advice and you know you already mentioned buying a new house in keeping the when you already have but if you want to stay in your house and you're not going to move how would you recommend one of our listeners pays for property they find\nWell you know you if you have ... what do you and your ... how could we find at your home and take equity or you get a bridge loan between the two properties mhm there are a lot of private investors out\nOh is that what they call hard money\nYeah absolutely could be called hard money\nPrivate equity investors but with a lot of folks can do you can't buy yourself but you can fast\nIRA you can take it to be a self directed IRA\nSome banks do it some national come next to it and you invest the money you direct where it goes so for example somebody looking\nFor money for a down payment on the alert to finance a flip property or picky then that something needs\nFifty Seventy five hundred thousand a good source of self directed IRAs because that person is going to get more in a real estate investment based on interest in return than they would\nIf they were to um just have it with a institutional higher rate company it's paying probably two percent today stock markets good maybe it's ... percent\nYou're Peters back is fascinating and let me ask you another question about all this you know you have more than one hundred properties if you combine Florida in Massachusetts [noise]\nDid you just kind of end up there or was that part of your plan to have one hundred one properties by this time in your life that\nWas kind of planned out the Massachusetts is where I'm by home and I raised my son as it turned out to ... yes it wasn't a planned Venice, Florida is the right\nSpot has a lot of desire ability and therefore it gifts of based on the Gulf Coast rock and go up and down and do what I Need to do so that was definitely in the plan\nThat is wonderful one more question for you my friend tell our listeners if you will\nBut if they retire and they have anywhere from a handful of properties to a whole lot of properties what will their life be like\nI wouldn't know what we're from it is and that's and that's a nervous worked for bank but I can assure you that\nYou'll be able to live the lifestyle that you're looking to live without worrying about it because you're controlling your own destiny\nPeter that is just such great perspective and thank you for all the insights in the advice wonderful job my friend and I really appreciate you being on the show\nThank you it's my pleasure you're very welcome Peter West real tour with bishop west real estate\nFriend and I really appreciate you being on the show thank\nYou it's my pleasure you're very welcome Peter what real tour with bishop west real estate license to Massachusetts Vermont New York and Florida\nComing up on real estate say selling your great big house\nBy so much they will say last year and in addition to locking in that equity\nI no longer on a lawnmower [laughter] [noise]\nThat's coming up on our special show retiring wealthy [noise]\nBut first it's time for our smart home technology reports\nToday of big questions\nAre smart speakers along the way\nPossibly pushed aside by smart display\nLet's talk about that up to now there have been three main players and the smart home arena Amazon Echo Google Home an apple home pot they all started this just smart speakers really smart speakers which you could ask anything and the speaker would answer by talking to you\nNow that was the status quo until Amazon added video screens their big echo show and they're cute little echo spot were game changers because with their bright colorful screens you could watch the news watch the forecast and watch the steps in a recipe\nFor more than a year Amazon oh into that space until last July when Lenovo launched a smart display with built in Google Assistant\nIt was followed closely by another Google display from J. B. L. but just this month Google announced it their own version in their biggest development yet\nThe Google hub the replacement for its original Google Home the hub has a seven inch video screen and premiums speakers built in\nAnd when it comes everything Google is known for from Youtube videos to step by step map directions to your personal calendar but now you can see all those things not just hear about them\nNow the Google hub is a smaller device which would fit justice comfortably on a night stand is in the kitchen and perhaps because it would make such a good smart alarm clock nestled right next to your bed\nThe Google hub does not come with a camera\nAt the store shelves this Monday October twenty second and its entering the market at a lower price point one hundred fifty dollars compared to two hundred and thirty dollars for the second generation Amazon show ...\nThey can sell that house and put that quarter of a million dollars in their pocket free of tax\nAnd if they're married it's five hundred\nExactly so what I'm saying ... some people doing as well is\nTaking that exclusion by another property and start that exclusion all over again\nStarted clock up again in ... slash five hundred\nAnd that's particularly useful for people who are thinking or gallon size so why can't sell the big home ... and fifty five hundred thousand start the clock over again on the towels in kenner Fifteen Years cell that ... free forever but condo\nThat is such a great strategy Peter\nSo for example I'm In my early sixties and I sold my single family last year and in addition to locking in that equity I no longer own a lawnmower\n[laughter] I can go fishing whatever I Want\n[laughter] [noise] oh my gosh and you know it just comes to mind that real estate can help\nYou in so many ways in your later years you don't have to limit yourself to being an investor you can be just smart with your primary residence\nCorrect exactly\nPeter awesome advice great job and I really

and they can't even handle two years of payments on a payment plan interest free which is still forty something dollars a month so now\nHere's this experiment offering three year payment plans okay this is a rotten terrible idea you end up paying more for the phone each month likely been for your service each month\nAnd so it means to step back and look at in spite of all the hype and all the ads and all that look at a more affordable phone\nWhat can I use phone\nWork at one of the mid priced phones are lower priced phones but you can afford to buy instead of having to finance a phone for

scholarship I'm gonna take it but she didn't but it was out there and that's the thing is to use the marketplace tier advantage and was state school systems\nVary somewhat state to state for more and more states are now going to three tier or for tier\nStates supportive school systems where they will have white is for lack of a better term maybe sometimes used in a state\nThe flagship state universities charge the highest tuition\nThen there'll be second tier third tier forest here is a community colleges many of which now offer a four year degrees each here has a different tuition level the greatest irony of it though the whole system\nIs that people who go to a first tier state school\nYour freshman and sophomore year will be far larger class sizes than someone who goes to a fourth tear community college in the state\nSo you might be in a classroom that has fourteen hundred students or eight hundred students or something like that at a tier one the flagship university in a state\nInstead going to a community college to deal with your ... as a freshman or sophomore you might be in a class with twenty six people were forty four people not hundreds or thousands so he had a better deal and you get more attention from the instructor\nChuck is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Chuck\n...\nHow's it going not ... not bad at all how can I be of service the you well\nOver this last ... maybe a little bit longer and get offers from companies that are interested in buying my house you know they're pretty persistent and so I just said let me\nLook them up and see what they were all the falls but uh I haven't really been able to find out much about them so I guess my thought is I'm\nA ... number two um if they all legit today you know do a a little law offer on your property and what are the dangers order risk in in going forward with one of these folks yeah and I'm I'm just doing it\nPrimarily right now for education to learn what they were about what their business model is like\nSo that I can make an informed decision\nRight so the the people who are approaching use your house a house in good condition and I are established neighborhood\nYes it is so go ahead and name who it is who is on your radar is there any particular company that you're curious about\nI'm One of them call a a thing goes by name open door\nAh I've addressed open door on the air and let me explain to you what this is about there are a number of companies that are establishing and they're racing to establishing city after city in the country\nWhere for um [noise] I guess you could refer to as mid priced homes in a market\nThere's enough inventory where they feel like they can figure out what is a fair value for your home so with these people do is they guarantee lie in the case of open door and\nIts competitors they guarantee you that they'll they'll evaluate your home they may come in and they'll do that on line they may come in and do an inspection\nAnd then they will make a firm offered to you to buy your home and then with the idea of being the you've vacate really quickly typically within a month can be quicker but\nThey just buy it and they charge you roughly the equivalent of a real estate commission to do what they charge you about six percent\nOf all I'd say just for argument's sake they said the house was worth two hundred thousand they would pay you like one eighty eight somewhere in there and you're out and you're just going\nSo the question with any of them oh and the reason they do that is they believe that they develop systems open during his competitors believe they've developed systems\nWhere they can properly price a house cat it I'm dressed up however they need to end the landscaping or inside\nAnd get it sold quicker than you can with you going to a traditional real estate agent and having them market the traditional way whether or not these things are going to\nStand the test of time the market will decide the weight you get out of it is you're just done if you like the price they offer you ma'am you're out no questions no gifts you know you're done you don't have to worry about showing the house or anything like that\nI see okay and you also have to decide the price\nThat you were offered [noise] do you think they're low balling you or do you feel like it's really a decent offered they're making for your house\nAll day does that make ... yes\nYes it does I just wanted to have an idea what they're about whether or not you know they were totally\nTotally legit no doubt that this is a a a real thing and the company's doing this I think another one is offer pat I think is another one and there's another one called knock\nAnd so these companies they're learning how to price they're learning how to market their learning how to sell\nAnd then they add cities around the country very heavy emphasis on the south south west and west and the reason those areas because those are areas of the country that developed along the automobile have a lot of suburban housing a lot of ... a a subdivisions and developments\nBuilt with very similar housing plans and looks so they can more accurately price to house they're not interested\nAnd really high end houses because they don't know exactly how to price them and how easily they'll sell and they're not interested in the houses that tend to be a neighborhood so I said there in transition that maybe had been rough neighborhoods trying to get better or something like that\nBut it is the real deal\nAnd Tom is with us on the Clark Howard show

fine one afternoon I got an email from the car companies saying well we've got your address change which obviously was a mine so I called him\nStop the stuff's card know sent me a new one the whole smear at that point to sue the cart into the to my file and started using my original art again and at last September this last September I got the same message from the credit card company so I called them\nThey went through the whole dance on they sent me a new card and then it happened again and October ... three times as happened it's been a different addressed of a male and the new car too so I talked to the company and they sent me on the frog department and the whole thing I did ask him I said no other cards I have\nFor a second level security worried and they would ask you a

consumer protections fit a consumer card does under pre existing law and the car to act that was passed after the banking scandals\nSo the Congress carved out the exception to consumer protections for business cards so as an example\nLet's say a criminal did run up a lot of charges on your car and if they were successful you able to take it over and run up charges their credit card company with a business card can say oh well\nWe don't think they you Tom took good precautions and so we're going to hold you liable for their charges or whatever which they cannot do want to consumer car so I don't like even if you're using a card\nFor business purposes I like for you to get a consumer card and just use it in your business and pay for it from your business\nIs it less course apps and then
