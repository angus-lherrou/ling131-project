designed to grant freed slaves who'd lived here for centuries and had no allegiance to any other jurisdiction the basic rights of American citizens will be used as a tool to prevent Congress from regulating citizenship for immigrants of all stripes is scandal is\nThe first sentence\nOf the fourteenth amendment all persons born or naturalized\nIn the United states and\nSubject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nThe state where they reside we need not speculate what subject to the jurisdiction thereof means as I said the other day\nSenator lime in Trumbull of Illinois the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee at that time\nSaid during the debate over the fourteenth amendment quote subject to the jurisdiction unquote of the United states means subject to its complete jurisdiction quote not allowing allegiance to anybody else on quote\nOf course persons present inside American territory are subject to our partial jurisdiction in the sense that they have to obey our laws and our subject to criminal prosecution for disobeying our laws but one congressional drafted added the second phase of jurisdiction to citizenship clause\nThey require it clearly limiting citizenship to those who in the words of one of the three key draft ers were subject to complete jurisdiction as Americans\n\nSenator Jake empowered of Michigan the principal author of the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment in the Senate explicitly said that candidates for citizenship must be born here and not owe allegiance to any other authority echoing Trumbull\nHe said a full and complete jurisdiction means that same jurisdiction\nIn extent and quality as applies to every citizen ... of the United states now he made it clear allegiance quote will not of course quote will not of course include persons born in the United states who are foreigners aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors\nOr foreign ministers I credited to the government or the United states so\nSimply put the history of this amendment is not in dispute it's not about ... and ... it's not up for debate\nSo what changed\nIn the constitution changed nothing

United states under those circumstances you wouldn't have brought in South Carolina Georgia and some of these other states in this there's no question that's the history\nOf what took place that's the history of what took place Benjamin Franklin was an abolitionist\n\nAlexander Hamilton was an abolitionist several of them were abolitionist but they voted\nThe way they voted\nBecause they felt they needed to have a union and then from there they could address the rest that's exactly what took place you know who else took that position sixty years later\nWell Seventy some years later Abraham

wouldn't have been a civil war to eliminate that's what the scientists rights\nFor all intents and purposes taking up the position that Lincoln took up taking up the position of Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Hamilton took up so\nThis guy Andrew Gillum says that demonstrates that to say this wrote a book defending slavery\n\nNow this man is repulsive and he's a demagogue\nHe's alive is way
