all I Believe the uh\nFor any child that's out there or do that it plans to do something and I believe this young man fear for dry and that's why\nThe police officers in my estimation did not allow him to come out of that place alive because he shot a police officer are they're killing our children wholesale over and over again\nAnd they should fear for their lives because they're they're just just fixed that showed that day I die\nBut this young man rather than going to a shared somewhere he should have went to a mosque or a church somewhere and say I'm ready to give myself up and therefore he may have been able to make it out alive and and support the case that he feared for his life\nAnd getting it that becomes a real conversation that people should have with individuals who I wanted that if you don't control the dynamics of your\nAh of you turn to yourself and if you don't control that dynamic you could die I had a situation not too long ago with my good friend her room

ago mhm and her room gave me a call and I called everybody I knew to arrange his surrender Ryan and we created a public ... public rallies\nAnd I walked whole room into the Fulton County jail personally\nRight and I told him I'm walking you win today and I promise you I Will walk you out and a few days after that we walked the brother out okay but what could have happened he could have had an interaction with law enforcement\nExact something else would that he could have been at a rally himself protesting for something that's right and somebody ran his name and something else would that they could have kicked in his door for the board right now you got to control those variables when you know that this paper on you like that\nRather in this this speaks to nationalism I called this program and others because of that very concept nationalism\nWe have no nationality in this country and I chatted with you and go back and forth and it is let me just take it to the international

folks to another white race the Chinese they've all quite as flying into the other as well that they still have the same agenda and that agenda\nTo create and use the resources that country for that

front of our face right here in America why we've just vote for is a poet the very shift them that continues to do it\nAnd I I tell you for the life of me\nAs a country boy cotton picker small intellect individual\nWhen I look at these people who continue to support the very people that are ... and taking that you're in and marginalizing is educating and they continue to want to join them [laughter]\nI think we get what we deserve it here on the continent of Africa you got the very same thing going now and this development is actually destroying the environment\nFor the reach of the
