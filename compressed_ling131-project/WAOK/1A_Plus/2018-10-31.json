I wanted to be ... I was telling I was telling the pastor during the uh right before we did the interview I Would I was six or seven years old if somebody asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up\nMy response was I Want to be a superhero and I believe that being a superhero was a legitimate career yes yes yes yes and I was the same way I Want to be Batman [laughter] with the car the whole nine yards so\nI wanted to choose something that so many from all walks of life in ages can identify with what better way to be able to reach out to people in a safe environment to have fun for the children as well didn't have a night with superheroes so tonight we're going to have Black Panther we're going to have super Wonder Woman we're going to have kept in America\nAre so many superheroes going to actually be

way of being a safe environment safe candy you know back in the day when we were growing up we ... we heard\nTrick or treat this is a better way of being in a safe environment\nSafe candy you know back in the day when we were growing up we ... we heard all kinds of things about razor blades in apples and candy being laced with drug substances you don't have that issue here yeah we have a safe environment with families can bring their children they can have fun they can eat that can\nA fellowship with other people uh we have a Latino brothers or sisters going to be that I got to D jays going so they're going to have the Latino music going on and we're just there was a blind date and so we're just going to have a ball in a safe place where the children can come and just have

to come in their candy history for the kids with the trick or treat now we've got vendors are going to barbecue chicken and things of this nature do we want to have something where they do so they wanted to buy some barbecue chicken or funnel cakes\nThat you know that sealed the deal for by half of my little ... oh yeah you got to have the yard but we got to have [laughter] all day [laughter]\nWhat gave you the idea to do this\nThey gave me that would give me ideas being able to reach out to the community\nTraditionally in the church you always want to people to come in you come to us that's not the ministry of Christ is to go out to where they are and what better way to do it then when people are already out people want a safe place to have family time and fellowship time in these\nWe could times that we're in drive by shootings things of this nature it's hard to find a place in a venue where people can have fun enjoy when another meeting new people fall under fresh relationships and experience the love of crisis will\nFrom last year what were some of the takeaways from the adventure had last year yet a thousand people so I'm sure there were some moments there did you say wow this is something where they\nTake away it was the community wants to safe place to be able to enjoy themselves without having to worry about any issues and so we bumped it up this year we're going to bump it up next year to wow the key thing is to have fun have fun and fellowship have fun and eat and just enjoy one enough\nTo have some canned and has a whole lot of candy yeah
