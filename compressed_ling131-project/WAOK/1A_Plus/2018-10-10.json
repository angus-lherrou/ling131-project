U. C. K. A. F. R. E. E. have a good time\nFor zero point now to do seven zero three that gives you the conversation let's go to Sam in southwest Atlanta sale what\nWhat's going on our side than a yes how are you man I'm good how about you that's a great brother had a man I'll\nListen to the topic last night on another one of the shows on stage did it so representatives all that at our policy is is what the Atlanta and they were talking about their thoughts and I'm trying to see some of them mentioned some names are who\nAims to make money off of the deal as somebody brought up for him he said\nI wasn't sure if you're going to think about it but why do you think of land is pushing the deal so hard\nThere are multiple reasons why Atlanta is pushing this deal some of it has to do with legacy\nMayor Bill Campbell transformed public housing you've had other mayors do things like Maine or has the airport I think Shirley Franklin Atlantic Station\nAnd a casino read obviously his massive development and uh the stadium so this would be a legacy bill now wouldn't create opportunity and jobs yes all of that is very true and it would have a dynamic impact in that undeveloped area of Atlanta\nBut the question is how much tax dollar how much how much tax dollars are going to be involved so I think part of this is a push a legacy\nOf push to really see the legacy\nOf mayor bottoms and also there are people who still believe this will have a net positive in the city and there are others who believe in what happened that negative and that's the argument\nWow I Know it seems like Atlanta looking to have everybody making at least a hundred thousand dollars each town so bringing on at least a hundred thousand dollars because usually attracts other companies if\nOther people all over the span I see in the first all the uh low income people out because it's not right\nBut outside of you they can you know I don't see them where they're having a leg to stand on right now because it's all about who split them an office and the\nMoney behind the politicians they're going after Reagan served type of a demographic an area where I work with a friend to thank for America about Thirty years ago\nPaws worked on campaigns for early Franken Franklin and he said send me outside of this this play out of the entire United States they don't change and I try not to cough complex of the country\nYou know Franklin and he said send me outside of this is way out of your prior United States Trade Center cough conflicts of the country\nMoving all the wealthy people within the inner city that I stay home with his Thirteen Years ago I was taking it seriously you know 'cause I was no way to do a great science and stuff I wasn't folk expected\nBut now he says you'll see it come to pass it with common defense the former fine\nAnd I think they're trying to set it up or a Republican or a wealthy people are in certain areas will superdelegates a votes will count for the president in an office or why do you think they're going his redevelopment\nAnd it's not that it's not that because that is contrary to their political goal they do not need a bunch of rich white Republicans to move into the state of Atlanta that is contrary to the political aspirations of mayor bottoms and others who serve on council because\nOf progressive voters so that's not the reason okay if anything they would like to have more progressive individuals more minorities actually coming to the city if we're talking about political goal I write because politically those other people who vote for them right\nSo I think there's a fundamental difference\nIn simple business doctor in an ideology that is what I Believe you have members on the council who simply saying this is a good deal business wise based on their doctor named belief a business and there are other than the council who believe that this is not the best deal we can get at the moment and so they are contrary\nA contrary to the idea they may come around\nIf some room to negotiate exist\nBut as it stands today they are not in agreement with the goats deal\nYou know how much tax dollars are wonderful to do\nI think it was at one point seven five a one billion seven five and the one billion was coming from the state of Georgia through a tax to ferment I Believe on the rest of it was coming through eight thirty year\nA tax to ferment\nThe actual development site and so there's still significant a tax dollars here\nWhat is the ferment me\nThat means that you pay later don't you just basically pay later a one of the conversations I had with a member of the Atlanta school boy this was all record\nIs that basically the school board in Atlanta they get all of their money from property taxes but how they're going to deal goes through under what's called the tax allocation district which is a combination of the city of Atlanta\nFulton County government and Atlanta public schools okay\nThat a professor has with their student the American association of university professors a group that I Am a member of\nHoles very sacred the idea of academic freedom you may not always like the academic freedom but academic freedom exist now during the candidate sea of Trump\nTrump spoke at various colleges why he was candidate for president\n\nNot only did he speak at various colleges walk candidate for president he also spoke at colleges that gay students extra credit for attending his speech his rally\nAnd there were some on the left the guy's been out of shape about it but here's the truth the reason why I didn't talk about it not in that context is because I understand it was academic freedom\nProfessors institutions have the ability to do that you may not agree with it\nWe got young Julian here\nI think I think he disagrees with me\nNo I you know I actually do agree with you or you know I'm about three days removed from college arise and if it if I had a college professor that offered\nExtra credit for us to pull up to one of these events you know I don't I Can't speak for all college students but at that point in time I wasn't as politically inclined so I Would have pulled up especially depending on what kind of class it was kind of course it was I Would have pulled up took that sell the and put it on let me say each well his desire to learn and that's a uh that's like an academic\nRight on the website for for class and students decide you're uploading it to\nBut it on let me say in each well his desire to learn and that's a uh that's like an academic brown website for for class and students decide you're uploading it to to Instagram to promote Stacey Abrams you were there was a\nProper context for the actual assignments or this was a criminal justice assignment the reason why this is appropriate to me is because\nPart of what was discussed at the rally was criminal justice reform and the candidates plan in order to implement criminal justice reform in the state of Georgia unfortunately the Republican\nNominee for governor he's not talking about criminal justice reform\nI get it and I think that I think it's an overreach because ultimately the students are getting an opportunity to see what this is about\nAnd I think that is the most important part and that's the learning part of a of the lesson right you go out to this political ... you can call a political rally where you're seeing possibly our our next governor speak\nI think it's a good idea and you know extra credit\n... extra credit credit and I know that you know I don't get why this is a major story I mean the headline on traveled to says extra credit controversy really really yeah extra credit controversy I interviewed bill Campbell last month last month the interview billed Capitol leadership talked at ... university interviewed him had a great interview\nEvery student in my class got extra credit for tend to\nEvery student I gave them extra credit for sending that leadership talk discussion\nAnd ultimately that's what we care about as students is getting as much credit as fast as we hear well we have to do in order to get that extra credit people will pull up regardless of what side of the other party there on and they're going to come just for those who point\nThey will but again it gives you an understanding of the curriculum outside the confines of the classroom so it makes it leap from theoretical to a pragmatic one people who have actually experienced it\nNot as a scholar but as somebody who who is a practitioner and so you create those opportunities as much as you can if you are a good professor\nAnd my question to you real shot and all the listeners would be would this be an issue if this wasn't happening during this air in politics\nYou know if that's a great point and it happens all the time this is an issue now because of the increased tribalism of our political narrative but believe me\nConservative professors have done it liberal professors have done it it is absolutely nothing new nothing new whatsoever okay speaking of leadership talks\nSpeaking of leadership talks we have our very own Derek Bozeman\nWill be in the hot seat with
