some things that happened during the commercial break that obviously every one did not have the opportunity to experience\nOkay yeah I agree that understanding\nObviously every one did not have the opportunity to experience\nOkay yeah I appreciate that understanding um you know I I was just having a flight reaction to the young lady she was annoying Lee immature I I I Would like to see a little more distance between her fellow when he is activities and her running for this office\nNow when you say distance are you talking about Tom was time life had gone to so understand this one\nThere was no felony conviction based on ... of no law or inefficient in addition to that the law itself grants Eighteen year basically a ... year stay\nOn running for this particular office if there was a conviction and remember they interpreted it was not a conviction so the law says ten years as far as I'm concerned\nI really don't care about any of that I care about the person's transformation from anything negative that would compromise them in office and their ability to serve properly and that's it\nYeah I appreciate your your continued explanation of that now that I think about it you did emphasize that with her at the time the the legality of it all night three sheet that um I just think he's still needs more time as they say to wipe and she says he struck me as being cocky he struck me is just being immature\nI I just that he needs more time to write another ten years me\nI don't know about ... than ten years yeah I mean how years may than\nIt does because of her personality because of her personal characteristics\nShe she's actually she's a really nice person she's only thirty two years of age and you know I advocate for young people the millennial advocate for young people are being held run into office all of that because we knew that\nYeah I did too but you know she's not you I mean I just said she's not she just doesn't strike me as having so much to offer and and the way of of\nOf of of the kinds of kinds of financing you do at telling our little about that with this little thing that strikes me I was just not impressed I mean the other thing is I have I have kind of I guess personal disdain for all Republicans\nI'm trying to remember whether this is the same district that and that test or I don't think you may not remember\nWho now say that again that her name was and that's Katherine ... anyway she was the first black woman I'm elected I think to cob something and this has been years ago and she managed to to offend some of the white God there and so they literally ran or out of town on the rails\nBut I'm In Marietta um I I'm just wondering how they how ... how she stacks up against the Democrat is there is he running against a Democrat I\nWrite she is now just so you know I Will be sending that person and invite because of the equal time claws\nBut I Would not send to before we did the interview because I needed to know how long her interview was before a offered it on the other side sometimes they accepted sometimes they do not but that is part of the equal time clause in elections\nOkay yeah well you you know this has been quite enlightening for me I was not aware of her and uh I appreciate the information that she provides as I said um that un she provided but um I don't know I I just found that she was over there and to me I mean she really ever so cute and charming and all that\nBut she she needs a little more time and a lot more maturation on that just\nAnd for and for me I'm understanding because I've stood
