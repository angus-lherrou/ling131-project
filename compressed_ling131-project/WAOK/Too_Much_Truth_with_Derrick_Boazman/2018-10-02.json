I used to call it a great question or well how is this a good deal for that well I think\nThere are a lot of questions and you know that depends on who what perspective you're looking for as to whether it's a great deal or that so several of the things I think the council accounts of member I Would do is the community benefits peace are I call them like the dangling sparkly things\nAre and I and I have to give the administration kudos that they were able to come up with some community benefits in terms of what about housing those kind of thing 'cause that's not something that's normally done with these deals however I don't want us to focus so much on that\nThat we don't look at the actually enabling legislation and what it does is so when you get into the document that's where the meat of the questions are\nFrom inner governmental agreements whether the council would be approving a one ordinance that would\nEssentially approved in a governmental agreements with Fulton County in school board without coming back to counsel\nSo that you know kind of a dangerous situation\nThat we understand it in the late must turn them in\nThat property is not wholly owned by the cities and holding on by the\nSnow in the city through the Fulton County recreation and thought I think has a piece of Norfolk Southern has a large portion of their um the state of Georgia has Martians or that\nAnd seems like there's another party because it's owned by various buyers are already I Am what they have that it's gone to all these various and said they'll through us yes they have a contract with an option to purchase a proper even for the city's portion\nYes yes they are able to get this deal so the ... the issue that they had what timing or they say they have it what time is these options come do at the end of the month and so they don't know that the people\nAt all but everybody who's option\nIs at the table or the city of Atlanta right state is all of that tape what people have not saying because the mayor said in her press conference Norfolk Southern is saying they want to relocate to headquarters here but what mysteriously that was missing out of that conversation that see I Am\nBought the Norfolk Southern building that big white building that's its own springs\nHaven't bought it so this is what I understand\nThey have bought it and they actually working in it that natural understanding that now OK\nOkay and I and I may be wrong but I Do know when I talk with north for seven and they have an option on their property so\nThey're not currently can you ask them for me because information I've been able to glean is that the actual\nOwned the building and there may be more or at least ... I'm Talking about the big building okay I don't know are going to say that that's not that they are\nDeveloping it and they and then now doing ...\nAt least ... I'm Talking about the big building okay I don't know are going to say that that's not that they are developing it and they and then now during preliminary work to convert those the law and that may be true and so uh but\nThey had also the property where they have the air rights that they're getting all of them were the tracks are\nBut if they already own the largest piece of real estate of Norfolk Southern was so interested in relocating their history here why would they seal the building to see I Am ...\nI can only tell you what I Know and I and I and I'm not I have to clarify whether it's that building or not but I understand\nThe the I Am has an option on the property I Gotcha and Norfolk interest in this deal is it moving forward so that they purchased the property because they liked that money from the purchase of that property to help them their relocating to Atlanta\nIn ... in mid town they're not building in midtown renting since may ... I I don't want to I'm not sure if they're renting here's the thing they make it sound like oh we're about to lose this deal will all you're losing is a deal to rent some space\nHow they are losing is the money that they would get\nFrom selling their ears and feel that it goes to their bottom line what I'm saying what I'm so they already own see I Am ... owns the building and that they are actually doing work on okay I don't know I don't know that is true or not because if you're just\nTalking about leasing some space as ms uses as a ... actually the reason\nFor the we need to move that Norfolk Southern may move somewhere else how ... how do you let me ask you know the ... on this and they were going to move on the ... had they just told you all this is for Amazon and they still monitor your um in in that\nI have not heard that it's definitely for Amazon and they've always said that they want to build it was an Amazon comes here and not [noise]\nOkay and you believe that\nIt's not a matter of belief that just telling you what I'm ... okay for for a night to to seven zero three\nIs all about the goals one point five billion dollars in tax incentives and inter governmental grooming what I Want to get back is just so you can unravel inter governmental ... because what the city is pledging is its portion\nOf the increase of the taxable real estate\nOver a period of is it Thirty years ... attorney\nOr say oh they're in the ... and in addition to that any sales tax revenue this generated in the enterprise on which is\nWithin the task to state allowed to happen for sense of that will go to the development once they get to return on on\nOn that is where the billion comes in from the projections for the ... over Thirty years well it you know it won't be Thirty years because they got to build it and they've gotta get retail in there and they've got to start generating some south\nRight but I'm saying what is the time period for that to fall off\nAnd I didn't ask for probably in I don't know now that one I'm gonna have to double check on the enterprise on but I Do know the the um textile ... district as a thirty year\nWhen we come back because what I tried to do is when you hear is kind of really\nInform the public because when you say tax allocation disregard understand it but they don't okay so I was at best your kid will come back I Want to explain what a tax allocation district is and what it does and how does it benefit the city\nI especially gas is a council president Felicia more they were going to talk about legislation for the independent third party audit that didn't pass just\nThe city I especially gas is\nA council president Felicia more then we're going to talk about legislation for the independent third party audit that didn't pass yesterday\nThe renaming a Confederate avenue did the name change or will it stay\nThe same and ... also request installation of cameras in the Fulton County superior court in Fulton County measures to court and the voluntary\nLive stream this is something that that is a ...

places particularly it lacks a technical college because this is located in the south was a lot of what I Would ask that they would go in and\nApprentice or the people that are coming up in there for ... like electricians ha ha ha ha you know other good structures trees would get some people praying in our neighborhood to do some of this work that's going to be happening so that we could benefit all for that I Would also\nAsked for a job training for\nTechnical stuff you know like a computer science things like that I Would ask for job training programs for that but basically I I Will see jobs and abatements for of senior citizens\nI and the one of the question that they get back to the question of if you look inside your own neighborhood now are there some priorities that you won't address not just the deal you know they have job training I people don't need no more training they need the actual job\nNow what would you rather have some more training or have the job itself we got

go\nTo a Libra in Atlanta labor [noise] Valerie\nAll is well man how 'bout for you a measurement alright well world covering\nThings cascade al ... or they don't pay 'em a I got a Fifteen year old daughter learning how to drive about they hit the same locks and nuts I hear when I learned how to drive home more than five\nRight so we started close years and instead of these big June saw walls they put a challenge to roll those just said the color of misty ...\nKelvin to about making two ways all the way to a double Israel to Douglas real law mergers just throw the sa walls that's not that's not doing enough\nYeah but do you get this low drive in front of you you you are in bad shape them\nA year or two but I mean don't they just say the same is that a lot of a sudden are still there oh\nYeah we're talking about thirty some years I got under some\nYears and kiss you stay on the cost of living I Love it so we are getting married to her don't come marching through my neighborhood march over to her she around the corner okay\nWell uh I missed a a council ... they're more ... say there are six or eight page document is that all the the the website\nA we actually put it up about a week ago on our Facebook page if you want it will re posted again but I'm sure you can find it there but if you go to my Facebook page will have Lacey put a ... and put it back up there so you can get it off of a W E okay dot com we'll put it down as well as well as on my Facebook page\nWhat oil the question how how how can they address bill and stop still it\nOr how can they can make a dress that I mean as far as all the council because I really want to believe they all said no but you know they want to get a oh no the party to review the six hundred a ... page document I mean isn't isn't there was a counselor for one\nHour or did they ask for is a independent analysis\nOf the uh cost benefits here\nAnd so I I don't see anything wrong with that having a auditor here's here's what you had to realize how on that city council you have real estate people you have a nurse\nYou have um you know a CPA I think you may have one attorney or you have people who are just regular people right and so to unravel a deal if you really in a search for information and the truth\nI'm you know do they will understand it now I understand development because when I came to city council that was the area that I was most interested in so guess what I did that's where I put all of my uh effort I didn't try to understand all the complexities of\nHow to transportation work are trying to understand all the legal or maneuvering that goes on I wanted to understand how do you turn around neighborhoods\nHow do you do a a tax allocation district how do you do tax increments financing how do you develop a public private partnerships how do you do so that's the area\nThat has been ... years learning and understanding so you can't fly this stuff by me because I understand it\nThe ear you that has been ... years learning and understanding so you can't fly this stuff by me because I understand it and so I didn't get off into somebody's or there's a everyday folks like city council some other very conscientious\nSome are very smart some are very lazy and some of them ain't gonna read six pages other six hundred\nThey just want to know well what do the mayor want me to vote for I mean that's how it works now\nOr in I said any mayor that cannot get eight members of the council that go along with them is a pretty poor may [noise] so I Am not optimistic that this is not going to pass but the art of politics is really negotiation what else do we get off the table\nFor communities or if you cannot outright stop this thing\n[noise] well I got to say this is science for the uh although if you heard the commercial but I mean to sound like a year or self commercial the way they are ... on a green light to go to like ... ah there's a hole in the heart of the city and we can help\nMe with it but I asked\nFor a cold front only shows are saying oh came forty years ago it ruins solve pressing in dire why she called the hole in the ground but then in the ... ... is oh there's a real estate\nI which one is that they are not here for a\n... look here every close I sleep now [laughter] I said you know they just over the road you just stay well man and that's all I've got to do like your brother all we've got to stay well\nThey're hoping that you hear that\nAnd you would I don't know whether you get emotional oh I don't know what they want you to laws he'll hold and in the hot you know that's why I'm asking you know what's going on to your neighbor that need fixing that ain't nobody got around to\nBecause if this is the city's top priority\nYou know we got a city imperil\nFull for a night to to seven zero three four four eight nine to two ... when you look around your neighborhood what do you see the ... that could use some of the one point five
