selling I thank you for joining me Sunday afternoons from four until six we talk all things relationship and today it's all about my sister's feminism hills and sexuality\nAnd how we got to this\nI had the pleasure of being on a cruise stole Jordan's\nShow that she a host on rolling out magazine and after I finished the show is it called a reality check reality check and after I finished the shows she talked about a topic a topic that she thought\nThat would be good for this show in may be a part of it and after she mentioned what it was about feminine I'm helping sexuality and some other stuff in between that I'm like yes let's do the show\nAnd so that's how we got to this day I think her for coming today and first I think you for allowing me to be a part of your show Christian welcome to the show\nAnd why did you feel like it was important for me to know and for women to no end for us to bring the show to a loving relationship\nWell um I I appreciate it the the idea that you actually had great candid conversation and I think some time that's heart where we're in a culture that is so driven towards being politically correct that we don't have like people we can go through just for real conversation and um\nWhen I was taught when I was doing the articles and actually get connected with Dr Lisa I I wanted to talk to some women that were ready to have a real conversation about this\nUm I talk to my girlfriends but these are not people that want to be talking public and as a result we have a culture that women\nThere's so much that we don't talk about in mixed company that we only talk about amongst friends and I just wanted to have one of those conversations on a public platform that other women would benefit from let's roll back a little bit give us a little bit of background about you [noise]\nAh well I think most people probably out of public entertainment publicist here in Atlanta um my company is and chanted public relations and branding\nAnd I've done that for about ten years here but I'm also a writer and a rolling out upscale and some other magazines I write about women's issues I'm female empowerment and all that kind of goes together um so reality check was burst out of\nA month in seats the in the work that I was doing and saying you know you should be having these conversations with women about relationships and you know it's easy for people to look at someone to say they're stupid but\nThere's we've all been there we've all done that and there's there's a science behind it and the only way that other women can benefit is if we speak about it you know what happened in the relationship what what was I thinking if that's how it was my psyche like you know at that time\nSo that was the purpose of reality check and um you were an amazing gas you gave some real real honest in from ... you know a advice to some of the questions that we got an a on relationships with a show\nYou a thank you for having me and thank you again for being here and there you are responsible for this other special guests Dr Lisa of being here so you make the introduction and I'm going to think or after you finish\nWell I'm Dr Lisa underscored the body's natural you are familiar with her on Instagram is absolutely amazing she was a part of a an event that we did earlier this year for female empowerment and has um a great way of being able to\nIs absolutely amazing she was a part of a an event that we did earlier this year for female empowerment and has\nUm a great way of being able to be honest with women she's a plastic surgeon and we expect a lot of plastic surgeons to be over the top but I Love\nDr Lisa because she's so honest and she's so you can tell that she's definitely got her girl power going on but she was able to do it in a professional way and I think that that is refreshing because you can get great information you know from her\nUm there's a lot going on with plastic surgery and there's a lot of things that people don't know\nAnd I think having people like Dr Lisa it'd be a part of these conversations are so important and\nSo I've visited her um 'cause she has a something that she's got to talk about today and we talked about a feminine health in this new a valuable rejuvenation procedure that she does\nAnd I thought that she would be a great a person to come on and talk real talk again because that's how she does it but she also keeps acute and she also realizes that you know as women we have a right to look the way we want to look and and the other we want to feel and she can help all of us get there so it wasn't no further do thank you so much Dr Lisa for joining us [noise]\nVery much for so thank you for having me on the show it's pleasure\nAs always wonderful to talk to people about them in and how and about what I Do in plastic surgery and uh when I practice every day which is just empowering women letting him get to know who they are\nAnd where they want to be and for me it's very important as a plastic surgeon and really as a woman is really help persist find out who they are and empower them ultimately and sold them in and tell us when I talked about that and uh there are lots of issues you know for all of us\nYou know the low our waist line or\nSomething we don't really talk about ... um we develop very early then we're in our childbearing years\nIn Denver Post menopausal before we know it you know that twenty Thirty years those by very very fat mhm and uh now with the advent of people looking at themselves in assessing themselves and trying to be the best they can be\nI'm just thankful that women are turning it on to themselves and deciding that I'd want to feel better when I'm having sex and\nI think ... said it was broke after she had her baby [laughter] you know I'm not you know that old but it doesn't resonate with meat like something is very different after you had to be ... and it was wonderful her for her to see that because it actually puts it out there is an issue\nAnd you know that's why crystal came to visit me that's why they're there are different technology out there\nIt just makes a woman feel better\nAbout the sexual experience you know throughout her whole life and not talk about more details and we'll get into that but thank you for having me it's wonderful that we're talking about that\nOne other lady

eighty W A L K ... for eight Ninety two seven three ... health and sexuality is the conversation today and going into the break you had to cut you had to come in for ...\nYeah I did because she was talking about all these different\nThings that could be happening down there like with the lips and how they looked and I I don't know if I got a cricket live not [laughter] but you know the thing with the women and that our mental pause though in terms of being a mental pause though I knew you were describing I haven't experienced any of that and I hope I never do\nBut uh I don't know that it really ... well I guess for that person if it's a psychological thing that bothers them in that way because at this stage in life if I did discover that one was longer than the other I don't know that I Would do anything about it I wouldn't you know 'cause it's not interfering with my pleasure I guess would be and why we're in\nRight so I don't see people the average age group for someone for and leave your plastic which is the actual surgery\nThe ... and ... and ...\nRight so I don't see people the average age group for someone for and leave your plastic which is the actual surgical procedure ... between the ages of twenty and probably forty five hoping to that I don't see it\n[laughter] I don't care because it's more you know as long as a ... a year now their prey and it's like let's do this and they don't care I don't think that if they saw cricket loves nobody ever told me about it [laughter] you have so\nMuch on even ask that when there's penetration their lips on the inside can actually kind of create you know\nVery painful sex you understand so you know as a young girl this is not normal everybody saying how wonderful that is in your your intent ... yeah so that would make you see someone out or you've had a baby and when you have all of this\nUm promotional stimulation to the whole pelvic floor both live you can get a symmetry an eating this and you can get eaten elongate should have won lip versus the other so now you go back to your husband have expect everything to be a little different and now there's a scene with sexual penetration\nYou look down there sure like something is different ... and women come in they're like okay\nI don't mean to be gross but let me show you and they're pulling on their lips and I'm like oh no it's not gross something change let's fix it leaves it always been a big said we can do non surgical\nTwo or three visit three or four visits non surgical\nAddress these issues were going to you know try to address them immediately and also hit things they may be occurring or if that doesn't work we'll go to surgical we'll talk about surgical options mhm but that's what happens and it is usually\nPainful sex dryness um there's incontinence cough a little bit and you may leak a little bit\nAnd then lastly some people feel that the sensitivity has decreased globally where they are they're orgasms aren't the same\nAnd if that's the case most people\nThink that it were guys making everything else why do I want to work at ... and I'm thirty ...\nWhere are the worst [laughter] so you know there is\nA non invasive a technique is radio frequency ... energy based devices that can be used they provide energy to the outer limits\nIt causes shrinkage because uh you know like I said there's a lot of redundancy so out of lives in the inner lips will get the shrinkage and then you apply the pro where the energy base device to the internal cavity other the China\nOnce that's done that transmits the heat wrapped up in China and then you get the subsequent\nShrinkage and then you get increased lubrication and if you had any incontinence most women who are you know post baby or right after baby have a little cough lasted at least a little and it's embarrassing 'cause they're not used to wearing masks the pad\nEver have already\nAbsolutely first of all I Believe is vitally important for us or\nUnderstand\nOr have some knowledge of the women's anatomy what isn't exposed and explain\nThat the sexual or this is also a location where it comes from the body how riding a the woman's box it does the date and time is I don't believe there's been any other time in history where it should be emphasized as much\nAnd yet also this is an area where the lady comes from the sexuality or\nYou're not eating you know what are you talking about getting on a I'm about to explain briefly come to know\nWhat I'm coming to our science understanding that we give you one example I only steamy have you heard is that\nWhy do you think I only knew me steaming\nWhile his pronunciation tomatoes tomatoes you on a steamy\nUse already that cleans using internally along with these guys are not actors\nAnd I believe that if men young boys and men were educated more on the nomination mad at me they would make which says it's like going into a mall when you go you see all these places that are trying to invite you in today\nThey understand the corners of their ability to like she was saying the educated about it then you can have more\nConversation not based on just the\nPhysical attraction but what's going on in the wall much my and I think a lot of sexually transmitted diseases would not be transmitted because young man out here without knowledge they're going from ... a ball and what they see all social media\nAnd they have not been trying as to how they should understand a woman's anatomy so I Believe also some she elements that out I haven't heard you guys talk about [noise] gotta vitally important in developing good relationships\nUnderstanding the existence and continuation of those relationships and understanding ... men and bring to the table 'cause we have the total package the woman is wanting us to come and be part and be involved in her enterprise if you will but a man is already complete\nRight what does that sound like me get in and said that there's some instruction if necessary because of the fellows don't know that that's what I took from that statement I Know that when I get that but I bet\nHe definitely was clear and saying that men are complete and basically don't meet women and women are ... and and need them but I it's funny they said that because I Know more women that are older\nThat are single and are happy and living very still alive and men that are trying to get a woman a very confused about why they can't get it on to want to be with them at that age so I I think that everybody brings something to the table um but looking at it that way is one of the reasons that we have problems like this you know and\nMy value if we educate our our ... young ladies and educate ladies period\nThen then they'll understand more about themselves Ryan and their needs and desires in once and and and then it's getting in and you all as men's response of men responsibility to educate these men we have to know ourselves for that [laughter] yeah\nI wanted to say something to get in and did you go let these hit that said that the bass themselves to hit that\nAre these mass that you did it surprise and they had herbs and they help 'em cleaned The Vagina but I Want to tell people that everyone has a certain body odor\nSo when it gets a certain level you have to do something\nUm but as far as you hit as steam bath they feel good um but they're more for pleasure but you're still going to have a body odor and there's nothing wrong with that and men are not complete without someone to be with known to say that\nMen have all the equipment you definitely don't have the mental engagement though if you are totally complete I guess it'd be complete with a dog\n[laughter] and men can't give birth yeah you can have a baby with a uterus yeah so the other means besides sex was re cannot [laughter] reverse that right away around so I take issue with the complete thing I think you need a part of that but\nThank you getting in for definitely responding and and listening to our conversation because it's a conversation that we need to have men have to understand that women have sexual desires\nAnd any at all at all ages\n... and um we're talking about you know how we improve our response to sex by um amplification jeeze about application masturbation penetration and um you know the\nThose are our response to sex by um amplification gee spot application masturbation penetration and um you know this discussion today is about\nYou know really looking at things below the waist line and making sure things are happening in the way you want them to happen and you want them to look we want to look because there's also a society now\nSome people are saying that women are getting too much surgery down there ... and the question is where these people were saying that because of the clients are very very satisfied\nAnd what it is it's a cultural shift when there's a cultural shift sometimes people feel that women are being too forward maybe too demanding\nAnd um it can lead to insecurities but we have to remember that men have had the blue pills for some time mhm and we have had nothing mhm so this is the right conversation\nAnd if we take a little longer to get to orgasm you have to be patient they're good relationships that can be built by being patient and it's definitely more fulfilling so a man thinking that he is complete probably not the best way to go into a relationship mhm\nAnd you you know I Want to just chime in on what you said in terms of orgasms because men have to recognize that women\nWe are wired so much differently from them and so it's like you said sex for us starts in the mind it it's mental and so if you are not stimulating a woman's mind it's going to probably be a lot challenging to stimulate her physically mhm and when it comes to orgasms\nA lot of guys have experienced women who are faking orgasms and so they get to a real real woman\nHole there try to connect with and don't understand why it's taking so long and it's because you've had some other experiences where people were being dishonest and they were yelling and screaming and care at all and making you think you would do with them when you were not why is ah masturbation\nA a an important piece a in a set in a woman being a satisfying herself for being satisfied\nBut you have to remember that most of the time we think about masturbation all the pictures and things you see on the Internet things are usually a man mhm very rarely do you see a picture of a woman masturbating\nAnd you have to remember that really being sexual sexually comfortable with yourself in that area is a huge thing for women because they don't look down there to begin with\nUm when you take ... to some people they're like\nWell what's a ... we know the clearest is very important and then there's the G spot if you have a spot or a sensitive area\nThe masturbation will help you had that sexual release\nAnd then you know how you should be right back because if you'd never masturbating you don't really understand how you should feel right so um it's one of those things that you have\nTo decide that you know you have to be comfortable with but if you find that that Texas has not been good for you then you probably need to read up on it [laughter]\nAnd if you can't feel comfortable such an yourself how can you feel comfortable with somebody else to\nRural for eight nine to two seven oh three will be back with more women um health and sexuality and loving relationships a news and talk Thirteen

to get what you want ... which I don't know right\nBut you also see clue I've gone to see clip because I got it all it back but a lot of times I'm telling you when you're when you guys know men men are very very fragile and the situation a lot of times they will turn it around and flip it on you if any even if you're even if they feel like you're not having an orgasm as quickly as they\nFeel like other women have because otherwise have fake then they said oh well if something wrong with you\nKnow what I mean I've never experienced that and and I guess that's a good thing I'd ever

it around and making ... main\nMainly because I smoke dynamic but I guess I can I say something real quick yeah and I think I Know we moved on but tied the other thing is she is probably falling in love with one of those men she got emotions as she's feeling\nGuilty about getting one in both now I don't think that she ... she's incapable like Dr Lisa than\nThere are alpha women who can do it have done and continue to do it but she has called films for one of those guys so it no longer feels good to her to be dealing with the other one that's my take\nOn the last time you have to remember that you know she's handling two men maybe there's something else on the horizon work\nMaybe she didn't dishes maybe her career has developed maybe Phillies and see your doctor leader for the down now to look at me [laughter] you know move on so she dies in something else women are very complex ... back to a very you talk\nAbout I'm seeing clients and uh one of the questions I think as Dr Lisa ask you first was the top three are concerned that the\nOr men or women per se have what are they are usually it's from a man and I'm One of the things that they talk about is not having enough sex the second thing is about the positioning and not having enough diversity in the sexually experienced with their partner and then the third thing is about not\nHaving oral sex and so what I\n... or not having oral sex I'm In the manner that they would like to to be able to have it um something that they may have experience with someone else or something that they probably read and heard about on the Internet that's a possibility and so what I always say to the couples is that if you start\nWith your communication and everybody's talking about what they what it is that they desire\nAnd what they are looking for then you are on the road to a healthy sexual relationship\nBut if it's one person coming to the table with an expectation all my married guy said that they thought that was they said I Do it was going to be unlimited six and I say really that's what you thought the old and was going to provide\nBut that is what they think and so you've got to have those conversations with your mate so that you will know what you are out there communicating your expectations and that person is able to\nThose conversations with your mate though that you will know what you are out there

so I take issue with the complete thing I think you need a ... billion but\nThank you getting for definitely responding and and listening to our conversation because the conversation that we need to have men have to understand that women have sexual desires\nAnd any at all at age\nAnd um we're talking about you know how we improve our response to sex by um applications you about application masturbation penetration and um you know this discussion today is about you know really\nI'm amplification gee spot application masturbation penetration and um you know this discussion today is about you know really looking at things below the waist line and making sure things are\nHappening in the way you want them to happen and you want them to look we want to look because there's also a society now some people are saying that women are getting too much surgery down there ... and the question is where these people were saying that because of clients are very very satisfied\nAnd what it is it's a cultural shift when there's a cultural shift sometimes people feel that women are being too forward maybe too demanding and um it can lead insecurities but we have to remember that men have had the blue pills for some time mhm and we have had nothing mhm\nSo this is the right conversation and if we take a little longer to get to orgasm you have to be patient\nThey're good relationships that can be built by being patient and it's definitely more fulfilling so men thinking that he is complete probably not the best way to go into a relationship mhm\nAnd you you know I Want to just chime in on what you said in terms of orgasms because men have to recognize that women\nWe are why it's so much differently from them and so it's like you said sex for a start in the mind it is mental and so if you are not stimulating a woman's mind it's going to probably be a lot challenging to stimulate her physically mhm and when it comes to orgasms\nA lot of guys have experienced women who are faking orgasms and so they get to a real real woman\nWho they are trying to connect with and don't understand why it's taking so long and it's because you've had some other experiences where people were being dishonest and they were yelling and screaming and care at all and making you think you would do with them when you were not why is\nAh masturbation a a an important piece a in a set in a woman being a satisfying herself for being satisfied\nBut you have to remember that most of the time we think about masturbation all the pictures and things you see on the Internet things are usually a man mhm very rarely do you see a picture of a woman masturbating\nAnd you have to remember that really being sexual sexually comfortable with yourself in that area is a huge thing for women because they don't look down there to begin with um when you say clearance to some\nPeople they're like well what's a little ... we know the quarter is is very important and then there's the G spot if you have a spot or a sensitive area\nThe masturbation will help you had that sexual release and then you know\nHow you should be right back because if you'd never masturbating you don't really understand how you should feel right so um it's one of those things and you have to decide that you know you have to be comfortable with but if you find that that Texas has not been good for you\nThen you probably need

I Believe\nAnd then went out on the part of life anyway I watched it all the girls that I really don't see a lot quite a number of show\nYou the truth the truth\nBut I have to say though here's the thing and here's the thing same K. right and we aggregate\nAll the people who was Fifteen people roughly killed this weekend that sound like a water you\nRank oh here's the thing I really look at that\nPoint about the five police got children but they told her alive\nYou they're forty million of us here now right so at the end of the day we can say that as a certain level of vitriol and hate now uh as as a James Baldwin said\nOr to be black and be in America is to be in a constant state of rage vote of the um while we have the tragic incidents and we don't minimize any of them do I think\nThat there's this uh group waiting to just come over the hill hell if they came over here they wouldn't know where to find out that we saw in ... when they ... they had to kill off all the community and us\nWell let me let me see if I currently live but we don't sell out there are we going to go on I'm going to show\nThat 'cause I think we need to talk to you that you don't look here I don't know a black how that don't have a gun\nWell let me see I don't want to get on the bottom of why we're going to put her in the summer off still going on in life\nYup and I want Charlie Paul bond them because here's the thing where you are trained this why won't\nYou all did not just react I don't care how many AR fifteens you get I can take that twenty to put a straight to your head and you can have ten thousand gun and they will be no consequences to you and so part of what we got to do is take that case in case they were the level\nOf intelligence now they look if you got ten thousand guns at home you can only she won\nAnd or if you got ten thousand gun at home they all locked up in the cabinet you can't even get to it\nAnd so we just not need to be practical now all of those who believe that it has a great race war coming in I don't know we think the white people don't rise up and start doing what shooting everybody at kroger's is you know the black people\nI don't see that happening is impractical really very impractical\nThat'd be the people who want you to believe they gathered nerve gas they let go to just kill all black people um look we're too inextricably bound together with him at least you all if you want to come find young he got come to some of the house to get you\nAnd uh and so what I tell you to do is if you own a forum get training for everybody in the house on how to use the baby that's three should be able to break one down and loaded\nOtherwise don't bring it in your house because nine times out of ten it ain't going to be used with a race war is going to be used\nYour wife uh-huh shoot you you shooting her one of the kids shooting each other nine times out of ten it ain't going to be used for no defensive purposes and if you believe that black people have given their guns away I gotta you gotta be kidding me I don't know see go home\nPeople who do we just don't even we don't believe in ...\nWay I got to ... you gotta be kidding me I don't know see go home with\nPeople who do we just don't even we don't believe in non violence okay I um I Believe in non bought um non violent with those who are non violent with me\nMust be very clear about that but I'm violent as hell with those who are violent with me in fact I don't even believe in proportionality of response\nRight\nYou'd take the chance and run up on me you just get whatever the pause can give you\nYou know\nOr just how it works for\nFor eight nine to two seven zero three but as tragic\nAs these incidents or you know we have to remember South Carolina and uh the church down there were I don't know ten eleven people twelve people die massacre\nYou know\nUh it is as horrific is going to synagogue and targeting an individual but there's some sick people in this

kids so yes we will have lots of candies\nBut in addition to that as you said it we will allow tours for treatment plant so that you often see just what goes on in that process to provide that good
