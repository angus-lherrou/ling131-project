Haitian it got to sit for a minute right and they had to fly going off correct\nWhat the particles fall to the bottom is siphoned off that's correct and then is brought in Haiti all clean it up and everything yeah one more process to go through which is filtration filled trait which is I found a line of defense now then we send it into our clear will\nThey go and so these are when we come up you see these big old tanks and this is this what this is that a clear well what are these ... with ...\nActually I have to water treatment plant our three clear oils are stored underground huh they think

you first come to the city Thirty years ago\nWell when I first came to the city of Atlanta I came through general services or by the mail room\nNow you down never with ms ... hour long ... yeah man you've been around for a minute there is our I'd go back to the ... about Thirty years of his how's how with my neighbor and a son and Gregory and I went to high school together in fact you would do a lot of my sister\nIn St Passover price high school so you didn't and you don't see a lot of single so to talk about your sense because one of the things I tell people a city government is a very if you got into the city hall you guys had a very stable job and you could you can make a career out of it\nMay at Thirty years you on the backside of your career you really could retire if you want it to absolutely but you are listening to good a job to do I love what we're doing a young fellow to look that way that's all right I'll talk about your job here you're respond well let's walk through your history and said you started in wherever mail room you go from the mail room to where we\nAre from the mail room that I came here as an operator training it was a entry level positions are that's why I started a after um a year I became a certified operators while I went from a operated three which is the lowest level of certification up to an operator one and\nNow what you say operator for the purposes of water yes what does that mean that you're observing you're doing what are you doing at\nThose levels are at a water treatment plant it's mandatory that are in order to treat the water you have to be certified generator and these treatment plants they must have for every every hour that the planets and service you have to have a certified as a writer on\nDo you like a mechanic keeping watch over the course of the Andes you're the one that's producing the drinking water for I citizens of it now what'd you now is this stuff has got technologically more sophisticated over thirty Thirty years ago we didn't even have a cell phone they would was unheard of you had one that was\nAbout why does this table then you have to care with two hands but um so how has water change in terms of technology\nWhere one of the technologies for example when I first started here and do your listeners can't see it but you can\nThis is a very large plant it is and in order to know what the status was a of the different piece of equipment don't tell me how to get out and run work at you had to go from a a location to location in order to see verify that this equipment was operated right visualize what the quality of the water was\nAnd we had to do this on an hourly basis in order to know what I was exactly\nAnd whether it was a nice day like it\nAt all to do more now reign of knowing you got to get out and they had to be here who in fact well I bet you tell the young fellow who come through here now a bar let me sit down to tell you as\nYou know when I got here I had to walk you know how your mom and if you add about Seventy five miles to go to school yeah I've got an easier\nWith you on the cars today that could just sit behind a desk and ... and controls the entire treatment plant\nYou either well Seventy five miles to go to school I got an easier\nIt is only the cars today that can just sit behind a desk or ... or ... or controls entire treatment plant a what keeps you coming back to this job every day uh one uh is uh when I began to doing it I learned you know exactly how important that it was the job that we do\nA and the cities that were yeah I Love the city down the greatest cities in the nation well and to be able to provide water to the citizens of Atlanta\nFor us to be able to contribute to Hartsfield airport which is the busiest airport in the world and know that we have a part of that things of this nature is what keeps me coming here but most importantly it's the people you see people around so not just the staff right citizens that are coming out\nWe are here we are able to have a safe space for the citizens of Atlanta to come to the give them my education then give them as you say a little entertainment stuff like this is my heart\nI'm a I T E and love for each other again the preacher he gets the for the gospel of water ah but you're absolutely right it's amazing\nEven as I sit here it it's still amazing that from this plant world will flow all the way from Sand Springs to down to the new he's pointing own beyond that to the to the uh what one point three million water custom\nOn the point two million children we serve each and every day I Know people a doctor and his entire career will not see that many ... have as many people that I have in a day their lives and they're saying\nI Will take you out to eat with ... percent graduation Thirty years and\nAh yeah they get excited they they get excited about the water might become idea maybe as I stopped working for the W A L K I come back to the water department you know I got an openness\nYou got to open it and we got plenty for you but if nothing else be sure drinks out\nThere you go deliver dragged out but absolutely uh I Do it every day I Do my sister makes you do that every day I just got\nGreat quality water I go all over the world and or you can drink a lot of war\nHey are you oh well we got the mole oh who come on over here we got cats moment come I don't know if your cat ... yards they come on over here now let me\nA company a goose in ... and ... do you run it from your parole officer was [noise] okay huh your parole loving loving\nYou use your uh unassuming name you can just be the\nOkay we got some grown or you know what folks how they got a ... is that black pants or just the black panther I don't know and then they got some nice uniforms and they are out here and ah they walk into children through the uh water treatment plant and I didn't know that is what they were headed all of that and then\nOkay we got football players and a green goblins and are they taking a tour of the plant\nAnd when we are not in the schools were in the humidity at various festivals where we are again relaying information about how to conserve water somewhere out money to live\nMy water bill is high and so what we like to do I'm an exchange of information and let them do the things that they can do at home to keep their water bill lower it'd be better stewards of our water so we just pretty much provide education for a public\nAnd I know that works because I I ... partner with us when we do a real ... real women read and they come out to the school\nI Am amazed to be honest with you that I was young people know a lot about water conservation water barrels and stuff that we didn't even get when we were in a a school about same rain barrels and all of that kind of dumb how to conserve water turn to ward off when you're brushing your teeth and all of this other stuff that\nA is a part of education 'cause if you David then you have you known your bill that tried\nTo what we're finding out if we start to teach them when they're young mhm they inevitably take that message home and so while we may not have been the best stores of that report them water and the ones that we are educating and bring it up now they will certainly be better stewards of that water because they are learning those things\nIn the middle you know we teach them on the other side really about fall then they'll be plugged in all of that the ... baby wipes down the toilet and all of that those a lot to educate the public on\nThere's a lot of we have to protect our system when you go home and you turn on that trap yeah we want want them to flow and you want it to be good quality water because there are a number of things that you mentioned not flushing the white down the pipe they are disposable they are not electable I we do not want to do that\nIt'd be a good quality water so there are a number of things as you mentioned not flushing the whites down the pipe they are disposable they are not flush of all\nWe do not want to do the things that our grandmothers and mothers did particularly at this time of year when we start to find the turkeys and cooking that hand yeah those dinners we do not want to turn on the hot water for that grief yeah down the drain because that clocks the drain and then you're never going to have a chronic problem and the medications and those things that you no longer take\nUm we do want you to the photos of them properly throw them in the trash slip them that the tide them up to take them to a pharmacy they will take those back but do not flush those things that we're\nTold and well I did that because I had never wanted to do the the war to get drunk in everything you've whatever you\nPut in there taking the same medical new planning medicine that were taken and it requires a just\nA level higher level of treatment treatment get that out of our water I never\nThought about that until recently when it became a real push don't put Joe ...\nWell all of that others don't vote for Gore said mouths all live in the water or you see we don't we don't want to drop off oh you'll you know you shouldn't be finishing on occasion that the doctor\nSays well they have some left over now I Do not want to say that hydrocodone I couldn't handle domoic acid laid up for it is just deals didn't get that but thank you uh the word informing us\nOf you know about what we need to be on the lookout for um a Taco Bell talk a little bit about this event this is a opportunity you know what else are you going to see children marching around the plant\nIn costumes learning about what this facility is all about by the dozens\nAbsolutely and one of those things that we do pride ourselves in providing those alternative ways of learning and not those traditional methods that may not be as exciting are more easy to capture so this is an absolute find funny that um that we do provide 'em that the adults and children as you say in your heart\nYeah 'cause you don't believe that don't have a lot more fun than [laughter] come out and\nBe able to um get some candy and have some fun and and this was at that we have our partners out because we can't do this alone\nOn their education for our community at all levels and so we partner with the Atlanta fire rescue
