Adrian is in the building and we're talking about the trauma and after effect\nOf sexual harassment we also watching the last Fifteen fourteen Thirteen seconds of the falcons game and we're up thirty six thirty\nOne and I believe it might be old burglar or yeah it might\nBe because they were running on fourth down\nLet's see let us he hopes the less so we need this way and we need this when but Dr Adrian I tell you you know if you turn on anybody's TV if you you know look on any digital platform including W A L caves envy what oh threes\nYou'll see some form of sexual harassment being talked about\nYes and you know I think that with social media and just the media in general are providing us with so much information these days\nYou know I often question is it really that we have more harassment going on or is it just that we have a platform where we see it more\nAnd so I think it's just that we are able to see it more I think it has always existed and when you look at some of the statistics concerning sexual abuse and the actual harassment they're pretty alarming and um have always been pretty mhm just didn't have the same outlet to talk about it\nRight right right I think I think that I think when when we talk about social media and we talked about the Internet\nI think that has been just like you said the vehicle in which a word can get out right whereas there have been times in which things have happened but because we don't have we didn't have that vehicle other than you know thirty five years of radio or or TV or things like that\nThen you didn't you couldn't you didn't get the information right now the information is available to you so in light of the bill Cosby's sentencing and what he is convicted for\nHow can we overcome some tragic circumstances such as rape sexual ... how a sexual assault and mobile station in order to bill healthy relationships again with our mates without partners in significant others\nSo I Want to start by just kind of talking about some of the statistics that are out here so that I can provide some kind of sick of 'em and started with this\nYou know there's so I Want to start by just kind of talking about some of the statistics that are out here so that I can provide some context of 'em and started with defining sexual abuse\nBecause sexual abuses any form of sexual violence that includes rape child molestation incest and simulate forms of any type of non essential non consensual sexual contact\nSo Ninety percent of all rapes are committed against women one in six women in America have experienced rate one in five girls and one and twenty boys experience childhood\nSexual abuse forty four percent of sexual assault victims are under age Eighteen and of those twenty percent\nAre abused before age eight while those are some alarming statistics scary\nBecause I think about that group of women yesterday in that room and so we were to count all never six person in that room has probably experienced some form of sexual assault sexual abuse\nAnd you know a lot of times it's because it's not talked about and even with the me too movement the me too movement actually started in two thousand and six ... but it has gotten a lot of a lot more\nPublicity because of the things that are going on with people who have such a higher stature mhm and that that is the reason now we're starting to hear more about me me too but it's been around for very long time over ten years\nYeah yeah I remember when um the young lady uh talked about in in in um\nYou know she didn't get the response like she should have gotten ... or because she didn't have a a a ... a ... caliber of life right that you know could have pushed it to the levels in which it is now right and and so now I go back to the question that I\nAsked then knowing that six of those ladies you said that we're in the room with us\nYesterday morning could have possibly been affected by rape sexual assault molestation or any any of those then how do they any anyone else even build healthy relationships from that\nAnd here's the thing joy you know when you start talking about trauma that has occurred in childhood and especially with regards to some sort of sexual abuse trauma you have to have a support system because most people will not come forward\nAnd they don't come forward for a variety of reasons a lot of times is because there's a fear of some form of reprimand\nAnd one of the ... most glaring reasons is because if the the person that has created the offense is known by the victim a lotta times they will not calling for because they don't want to see that person get in trouble\nThey don't want that person to be hurt by some sort of criminal charges being brought against them because a lot of times when the offenses a car\nIt's by people that the victim no and so that makes it even more difficult but there has to be a level of healing that needs to take place and of course I'm a proponent for therapy and I'm always going to say\nYou know you got to go and talk to somebody outside of your family because it takes a lot to process through somebody hurting you in that way [noise] Mm yeah\nMm you you you you talked about um a person not wanting to come\nSomebody hurting you in that way [noise] Mm yeah Mm\nYou you you you talked about um a person not wanting to come forward ... ... and not wanting to talk of person not wanting\nTo say I've been harassed I've been raped I'm been whatever that that trauma or has been to them then you know from your perspective what could you say because it could be some people that are listening right now\nYou know and here's the thing a lot of times what people don't realize even with Dr Ford who had to testify\nAgainst a missed a cabin though when you have to recount that story it is almost as if you are being pushed right back into that place and that a lotta time\nDiscourages a lot of people from coming forward because it's hard enough that you had to deal with it but now you've got to be put in a position where you've got to explain it to someone else\nAnd a lot of times people are accusing you are being dishonest not telling the truth and especially when you're on a public spotlight but even when you're not\nIt's still a shame that goes along with that and it's the question of\nDid I Do something to calls this a fence towards me\nAnd so people don't have the support that they need that makes them feel comfortable to say you were the victim right who didn't do anything wrong or I have nothing to do with how you address right where you will walk in who you know who you don't have nothing to do with that nobody fines up to be abused to to receive any form of you know what when\nAnd I support her really came about with us I'm really focusing on how do we connect women visits to women business and\nSo then we started talking about what other ways do we support each other and\nWe wanted to be specific social support is an acronym and I'm so F is for how do you show up for her you as for how do you do night and collaborate with her ... how do you pay it forward to her\nThe other pie is how do you put your money where your mouth is for her because we all say oh I'll support you you got a business don't about everybody in front of it but also for a Jew\nI'm old is for how do you open doors for her art is for how do you reveal your resources to her and tea how do you train and mental her wow big round of applause then and then a forward then all the women around the table then why is it still hard for women\nTo be supportive and why is that still hard from from from your opinion\nWho ever want to start back in ... I\nI think it has a lot to do with the fact that we have adopted a competitive spirit Mm I'm not\nUnderstanding what it means to be in the same room with um different individuals and appreciate the difference and uplifting one yeah\nSo we automatically began to say oh well we have to one up another individual or feel like that they have to you know some past someone versus understand the fact that if my sister said the right of me is doing great there were all doing great mhm\nMhm mhm anyone else wanted hardly agree with our first lady uh I think I just always have grown up with a supporting you know just the support him on his spirit and I am all about supporting a black women\nAnd just like business as an independent all businesses but because I think is very very important for us and again it is about the competitiveness and um\nI feel that we're moving forward towards moving away from that ... I'm sending more and more I think with all the empowerment industries and and and the ministries and the different jazz or groups and for the platforms that people have now I'm seeing that we're moving from that anyone else\nI just want to throw in a went Becky described are and and told us what the acronym is I mean that's powerful right and I made me you know I kind of worship Becky a little bit\nOf marble aspect [laughter] bad manners and [laughter] but\nYou know what I realize is that we need each other and we knew we maybe we're coming in to that realization I think that's what works so well with us here in around the table\nIs areas like fast relationship there's no competition there is a genuine desire to lift each other up and to help and support and tangible ways not just by our our words but um\nI think we're getting there it's slow it's slow because we his\nAnd to help and support and tangible ways not just by our our words but um I think we're getting there it's slow it's slow because we historically have been in competition with one another no matter what your field is no matter what uh\nThe the the the feel of expertise you may have is is that I got to pull you back so I can lift the myself up\nHigher and so I'm thanking God for the revelation that we are one we are women here supporting one another so it's a pleasure to be a part of a such a powerful group of women\nYou know just one of the things that we we had a conversation when we were taping the the commercial for I support her and we started to have a conversation and\nThere's a couple of things I realized that came out 'cause I asked that question why why do you think women don't support each other whether the struggles and several of the women that were there said they're big\nA issue with supporting women it stemmed from their relationships with their mothers Mm and that was like OK so tell me more and it was really about a a a bad relationship\nThat made them kind of push away from from a supporting other women and that just continue to manifest itself during their life because one of the things that probably hurt my feeling is the most is when I hear\nOther women say I don't do women I mean I I Do I mean that just hurts my feelings and and any Yvonne ... ... has said it perfectly does something in you know that you're not supporting as another woman but that was one of the things that came out of that conversation of women supporting other women\nBad relationships with their mothers in their family and one lady shared\nFrom a mental health standpoint um she couldn't support any one woman man anything so she just steered away from from everything and it took her going and getting some help and other women loving on her for her to really finally put our guard down yeah I Know I I had a recent situation\nUm that um someone spoke a about um\nTreatment and how they were being treated and they made it public you know they made it they put it on social media and I was like so what are you what are you looking for when you put it out there publicly what are you looking for\nAnd I hope that you receive did yeah because it could have been something that could have just been\nPersonally discussed yet and so so so my question is and when we come back and I want people who are listening we are live now we are live for for eight nine to two seven oh three when you do not see\nAnd want to support and you put bad Vides out there what do you think people are looking for ... ... women particular learn the what are you looking\nFor because we're a bunch of says scores up here and we need to help the whole purpose of assistance getting together is to be of support and to be of help and we have to speak our truth ... and we have to be transparent and things and and when I saw this on Facebook\nAnd it was it was pretty much directed towards me I did not respond to it and I have not responded personally\nBecause I Hope that she got what she got and and and you got what you got but I Know at some point it has to be a conversation because we are we had been too close for it to cause a relationship to be\n... and so I you know I just want to throw that out there and the other thing is that I Want us to talk about is fulfillment and purpose\nMhm what does fulfillment and purpose means\nUs to talk about is for field minute

number\nWe are in this business\nJust me personally to have a relationship because I Know\nUm how small of a number we are in this business and especially the young ones that are coming up is a responsibility of of someone who's just celebrate it thirty five years\nTo grab 'em and send them to what you're about to go through and here's some things are going to have to deal with and here's some things that will help you uh I'm a chick matriculate through the the career\nSo from from a from a boss thinks standpoint I've been I've been good at me with a I honored uh Jean Ross and my uh women's empowerment brunch who is my boss on this side\nA ... of the radio because I see what she deals with I Know what she deals with and she's able to conquer that and so I as a as a person who\nUm have to call on her like few minutes ago when I said I Am caught up in all of this traffic and I had to do a a um a best of two started the show\nThen then you know I just haven't I haven't\nWitnessed it I don't know for you who played the corporate world have witness it I just haven't witnessed it because of the small volume of women that I've had to work with from a power structure state I'm not\nI'm not just represent powers of power the exercise of the boss or manager a supervisor I've seen it when it was a matter of having the uh the deciding vote in your last one to vote on the matter and if it comes out to another woman versus another\nAnd I hope that doesn't happen on November six [laughter] in a in a in a way that we see you know history can be made and have the power to help make that happen you know it it it because the deciding vote will\nCome from us mhm I think both I mean I've seen you know women used their power not for good but I've also been fortunate enough to see women used their power to open doors for other women and I've been truly blessed even through corporate America to have\nSome amazing women open the door for me to get to the next level and the next level and you know one of my boss told me and she was she was a white woman and she pulled me aside and she said ... you have you have what it takes as she said uh I'm it's not going to be easy she says not going to be easy as a woman and she said is not going to be easy as a black woman she said I'm a white woman\nAnd I know how this this world works and I know there's some things you are going to have to deal with it I'm not going to have to deal with\nSo here's some things I Want you to do and she just I mean and everything she said I was like thank God and I was on I was on top of what she said because she was paving away to open a door for someone not based on color but based on a skill that I had that she\nUm that she saw so I I think you've got good and bad on both sides of the table people who will take the power and run with it uh negatively and those that will use their power for good to really be able to help and support and pull another woman up with them mhm from a person\nA Delores who is the president of an organization that isn't out there to do for women period to the best of their abilities\nThen what do you see from your standpoint uh when it comes to the struggles or the communication between women in ... in hopes of empowering or you know having some type of a issue with\nI think uh we're definitely try to be out in the community and we try to Randolph sales which we try to be out there and people understand who we are I think a lot of times and and there's some negative things out there that you'd be surprised\nIn our cells which we try to be out there and people understand who we are I think a lot of times and and there's some negative things out there that you'd be surprised though there are people who feel that we're not inclusive a\nAnd which is not true uh\nAnd so I think they have to be educated learn about the people who you are around are you trying to associate with a B on your circle so see if women are trying to be a part of an organization like our organization I find that they don't go and research\nYou know try to learn about the organization but they want to come you know meeting Greece try to get in and then I'll find that when they do\nGet and then there's all these issues that you didn't read it because they're not reading than not understanding they don't research and then not listening ... and ... and those a lot of issues that I have that I buy in and out\nIt's just a lot of misconceptions out there about women organizations and were definite just about empowering women mhm and I think they miss understand our organization and we're about advocacy\nWork we're not a social club and that's a big misconceptions and they come in making we just going to a party and get dressed up events on when we were you know we work in areas of education probably deposit and an empowerment of when ...\nWhen I Want to get to what does it mean to be equally yoked ladies\n... ... ... ... so that if they are not equally yoked well it's hard to survive it\n[laughter] [laughter] but I mean come on and so I can only imagine\nThe wild that if you're not equally yoked which are going through what it is that you have to face because you know what God\nThings are possible and you can stand on his word and you can stand on his promises for your marriage for your family and stuff you have one person is all God and one is not that that's a struggle you know or you have one person that has a totally different a perception of what\nThe um the husband and wife relationship is supposed to look like you know that that that trouble you know and so those are the things that use the pasta kind of find out beforehand and if we're not walking on that same\nIf we're not equally yoked and it's a definite sign that we should not be doing this and so those of you that are in relationships and you know um that you're on equally yoked now my prayers go out to you know they really do\nCould cause we need them when we an equally yoked my first thought we were on equal [laughter]\nEqually and I needed a whole lot of praise we're walking down to ... you just said if you need to know that going into\nYou know the signs were there but I ignored the size and uh because I wanted what what I Want it but the signs was there when we got married I really saw all the size but I still kept trying to uh okay we're going to make this make this work I mean if I got up to go to church with like what are you going to try it well\nI don't know why you do at and for the first two to three years of my marriage didn't go to church\nBecause\nHe he landed asked me if I guess I laid out and sleep and it and and I I was in college by myself didn't have to risk with bonds and nobody but I got to the church because that was just me but I get in this relationship with this man and all of that stops because okay let me just kind of calm let me just and I\nBut if you feel you're ready then don't wait on anybody to to protect you I said you got it I said that's the last time we'll talk she's thirty four I've never done it again\n[laughter] you got young ones yes eight and eleven and so I'm recently a family friend of ours um you know that in a one of my ... um got pregnant mhm and she's not married\nAnd so um I wanted to um tell them because my children are very vocal and so I Want\nTo have a pre conversation because I knew that I Would see her on [laughter]\nAnd I said well I won't let tell you that so and so is um is pregnant and so um I\nThought it was oh my God you know and\nAnd I was like well um and so my son\nUm tags and he's just so interesting that he's hey it was like she never had a birth\nControl [laughter]\nIt's hard to him I said you know he's eight\nAnd he says yes mommy everybody knows about birth control and I was like oh my God\nIt's hard to him I said you know he's eight\nAnd he says yes mommy everybody knows about birth control and I was like oh my God\nOh I I had missed the conversation here my my son knows about birth control and then so then my daughter says I mean you know why didn't she use protection and so I said\nShe didn't know about protection [laughter] and so we're talking about an eight year old in our lab and euro and so there are having these conversations at school and so we haven't had this conversation at home and I'm like oh my gosh I Want to know how much they notice I\nForget them separate and southern jackets and we've been waiting for you um for the longest you just tell us what babies came from you know\nThey've been waiting to have the company but you're eight mhm right and you write in Lebanon mhm so I I think ... I think Todd said it when they started asking questions about you know where they came from that is a good time to start developing for conversation 'cause we've been saying\nWhere they come from you know that God brings and you know I've just been very creative with that but these kids know a whole lot and so\nThey now access they had asked no matter how much you try to put the code on anything that ... that is at eight and he led because if they can't get to at some of their friends came in there and and so they learn a lot\nOf what they think they know and so I I'm a firm believer that you got to go in early\nYou do [laughter] hey I was and they know that\nTheir parents have it to you know so there is you know some odd because we had well um do you oh that's so funny you and dad have sex\nAnd so my daughter times they yes they they did it on the anniversary\n[laughter]\nI have a I had to nip it in the ... [laughter] I don't know why not [laughter] that was that was that was just aid for us that questioning you know but it just\nLet me know like how much do you think is going over\nTheir head it is now mind you and I will not is not going over there yeah\nThere was this and I had a parent want a teacher actually and I had our son and my class and he went home one day it was five years old wants to know about sex babies I'll never forget it she came and she told me they she and her husband sat him down had that weight talk and everything and\nThen he says and she says babies\nCome from this and we had sex in and out of that game our three children you're one of them and he said\nGood thing you only did it three\nTimes [laughter]\n\n[laughter] no I have a conversation\nEarly I'd I'd I did because because of the conversation that they have\nWith you and let's see if you put it in a in a position to where they know that they can come to you for anything and that's to this day that twenty two year steel comes with everything ... because he knows that he can you still going to be a parent and you're going to answer according to\nBut I'm thankful that he knows that he can come and so you're not okay rarely and I came back [laughter] let's let me share this [laughter] so I think I think when they're ready\nTo to to be able to understand it you gotta you gotta have the conversation your kids\nA man [laughter] lord they said they will wait and maybe the way we get from your experience\nBecause all of your experience ladies in here from George\nWhy we had my way from your experience\nBecause all of your experience ladies in here from your experience what do you think men is getting Rome when it comes to understanding a woman\nNo be quiet now just go deep bond\nRelationships all of them do not [laughter]\nNot [laughter] they just want to be equal but I I don't know how you\nFeel you up here I'm Down here I I just want to be equal ... I feel I bring this much the table and you know I I I don't think it's it's about a a salary or anything like that but I I just think I just want to feel ... ... well that men men tend to feel that\nAnd I think that's the old school from back in the day you know how men fell about ... ... you know that women stay home and I know that's how I was uh my my dad were my mother stayed home\nAnd lord knows I I Would just so grateful when are you that that [laughter] you know she didn't understand it at the time but you know we got older and we look back on it\nI used to tell her when doing it for illness that it was the best thing sometimes you don't know\nWhy God does what he does but he had a plan but it was the best thing because my father was the type of person he didn't want her to grow he didn't want her to do anything as a woman and the one that was my grand over my mother learned to drive and when the war she got educated run around the house\nYou know those things that he was keeping are there no my thing is uh I don't want to say I'm an independent ...

photographic artists in two thousand and third chain um Trayvon Martin happen well two thousand and twelve\nAnd when George Zimmerman was not held accountable and two thousand and Thirteen for the murder of Trayvon I decided as an artist to go to the ground because I wanted to tell our stories from our perspective\nHas far too long we have been looking through the lens of the white male in there too\nAnd I felt that it was important to bring in\nTheir elders that were unknown that were members of the civil rights movement like Loni king Dr Ross them poke and others and intergenerational lives them with the young people today [noise] um\nYou been to Philadelphia bathroom ruse Atlanta Detroit\nFerguson where was the most interesting place what was the most of his time or did you

that Sunday when Freddie Gray past and that Monday I went into west Baltimore and I've been to Detroit I've been to Chicago But West Baltimore I felt like I was in a third world country\nI mean I was looking at the landscape and it just caught me off guard and I don't know why and I immediately started photographing the landscape\nAnd there were some people around and they told me to get out\nAnd said they didn't want me here why people here are the media because the only time when you come into these communities when we're talking about is an additive right\nSo you know you had to think fast on your feet and I'm kind of like a little girl sometimes and I said well\nI'm from the home of the civil rights movement and I want to tell our story they looked me up and up and down ... and they said yes and then a woman came up to me she said I'm gonna tell you the truth she said\nI just got out of jail and I don't have any money do you have any money I looked at it and I said ma'am I don't have any money I can give you a hug don't know why I said it and we don't we try\nAnd so I felt that it was important for me as an artist to tell the stories because I had different experience in different areas in Ferguson\nWhen I went to the aftermath and I was on the ground you could just feel that tension in the air it was like a\nBubbling ... are are around I mean I'm the people were telling me about how the police stations and the people in the community all work together and how they would give them tickets and it will pal up on ...\nAnd they can and then they go to jail though it was in ... it's like a perpetual revolution constant never ending\nAnd see as a a photo journalist you were able to really get the real story well I don't consider myself as a little well I mean yeah we'll we'll take the journalist target for\nBecause most people still don't understand what burgers and was about right and they think it was just about Mike Brown but when you had all white police department right in a black town not one black officer or for the most part I think they had one\nUm but every body of that town had just hundreds some thousands of dollars worth of kids that they will basically being used as used to read a you know as a way to control the population\nAnd extract money from them like it was some kind of\nCrazy system um you know so that was ... we learned
