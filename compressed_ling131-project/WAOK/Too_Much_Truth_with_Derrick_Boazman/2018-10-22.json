today that can identify with women\nTaking it upon themselves to throw caution to the wind even though you know the man wants protection and you don't do it because you either want a paycheck or if you're like me you just want to baby ... you're not thinking of the ramifications of now it's just me and my child\nMost of my friends are in their fifties they don't even I lost a lot of friends from that because they're like a baby have you lost our kids are in college the same thing the the my child's father said were the old we can't do this so now I Can't hang out with you because I don't I don't I'm not into diaper phase I Want to hear your kid screaming or no I had a girlfriend tell me on fortieth\nBirthday you can't do the probably so can I ask this than when the child came yes and uh did you have any problems or issues in the father and the child yeah having a connection\nAbsolutely I'm the father moved out immediately I'm I was sickly he moved down the street maybe two or three blocks from me but he never came over and never visited never called\nDidn't do anything until about I'll say he showed up for Christmases so he was good for the finances we both went to child support immediately he got his child support so he pays that and then but then he was just never around and only until recently very recently in the last\nI Want to say the last two years they've developed a relationship where they interact with each other\nSo when the child was getting out of kindergarten he came around grandma came around you know and then now that the child is seven and able to speak up for himself a little bit more he's interacting but it wasn't until two weeks ago\nThat the my uh my\nChild's father came to me and he said I keep hearing you recount the story of being a single mom you send us really ticks me off because you're not a single mom I pay child support I'm here every now and again and I said to him well the problem is you've never been here with regularity we have never schedule to visit for seven years and if you don't schedule a visit that means\nThe burden is on me twenty four seven as to how to care for the shouting I'm willing to take that burden because again I made a shady move I'm having a baby and secretly doing that\nBehind my partner's backwards lady's let's just stop doing that but she stopped doing it but then just recently this last week he sees\nOh okay well if I don't have a regular arranged schedule that means me and the child don't really get to know each other with any regularity and there is no real foundation 'cause in his mind as long as he paid child support for him around once a month him in the chow has relationship\nOvertime ... um you know just because your your your money is nearly every day if you're emotional friends isn't there every day the you're you're not you're missing\nAll the time um you know just because your your your money is nearly every day you emotional friends you you know you miss All right let's talk to a Romeo spinning hey Ronnie a lot and\nI are doing good any day\nI wanted to tell you I came home and my baby mama looked at me and she said my daughter\nYou know diapers ain't got no diapers or say well I'm a go try to sail for him and me and my mother told me I couldn't say I am a name on their property\nSo what I did I took the choice and I went to ... and I stood in front of the target and not at all white people going into target I sent my daughter need diapers and one man told me come on it took me back then he bought me two types of diapers and I went back home and my family was very very very happy\nI had to make the decision to get the diapers for my family [noise]\nBut you write on regime was upset she was highly ... room at but ah I made a happier when I brought those titles but\nBut what I Want to try to tell you uh if you don't have something you're gonna have to go out in public and ask for it because if you try to make money on his way in a strange now\nThey will block you from making that money because they brought me for selling my ... so you just have to ask people to go out to ensure labels for what you eat and what you know if they had they gave it to you they don't they want\nOne time me and my kids went out of food I Would ask my neighbor died it though they gave me a little bit for the last three months\nAnd I was ... you know what I did the the the beauty of what Romeo is saying is the lynching when he he would take legally to help some ... his children and you know and and and that's the the the beauty of it a time\nThey'll Joyce Missy fill me\nOkay I saw I didn't see the entire video but it appears to me on the portion that I saw she was attempting to show that she could drowned her kid but I didn't get the impression that she she really trying to drown he\nKnew he wasn't a matter that he was just really doesn't matter [laughter] actually\nActually does matter it's bad enough is bad enough that she we've a traumatized and five year old kid like that five months\nFive ... yes if five year five month old kid like that but the the the actual facts of the matter show a little bit a little bit different says what was really going on it and how much control self control she actually did have but then separate from that\nI'm I'm finding the ... I Want I Want to make a request for future broadcast Joyce but in in reference to what we're talking about right now\nWhen I'm finding is what a lot of people the two of you included a reference and is being lunacy are crazy is really just as a saint conscious act of evil\nAnd we have a we have an honest conversation avoiding pontificate\nAbout what the economic costs to say in a council war there actually is considered an economic middle class in metro Atlanta it's focused on that okay then you take in consideration what it takes to get somebody from zero to the adult age of twenty two because you're a pair for the whole entire part of your life\nThen it gives you a little bit more insight of what what the actual much much physical quarter the physical quarter cost is\nThen on the ideal circumstances because things go wrong sometimes then if you take in consideration the time and energy not just the money then you start thinking about the you start talking about things like okay what type of a recreational programs what type of\nAcademic setting that you want to be in to what degree do you need to be involved in understanding the teachers of the school that your child is as well as the ministry of staff\nAs well as the other um adults who provides of the organizations that they're involved in\nThey start talking about things such as planting a planning a structure for this person to move into adulthood where you could just lift your hands from them for the most part and move forward\nAnd it wouldn't just be talking about money it will be talking about time energy and forward thinking and we deal with\nThe information hand it's invalid you would not what you want to hear that much and\nHe said what would you do with the information what would you do with information\nYou will you put it in front of people who have interests at some point in life and becoming parents and give them some better insight detailed conversation some better insight or what is actually going to take them to get to zero which means before the child is even conceive\nUp to the age of twenty two where they want to at least get that child into where they can move independently on your own death which you would that's what they would do with the information is good\nAnd the reason why I say accounts for war because you want to isolate it so if you want to isolate into a very small area\nIt there for ... is good and and the reason why they account for war because you want to isolate it from one isolated to a very small area and you don't want a whole bunch of folks coming in given unnecessary paying separate from what the actual to folks is our economic and social structure\nRight can I just folks will structure their grant snow because there are grants that actually a deal with accidents or an ... an accident in in in those courses\nUm you are you deal with the financial cost of ... or ... or as raising a child and I know that because I used to work for a nonprofit um who who did that who who's sort of goal was to do that so there is information out there but what I what I learned even in in teaching those courses the children is that\nIf they don't think that you are a human when you're teaching your ... if if you're looking at it they don't I didn't write it in there as you know as an authority but you don't have any humidity this ... this this sort of\nIn the car with you are not going to look at is no different from knowing how much it costs to to stick to keep a car\nOr maintain over the course of his life what do you do with their does that make you a better drivers make us safer driver to the ... like what what do you do is we have to ... in my opinion you know it it goes a little bit deeper then finding out the coast time in a gentleman ... I don't know how you measure that\nBut then we end measurable right we we have to get to the core of this thing one thing I wanted to say before we before we we closed the worst thing that ever happened\nTo us artistically was the song that's just my baby daddy\nThey've harm because because that's just my\nThat'd be little hit it it minimizes the most important job you'll likely ever have in your life and when we got to the point where we were saying that's just my baby daddy baby mama\nThan we thought we could do everything else but be a good dad would be a good mom wouldn't be a good team ... so we have to really on we had to deconstruct that and figure out what is what is leading us to to to say things like that's just my ... that's just the person that's going to carry my legacy and it's going to me and my my little you\nKnow other community feels that way or or responds to parenting in that way and also no other community kicks kids out at Eighteen other communities understand if you're female you're in a home with your family to you Mary ... and if you've never marry your your your family's gonna still\nCarry that that way of helping you provide re with you with that that's just my baby's daddy if I'm Around a lot of people in other cultures and this is why they look down on African Americans so much because of our parenting styles are lack of respect for marriage or lack of respect for community you know even the brother who talked about selling them in them\nYou know on one hand people congestion but on the other hand this man is willing to put one on his frailties out there are you a judge him and that's exactly what we're saying the mob who'd dumped her baby she should have put her frailties out there and said hey look\nI Can't get a job I have other mental issues going on I Can't find a house keeper house for the baby somebody needs to take my kids and moms out there\nPlease please please start sending your children to your father to their fathers who are willing able and happy to care for their child that's another conversation we need to have the wire women holding on to kids when their dad should be especially if you've got a black male child mhm and you have a a willing father\nSo once you once you say then Missy that\nUh she should have made the phone call and said hey I can not handle this any more that's right we need that need when I'm On I'm going to send send this five months older this five year old ... eroded as nine year old to you\nLast because if my if the mothers of my sons are children were to call my son and say I can't take care of the baby we take it I can guarantee you even though my son is not necessarily he's an artist\nUh my son ah children what to call my son and say\nI Can't take care of the baby we take it I can guarantee you even though my son is not necessarily he's an artist and he doesn't work at nine to five he will call me called his sister and say hey look we got baby and trust me I Will be over there a hop skip and a junk because I Love my blood line\nAnd I I knew that my grandmother raped me very well to know that your grandchildren your star seats are really that should jewels in your crown so I'm not going to let any of my grandchildren be out there a year\nSo we under estimate the power of the paternal lineage and we have to stop doing that were the only culture that does they were taken a beating for a black man are suffering and really we need to think that\nLike us on Facebook and loving relationship show leaves your questions and comments have loving relationships with ...

had to go out and buy those services if they went out I don't know how to do that\nAnd so what we have to do is cast down our book as well we spoke at the Washington say\nYeah I learned as much as we can apply what skills we have\nFilled them in the marketplace take care of our family our people in our own and then that what politics that have to rule then lead to rule but at the end of the day\nOr the measurement of our ability to stay here in relatively a sane mine is vested in our direct recording direct correlation without black love proposition\nWe love each other then we're going to survive if we don't we're going to fraction look man I knew from day one\nThey were going to come from an egg white boy at the end of the day they love him because he has made a pledge to

never in the history of watching politics and I've watched all of my life\nMy first race was a for the kid in God and a president so I've been saying for a long time so at the end of the day when that

time and then I knew\n\nNow now we got a couple of more minutes to go and we're trying to tell you everything\nThat's going to be on the ballot trying to answer all of your question with regard to voting access to the polls and all of that we're going to give you the critical date right after this amendment now before we went down the first three amendment number four provides for victims of crime\nAnd the judicial process and um that's what it says essentially and this is where our breach of the cost to Georgia\nBe amended so as to provide certain rights to victims against whom a crime has been allegedly perpetrated and allow victims to assert such right now\nThat has to be our sees law and Ken uh that uh gives they are victims of crime a notice if some of their perpetrator goes to court as well as when they come out or those kinds of things that supposedly what it means\nA and so that's um you know they've been talking about martial law again\nI'm that scene British straightforward a notice is never a bad thing give you the victim of a crime and um the last thing you want to do is have the person\nWho victimize you um walk past year and a Kroger and you did not even know that hadn't been released from jail right uh and that's another big thing that are on some of these social media platforms\nThat community people are talking about the no cash bell which I strongly support\nThat now on the days front of the day's paper they're saying that it have resulted in a more no shows that people who are homeless or people who have are not income not once they are released on the signature bond they simply just not showing up for court\nAnd a lot of uh advocates against it is basically saying you know that uh well they're not showing up and they're committing crimes again and so you know that's one that's going to need to be wise but you should not stay in jail\nOr as a person with no income because you cannot afford a hundred dollar bond two hundred dollar bond\nUh as a person with no income because you cannot afford a hundred dollar bond two hundred dollar bond it makes no sense\nOf that really is a dead us court were poor people are having to stay in court and then that causes the city and the counties Seventy five dollars a day just to keep you in there to after three full days they could have posted your bond and let you out and so um you know\nIn a way a limited number five the last one on hears is somewhat alone what but it says to authorize the fat allocation of sales tax proceeds to county and city school district\nAnd they'd read shell the constitutional Ga be amended so as to authorize a referendum for a sales and used tax\nFor education by county school district or independent school district or districts with in accounting\nFor a having a majority of his students enroll was in the county and to provide that the\nProceeds are distributed on a per student bases among all school systems lesson agreement is reached among such school system for aid is different distribution\nThat basically says the schools with the largest populations get more money not necessarily are that they get based on need so it's based on a different formula for school systems and who is to determine and\nIndependent school systems versus a a regular school systems are so this you'd have to really talk about\nHow that distribution will impact your school system um and to really look at it uh I'm all for schools ... education but you know I Would seriously look at this one is ...\nGoing well known again anytime wish the Republican primarily trying to do something with taxes they're trying to take it from the poor and give it to the rich generally is what they're looking for is the reverse Robin Hood affect a again and largest school district in some of the more rules cities\nOr wherever lure them tax there's not a fun enough public education public education was necessarily because of the compulsory uh exclusion of poor black people black and brown people from being educated\nSo historically that come up with the way in order to or because they educated\nA consumer base or educated electorate or educated a city town\nUm would provide people who are readily able to go into the workforce when companies come to Atlanta in his state or city they want to know who is what the workforce looked like and uh what is the the first thing they asked what is the quality of the schools and so if we're just going to\nI'm not the DEA of love you know great member of the school board in one of my professors at Moore's brown or in political science would always say you cannot at even to ... even in ever get anything but on the ... that's right so so the equal treatment of poor and black people\nTo the Dominic community as equal makes it inherently unequal and because they started with a four hundred year headstart and so you can you the only way you catch up\nIs that one of these groups is gonna have to be treated differently and that additional resources will have to be allocated\nTo deal with the historic and that's what I was just talk\nTo these groups is gonna have to be treated differently and that additional resources will have to be allocated to deal with the historic and that's what I was just talking about a few minutes ago don't tell me we're going to give the south side school the same as a bucket schools because we have had fifty years\nOf a book that we had to get used books\nA deferred maintenance um you know no investment or lack of schools being built known outside of town the ... and this is real even the date the most costly school costly at school in Georgia\nIs north Atlanta high school one hundred forty six million dollars for one school that are systems in Georgia that don't have a hundred and forty six million dollar budget that many exotic and that's what we spent on what's happened to be\nHeld it up and did amount parent area yet as many times that I'm past that place I had to access a friend who live up to what is that they said there's no ... none of high school yes I said this is why the schools down here that needed on the Southside\nLook our diving to get the mole out of a Washington\n... nearly a normal here you hear me yes yes I'm like we've got a black and I'm fighting to get the mole out of this with black people\nWhat we're going to do but you are going to leave him alone that's right and she went on to serve I think about thirty six\nYears after that [laughter] I made some great stories and even today they still try to that convicted felon dragged Iran they were able to successfully knock him off the ballot I Believe or he lost\nWhen he won the mayor's race and then we they sued because he or was it felt when they get selling okay and then uh he got his restoration papers from Alabama and then he ran again in our city council\nI mean what are you do that now we need Brian Kemp to do an investigation him\nBecause he swore an affidavit was absolutely false because we're running for office as have you ever been convicted of a crime ... check no when in fact he had that's right ah in which is a direct he swore a false application as perhaps we should return to him\n... and ...\nAnd of course nobody made no case about that 'cause he's white and um but he's on the city council now
