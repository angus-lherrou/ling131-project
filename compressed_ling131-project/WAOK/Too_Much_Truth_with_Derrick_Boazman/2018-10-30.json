J. he's over in Lakewood CJ\nHire you they think they are but I'm I'm not sure you don't okay man what's happening\nOh man I tell ya and stuff and I try to start listening to the north but right and this\nI might have a question to ask you what I'm saying but what the pipe bombs on the guy going on to the church toward the Jewish coming to shut them up there and got our looked on the day and I lost my job right now to call the shots they got in the back of the grass off\nAnd then went out on the part of like watching all the girls\nThat I really don't have a lot of course nobody asked you just walk\nDown the street or not the truth\nBut hey what they're saying though here's the thing and here's this morning and K right and we aggregate all the people\nWho was Fifteen people roughly killed this weekend\nDoes that sound like a water you [noise] what was going on\nWhere they are but here's the thing I Would go out to look at\nThat point to us about the five police that got killed in Dallas right but they feel obliged to provide the piano\nYou they're forty million of us here now right so at the end\nOf the day we can say they is a certain level of vitriol and hate now or as as a James Baldwin said\nOr to be black and be in America is to be in a constant state of rage your vote on the um while we have the tragic incidents and we don't minimize any of them do I think that\nThere's this group waiting to just come over the hill hell if they came over here they wouldn't know where to find out that we saw with low when they ... they had to kill off all their community and the U.S\nLet let me let me see if I could you live but we sell a lot of back I think we got a good thought I'm going to show\nThat 'cause I think we need to read at you know looking at I don't know a black how that don't have a God\nWell let me see I don't know what\nMatters is what you want a\nBottle of wine and he was like to put her last year they went to some of them oh they are still things that are sold in their life\nYup and I want you all the way Paul bond them because here's the thing where you are trained\nThis is why won't you all did not just react I don't care how many of a a Fifteen as you get I can take that twenty to put a straight to you a head and you can have ten thousand gun and they will be no consequences to you and so part of what we got to do is take that case in case\nWere the level of intelligence now if you look if you got ten thousand guns at home you can only see one\nAnd uh if you got ten thousand gun at home they all locked up in the cabinet you can't even get to it\nAnd so we just not need to be practical now all of those who believe that that's a great race war coming in I don't know we think the white people going to rise up and start doing what you knew everybody ... says you know the black people I don't see that happening is impractical really\nVery impractical\nThat'd be the people who want you to believe they gathered nerve gas they let go to just kill all black people um we're too inextricably bound together with him at least you all\nIf you wanted to come find young he got come to some of the house to get you\nAnd uh and so what I tell you to do is if you own a forum get training for everybody in the house on how to use the baby that three should be able to\nYou to do is if you own a fire 'em get training for everybody in the house on how to use the baby that's three should be able to break one down and loaded\n\nOtherwise don't bring it in your house because nine times out of ten it ain't going to\nBe used for the race war is going to be used on your wife\nUh-huh shoot you you shooting her one of the kids shooting each other nine times out of ten it ain't going to be used for no defensive\nPurposes and if you believe that black people have given their guns away I gotta you gotta be kidding me I don't know see go home\nOr people who do we just don't even we don't believe in non violence okay I um I Believe in and bought a non violent with those who are non violent with me\n\nMust be very clear about that but I'm violent is here with those who are violent with me in fact I don't even believe in proportionality of response\nRight\nYou take the chance and run up on me and you just get whatever the pause can give you\nYou know\nOr just how it works for for eight nine to two seven zero three but as tragic as these\nIncidents or you know we have to remember South Carolina and uh the church down there were I don't know ten eleven people twelve people die massacres\nAnd so if you wanted you want to be much your children around in the streets was dangerous and you know and you want to have a great event they have a a film accounting screen on the green but it starts in like five o'clock with
