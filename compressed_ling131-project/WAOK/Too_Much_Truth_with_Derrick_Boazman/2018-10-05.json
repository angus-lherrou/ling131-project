fifteenth tell us what a man's voting is and who can vote on begin on the fifteenth and are working they find polling places that will be open\nA October Fifteen has early voting ... that's what they really mean advance voting means just voting early\nAnd anyone could vote early so you can go you don't have to go to your own writing and that's that you can go to designated locations and the way you find out where those are you can again go to my voter pay\nReally is the website to catch all all voting ...\nIt has everything it will show whether you requested an absentee ballot and when you get it it was said the date that it was sent to you\nAnd so when you send the ballot back it was said that it has been receipt wow so you can also look up the early voting locations where they are where that can you can go vote early all of that is someone there if you don't know who your representatives are who do you tell you who they are\nIt would also tell you who is running on the ballot because it says qualified candidates you can click on that little link to bring up all ... yes ... market a sample ballot\n... early voting so early votes on the Fifteen a Saturday voting mandatory sedative voting October twenty seventh that's right this is a no one of those progress a piece of legislation that able to get to ask enjoy that Saturday voting to kind of make sure that people have access to the ballot\nThat Saturday voting so right go generally vote at some of those same precincts on Saturday\nThat's correct It's a mandatory ... all one hundred and fifty nine county\nNow some counties like Fulton will have not only that ... Tour de there'll be open on an additional Saturday as well\nYes they all have the previous Saturday I ah October twenty seven is the mandatory one and the twenty first would be a the twentieth I think it's the um\nSaturday well loved the previous week is a previous weekend is that a Saturday voting other Saturday voting as well as a Sunday voting I exactly I'd rather get\nThat your Sunday voting is probably whatever the next Sunday\nAs it is the twenty eighth is the I'm sending him voting or that goes along with ... or a Saturday and the twenty first is the Sunday that goes with the twentieth that it\nGo and we encourage all of our churches to tell people to go the service and then go straight to vote and usually Adams we'll recreation center kind of one or the ones that have been counted the headquarters satellite right for people and ah and I know I've driven over there and I live in South Carolina\nOf pride university but I've driven over there because of early voting may be out of town or what have you don't have excuse right or early vote\nRight Fulton has about twenty some location him and to cap has a a equal number of voting ... as well now all counties dumb\nSome location and to cap has a a equal number of voting those patients as well now all counties don't do Sunday voting\nSo you need to check with your county and a chicken see because you need to vote in your town that's correct a November second to last day of early voting so that's correct or if you don't vote by November So I could\nYou had to go into a polling place or ... November six new to me at that point to request absentee ballot is probably getting very close to the\nYou can request it but you know to me is is really to lay out because I have really dominated back then and get it back in ... on November the six\nAnd they have a statutory limit of two days to get it out to you correct but then you're going to mix you to ... to get it\nTo you wrote back and the way the system has been run own ...\nOrder today and we'll put and we'd go up to that form to trying to get as much information November six that's all over but the ... election day ...
