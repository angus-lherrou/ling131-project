A. okay [noise]\nAll right for you I tune into the other ones that I have a new star search United every okay I'm your hosts Darryl Kilian specific shows so we try to get through quite a bit of information so you might want to get to ... radio you're ready to hear it again when they rerun\nThis tonight in overnight hours but uh I think we got a lot of good information excited about today's show so we don't jump right into it if you listen on a weekly basis you become familiar with the fact that we do automotive reviews every Saturday morning\nThis week and go do it a little bit different 'cause we're doing to but they're from the same I don't make a so if you've seen the video that we put up is the ah two thousand Eighteen expedition platinum edition and the two thousand Eighteenth for rap for that one fifth director now because it out with this expedition when this vehicle pull it up\nIf they um it's called stone grey metallic and had this black leather interior with this really nice stitching this a little bit of an off color stitching almost like the next year to vehicle\nAs soon as I saw it was like wait a minute this is a it was reminiscent of the navigator switch built on the same chassis as Lincoln Navigator\nSo I expected a bit of luxury but I said you know I guess forward is not going to have as much in this expedition as having an advocate and they did leave a few things out like you don't have the thirty way adjustable seats but what you do have is you have heated\nAnd cool drivers and passengers see you have\nMassaging seats are driver and passenger and I do mean um besides the ball in this seat\nThen rolls andme aside is your back you can adjust the attention of the seat you can adjust where you get the most miss out on the low ... upper I was totally impressed then is there's this zebra looking would trim along the center console\nAnd alone to death\nI Would say it elevates this for it to a luxury status I Would not be surprised to find expeditions to some of these a limo company a fleet coming up some\nThree row\nFull size SUV with power folding third row seats and you can fold down the second row from the rear is not a powerful and you can't let it back up from the back\nBut you can't fold down the second row captain's chairs from the tailgate others vehicle has all the things that I've come to expect like the remote start the ... century where my fathers in my pocket I Walk up open the doors and never take my key out\nI can open the deck ally with the remote key all those things that it it just it's almost now looking at a luxury vehicles are almost one of the things some of the things that you just automatically expect but it also has um\nDo climate controlled for front and where it has the smart cruise control it has\nAdjustable foot pedals so a lot of times now we see a lot of families going to SUVs and and so you've got young people starting to drive you have ah people smaller stature\nAnd you need to see over the steering wheel one of the things that used to be a hindrance to full size SUVs it was hard for people to get adjusted to see over the front of the truck well not only can you lift the seats up to where you can see you can also adjust the foot\nIs it it was hard for people to get adjusted to see over the front of the truck will not only can you lift the seats up to where you can see you can also adjust the foot pedals for people with short legs\nAnd its control it's a ... attach the memory function on this key fob so that when you're ... comes to the vehicle it knows who's ... and they're just flip pedals steering wheel and seat to where you wanted to be\nThis thing has A Panoramic sunroof that's right front Andrea glass roof that you see\nIt has ... entertainment and the one thing I liked about this for ... entertainment is that you can connect your smart devices like Apple iPhone or your Android smartphones and you can mirror whatever your kids I mean you have grandchildren are children who watch videos on their phones you can mirror that\nTo the um screens on the back of the head rests on the second row in these captain steer not only can you do that but there's climate control adjustment\nFor the second row passenger so teens are pre teens in their second row feel like they're in control of what they're doing their remote control to control those screens and their headphones\nSo that the driver doesn't have to hear what the second row is doing that we're talking about an SUV a lot of people have boats and an RV this um\nV. six 'cause it's not a ... a three point five to six equal boost Anthony here would it tends to be transmission well this car into your\nNormal sized boat trailers together fourteen thousand pound to incapacity so anything that you were going to do with the VA you can do it with this these six in two thousand Eighteen expedition\nI Will say it's a little bit steeped in price we talk about eighty thousand eighty one thousand eight hundred and Fifteen dollars for for a lot for me to swallow initially just thinking about it but I'll tell you they have stepped up its comfortable if great power\nAnd its luxuries this is a vehicle when you pull up there's no apologies needed\nBut now we got to go to where the fun was\nThat when they brought me the very next week the two thousand Eighteen Ford F. one fifty raptor now interviews have seen this Ford pickup truck that looks like it's woven in over the wheels in the ... like\nYou know somebody's added something to it after market well they didn't Ford has for many years had this rafter vehicle but up until two thousand eighty rafter always looked really mean and found it really mean had a big VA engine\nTons of horse power is a true off road vehicle for Bill the F. one fifty raptor for people who want to go out for all of your fishing hunting if you're the person who drives and sandals and beat if you're taking this vehicle you're going to go on to explore\nThat's what this is one fifty raptor is all about\nBut they did away with the VA and went to a V. six that was the one thing that I thought may be a hindrance for me recommend in his vehicle to anybody I tell you with\nFour hundred and fifty horse power twin turbo charged\nV. six this thing gets zero to sixty five point one second when I tell you a big truck like this can scoop it gets cool and I guess part of that comes from the aluminum body\nYou know a for a couple of years ago I went to all aluminum body on frame to lower somebody to wait to get the feel the economy up well in this raptor it also got the performance of\nIt has all the stuff they pick up trucks and ... this one has the power folding rear gate so a lot of time you see people trying to vote again to welcome you to grab it will only F. one fifty raptors the rear gate folds down with your key fob or ...\nRear gate so a lot of time you see people trying to vote against what could be the grabbing will only F. one fifty raptors the rear gate falls down with your key fob remote pushing the button it has a shock Senate deployed there really slowly once you have it down there is a button on the back of the tailgate you push\nSteps fold out of this tailgate not only do step full out as gay but there's also a handle that folds out lifts up so that you can then hold on and pull yourself into the better the trip I thought that's probably one of the best thing for it is done with the F. one fifty yeah\nA lot of people have stepped aside and all those kind of thing they'll beginning this is built into the declaration of drug and makes getting in and out of his trip east but that's the last thing you want to think about what is there one fifty is raise it had I'll throw suspension and\nIt had big Ninety tires anything that you want to do all wrote just about got on the ground to skip plate and you're going through water going over brush\nThe other thing to do is I put a lot of models on my car uh-huh and uh you know Dr ride share so um I've got like a hundred almost a hundred and fifty on his car and I'm raising my I got to tell you this because there's no for longevity and and uh you know not\nThe forward edge and then the transmission for for a long time and I'm afraid I'm a switch up man you know because you have any issues with the\nWeather to convert or as a sitter and it is um what what you call the shuttering yeah\nYeah that's what it's doing and uh you know they told me that I Need to get a new one you know which a foot man it's kinda crazy you know but that's why I was wondering about the ethical that\nThat doesn't manufacture that doesn't do that um because you know I wouldn't have this problem once you know\nDo you have a six month four cylinder a camera for\nA winner there'd be six may not have you know what I'm going to do some research and then I'm going to put you on hold them unless among get your information\nHow does research on that and I'll get back

on hold some want to get the information and I call you back after the show and then we'll get some more stuff with against me\nOkay um I may have to go is another way that we got ...\nWell yeah you

I'm a conference center is and goes all the way over near Mercedes Benz stadium\nAnd those guys who are on the ground now go wrong yes or not and then you have the right and you have the railroad tracks on the on the day or two years so\nAltogether is forty acres is owned by five different entities and so it's then it's a challenge over the years to get somebody to take on that big projects so they say\nSo it was discovered in some of the the the meeting\nThat Abbott and that I attended most of the city council meetings about the goal which I was that the two hour work session was supposed to be to our goats work session that turned into a four hour work session that only half of the city council members attend it\nAnd I'm as senator for refers to the people at the table answering the questions as a money to wearing lawyers who've been paid ... I'm also attended the mayor\nInformation form that she had that has been criticized because two thirds of the people in a room were actually city employees\nWhich meant that the true public were could not get in but since I was at the hall that day I I was able to get in because I was there are very very early\nAnd um it was definitely an interesting um scenario or to be in the room and see what was going on and most of the questions were not actually answered and I still I'm asked my ass myself and many others how is it that\nYou have a lawyer who was representing the city who is Alvin Kendall who was in Atlanta natives who is the liaison between the city and see I Am this developer\nWho has on their board of directors or one of their owners is brothers with ... one of the Atlanta Hawks owners I think his last name as wrestler so how is it that this guy is doing this complicated presentation at the mayor's\nForum and he's not using a PowerPoint yeah\nThey have these these big screen set up and they have a PowerPoint that's you know showing pictures of the Gulf and had some other points on there that they want us to know that was good for the city\nOr in their pain but they could have just as easily had him do a powerful understood him quote in all these numbers and facts and figures and people can actually see it as he's talking about it so that was interesting\nSo I have a six hundred page document that's called the Atlanta Gulch project and if you go over five hundred and Fifteen there is a development agreed that ah that's among the city\nI'm five hundred and Fifteen there is\nA development agreed that ah that's among the city of Atlanta and the Atlanta development authority\nAnd there's some interesting things because remember affordable housing is very much and need across the country as well as here in a state of the land and we need more affordable housing and more workforce house\nSo they're bragging about ... percent of the the um uh units are going to be set aside for a workforce housing so that's supposed to be two thousand I mean that's supposed to be two hundred unit\nBut if you look closely under exhibit\nYes on page F. one it's sad that worked for a full of flash a portable housing rental units must be lease as such for a minimum of three year old does that sound like a deal to you\nWell it's very weird to read to me\nYeah and then over on another page on page three\nOkay I'm listening\nWas the problem with the three years in your view well it should be for the life of the development not just for the first three years at at over\n... I just wanted to clear I'm On a note the audience would understand\nOkay I Gotcha I got you you know for three years in and what do you do after three years ... you know they can actually um by the unit but most of the people that need work for the housing and affordable housing can't afford to buy you and is that at this point stage in her life\nAnd they could also end up selling it at at markets so that's a farce\nA five billion dollar deal um that's coming in that's interesting um another key thing about the ... housing that says that for the avoidance of doubt any workforce slash affordable housing unit that has not been able to be at least\nFor a period of sixty days may be least at a market rate\nSo as to minimize vacancy within the project\n... if you hold it off the market for six today than you can ruin it for what have you ...\nWhat did you report not those holes in the housing plan and that means the people in the MP you and people who are concerned housing advocates than others should be pressing the elected officials to get a better deal from the developers right\nYes and we are in that last caller in on this I'm going to send the Vita is that it says that the owner may elect to pay an inland sea to the city to be deposited until the Gulch housing plus fun prior to issue weren't are they building permit\nSo that means they can pay a fee as there be no affordable housing units in this development which\nMeans this development could be like a Martha's Vineyard\nOnly the rich people\nWere you dug out some important thing was the one other issue you want to Drew Drew\nI Do the other one is that marred on a board of directors voted on how the heck\nPenny sales tax amid Atlanta\nFolded voted for twenty six team they voted on projects on how it would be spent and as\nA dad as you may remember and some other uh Atlanta residents lady remember that the foods and industrial Marta station where the part of the original Marta plan and\nUh yeah that you may remember and some other uh Atlanta residents remember that the food industry Marta station was a part of the original Marta plan\nAnd so we at your just stand up and some other local advocates were asking Marta to at the Fulton industrial Marta station back to the project list\nBecause the number three seven ... the number of Seventy three Fulton industrial bus that goes over to\nFulton industrial does work that job works center\nWhere UPS just opened another facility where they have twelve hundred workers and that plan alone so um we didn't get that added to the list but what they did find was light rail transit on Capitol Hill road and a green grass transit center\nAll the other projects that will be a get a part of this two point five billion dollars over forty years the rest of the money goes to the belt line they took some of the money from Emory\nUm so that's a possibility if they go is Democrats when the house and Democrats win the Senate that talk was uh when I woke up this morning about six to ... that was already on the Internet that Democrats were talking about impeaching Kavanaugh if he was confirmed now he has been confirmed\nBut the big old enough is enough Democrats get out and vote and if the house and Senate or become majority democratic\nAnd what is it that Mitch McConnell and state and I don't understand I think as a whole lot of a ... um when you're skeletons of his closet also but he was saying that they only need one senator to ask for the six can vote something uh [noise] um let me turn back to the sixty votes a portion where they've been ... chicken chicken farm\nBut they can get no senators to do that or is it like that same thing that we needed when Bush and the rest of them said stone or the election and they needed a recount but they couldn't get a set of the stand up and ask for a recount\nSo years it took two thirds majority to appoint federal any federal judge and then they relax the rules to allow a simple majority for most federal judges except for the Supreme Court\nAnd then within the last two years they've relaxed roof further to allow for a simple majority vote even for the highest court in the land because they see the majority slipping away from them they see the\nMargin you know there's only a couple of boat in the Senate so it is um\nIt's a very difficult situation but I was intrigued by your other suggestion is that whether Kavanaugh could be shamed into resigning and I think only if\nThe GOP feel that there is sufficient evidence against him in the public arena that jeopardizes the twenty twenty presidential election which starts on January the first and that's the only way I see that playing out if there was such overwhelming\nCorroborate shouldn't other evidence and if there was evidence that the White House improperly intervene to limit the FBI investigation than you might see some reverse of but I don't think impeachment were I think I've got to be a political quest\nYou're absolutely right it was opened by the time twenty twenty rolled around that I'm\nA gentleman that's in the White House or what have convicted him a ... mouth season changes in a whole bunch of other things where we and there's a lot of rocket ride that's for sure ... and ... and it\nSeems to me that in recent he started attacking that a ... a lady missed by Dr\nBlocks of oil blasted for this\nBecause he already knew that if somebody told them what they were going to doing it seemed like he already knew what the outcome of the FBI investigation so he did when it started acting like even\nYou know because I have two or three days before that he was so impressed with what you got to say well soon as they gave him the green light and saying no we want to get this through he just went on I started acting his you know south\nThe investigation was hamstring by the White House it was just a show it was a\nA cursory investigation they didn't interview people who had already come out with accusations against a camera no they didn't want to talk about it they know he's the lead they just don't care and I tell you something else they have calculated it was as and as mentioned there is a political issue\nTalk about it they know he's the lead they just don't care and I tell you something else they have calculated it was as Janice mentioned is a political issue they\nCalculated that white women are still going to vote for Trump and Trump is people even yeah they disrespect them publicly and openly and shame them off for no one in being victims or what we all know women are victims of sexual abuse\nOh Brent Kavanaugh was worse acts would not the acts that Dr ... talked about even though those were bad they are a whole lot of accusations against him but they wouldn't in any of those people they want to talk about it they were accusations that came up to the nineties but they didn't want to talk about that um he's withdrawn\nHe's a liar 'cause he proved that he does not have the temperament to be the judge that he was in the uh\nThe appeals court wasn't appeals court even though I'm a court of appeals court of appeals\nHe's biased with was a very great concern to me 'cause if any case involving sexual abuse of believing that a woman with sex abuse he's going to be extremely biased involved Democrat or involves Democrats or has anything to do with the person who supported Clinton he's gonna be streamed advice and he would\nHe should in any case is like that recused himself so it's as if he's not even there can't even do his job because of his biased\nOr they knew that all of that stuff they just didn't care\nAnd Trump cat they trumpeting jak labor somebody calculated tell him what we got the votes so you can say what you want to say now 'cause he was acting all most humans when he met her testimony was credible and what I what I Would like for the Republicans to explain\nIs why this lady who had some very distinct memories and who also passed the polygraph tests in August\nWhy her testimony plus a polygraph test will be disbelief in somebody who gets man is not since snaps at people and ask ask the question is would be\nBelieve out on the other hand I'm telling you he couldn't make it on a jury in a traffic case\nThe other factor in this that they hadn't talked to a whole\nLot about is judge Kavanaugh's view of presidential power and what President or exit from which is prosecution in his view and that plays a role in the G O P desire to protect him and give their quote political cover for making this boat [noise]\nYeah so a whole lot I liked your questions I'm Glad you hung up because she raised some stuff you know I say they want to talk about it but I'm Glad we did talk about it\nAnd we're not a question if if you would know that that you are very well read and and science or is it is it true that a that this man might belong to a quote unquote calling bombs group\nAnd um and different types of political pressure\nAnd are we going to be able to understand all will be able to be able to see or is there anything in the type that will take the money out of these elections because\nIf these elected officials already bought and paid for by the time that they get to Washington DC well then it doesn't make any difference uh it's almost like being able to verify these vote\nEven right here in Georgia if you if you're not able to verify the both will always come up short\nWell we're not going to always come up short I got a little too much faith in that style and balls yes most likely he is a member so a whole lot of other senators and former president\nI'm going to say you can go buy his plane words you don't have to believe that he's a member of a secret society to know that he is not a friend of justice or equality\nYeah you can go by plane words you don't have to believe that he's a member of the secret is that you know that he is not a ran the justice or equality or equal

but I was curious I I think he may have mentioned them on one occasion but I'm Glad you reinforced it\nI think the lady who took out the boy here at all that's where they were very good call very good information\nYes she was giving us a ... and I'm Glad you mentioned the\nAlternate term for early voting because I have seen both of those and and um you mentioned also that um we can go into the voting booth with our relatives my mom was a could not read or write either so I finally I got her voter registration certificate and I go into\nThe booth with her when she was still alive you know\nAnd uh so I Love the fact about South Carolina I as as that he meant and the other lady I'm not so sure Syria I think very\nThat that are in deep down yeah Harry I don't know what he finally we get anybody to answer that but I'm the butler cancer some\nYou know we know the answer to that question you can go into the booth with someone in in Georgia it has to be a person of the voters to the other day you want to go it was just I'm just given an exam\nSomeone in in Georgia it has to be a person of the voters choose the\nOther day you know I Want to go it was just I'm just given an example if a person wants to go in with their a young adult child and the youngest child doesn't want them come in and they can't come in\nBut the voter makes the decision whether or not they want somebody that they want to know the person to come into the booth with them they can bring that person then there is one restriction do and I'm Glad you miss it because I forgot to say you know air\nOne person one helper can only help ten people\nAnd also posted it on Facebook and so we didn't read it all but we did put it on the sisters in law Facebook page\nYou're so I Want helper and you can see where

A. okay [noise]\nAll right [noise] you're thrown into the other ones that I have a new star search and ate it every okay I'm your host they're killing for this week's show so we try to get through quite a bit of information so you might want to get your fans radio you're ready to hear it again when they rerun\nThis tonight and overnight hours but uh I think we've got a lot of good information excited about today's show Sweden jumped right into it if you listen on a weekly basis you become familiar with the fact that we do automotive reviews every Saturday morning\nThis week and go do a little bit different 'cause we are doing to but they're from the same I don't make a so if you've seen the video that we put up it's the uh two thousand Eighteen expedition platinum edition and the two thousand Eighteenth for rap for that one fifth director now we'll start with this expedition when this vehicle pull it up\nIf they um it's called stone grey metallic and had this black leather interior with this really nice stitching this a little bit of all colors it's almost like the next year to vehicle\nAs soon as I saw it was like wait a minute this is a it was reminiscent of the navigator switch built on the same chassis as Lincoln Navigator\nSo I expected a bit of luxury but I said you know I guess Ford is not going to have as much in this expedition as having an advocate and they did leave a few things out like you don't have the party way adjustable seats but what you do have is you have heated\nAnd cool drivers and passengers see\nYou have massaging seats are driver and passenger and I do mean him aside to the ball in this heat than roles andme aside is your ... you can adjust the attention of the seat you can adjust where you get the most miss out on the low ... upper\nI was totally impressed then is there's this zebra looking would trim along the center console\nAnd alone to death\nI Would say it elevates this for it to a luxury status I Would not be surprised to find expeditions if somebody's a limo company a fleet coming up some three row\nFull size SUV with power folding third row seat and you can fold down the second row from the rear is not a powerful and you can't let it back up from the back\nBut you can fold down the second row captain's chairs from the tailgate others vehicle has all the things that I've come to expect like the remote start the ... century where my fathers in my pocket I Walk up open the doors and never take my key out\nI can open the deck ally with the remote key\nThose things that it it just is almost now looking at a luxury vehicles are almost one of the things some of the things that you just automatically expect but it also has um do a climate controlled for front and where it has the smart cruise control\nThe things that you just automatically expect but it also has um\nDo climate controls the front and where it has the smart cruise control it has\nAdjustable foot pedals so a lot of times now we see a lot of families going to SUVs and and so you've got young people starting to drive you have um people are smaller stature\nAnd you need to see over the steering wheel one of the things that used to be a hindrance to full size SUVs and it was hard for people to get adjusted to see over the front of the truck well not only can you lift the seats up to where you can see you can also adjust the foot pedals for people with short legs\nAnd its control it's a ... attached the memory function on this ... so that when your key fob comes to the vehicle it knows who's ... and they're just flipped pedals steering wheel and seat to where you wanted to be this thing has A Panoramic sunroof that's right front Andrea glass roof that you see\nIt has ... entertainment and the one thing I liked about this for ... entertainment is that you can connect your smart devices like Apple iPhone or your Android smartphones and you can mirror whatever your kids I mean you have grandchildren are children who watch videos on their phones you can mirror that\nTo the uh screens on the back of the head rests on the second row in these captain's chair not only can you do that but there's climate control adjustment\nFor the second row passenger so teens are pre teens in their second row feel like they're in control of what they're doing their remote control to control those screen and their headphones\nSo that the driver doesn't have to hear what the second row is doing that we're talking about an SUV a lot of people have boats and an RV this um\nV. six 'cause it's not a ... a three point five days a week six ego boost your would attend to be transmission well this car into your\nNormal sized boat trailers together fourteen thousand pound to incapacity so anything that you were going to do with the VA you can do it with this these six in two thousand Eighteen expedition\nI Will say it's a little bit steep in price we talk about eighty thousand ... eighty one thousand eight hundred and Fifteen dollars\nFor for a lot for me to swallow initially just thinking about it but I'll tell you they have stepped up its comfortable if great power and it's a luxury is this is the vehicle when you pull up there's no apologies needed\nBut now we got to go to where the fun was\nThat's when they brought me the very next week the two thousand Eighteen Ford F. one fifty raptor now and if you have seen this Ford pickup truck that looks like it's woven in over the wheels and the ... like you know someone is added something to it after market will they didn't\nFord has for many years had this raptor vehicle but up until two thousand Eighteen rafter always looked really mean and found it really mean had a big VA engine\nTons of horse power is a true off road vehicle for Bill the F. one fifty raptor for people who want to go off road you're fishing hunting if you're the person who drives and sandals and beat if you're taking this vehicle you're going to go on to explore\nThat's what this F. one fifty raptor is all about\nBut they did away with the VA and went to a V.
