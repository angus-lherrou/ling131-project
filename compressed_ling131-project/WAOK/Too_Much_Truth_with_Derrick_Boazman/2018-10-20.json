A. okay [noise]\n\nAlready where ... the other ones that are new thoughts are genetically W A L K will reduce your bring you\nInformation and we hope extensive review the vehicle that we've tested so that you can make good decisions when you go out to buy your vehicle\nSo we're going to start because I got a couple I Want to get in the day we weren't here last Saturday I Want to make sure these reviews they fresh I don't forget some of the things that I did and what I learned about these vehicles wanna bring up the right away so first of all we can talk about this two thousand Nineteen Honda insights and this is a\nRedesign model for inside the previous insight was a very um hybrid eco friendly looking vehicle this two thousand Nineteen hybrid or from hounded insight\nHundred took a little different approach they're a little bit different in some of 'em the other hybrids that we've become familiar with\nAnd wait I and I didn't get this from Honda I haven't gotten any inside PR person telling me this is what they were doing but this was when I get when I saw the vehicle pull up the insight reminded me a lot of the new Honda Accord you share some of the same lines the grill is very similar to the new ...\nSo I thought that I knew the inside was a hybrid\nAnd when it came up and they look much like a hybrid so I thought maybe I Would not up to speed but in fact idiots and that was one of the first thing I noticed about the inside is it doesn't scream hey look at me I'm saving the environment\nAnd if I'm being honest that's probably one of my biggest issues with the hybrid vehicles in hybrid vehicle owners um\nAlmost feel like hybrid and electric vehicle owners trying to shame everybody else who drives gas powered vehicles if we're um the cause of everything wrong because we are polluting and were burned up too much gas we're creating all this need for more fossil fuel and so I Do get my feeling some time when I see a hybrid vehicle\n[noise] 'cause I haven't completely I'm\nAdopted that that that months it but I Will say we took a trip as a family from Atlanta to Destin, Florida in this insight I told the press fleet vehicle a company that I was going on a road trip in\nAfter there was any way we don't get to pick what cars we get for you know each week we just ... they bring us what it is we have no preconceived notions we don't know [noise] and the best he could do was bring me this board or inside\nMy first thing was is probably going to be a terrible trip three people in our luggage beats the\nLoan drive in a hybrid oh my God it's not going to perform well where was I I couldn't have been more wrong there was plenty of back see room for my ten year old\nIn a hybrid oh my God it's not going to perform well well was I couldn't have been more wrong that was plenty of back see room for my ten year old if you have to um adolescent children yeah I'll say up to about you know teenager\nThere's enough room for a three four hour drive in the back seat and still have some comfort there is Bluetooth integration there is why integration into vehicles so you can um connect your wireless devices in the vehicle you have satellite radio\nAnd so that keeps the little people entertain for the trip and an insight now as far as the driving position of this insight I found the seat to be really comfortable\nAnd it had one of the things that I have come to love and even expect to be a cause these days and that is this a enhanced cruise control and what do I mean by enhance will this cruise control you set the speed the distance from the car ahead of you that you want to keep and you can adjust how far you want to stay from the vehicle in front of you\nAnd you turn on the\nLane keep assist feature\nIn LA and keep a speech is one of those things where once the vehicle reads the lines on the road and it's hard to incite when inside reads the lives on the road\nThe vehicle attempts to keep that vehicle with in the two lines on the road so it keeps you sit on your lane\nOh you have to do is keep your hand on the steering wheel and this vehicle pretty much drives itself is not good are completely autonomous if you take your hands off this year will for more than a few seconds you'll get an alert on the dashboard the driver must take control the we'll give them that it will turn the cruise control off that will give you all kind of\nAudible signal but it makes for a really relaxing drafts of you have a vehicle that has this you want to try it but in this two thousand Nineteen hundred insight that link keep assist worked\nWell it takes a lot of their driver fatigue away and speaking of driving for tea there is a function of feature in this insight that monitors how long you been driving and money unless you know when you need to take a break\nSo you can set that up and it'll give you alerts they tell you time to pull over time to take a break a time to switch drivers one one other thing that helps keep you safe or in the vehicle\nAnd has a parking assist program so it will help you get their vehicle into parallel parking spaces and traditional parking spaces so that\nIf you are not the best job or you got a young driver learn to drive it will assist them in getting their vehicle a park that has blind spot monitoring but hunter goes one step further in the inside\nWhen the driver stars on the right turn signal\nThere is a camera is located in the right outside near that when you turn the single lone your center console turns into a monitor\nAnd it will stand display what ever is on the right side of their vehicle so you're making the right time between a parallel park it shows you the curb it shows you anything on the right side of the vehicle it shows you have a bicycle is or a desperate is approaching\n[noise] which makes it safer for pedestrians on the road as well I really liked that feature and you can also turn that feature for that a sinner console own just by pressing the end of your turn signal you could turn the camera on it\nAnytime this thing had but I said dad was cruise control\nCollision mitigation breaking which means if this vehicle noticing that you're about to be in a in an accident you're approaching another vehicle on object it will alert you and it will also activate the brakes and stop the car if you can't do it like I said it has to keep us is and what they call\nIt will alert you and it will also activate the brakes and stop the car if you can't do it like I said it had to like keep us is and where they co wrote departure mitigation wherever your vehicle goes over the line\nThe car takes over pools your vehicle back into his lane I Know oh that sounds really scary and some people think its troops there but\nHaving driven ... Honda does a really good job with this technology doesn't take over and it does it intrude on you\nAs a driver but it does offer you some extra assistance and if anybody has taken a three or four road trip you know it does start to get mundane and Honda insights what it does is it just keeps you back focus it pulled the wheel in large you it tells you if you're tired\nAnd did all this with three people in our luggage when it came time to accelerate hundred and fifty one horse power with the help of this hybrid at one point five leader\nFor sale the engine and with the hybrid motors it brought up to a hundred and fifty one horse power and what I Will say people I drove a car this size\nAll the way to Destin on one tank of gas and drove around for about a day and a half in Destin on that same tank again I average about forty two point nine miles per gallon city and highway um hunter\nProjects that it'll get forty eight miles per gallon combined fifty one in a city forty five on the highway so that they're more highway driving is probably why they got forty two miles per gallon because of a hybrid you really um get your fuel efficiency from stop and go driving that's what separates a hybrid\nToo that's intersects a lot of things that you normally do you could see it right there from the screen with out\nHaving to take your hands off the we'll hold a phone in your hand and take as off the road because I think what Toyota some other makers have come up with is that\nYoung people are accustomed to the technology and that center console is going to be a lot more familiar and a lot more comfortable to them and hopefully make them better drivers\nUm they also have a wireless charging port in this vehicle you lay your new smartphones down his little charging station any charges it takes it out of the kids hands young people's hand and it puts it there\nI'm I Will say the interior\nThough it is exciting I don't know that that appealing for me a lot of white plastic inside of the car and the center on the dashboard when you're ...\nUm looks more like a in a ... a writer and amusement park more than it does a car but there again\nI think Toyota is appealing to a different demo than data me forty nine year old man not necessarily my idea of a grown up car but what it does and what it was designed to do it does well and that is to be environmentally friendly and to be fueled the fish and\nUm if you've ever looked at them and ... that's the window sticker on some of the newer carts of cars you see that there is a\nA little section that is the EPA DOT and says fuel economy and environment so fuel economy and greenhouse gas ratings you can go from one to ten\nAnd your calls a driving his car seven hundred this car gets a T and on this government environmental ratings for small you can go from one to Tina Tina and being the best the previous gets a seven as it relates to that so there's vehicle is very environmentally friendly\nFuel efficient and overall vehicle crash test it gets five stars side crash test me to get four star sacrificed as it gets five stars the vehicle has tons of safety features it no airbags tribes are controlled it has the uh\nI'm a\nControl remote groups throw you have a lot of things are those features into satellite radio\nIt have you can get a sweet subscription where you can subscribe to all this stuff on your car to make it look like a mobile phone on the dashboard so it's really more of an in town not a road trip not really a family car this is\nYoung people urban environment um small vehicles move around get in and out and\nFrom my point of view it's one of those vehicles that\nIt says look I mean I'm doing something for the environment I Am environmentally friendly I'm saving gas therefore potentially saving lives and I would say if there was any knock I Would ever have own a Prius or any hybrid vehicle it would be the\nRaising my hand look at me I'm environmentally friendly I think it's one of those things if you you just do it\nWe're vehicle it would be the raising my hand look Amy\nI'm environmentally friendly I think it's one of those things if you you just do it but you do have to let everybody know that you're doing all that said you can get this vehicle thirty three thousand seven hundred and three dollars um there are some states do have some um tax\nBenefits to buy an environmentally friendly vehicles\nAnd this is not one that you can drive you and like this the ... and and hybrids you don't get that that tag in Georgia you could drive in the um HOV lane because its eagle friendly car then come with the hybrids it comes with the electric vehicles um but I Would say all in all Toyota\nGood brand this ... has been around and running strong for a really long time\nFor years has actually set the standard for other auto makers and their hybrid endeavor you've seen Hyundai cue GM a Honda all the rest of those car companies come behind Toyota because Toyota was groundbreaking innovative with this previous when he came out\nAnd they're continuing to evolve and continuing to set the standard for the hybrid industry so go out to get the waiter dealership and check out that Toyota Prius\nI'll give it you know you're young professional inner city urban environmentally friendly coast um efficient person then maybe the vehicle\nFor you it also comes with you know standing water three ... thirty six thousand Mao they're better he wanted a little bit lower you want to check just to make sure the batteries on these hybrids have had a bad take early on but now these batteries are up to speed and I don't think you have anything to worry about so take it out and uh you know let me know what you think about their ...\nBut talking about warranties we have a gas coming up if you follow me on social media you may have seen that I put up a a story that GM the company that owns\nBuick\nGMC drugs Chevy Cadillac has come out with\nWhat they call innovative new extended warranty it's a bumper to bumper towards the end is supposed to be different than anything that we've ever seen from an automaker in the past well looking for you and me we're going to have a guest in the next\nHour joining us to talk about this\nWar the program and it's not about this fresh at least that just came out

A. D. V.\nDot org [noise] talks Thirteen eighty W. A. okay\nThis is was love for holding court called ... which was World War three Ninety three seminars breathe you can talk W. A. okay [noise]\n\nIn law who's into search the native W A L K\nHere is a very intriguing store\nWith me or race not just poverty shapes who graduate in America [noise] well yes that's true so what does that mean\nIt means that racism versus bottom line is what it may it means that all this talk about race neutral and being passed race is\nWe're rolling in one of her opinions to get beyond race we have to take race into account\nSo we may have race conscious policies that civically target black boy\nLet me just give you a little synopsis this study is by the equal equality of opportunity project is relatively new there's been a lot in the press about it but not so much in the mainstream you know CNN him at MSNBC\nNo matter how much money on family I have no matter how well see a black family is\nBlack men are less likely to finish high school less likely to go to college more likely to go to prison more likely to experience poverty less able to earn wages less likely to be employed this study was done on millions of people\nTwenty six years worth of data\nFrom I think Nineteen eighty nine and all the way the twenty\nFifth team racism and policies that don't take race into account all the reasons interestingly enough black boys do best when they live in neighborhoods where there are a low levels of white racist\n... the last that it is not anything about the the family but income the education black boy thrive when white so I'm not racist de ... around\nWell when they were actually when they live in a mobile neighborhoods mhm where they are low level the whites are round but they're not racist what okay\nThey said something to me when she was just a little girl we were talking about we were in a meeting a rainbow pushed meeting and they were talking about all the disparities in discrepancies and black achievement she said well we don't trust studying them\n[laughter] me [laughter] that's a good we're adding up\nThinking that the problem is in us when the problem really seem to be based on this study that racism is what causes black men to suffer economically and educational\nYou know when you were saying those things introducing us to this topic or this study I was thinking a racist would say that black boys do worse because they're genetically inferior\nRight but that that is not borne out by the they looked at what your test scores are in the lower grade and how you end up and there's no correlation between lower test scores and income earning ability later in life\nWhat matters is whether you were exposed to raise\nThose among them ... you have deep and one thing we live out of felt that yeah\nBut to have a big study I mean with millions of of data points in\nAll black people have a whole lot of sayings that really ... in camps them as what you just said like you gotta stay black till you die the point of view that whether you are rich or poor education I'm educated you are going to be black and you're going to be discriminated against\nBlack boys who grow up in millionaire households [noise] I'm more likely to be poor at some point during their lives than white boys whose families only earn thirty six thousand dollars a year\nShocking and I tried to read them I tried to think of a some black boys who grew up in millionaire homes in the top one percent home and I I just it's hard to wrap\nSome black boys grew up in millionaire homes in the top one percent home and I I just it's hard to wrap my mind around that counts they're not that they would be quite a few new\nWell to do family whose boys are suffering right now that's when I could name song that's I don't know read my man around\nAnd don't you know black boys who are under achieving black man with under achieved their parents\nYes who maybe didn't finish college I ended up getting in some kind of criminal trouble well\nAnd they say look we give money the other thing is this past race with President Obama's election there was a lot of talk about post racial America\nYeah we get title one of my face all family it's cool\nWay to not give title one minute to school there high concentrations of black students because black students need help overcoming ranks of\nThey don't just need help overcoming poverty they do okay and interestingly enough the discrepancy that it's there is not nearly as for now the among girls as it is my voice and why is that we live in a male dominated society the people who have the most power or still white\nMen they exercise that power against black man more ferocious than they do against black when black women are not perceived as is threatening or if competition\nAnd but well in our most highly educated segment of our society\nThere is believe it or not between black women and why women with similar family income there is no\nDifference and earning ability ...\nBlack girls and white girls from similar economic backgrounds have the same earning built over their lifetime\nSo metaphorically kill all the boys are right works like this like payroll and he got it\nRight and we're black women have to own that and fight for policies that\nCounteract that and get people talking about oh I didn't go to school on the farm it that's where your food [laughter] you know you just being foolish because why would you\nI flew am I went to school and affirmative action but also assume that I took my primitive action tip and did their best I could with it right I don't know where that did not use you work with the lawyer who the affirmative action in\nYeah in law school a lot she hired me to work for her just because her opinion was totally opposite from a ... where she defended oh institutions that were accused of racism\nAnd she knew that my point of view was totally opposite of hers and she I that's the only job I ever got about ... awful oh she came to me and asked me to work for her\nI just wanted a founding board she wanted a different opinion\nI don't know what she wanted and I guess you I Hope she got it oh I was in her they had a person who was again\nOh affirmative action teaching voting rights I was in her voting rights glass and somewhere along the line I don't know she figured out I was the person is you need to hire to be her own research and assistant\nAnd I think now it's happening is we're opposite\nBut this idea that uh we don't deserve any special ... that's a form of reparation actually affirmative action is a form of reparations and not just repair for damage done in the past\nThat's a that's a form of reparation actually affirmative action is a form of reparations and not just repair for damage done in the past but Rick Perry for the continuing damage of continuing racism in the night\nSo we have to be careful what we say we don't put the permanent that we ought to leave and more of it\nRather than less but it's an interesting study if people go to a state\nOf an article in a ... foot pay 'em a shower\nTo when I get a minute for yourself and tell me what you think\nWell and I remember one of the first interactions I had as a a socialist a prosecutor after I got out of law school this all white lawyer come in his office and he said well don't you think we prosecute so many black people not because they're black but because they're poor and I said no\nI agree with you on that money is not the protector is the quality of the upbringing and auditing money is not to protect because racism exist in hospitals and oftentimes\nDues that I Know a lot of black do and I know a lot of black ... grew up in the middle class neighborhoods like me\nOftentimes those that fall victim to the pressures of racism in the in the tripping out techniques of racism they fall victim to a whole lot of things that trip from up in life because you're bringing it wasn't that good his grew up in the middle class black neighborhood and\nSee this is where we differ I think that racism trips as it does I think that racism works against us I mean there are effective\nIn his persistent and it's not viewed as a factor among people who like you know they fund education for poor people but they don't want any programs to help us deal with racism\nAnd then I had a question where I last week the week before just asked me what what I felt about where was I bought affirmative action I support it too strong re ethnic and needs to be tweaked\nWhere two of us with affirmative action as it applies the benefit of benefiting white women in today's society\nBecause well I think that we should use the same standard of review there is a standard in the law ... strict scrutiny\nIn order to establish have race conscious program the program has to survive strict scrutiny when it comes to race when it comes to gender they don't apply strict scrutiny so you've got an entirely different method of review and evaluation\nFor what are their own gender program is appropriate as opposed to raise program\nBeing both black and female I Would submit that there ought to be one standard for both\nWhy ask some more about that I'm being caught for the time I'm gonna let that won't go past expect me to come back to that again 'cause I 'cause I that's one of the things that question I think needs to be tweaked about on the farm live action\nThey need to reevaluate how it applies to white women ... I'm not against white women getting it but I think it needs to be reevaluate one set of rules\n[noise]\nMate [laughter] I talk with you but I talk with you about it later\nWhy women have enough advantage\nI don't think they need the extra advantage of not having programs that are designed to benefit them not to be scrutinized like programs that are designed to fit or help African Americans are scrutinize\nYou know that's what James is talking about is two different levels they going to go through a with a fine tooth comb and a magnifying glass in a new paper\nRegarding programs that are designed to benefit African Americans\nBut if it's designed to benefit white females the scrutiny is not as great as oh that's nice but the stand it should be the same but just meditating on that I think you'll see the fairness of the stand to be in the same for both groups\nWhat what I see is that and I don't I don't have a I don't have an opinion on whether this is right and wrong it's but what I've seen is that white women over at least the last Thirty years have been the greatest benefactor of affirmative action\nBecause the standard is easier for lower\nThirty years have been the greatest benefactor of affirmative action\nAbout it because the standard is easier for\nLower there was a case when I was in law school come back and back stabbing strict scrutiny for race based programs but it does not apply strict scrutiny the gender based programs like\nTitled ... and that's the mistake and alone it's wrong okay\nHey made it easier for governor I'll talk to you all ladies thank\nYou so much time we appreciate incensed I brought back to the issue I'm voting you know and we promise to talk about it every time we on the air and to the election and we'll probably talk about even after\nUm you know it's wrong for the U.S secretary of state to be the secretary of state and control elections and also participating in the election there's a lot of the candidate\nAs a candidate there's a lot of talk going around talking about he's not able to perform his job because he's only been in office four or five times since the election started that's not my problem with it my problem is he's over something\nThat he is participating in as a candidate and it's a conflict of interest is not an hour of his office to benefit himself yeah and one of those way way he's done it consistently ever since\nI guess the thought of running for governor ran through his mind you know we talked about how so many Georgians were oh removed from the voting rolls\nIt was not necessary except that the secretary of state was going to run for governor and those people who were removed from the rolls we're likely to vote for democratic candidate and not likely to vote for him so he had three ... I'm only\nFifty three thousand voter registration applications our own home right now [laughter] Seventy percent of them are African American women can't be fair\nIt's not fair and take a step back to the six hundred thousand or more who were purged from the rolls it was the secretary of state when that was done\nThat's true and it\nCould only have been done to benefit him as a candidate that's why it's not ... that's why I was a conflict of interest as a kid and within the party right as a candidate\nHe wants to benefit is party and benefit himself as a secretary of state he should want everyone who's eligible to vote to vote and those two are in conflict\nYou know he needs and that's why the ant food again yeah but the election is was Seventeen Days away\nAnd if we had the voting rights that in place as it existed for shell the weakest Scott the election or stop the practices\nYeah but they're in office now before they stop it but we can now vote him you can ... him and that's

we've tested so that you can make good decisions\nWhen you go out to buy your vehicle\nSo we're going to start because I got a couple I Want to get in the day we weren't here last Saturday I Want to make sure these reviews stay fresh I don't forget some of the things that I did and what I learned about these vehicles want to bring up the right away so first of all we're not talking about this two thousand Nineteen Honda insights and this is a\nRedesign model for inside the previous insight was a very um hybrid eco friendly looking vehicle this two thousand Nineteen hybrid or from hounded insight\nHundred took a little different approach that little bit different in some of 'em the other hybrids that we've become familiar with\nAnd wait I and I didn't get this from Honda I haven't gotten any inside PR person telling me this is what they were doing but this is when I get when I saw the vehicle pull up the insight reminded me a lot of the new Honda Accord is share some of the same lines the grill is very similar to the new Honda Accord\nSo I thought that I knew the inside was a hybrid\nAnd when it came up and look much like a hybrid so\nThought maybe I Will not up to speed but in fact it is and that was one of the first thing I noticed about the inside is it doesn't scream hey look at me I'm saving the environment and if I'm being honest that's probably one of my biggest issues with the hybrid vehicles in hybrid vehicle owners um\nAlmost feel like hybrid and electric vehicle owners trying to shame everybody else who drives gas powered vehicles as if we're um the cause of everything wrong because we are polluting and were burned up too much gas we're creating all this need for more fossil fuel and so I Do get in my feeling some time when I see a hybrid vehicle\n[noise] 'cause I haven't completely I'm\nAdopted that that that months it but I Will say we took a trip as a family from Atlanta to Destin, Florida in this insight I told the press fleet vehicle a company that I was going on a road trip in\nAfter there was any way we don't get to pick what cars we get for you know each week we just ... they bring us what it is we have no preconceived notions we don't know [noise] and the best he could do was bring me this board OR Insight\nMy first thing was is probably going to be a terrible trip three people in our luggage beat stuff\nLoan drive in a hybrid oh my God it's not going to perform well we'll was I I couldn't have been more wrong there was plenty of back see room for my ten year old if you have to um adolescent children yeah I'll say up to about you know teenager\nThere's enough room for a three four hour drive in the back seat and still have some comfort there is Bluetooth integration there is why integration into vehicles so you can um connect your wireless devices in the ...\nIs Bluetooth integration there is why integration in the vehicle so you can um connect your wireless devices in the vehicle you have satellite radio\nAnd so that keeps the little people entertain for the trip and an insight now as far as the driving position of this insight I found the seat to be really comfortable\nAnd it had one of the things that I have come to love and even expect out of vehicles these days and that is this a enhanced cruise control and what do I mean by enhanced will this cruise control you set the speed the distance from the car ahead of you that you want to keep and you can adjust how far you want to stay from the vehicle in front of you\nAnd you turn on the\nLane keep assist feature\nAnd only keep a speech is one of those things where once the vehicle reads the lines on the road and it's hard to incite when the inside reads the lives on the road\nThe vehicle attempts to keep the vehicle with in the two lines on the road so it keeps you ...\nOh you have to do is keep your hand on the steering wheel and this vehicle pretty much drives itself is not good are completely autonomous if you take your hand off the steering wheel for more than a few seconds you'll get an alert on the dashboard the driver must take control the we'll give them that it will turn the cruise control off that will give you all kind of\nAudible signal but it makes for a really relaxing dry so if you have a vehicle that has this you want to try it but in this two thousand Nineteen hundred insight that link keep assist worked\nWell it takes a lot of the driver fatigue away in speaking a driver for the there is a function of feature in this insight that monitors how long you been driving and money and let you know when you need to take a break\nSo you can set that up and it'll give you alert that tell you time to pull over time to take a break a time to switch drivers wanted one other thing that helps keep you safe or in the vehicle\nAnd have the parking assist program so it will help you get their vehicle into parallel parking spaces and traditional parking spaces so that if you are not the best job but you got a young driver learn to drive it will assist them\nIn getting their vehicle uh park the hand blind spot monitoring but hunter goes one step further in the inside\nWhen the driver serves on the right turn signal there is a camera is located in the right outside near that when you turn the single lone your center console turns into a monitor\nAnd it will then display what ever is on the right side of their vehicle so you're making the right time between the parallel park it shows you the curb it shows you anything on the right side of the vehicle it shows you have a bicycle is or a desperate is approaching\nWhich makes it safer for pedestrians on the role as whale I really liked that feature and you can also turn that feature for that a center console on just by pressing the end of your turn signal you could turn the camera on it\nAnytime this thing had but I said dad was cruise control\nCollision mitigation breaking which means if this vehicle noticed that you're about to be in a in an accident you're approaching another vehicle on object it will alert you and they will also activate the brakes and stop the car if you can't\nDo it like I said it had to like keep us is and
