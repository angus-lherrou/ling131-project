I'm In a different state than we normally get too so we like to try to be proactive in our effort\nAnd we want to talk to them but some of the things that they don't know probably necessarily get to talk about in schools um and the parents need to be educated as well we don't want anybody to go out of there I'm not feeling for if you will with information on things that they may not have known anything about 'em but excitement and it's free\nWalk us through the classes because this is about young people will come in a while there's always impressed with a million people come from every part of the city and really it's not just about Fulton County\nThis information is good for young people regardless of what counter they live in um talk about the classes that are going to be a part of this experience either one of you know\nI'm going to have three different work shots for the kids that first one with the law enforcement and youth interaction and gangs and understand that education system and so she etiquette and we're also going to have like a panel for the parents at a separate area\nMhm and those areas are important because a lot of time we see\nLaw enforcement and we've gotten to the point we have ever served relationship here but I think that all officers out there to a a breeze their rights just that that's not the case and those of us who advocated advocates on the other side clearly understand that and the one thing that the sheriff understand is the the key to building\nBetter community in police if you will law enforcement\nUm is engagement and interaction and so um what young people will see what they walk\nIn and they'll see a lot of people from share of department here but they're going to see people look if you took their uniform ... soccer mom that somebody's\nDaughter that somebody who went to school with us right ... ... and people need to know that y'all are just ordinary people who do extraordinary job in the in the professor you chose speaking to us now got to get the job is because I always ask because I like for people to understand uh I Know\nHey hey I'll get there\nA lieutenant that was I mean you you're lieutenant ... moved up in this why to talk about because girls will be there tomorrow exactly and they will look at you and perhaps they would say okay well I did not know that I could\nBe a lieutenant that I could be a one day perhaps leading this organization or or um what do you say to them about you know how you moved forward in your career both for your as women in in this sometime male dominated and sometimes it can be male chauvinists the profession\nWell it's all about um with me is um having integrity or being respectful and showing the kids you know how to be professional that you know it's more than one way to have a profession you know I Know\nA law enforcement is not looked up on one of the ... and I play in a case you have to have a passion to do it in order to do your job properly and so when we\nA law enforcement is not looked up on one of the toaster professions and that is laying a case you have to have a passion to do it in order to do your job properly and so when we you know a interact with especially young females you know we let them know like hey\nYou know focus on edge education you know is it just self um well in the community or law enforcement used to be a male dominated profession ... oh yeah\nBut now women are lead in Iowa and when they look at us I I have interaction with kids and the court house and all they want to do is you know they want to cut you right\nWe want to fill out a vast around it you know pond us at the end they always ask us about you know things that\nWe have done it they have what we have seen and things like that and we explained to them like we have a great time at work you know in our hardest part what I mean to them is seeing them\nCome through the mentors right does it ever get to you does it ever\nA such a sudden the\nPrice does it ever in your capacity work does bother you like dang when one was so many stopped coming in ...\nI'm at all the time and that's one of the reasons why on the share of stresses and you know per activity and engagement with us and she and I both have a passion for it passion for youth anyway so it's it's kind of Central Asia for us to engage them in the way that we do um and this is bittersweet sometimes early flight you know\nIf I can just reach one you know possibly you know they'll be able to tell somebody else that they were engaged by not only just the female a positive interaction with the law enforcement officer\nHave you ever just looked at one who came through the door and say girls were in the world\nAre known to know you don't need to be no limit is when you look at every ...\nEvery ... what happens on the third Wednesday of youth intervention program tell us about that it's kind of similar to beyond scares yeah\nWe're we're not trying to scare my whole goal is education showing the kids what life is like the ... in jail I'm In a courtroom said and and her and I a last minute\nAli we have more females than males to how to ... ... yeah now and go like you know no your word you know how you doing that you could be\nOr not they don't they ... right yeah it's okay to be a kid I was trying to grow up so fast and you know just be a young go down in a little while longer interest\nIn that you know with within law enforcement which happened to mentor ship and not even know it because the kids want to establish report with us and half the time it's like it's ... take my phone they really want to know what I'm doing this weekend so we built in ... in in relationships without even realizing without being forceful\nWithout any type of and they they put a badge aside and realize that we're we're human being\nYou know a one of our good friends say uh\nChildren how to put the the thing they do not care how much you know until they know how much you care absolutely and and uh that's a very very valid I won't come back would you tell us some of the people are going to be there you know I started off with you all they got ... and they want to get one\nNo it's not too late and we ask in um if you had it for you register we encourage everyone to be there tomorrow at seven thirty were not fool a we have enough faith will be in a lotta metropolitan state college jam area um registration gave the eighth grade program begins at eight thirty\nI saw it was going to be in the gym now I'd so you need to know if you know the campus um that you come to the main interests and you can follow it all we round the gym you'll see sitting up on top of the hill and I'm In once you give them they'll take you where you\nNeed to be law enforcement and you've interactions and gangs are gangs are very prevalent\nI'm I'm Still amazed I Know you'll see it right um give us a snapshot of what it looked like us is still the numbers that come in for and I think the latest a number I heard\nA either from the FBI or from um the county itself may been from the district attorney's office out over one hundred and forty or fifty identified gang of clicks that's operating in this city that's\nUnbelievable and and the anecdotal evidence we getting is they're recruiting as a young young as elementary and middle school\nYou also see that they use you all that bad to do like many counties segregate or gangs were in the population in yeah\nThat's a serious issue so you could do some serious conversation about that I'm understanding of the judicial system tell us some of the people who will be there do you all had had judges there before who come in and talk about okay before you come and see me this is kind of how the system work in a tub telling his too\nIt's where a man he's going to be there as well to give you information and Greg Street from us to a brother or ... or the one oh three or be there he's going to be a moderator for the um children's portion um we look for that you know you put that aside and\n... you know and are they hand you're saying I Will tell you if I were going to name a search through that can name one\nBetter than a grocery their brother puts his money resources time his talent in his energy I enter young people and I have a sit down at a board meeting for about five hours tomorrow so I'm a I'm a I'm a show up early and then about a so I Will be there at some point tomorrow morning I'm\nThe other things about other things uh every young person that comes can get a eight

ten or twenty first twenty first when he who arrived as well\nOkay well I'll be there some up oh sure there will just rely on a number of young people are\nYou know what I'm Talking about you all have separate just into do tracks which I really like ah 'cause sometimes children don't want to be authentic when mom was sent into that I have a ... or you get more out of them\nWill you cannot separate them and they can really just tell you what's going on because at the end of the day the do you want young people to leave their feeling empowered that they could see something say something right that they can know that there's something greater than jail waiting on them which is a message that we need to constantly\nA pop all the time to write a book talk about the parents because you all the kind of started really having a conversation about the ... prime responsibility parents have responsibilities children's as well\nYes and we noticed that along the way that I'm not only that we need to talk with the kids sometimes parents need help yeah I'm In one thing we gonna at in that his new this year is it mental health component yes I'm going to have a gas there from Chris one eighty

course\nAnd usually we keep the parents you know in the gym and and put the kids in the classroom we're going to do something different this year to make a little bit more fun and have the parents in the classroom is dead\nI'm very important very important because all of the stuff that we teach has it'd be reinforced at home and I was told you in the business that you know I've been mentor a long time and um the thing that is encouraging is that parents are calling now saying look I just need some help on done everything God no\nLong time and um the thing that is encouraging is that parents

am I missing about getting out the vote sometimes vote in a an obligation but the other so we do to create an army that we need people to take people to the polls what do you feed the people who work

person so is key it is critically important\nAnd a lot of it when we were talking about today with young brothers are they going to do a lot of money that's why the vote so important where that we're going to be allocated if you've got somebody to speak up on your\nBehalf yet you're more you know yeah well and\nAnd none of us are looking at that's why every year the first place they love the Congress look at the local uh years of traveling and the political movement\nThe first cut in education because education defenseless you know and and now you don't have any music in school you don't have any Jim in physical education in school and and that's why I feel that the kids are losing their lives they have nowhere to look that all the repressed energy yeah\nYeah and this is by design
