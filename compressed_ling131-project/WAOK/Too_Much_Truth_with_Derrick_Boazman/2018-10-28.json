afternoons from four until six we talk all things relationship and today it's all about my sister's feminism hills and sexuality and\nHow we got to this I had the pleasure of being on a cruise stole Jordan's\nShow that she a host on rolling out magazine and after I finished the show is called a reality check reality check and after I finished the shows she talked about a topic a topic that she thought\nThat would be good for this show in may be a part of it and after she mentioned what it was about feminine I'm helping sexuality and some other stuff in between that I'm like yes let's do the show\nAnd so that's how we got to this day I think her for coming today at first I think you for allowing me to be a part of your show 'cause You're welcome to show\nAnd why did you feel like it was important for me to no end for women to no end for us to bring the show to a loving relationships as\nWell um I I appreciate it the the idea that you actually we had great candid conversation and I think sometimes that's heart where we're in a a culture that is so driven towards being politically correct that we don't have like people we can go to just for real conversation and um\nWhen I was ... when I was doing the articles and actually get connected with Dr Lisa I I wanted to talk to some women that were ready to have a real conversation about this\nUm I talk to my girlfriends but these are not people that want to be talking in public and as a result we have a culture that women there's so much that we don't talk about in mixed company that we only talk about amongst friends and I just wanted to have one of those conversations on a public platform that other women would benefit from\nLet's roll back a little bit give us a little bit of background about you\n[noise] ah well I think most people probably I'm a public entertainment publicity here in Atlanta um my company's enchanted public relations and branding\nAnd I've done that for about ten years here but I'm also a writer and a rolling out upscale and some other magazines I write about women's issues I'm female empowerment and all that kind of goes together um so reality check was burst out of\nA mountain seats the in the work that I was doing and saying you know you should be having these conversations with women about relationships and you know it's easy for people to look at someone and say they're stupid but\nThere's we've all been there we've all done that and there's there's a science behind it and the only way that other women can benefit is if we\nSpeak about it you know what happened in the relationship what what was I thinking that that's how it was my psyche\nIt and the only way that other women can benefit is if we\nSpeak about it you know what happened in the relationship what what was I thinking if that's how it was my psyche like you know at that time so that was the purpose of reality check and um you were an amazing gas you gave the real real honest and from ... you know a advice to some of the questions that we got an eye on relationships the show\nYou a thank you for having me and thank you again for being here and there you are responsible for this other special guest Dr Lisa are being here so you make the introduction and uh [laughter] I'm going to anchor after you finish\nWell I'm a doctor or Lisa underscore the body Snatchers right after you are familiar with her on Instagram is absolutely amazing she was a part of a an event that we did earlier this year for female empowerment and has\nUm a great way of being able to be honest with women\nShe's a plastic surgeon and we expect a lot of plastics are just to be over the top but I Love Dr Lisa because she's so honest and she's so\nYou can tell that she's definitely got her girl power going on but she's able to do it in a professional way and I think that that is refreshing because you can get great information you know from her um there's a lot going on with plastic surgery and there's a lot of things that people don't know and I think having people like Dr Lisa it'd be a part of these conversations is so important and\nSo I've visited her um 'cause she has a something that she's going to talk about today and we talked about a feminine health in this new a fashionable rejuvenation procedure that she does\nAnd I thought that she would be a great a person to come on and talk real talk again because that's how she does it but she also keeps acute and she also realizes that you know as women we have a right to look the way we want to look and and the other we want to feel and she can help all of us get there so it no further do thank you so much Dr Lisa for joining us [noise]\nAre so so much for thank you for having me on the show it's pleasure\nAs always wonderful to talk to people about them in and help\nAnd about what I Do in plastic surgery and uh when I practice every day which is just empowering women letting them get to know who they are and where they want to be and for me it's very important as a plastic surgeon\nAnd really as a woman is to really help the person I Know who they are and empower them ultimately and sold them in and tell us when I talked about that and are there lots of issues you know for all of us\nYou know the low our waist line or\nSomething we don't really talk about ... um we develop very early then we're in our childbearing years in Denver Post menopausal before we know it you know that twenty Thirty years goes by very very fast mhm and uh\nNow with the advent of people looking at themselves in assessing themselves and trying to be the best they can be\nI'm just thankful that women are turning it on to themselves and deciding that I Want to feel better when I'm having sex\nAnd I think ... said it was broke after she had her baby [laughter] you know I'm not you know that old but it doesn't resonate with me like something is very different after you had to be ... and it was wonderful her for her to see that because it actually puts it out there is an issue\nAnd you know that's why\nCrystal came to visit me that's why they're there are different technology out there\nTo just make women feel better\nAbout the sexual experience you know throughout her whole life and I'll talk about more details and we'll get into that but thank you for having me it's wonderful that we're talking about this\nOne of the lady that I Know is bold she'll talk about it no matter what play she's on ... station\nThank you for having me it's wonderful that we're talking about that\nOne of the lady that I Know it's bold she talked about it no matter what play she's on ... station she's ... wherever she is that if you ask her questions she's going boldly to give you an answer and that is my girl run to hide Wanda thank you so much for your own uh what was that day I call it that can you come to\nBestow and talk about sex while she was like sure yes ma'am [laughter] wanting to give him a little bit about yourself All right\nSo I own a consulting firm called let's talk El Al see we celebrate twenty five years in business this year we are a boutique human resources from but I also am a coach\nOr I wouldn't call myself a life coach more of a business cards but you know you can't call somebody on business and I dig into their lives and the speaker I run my mouth but the thing I'm most proud of is that I'm a mentor of some phenomena women and just published my first book I'm [laughter]\nI'm really excited I was nervous about doing this but it's called take the lessons and leave the baggage stories of a solo per newer being released a next month November seventh thing\nSo does to leave the EU heard from\nDr Adrian at fifty one a crystal at forty three around at fifty five me at fifty seven if at deep steel at the top of the list but I'm married to a sixty year old who is not at the same level\nThat I Am at nature feel very very very important so if all three of us came into your office and said that it was important to us but we still need a little bit more enhancement what will your a conversation then be\nSo if you're in my office I'm going to stay on the professional level so now that we're talking on the radio I'll tell\nYou what's going on [laughter] so what goes on in my head is like all righty then\nBecause I understand so I'm being in control and knowing what you want it may not happen to your older\nBut it's something that I really love to talk about and um it's very important I'm fifty five and sex is very important to me mhm um I have a nice spot and I know where it is is that these things so it'd be ... and\nAnd they have to look for that place um but there's technology now that makes that sensitivity all over ... which is on another level obviously mhm and um when you talk about sexuality you know there's definitely sects than involves the mail but there's also masturbation do you have to kind of really opened things up\nAnd the thing of it is for African American women and for women we don't even look below the waist line I think probably over the last Fifteen Years we started shading\nAnd then you had different patterns of shades and look and see you know that's interesting we got this kind of line and that kind of lime yet this pattern down there um and then um as I looked at people I notice that they're\nThe lip so let's just talk a little better than that and you know we have people coming from different age groups were going to have different issues because we have women who perhaps have never had sex or had sex and they weren't ... they weren't supposed to have sex that they need Hyman repair ... as opposed to Sylvia version\n... then you have a woman who is younger has been born with very large lips that you have the outer lips and the inter lips\nThat lady and the euro and the lady a Menorah and they frame The Vagina and they frame that are ... and then you have the G spot behind clutter is like in the ... canal and behind it at the top\nSo that when you roll will have a problem probably with something that's kind of genetic you know her lips one side may be bigger than the other she may have um her inner lip kind of for shooting outside of the outer limits and she's uncomfortable with it um and with\nYou know the Internet now you know it normally when you know what you would like to look like ... you know what you would like to look like so they'll come in at twenty saying this is not what I Want I don't I shouldn't have a large lips on the inside and then when you've had a baby then you know everything has changed a whole\nUm you know geography down their change you've got the lips that or lose you got the lips that look older now ... body they'd been stretched out\nAnd then you have The Vagina which is you know almost gaping at times um you can have um ah the Harlem like little ... of the of the floor which is bulging so do you have all this asymmetry it's an even doesn't look as they get extra tissue or so\nThe floor which is bulging so you have all this asymmetry it's an even doesn't look as they get extra tissue\nOr so and then as you get older and things get even you know there are other issues things start to become drier you don't have all the lubrication on do you make hop and have a little accident\nSo though that's the range of things that I'm Talking and thinking about as I see people depending on their age Mm but what I Do know\nIs that it takes a lot for women to come to a doctor and talk about that because you have such a wide range of care providers out there you have lasted surgeons yeah G. Y. N. doctors you had your own kind of colleges yeah family practice doctors\nAnd then you have like ... you know people who just put doctors trying to do to stop mhm so I knew it I Know it takes a lot to find me and then it takes a lot just to come and I listen to the background noise of your family ... inner self doubt\nSo I'm I'm always very upbeat and that Michael okay what what what you want you know I'm trying to get your head to make you feel comfortable because I Know it's very relevant and what's important is to fix that thing that comes through the door mhm if you come in and you say oh my gosh my\nQuestion then and I didn't want to interrupt then how old are you know and ladies if this is something that you know you can ask is well how do you know if the physical side of you is affecting the mental side or your aggression to ... you know being able to perform in has six\nHow do you know that I mean I that I mean that I don't know see that's\nWhat I mean so first of all I think some women never use it die for it right that you never use a dying man you don't even know what it looks lay down their exact right uses diaphragm you got position yourself\nLook down there and I think it's like maybe we need five percent of one of four women use a diaphragm at Seventy five percent of the population and don't let them take a pill or they get into our plan or something like that but um what happens is if you're a probably a after having children or if you're post menopausal\nYou'll have dryness you may have um irritation you may have more um uh you may also have more yeast infection that's how you know the problem down ... ... of ways I\nFor for a nine to two seven three dots Alisa Christmas joy dot to Adrian run to Hi Joyce of tell we're all in here talking about them in the hills and sexuality if you have a question we open forward for for eight nine to two seven oh three will be back on loving relationships are news and top Thirteen eighty W A L K\nLike us on Facebook at loving relationships questions or comments loving relationships with joy so we talked for\nHeroin mixed promises but all it really does take heroin can take your job your house your family maybe even your life\nYou Sarah one once and you can get hooked is it correct to crisis dot com to find a treatment center near you that's curb the crisis dot com\nRight now with the Home Depot select special order Anderson windows patio doors are very easy to get into their Fifteen Percent off ... quality in a low price [laughter] neither you nor your whole have to wait for an upgrade\nSo now's the time getting into the Home Depot because this could be the opening you've been waiting for a select Anderson windows a patio doors ... percent off Coney at the Home Depot or saving ...\nFell through October ...\nThis Halloween you can find treats for everybody at Walgreens like the very princess of only likes get cats or the superhero\nThe all new radio dot com app is available now it's a totally new experience that I was sitting at your fingertips we made it easier than ever to access the radio stations you love now will save your favorite stations and\nOthers to you based on your list and I get the news and information you rely on even when you are near radio you can take this station when you're on the go\nDownload the all new radio dot map on your smartphone\nAnywhere\nAnd ... do you need help me with the learning and your relationship to be able to you know the answer you're\nPaying ... mother in relationships which was\nI'm Joyce let me tell you you know how to communicate your knees actively are you looking for a mentor or Mitch right loving relationships his own lazy joy\nCenter special guests every early night living relationship which is\nMissing Thirteen eighty W.

secrecy\nAnd a lot of times for women we are not having conversations about the fact that yes we desire and we are attracted to a certain person because we've been conditioned not to that's what

and go ... if they weren't the marriage can\nBecause those are the ones that you have and all that far with yeah and then so there's this stigma attached to his like crystal say there's a stigma attached to women who enjoy sex and enjoying sex is natural and normal and healthy it just depends on how we're condition from our youth in our upbringing but I Want to say one\nOther thing because I work in being an entertainment publicist I've had a chance to work with some of these women that one in particular and I won't say who she is she's someone that you know has a very overtly sexual image right\nAnd you would think that she's you know very very sexual when you get with her alone in a room she actually very shy so I think our sexuality is you sometimes against us but we have not taken control of its so sometimes those guys that those women that men are saying oh I I even talked to strippers\nThat were not comfortable actually having sex intimately that mean she's not really have a piece of her body she just is using her sexuality but your sexuality and who you are sometimes can be very different things\nIt can be and a lot of times a woman's desire for love causes her to

W E okay [noise]\n\n\n\nAnd you would play that Janet Jackson anytime anyplace on the conversation light the ball for eight Ninety two seven three let's go to the phones ... guinea and yuan\nThank you for taking my call peace and blessings to you and your guest I Believe this is one of the most powerful subjects that you could ever have on radio\nNo\nAbsolutely first of all I Believe is vitally important for our son to understand\nOr have some knowledge of the woman's anatomy because what isn't exposed and explain that the sexual or fish it's also a location where waste comes from the body the how writing of the woman's box it ... the\nAnd time is a I don't believe there's been any other time in history where it's been emphasized as much and yet\nAlso this is an area where waged comes from the sexuality way\nYou're down in a guinea and what are you talking about I was so excited to hear get in there and I'm about to explain greatly temp do it quickly please\nWhat I'm coming to\nIs our sons understanding that\nLet me give you one example I only steaming have you heard of that\nWhat is it I only see me yeah are you saying ...\nWell it's pronunciation tomatoes tomatoes Yani steaming\nIt it is used ... for the cleansing internally of a woman's rational or this\nAnd I believe that if men young boys and men were educated more on the women's anatomy they will make more proper choices it's like going into a mall when you go to a mall you see all these businesses that are trying to invite you into the business well\nHaving the relationships are developing relationships is like that it five sons have been educated to the point where they not only understand the level\nAnd had been educated to the point where they not only understand the level of the females allowed to make them understand their ... their ability to part she was saying the educated about it then you can have more\nEducated conversation not based on just the\nPhysical attraction but what's going on in the woman's my and I think a lot of sexually transmitted diseases\nWould not be transmitted because young men out here without knowledge they're going from ... holiday ball and what they see all social media and they have not been trying\nAs to how they should understand a woman's anatomy so I Believe also some chi elements that out I haven't heard you guys talk about [noise] got a vitally important in developing good relationships\nUnderstanding the existence and continuation of those relationships and understanding caught me and bring to the table 'cause we have the total package the woman is wanting us to come and the parks and be involved in her enterprise if you will but a man is already complete\nRight what does that sound like they may get in and said that there's some instruction is necessary because of the fellows don't know that that's what I took from that statement I Know that when I get that but I bet\nHe definitely was clear in saying that men are complete and basically don't need to women and women are ... and and need them but I it's funny that he says I because I Know more women that are older\nThat are single and are happy and live in very still alive and men that are trying to get a woman a very confused about why they can't get it on line to want to be with them at that age so I I think that everybody brings something to the table um but looking at it that way is one of the reasons that we have problems like this you know and\nMight not be value if we educate our our young ladies and educate ladies period\nThen then they'll understand more about themselves Ryan and their needs and desires in once and and and then it's getting in and you all as men's response of men responsibility to educate these men we have to know ourselves for that [laughter] yeah\nI Want to say something to get in and did you hit that said that the bass themselves to hit that\nAre these mass that you did it surprise and they have herbs and they help 'em cleaned The Vagina but I Want to tell people that everyone has a certain body odor so when he gets a certain level you have to do something\nI'm as as far as you hit a steam bath they feel good um but they're more for pleasure which is still going to have a body odor and there's nothing wrong with that and men are not complete without someone to be known to say that\nMen have all the equipment you definitely don't have the mental engagement though if you're totally complete I guess it'd be complete with a dog\n[laughter] and men can't give birth yeah you can have a baby with a uterus yeah filter through other means besides the rate cannot [laughter] reverse that right away around so I take issue with the complete thing I think you need a part of it but it in it but\nThank you getting for definitely responding and and listening to our conversation because it's a conversation that we need to have men have to understand that women have sexual desires\nAnd any at all at all ages\nAnd um we're talking about and you know how we improve our response to sex\nAll at all ages ... and um we're talking about and you know how we\nImprove our response to sex by um applications you spot application masturbation penetration and um you know this discussion today is about you know really looking at things below the waist line and making sure things are\nHappening in the way you want them to happen and you want them to look the way you want to look because there's also a society now some people are saying that women are getting too much surgery down there ... and the question is where these people were saying that because of the clients are very very satisfied\nAnd what it is it's a cultural shift when there's a cultural shift sometimes people feel that women are being too forward maybe too demanding and um it can lead to insecurities but we have to remember that men have had to blue pills for some time\nMhm and we have had nothing mhm\nSo this is a conversation and if we take a little longer to get to orgasm you have to be patient\nThey're good relationships that can be built by being patient and it's definitely more fulfilling for men thinking that he is complete probably not the best way to go into a relationship mhm\nAnd you you know I Want to just chime in on what you said in terms of orgasms because men have to recognize that women\nWe are wired so much differently from them and so it's like you said sex for us starts in the mind it is mental and so if you are not stimulating a woman's mind it's going to probably be a lot challenging to stimulate her physically mhm and when it comes to orgasms\nA lot of guys have experienced women who are faking orgasms and so they get to a real real woman\nWho they are trying to connect with and don't understand why it's taking so long and it's because you had some other experiences where people were being dishonest and they were yelling and screaming and care at all and making you think you would do with them when you were not why is\nAh masturbation a a an important piece a in a set in a woman being a satisfy herself for being satisfied\nBut you have to remember that most of the time we think about masturbation all the pictures and things you see on the Internet things are usually a man mhm very rarely do you see a picture of a woman masturbating\nAnd you have to remember that really being sexual sexually comfortable with yourself in that area is a huge thing for women because they don't look down there to begin with um when you say literate to some\nPeople don't like well what's ... we know the clearest is very important and then there's the G spot if you have ... or a sensitive area\nThat particularly that what a mess I'll be more I ask you again can you maintain yourself in a relationship with two guys that are clean sex ... that are satisfying you greatly sexually\nWithout without feeling that you need to let one of them go because you're uncomfortable with\nNot understand okay if a man can do it a woman can do it okay\nI don't want it or how they are\nAlso women out there at heart and so the alpha girls are like bring it on so I understand your question because perhaps you hadn't met a woman who can deal with that but uh they're out there they are out there out\nThere were way way way there's no don't don't make any assumptions here I'm just this isn't a decision about me I just happened I'm listening to you guys talk about sexuality so I just kind of want to have a friend\nThat I had a dream and the answer to your question is there are women out there who can handle it what about your that answered that anger [laughter] that's not that's how I mean that's not that's not what I Choose to do is try and write write\nThat if they ... anyone anyone just like a ... a woman can take money from both men she can take sex from book that if she wants to it just depends on what your goals are are you know what I mean so I think a lotta times men will get a confusing things that we can't do something because we choose not to do but let me\nLet me in interest the time 'cause I ... I'm looking at the clock does the background that question I have a girlfriend January ... who is not any way anywhere near flew she ever been in our lifetime wearing the same age bracket is you crystal\nAnd she started having sex we want to do and she did a lot anybody she started having sex with nothing to do if she told me that she was having the best sex you ever had a life between two guys\nDo and she did a lot anybody she started having sex with nothing to do if she told me\nThat she was having the best steaks you ever had like the twenty two guys\nAnd then she started having problems with having sex with two guys satisfactory saint who got satisfactory sex would say two guy 'cause he felt like she needed to be with one or the other and I just thought it was I thought it was amusing because nationally she was cool with it\nBut then as a kept rolling she started becoming a comfortable with it in the sex became less satisfied word not to deal because she she was wire\nWell it is wired just being with one\nRight is that like you said why is how women are taught and we're taught that sex is something that we should look at in terms of loving relationships and for us to just have physical enjoy that there are some women that\nHave that are that are have awake and then realized that we have a right to do that as well but for many women I and I guarantee you this there are men that are sleeping with\nSeveral women at one time and the and the and the women all know right and the winner okay with it but if a woman were to tell to men that she was sleeping with both of them men at first they oh you're a nasty you're all something's wrong with you because men men are the ones that create this environment that make women feel like if they're able to have sex with two minute time\nThere's something wrong with them but in the same token they will let us know very clearly an openly which we should all be that they're able to enjoy sex and everything with numerous went out at a time so I think that\nWe're women have we're just under under the the the oppression of the way Mitt doesn't apply to set up for men\nSo I got a group which is good or bad if it's good what you said if it's bad which you say it to the man yes yes of course at this stage in life\nAnd I all I have a high end stage\nIn life yeah or I might not say anything with me this lady and they're looking at you know you go to a an indicator yeah you know but yeah no no faking it this boy and I I Am a fake or I Will admit I make my I I I'm getting I'm\nGetting there I'm coming to the point where our mothers it'll never you'll never have to get what you want ... which I don't know [laughter] right but you go to the sequel I've gone to the club because I got it all it back but a lot of times I'm telling you when you're when you guys know men men are\nVery very um fragile and the situation a lot of times they will turn it around to flip it on you if any even if you're even if they feel like you're not having an orgasm as quickly as they\nFeel like other women have because the other half fake then they say oh well if something wrong with you\nYou know what I mean I've never experienced that and and I guess that's a good thing I'd ever experienced the guy if anything they go hard or trying\nTo figure out you know they'll need what do you need me to do what do you want me to do it while I I've not experienced anybody trying to turn it around and making about me some\nAsian dynamic but [laughter] and I say something real quick yeah thing I Know we moved on but tied the other thing is she is probably fallen in love with one of those men she got emotions as she's\nFeeling guilty about getting one in both now\nI don't think that she ... she's incapable like Dr Lisa say\nThere are alpha women who can do it have done and continue to do it but she has called films from one of those guys the would no longer feels good to her to be dealing with the other one that's my take\nOn than last time you have to remember that you know she's handling two men maybe do something else on the horizon work maybe she didn't dishes maybe her career has developed\nResilient and see your doctor leading the down [laughter] you know move on so she died and they probably something else or ... not very you talk about I'm seeing clients and uh one\nThey probably something else winning or ... ... American Dr berry you talk about I'm seeing clients and uh one of the questions I think a doctor leads to ask you first\nWas the top three are concerned that the couples or men or women per se have what are they are usually\nIt's from a man and I'm One of the things that they talk about is not having enough sex the second thing is about the positioning and not having enough diversity in the sexually experienced with their partner and then the third thing is about not having oral sex and so what I\nOr or not having oral sex I'm In the manner that they would like to be able to have it um something that they may have experience with someone else or something that they probably read and heard about on the Internet that the possibility and so what I always say to the couples is that if you start\nWith your communication and everybody's talking about what they what it is that they desire\nAnd what they are looking for then you are on the road to a healthy sexual relationship\nBut if it's one person coming to the table with an expectation all my Mary guys said that they thought that was they said I'd do it was gonna be unlimited thing and I said really that's what you thought the all knew was going to provide\nBut that is what they think and so you got to have those conversations with your mate so that you will know what you are out there communicating your expectations and that person is able to talk about their\nSo when I return ladies I Want to ask you what do you desire when it comes to six or eight nine to ... to seven or three movies\nLike us on Facebook at loving

I Want to say a little later about the way it is this as a ... situation kind of kind of mushrooms with brothers you know for a fact some of us know that if somebody put their hands on our daughter's\nAin't no telling how that thing only and whale y'all know is not going to NYU\nAnd I'm I'm just being honest with you but so we got to figure out how for our personal and I know it might sound a little selfish but if our personal wellbeing we've got to figure out how to do something about these problems because if someone puts their hands on our daughter's brothers you know many of us are going to be ...\nMany of us are inclined to put our hands on their Bennett said in a W H that's not the position of W. A. okay I Want to get that out there W A L K is not advocate in and I'm just tell me what I think is a a very common natural\nResponse that brothers we have we got to do something about that um because we when I say something about that the whole idea of the violence ... because it's a danger to the entire\nThat brought us we have we got to do something about that um because we when I say something about that the whole idea of the violence ... because it's a danger to the entire community and I'm telling you we're going to get into this on the other side of the ... I got you Lester with me\nI got power with me and I have you with me as a community and I want you I Want you to you you got a call somebody\nYou gotta call somebody you've got an email you got to get 'em involved give him tell them they can download the radio dot com app you know and when they do that then they can actually listen to the gist of the matter with doctors in it and and they can be a part of this conversation let me give you the number now\nSo that you can have a four zero for eight and nine to two seven zero three four four eight nine to\nTwo seven zero three and you have them listen you know some young ladies who are away in college tell them they need to download this this episode and this that the radio dot com back and listen to what we're going to talk about today your sons are way in college and\nAnd a part of um or goat in that trend has really tried to influence how we see the issue of of intimate\nAll across the country or across the globe and a part of um or golden that trend has really tried to influence how we see the issue of of intimate partner violence particularly male on gay swim in rehab and intervention program for men who\nConvicted or sometimes at least fifty percent of the men are self referred to twenty four week program as if I'm divine intervention program certified by the state of Georgia for men who\nIdentify they have a problem and wanted to do something about it there's a space for that kind of transformative work and that includes some yeah some time high school students by the way and college students and adult men so that's one of the programs we have in some number those are some of the programs I Want one highlight tens of me\n... back in Grand Rapids Michigan I Am from the Caribbean I came to the United states through\n... through Michigan ... that's where um I had a ... a a family member live and so that's how I ended up in the state of Michigan okay particularly Grand Rapids\nAnd that was a family therapist after grad school I was a family therapist at the YWCA comes in center there working primarily on issues of incest mhm and we had about ... intervention program and the person who was doing it when he passed my supervisor said I Want you to take over that\nProgram initially I I'm not sure I wanted to do that\nBut it has to doing it I later realized you know in some ways that wasn't an accident that I ended up doing that called very few things that accident that was the universe the creator work yeah right right ... to that word because it was it sells in my family I grew up witness in\nFamily violence ... among many family members physically and otherwise violated women in the most are the ways you could imagine so there was a personal aspect to it in addition to the professional aspect\nWow wow it you know when I hear you talk about what you're doing with men uh stopping violence I'm reminded of a program\nUm when I was in graduate school of an advantage in Nashville, Tennessee that I work with is called the peace program it was a program to a bit of program to end abusive counseling and education and what did they admit it actually was a centered around me who were involved in domestic abuse and they use this power and control we'll hear\nAs a basis to talk about a remedy these uh these these situations in generally the maid who were in these programs were there because\nUm they were on the verge of being put in jail and they had the option of going through the peace program or actually a serving some time in in jail there in in Nashville, Tennessee but my question though is um\n[noise] I'm Wondering just how different um ... what the relationship between men stopping violence me in terms of your program areas were just back to the peace program let me let me say that another way with the peace program we ... it wasn't really\nAnd see I'm not the expert in this area just said you some questions that\nI don't know if the peace program was framed or designed in such a way to speak specifically to the black community and my question is men stopping violence and and I know just a broad term mean it it's it's inclusive of all s ness cities I guess that's the best way to put in\nBut do you all take a particular interest um in in speaking to issues in the black community in the black in our in our culture that I'm\nMight account for\nThis problem and even our findings particular kinds of um opportunities in the black community that positions you all to put together strategy so is it is it is it is is it is a cultural specific\nThe um opportunities in the black community that positions you all to put together strategy so is it is it is it is is it is a cultural specific in some kinds of ways that's what I'm asking\nI Would say yes okay while you're correct that um we work with all men men of all ethnicities we're very very intentional about looking at the issue of of um you could be\nAfrican American communities ... for a number of reasons um because yes there are unique dynamics histories than on for a black folks mhm and um all ethnicities within you know a black community\nAnd particularly because most of 'em the men sent to a program\nCome through the criminal justice just okay and so when we're dealing with the criminal justice system of course race matters class matter absolutely because there's over representation of black folks in the criminal justice issue already because we're any more violent because it's just a manifestation of a race citizen\nSo we see an opportunity there to really educated and to challenge\nThe criminal justice system about the\nThe uh in equities and the ways in which I'm over police in for example of communities of color particularly back communities and so yes it really matters to bring an analysis that has um that factors in race and class yeah and the unique history is a black folks and how that is showing up in the work\nBecause you know we know bottom line to this day\nThe the body meant as as as predicted by media or the wife of ... of criminality is the black body ... Batman and so we have an opportunity when we're dealing with this issue to really come to that narrative and to also she moved to a news to say\nHey we got some real issues within our own communities we need to be dealing with them from that standpoint that you know that is really unique to us so yes\nWow that's that that that is great but uh you Lester not listen\nWhen we come back on the other side we want to hear from professor Tara home and she's on the talk with us about this whole business of of of\nWomen and the whole the statistics and get it some of the empirical kinds of research that we're going to drop on because I Want to talk about this business of of men perpetrating violence against young women and I want to really get at this thing about this stuff happening in our high schools and then there's stuff happening on our college campuses\nHas got to be dealt with hey y'all don't go anywhere tell somebody hey you got here but you got to hear this what we're about to get into the news and talk radio Thirteen eighty W A L K the force of the community\nOf foreign aid to teach of an unusual talked Thirteen W.
