to this to this day you know but it's almost like a sense of relief you know\nI don't know I don't know why even went there but it is it's uh I'm staring or impacting for me\nMhm and so on and on the spot 'cause I'm just going to be myself you know so y'all don't mind no no that's what I Want to be this way of\nYou know so so anyway so\nBecause I'm just going to be myself you know so y'all don't mind no no no I wouldn't have to be the best way of\nYou know so so anyway so I was arrested you know pregnant I was four and a half months pregnant and I'm like the prison but moving aside rolling on a sidebar\nUm\nWho sneezes I'm OK I'm OK but you know every now and then you know when I tell my story I tell them with with all the feeling that goes with it and I don't know if that's good or bad but I just you know that's where I'm at today so\nUm but I I went to prison\nAnd I'll just carry the story I I went to prison and I believe the whole time that that dog was going to vindicate me that\nSo the whole time I was in prison I was waiting to go home\nSo when people would send me stuff\nYou know I Would get so much stuff and I would mail at home you know because I knew I was going home mhm\nSo that I Would tell my kids and everybody you know I'll be there\nYou know any time you know your one year to year five years eight years\nYou know ten years twelve years I'm Still believing that no you couldn't tell me that I wouldn't want home I took parenting classes\nYou know how to write to college classes and learn everything that they had in the prison out the choir director I did everything that the president's basically had to offer I took like Ninety percent of everything and so it yet still preparing to go home\nYou know believe in for that mirror so so I got to stay focused 'cause I don't want to take it into the priests we stand on the domestic violence died so\nBut\nI kept telling them I'm going to get a fat from the government\nAnd sure enough a fax came and you know the lord opens the door and I and I came home and then eventually a governor Arnold Schwarzenegger gave me a pardon but while I was incarcerated you know there was some support groups\nThat they had and the first one was in about Nineteen Ninety\nNinety One Ninety two laws or changing for a domestic violence that's when they first came up with the term battered women syndrome which is now called intimate partner battery\nBut it was initially calls about women's syndrome and so we had a support group called convicted women against abuse and so I became a part of that organization that gives me\nAnd in that group you know women we talked about there are situations and it was it was so strange because\nThat you are with us and I'm so thankful that we have this opportunity to hear your story I'm\nAs Dr Bennett and I were talking earlier we talked about how difficult it is sometimes to tell that story and the triggers that it evokes and so thank you for your story a thank you for sharing with\nThe um the ... yeah\nDomestic violence as you described it is a pattern of a assaulted in cursive behavior and I emphasize that that word pattern\nBecause it's a pattern of behavior that is inflict that upon intimate partners and as a result\nIntimate partners is now the turn that she used most often because it indicates that intimate violence can occur
