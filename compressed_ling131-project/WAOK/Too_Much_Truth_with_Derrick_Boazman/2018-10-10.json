be could be on the standing or helping develop my character and they all are and I'm I'm much better of a person more of a lead it and I was when I first got here last year\nThey are many things that

bring a rather than ... from all across from all ages all walks of life they all like to come back home\nAnd uh what message do you have from your office from the president's office\nTo the people who are going to be coming back to Mars brown and we're getting ready to run down\nThe schedule of events ways for people to get involved because we don't want to just come back depart own yard we won't be able to do the ... there is still need the help these students are there that need our support um what what message do we have this year but those who will be coming back\nA message to our alumni we are ... alum now own little world um but they all have connectivity were trying to come back in a come back and re new friendships and my message to them is that uh we we have\nAs you indicated it come on the yard those five or six thousand people that come on the out of everybody just broke fifty dollars ... make a big difference and trying to help these young people that have\nScholarships and financially as we worked wars regaining accreditation so I Hope that the message that goes out across the country for this coming home come in two thousand Eighteen\nOr that we need to begin to really make a concerted effort to make certain that we can take out place rightfully where we need to be with respect to all of the other institutions that have accreditation that are thriving and working toward being more transformational and that's what we're trying to have more\nBrown eyes and people can give now one of the things I tell people all the time that Mars brown just does not belong to the moms\nIs rich history or suggested it is rooted in the struggle of black people for self determination right on that in his own institution that was founded by black people stress expressly for the purpose of educating black people in Georgia and so\nIt is deep roots is rooted not just in the loans but in those who understand that that legacy or has two must and should\nHave a right to continue as right over whether you're on the line but not you you know wherever you are you can go to Mars brown dot edu is that the easiest way you'll see donate link on there that's where you can click it even as we are talking\nAnd say you want to put your fifty a hundred five hundred thousand whatever you can do a into this institution because\nI'm now we're how many years removed from the absolute loss of accreditation at school is still\nThere last accreditation and two thousand and three in the spring of two thousand and three allows the appeal of but we have to remain open them in years later if the students sometimes with six to ... for the students but we stayed open\nAnd or the ... part of the thing about that as we have to stay open if we want to keep the asses right and so now we need to recognize as tablets to move forward let's let's let's help each other less will get ourselves out of this whole and worked was\nMaking certain that Mars brown can become stable again\nTalk about a little bit about it and they were going to go to schedule I'm a Mars brown as you you mentioned the um\nThe rivers in their claws and Mars grounds lend lease agreement with Atlanta University I'd always remind people the history Mars ... sits on the original campus of Atlanta University in fact the first president I Believe of Atlanta University bear read outside of fountain high right\nAnd so in that land disagreement it was if Mars round ever cease to be an educational facility than the proper revert back to Atlanta University\nOr six six six a successor and isn't in this instance Clark Atlanta University of Mars brown is always and will always maintain a a educational of a facility or to make sure that is always educating students on that property\nIs right and has and that's why we all just into two wars being able to be focused on making certain we can keep their stoops and open and continue to work towards the stabbed us in our rightful place with all the other they use in the schools\nAnd it's it's certainly needed now one today some traction some movement um I've been watching with some some um some interest the movement around the historic significance\nMars brown still boast a although one building is now in the hands of invested ... what we don't know what will happen that gains hall or that burn but the preservation community step forward and said it would be an absolute travesty given this\nUh this building history to allow that building to be raised in sold the building is still standing with a lot of conversation around\nA reclamation there how do you deal with that a fountain\nAt a fountain hall perhaps one of the most historic buildings\nIn Georgia sit at the highest point a elevation in the city\nUm you know what what is what is a conversation around around to know what I wanted but I don't\n... yeah I Want the same national park service or they have taken finds out of the operating budget to support and getting a a an assessment done by one of the leading our tax in Atlanta\nThey have used their money while doing assessments to make certain that we can find out exactly what it will take to rehabilitate bound and how\nWe also applying for a grant that will help us with that uh with that effort to to be able to make certain that we can restore fountain hall and and and and not lose is lost is somewhat like what happened to the games all in order to do that you have to have partners\nThe national Park Service has stepped up and they are one of our partners and we look forward to that or to continue to socio\nMen as tremendous right and that's bugs around a lot of resources right\nOff for a night to to seven zero three one will come back\nUm is the kids will let you help us walk through the schedule tell us all done at what's going to be having the end and tell us um you bought your responsibility ... brown is to look for bright and bridges students just
