Don I'm good how are you sir early voting [laughter] for\nThat question for you know you're you're talking about a lot about a car insurance and stuff uh-huh\nSo like I'm going to New York and I've written out a car out using my capital one credit card because they provide insurance for you you know right what's the pros and cons of a\nYou know using my tractor a rental car credit you know insurance costs to buy the nine dollars they insurance with the budget around\nWell so I always tell people not hurt Clark Howard this is where I got this information from a friend of mine was telling people if you have the insurance on your credit card\nYou that insurance and your credit card I though recently have started using also going ahead and buy their insurance and that's because I'm I'm not as frugal as I probably should be\nThe reason I buy the insurance when I rent a car is because when you turn their car back you know I don't care what's wrong with that you just walk away and has done is no deductible no nothing is just over if you pay for health insurance we are calling calling here last week\nWho um had rented a car insurance company had rented her vehicle because her vehicle had been involved in a car accident and it was in the body shot she took the car back they found a scratch on the car and now she's been dealing with that for a couple of weeks now about they want her to pay for this damage that was under that car\nSo according to Clark Howard if you're unsure if your credit card provides insurance that should be sufficient I just always err on the side of caution and I use a little double and I are purchased the insurance when I bark when I rent a car just because I don't want to deal with that part later\nOn down there it's not like let's say I I did have an actual somebody rather than doing the right uh-huh that hurt my ... it'll be crying for me right so what that hurt my credit rating\nNo 'cause it 'cause that's not so confident than go against your credit\nUm 'cause what's going to have your insurance company ... what's your what's your credit card company does they have their own insurance what you're doing you just paying a premium on it but it doesn't account gives you a den account get in kind of get your credit card and kind of get your payment ... if it if an accident happens\nThey will file a claim through your credit card companies insurance company and they'll have to have nothing to do with your credit card bill from that point\nOh good okay that's right that's what I wanted to know\nI Know from ... there must be Kevin wrecking people's car new\n... I'm getting my driver's license back over here slowest thing on a road in\nNew York [laughter] All right ... ... are you\nTo Mars uh that's going to get Mart or taught allow for more than ... euro good morning\nStill argue to Mars or let's go ahead and get Mart a toddler for more than ... euro good morning\nI think It's MORNING asked me in the afternoon I better\nTell you what it was like [laughter] a reference to the Amish earns yes smart move man I Want my kid do a rental car right in front of me not been on\nVideo he would rent a car company would have made and responsible for it she\nThought she was ... she thought she was can his his car the ... and you get information\n'cause there's people that there's people that are really dumb stuff that people would do in your car and just keep moving by accident and then you've got to pay in a rent a car company you know damn business damn business um ran out nice looking cars they don't want to messed up\nAnd you know what's sad is a lot of time you know I I hear my parents' day is a whole I guess old term say to people with penny wise and pound foolish you know you go you're trying to say that nine bucks a day but then something happened and you got a thousand dollars a duck blow your own insurance that nine dollars a day for five days which is four to five bus going to say do a thousand dollars so we had a car\nCompany is posed as opposed to be the primary one\nRight now that there'll be primary I Would take I take out the other one I just like to be overly cautious and that's all\nI'm reasonably cost stuff what I Would say that you go out to the the bills don't have ... I Believe it used car sales are going to go up the\nPrice of the used car but it is a used car it's negligible they talking about on average about three hundred dollars a car so it's not you know a lot is not a huge amount of heat if you're buying a ten thousand dollar car if it goes up by three hundred but it's going to change your payment about what to pick two cents a penny among\nWell whether it's huge and that is relative to your income after you've made the agreement to pay for the car\nHave you been out of ten thousand dollar car an extra penny among gonna hurt your budget you buy in the wrong call maybe even a dollar among going to change but did you find her own car\nI think strongly that this is ... and I actually wrote a letter about this city to Congress [laughter]\nSo why don't you tell me what you would come home and it wants to keep me up the daytime to keep going I'm Sorry\nThe the amount that he goes up should be based on the mileage not the ... Namazi goes up as far as um [noise] the tax on it the tax should be based on the amount of my I was just on the car and nothing more than that and that will be more fair but I think for the car should go up\nAnd and so you know what the point you're bringing up I think that's that's not a bad point sold the book value of the car when they're the company you know black book that pretty much sets the value in blacker bluebird well ... Blue Book they ... the two different than black book of the company so when I go to the auction\nBlack book is the company that we as wholesalers we use to find the wholesale price of the car so if I were going to be in the car I go to the black book and I looked to see what the wholesale value in good condition a split condition bad conditions or whatever and that's how we're going to start being on the cars the within a number\nSo they set the value of the blue books a little bit different Blue Book looks at with retail by the car is okay so ... when that so it the the black the blue book is based on a black book and those values are set own mileage condition that vehicle\nUm it also based on the popularity of vehicle to demand a vehicle all those things are considered when you come up with the value of their car and you could see a viable car chained\nEach time that book comes out every seven days it can go up in the next seven eight book when it comes out if the car became popular in the past seven days so marriage is a factor in that but you can make it purely effect because if I go out and I'm buying a a two thousand sixteen Toyota Camry but it happened to ...\nYou can make it purely effect because if I go out and I'm buying a a two thousand sixteen Toyota Camry but it happened to belong to somebody who was a sales person and this guy put Seventy thousand miles on the car and then you go I\nPay less than a person who bought another two dollar sixty cameras got thirty thousand miles of the car to\nYou know just based on them out of the loan to meet in a very I think you ought to have some other variables and now like equipment that's on the vehicle what the original sales price of the car was when he came out\nAnd you know the physical condition of the car with the cars weren't for the markets a couple of things that they need to be added in there but mileage just want to know\nWhat I said was prime what if I didn't see it I mean let me say now I thought it\nPrimarily it should be based on the other thing should be contributing factor okay primarily based on miles to just by virtue of being a used car you should be paying for it I mean the government should be able to hit you based on just how you did it\nBecause you can put you could put fifty thousand well maybe not what you could you could put five thousand miles a brand new car if you've only half to two months\nSo what happens to this here's another scenario taught what if you were living in Alabama and you were moving to Georgia\nAnd you had a car\nThat um say you had a\nTwo thousand four teams to other than sixteen dodge charger hail cat but you bought it for investment purposes you go keep it for a long time and you don't really drive it that much\nTo ah get bring that to bring that out because if there's a lot of competition out here in that field\nWhile there's a lot of competition but it that's like my monitor you grow up a camera actually identified as people tried that and I get into their vehicles so All right and and things like\nThat I'll tell you the area that I have I have posted videos of that there there there is there's a company out there selling something just like that and their records it\nAnd it keeps it and it downloads to your smartphone so it comes right to use them in a deal out of the car and you still have the information on your smartphone\nThat you can see a share of the police so they get in and get what you got in that ... you can you still have the video said on the clout so they is stuff out there like it not just just because there's you know and it more than one McDonald's more than one hamburger place out there to her I mean you can't get to that and it won't be successful\nIs is I don't I just don't know that I have the contacts that with could put you in the rye room with the right people to to move that flew on\nOkay so your your your what your guest that I call wanted a mattress\nOr yeah ... hey do you know 'cause you know they're a great resource and then you know you got people in my ...

one yet reception remember you had a yard earlier in the game\nAnd I'm forty one younger egos over one hundred yards reception for the afternoon\nAnd also why were you where you have a Seventeen yard

thirty\n... Tyler so a lot of great stories today another great story has been the Cincinnati bear cats\nStay very dire for the tigers UCF on thirty one thirty\nHi Maggie Tyler so a lot of great stories today another great story has been the Cincinnati bear cats football program which went for an eight under its first uh its first season under loop pickle they have turned it around dramatically a six starts they are off this we got a chance to catch up with a bear cats second year head coach and\nAsked them how this drastic turnaround has come me for an Eighteen to a six and start\nTalking about coaching no just kidding [laughter] it\nProbably has little to do with coaching and has as much to do with relationships and building some trust and respect and a lot of the things that were doing um our our guys play harder they play faster and and\nIt has so much more to do with you know just relationships and in the ... than it does with fundamentals are technique or scheme 'em or anything specific to coaching to be honest with you\nYour defense gave up thirty one point he times last year it hasn't happened yet this year in fact you're only allowed to eighty two points what's been the difference for that you\nStart confidence that they play I mean you would say they play a lot faster I there are a lot of the same guys I'm I'm not sure that if you just timed him you'd say well well yeah you guys upgraded and are a lot faster but they're confident they understand the what's in the wise\nUm that makes them anticipate in look a lot faster as they play\nAnd then I'd say tackling I mean we've done it much much much better job of tracking the football and eliminating those big big place that uh the plight of so much last year\n... you know you never really know what you have in your quarterback until he goes out there and does it did you think Desmond runner would be as good he is he has been coming into the season\nNorth we if we would have we probably would have said he was the start up from the get go by you know it it's been a battle in in between does and and have more that they've you know fought it out all through camp all through spring football and really even fought it on the first couple of weeks of the season I Know that he didn't get as many\nOpportunities after he started the first game but um you you knew Desmond had some some real gifts and I don't just mean his ability to throw the football I don't just mean his ability to run a but some of those other things just the natural confidence uh the way guys kind of just tend to flock to him or he has some of those natural leadership qualities\nAnd you and said what you were looking for in a quarterback and someone who can make everyone else better how has he done that so far in Europe and\nKind of what I just talked about his ability um you know they're not always be the ... you have to put himself out their first he looks at how do I help others and and then return others are starting to help him uh he just he has a natural gift that\nAh that charisma a little bit with the with the confidence behind him that he doesn't have to be the hockey guy always saying stuff you know he has the ability to do it um\nYou know with his with his actions every bit more than he does\nA with his words and as a young guy especially a freshmen\nComing in I think that's the only way for guys to truly kind of buy in and believe into what you're doing a and he's done an unbelievable job of that\nYou have a freshman quarterback in the ... more running back in Michael war in the second who was that a lot of calories in part due to injury how happy to have you been with the way he has responded those four\nWell he's obviously done a great job I think the unique thing about Mike is his durability\nUm you know we kind of always talk about their ability is more important than ability\nAnd to be a tale backing carry the ball as many times as he has in the in the first six games um maybe and for those games in particular to be able to keep on trucking I think it's it's just unique you never you never know it's such a unique position that you know whether you're recruiting um every every high school team got a a really good one and\nA lot of them are very similar and a ... it's hard to kind of determine the difference between who's gonna projected that next level and who has\nA a really good one and a lot of them are very similar and uh it's hard to determine the difference between who's going to project to the next level and who has the heart and the will\nHum that a guy like Mike worn out of them you have to say Mr football in the state of Ohio and all those things have translated over uh just to be the guy that durable tough physical uh can do it every single day even though the software\nDogwood Cincinnati head coach Lou critical to bear cats at six in ... already bowl eligible in there by week after four when season a year ago in your first year there but as far as this turn around and one of the great stories has been and you have to tell me how you been able to do this offensively with a line that consists of two graduate transfers\nA sixty or former walk on we'll get more on him in a moment but a former hockey player and somebody who never put down a college football until this year\nIs called development and you know that kind of goes back to the believing in in those guys and\nWe want to be an office of wind driven program we came in here saying that the thing we got to focus on of those guys up front and in a lotta times guys coming in not just in our program but college in general a specially a friday it's become so much of a scheme 'em\nGame nowadays that I think sometimes we lose focus on whether it's really about and development of those guys up front of you know blocking and\nYeah we sort of stopped paying attention and wrapped up a lot of\nThat yeah it was ... he blamed it on my credit card debt and I mean towns
