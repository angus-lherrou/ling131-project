DC\nAre and so this is a new book a bullet marketable you've got to do you pull it into you need to go wherever you wanted to go there you go and do when we come back we'll take a break when we come back we'll talk about your approach to photography what got you interested in it\nI thought I could work at a gallery I had a choice I decided to own a gallery I Want it to expose a loving people to um counted artist to a wider audience ah to see and appreciate their work but I also wanted to expose people like me and you to the joys of and I think finite photography\nAnd so I um I just decided to take this passion and love is something when I look\nSo tell her about a war of the gallery is and I'm ... will they see if they come there on a daily basis\nThank you for asking um we're located at forty six hundred cascade road just outside the parameter a and not far from the south west art center\nI a show two to three exhibitions a year currently we have I'm Sheila ... writes workout or

always looking for great venues\nOr something different you know we can always do it at the coffee shop where else but we won't go to places that feed on people's souls as well be able to sit for that is Sheila I'm you know collection and or whoever the next group is it is always good to visit there tell people how they can reach you via email website social media\nSailor Dawkins gallery dot com and thank you so much for having me here today\nOur dog she will all this book is impressive it is I can\nTell you you know and I tell people I'm from Atlanta so a lot of the folks here in Atlanta um all all all of the places many of the protests um I've been involved in and do the folks and so the be able to chronicle history\nI'm One of the things that always concerned me was how we sometime or disconnected right and so we need to make sure that I'm the old guard if you will noses new guard who's basically just mimicking in following in their footsteps\nUm you know that a launching those reduce them and then vice versa right talk about why this book is important to you as a really a cultural grill telling the story of what was what is now and what's perhaps become\nFor me as a photo graphic artist in two thousand and third chain um Trayvon Martin happen well two thousand and twelve and when George Zimmerman was not held accountable and two thousand and\nAnd um Trayvon Martin happen well two thousand and twelve and when George Zimmerman was not held accountable and two thousand and Thirteen for the murder of Trayvon I decided as an artist to go to the ground because I wanted to tell our stories from our perspective\nHas far too long we have been looking through the lens of the white male in there too\nAnd I felt that it was important to bring in\nThe Elders that were unknown that were members of the civil rights movement like Loni keen Dr rising them poke and others and intergenerational lives them with the young people today [noise] um\nYou been to Philadelphia bathroom ruse Atlanta Detroit\nFerguson where was the most interesting place what was the most of his time or did you experience putting this together\nWell and first and I went to the aftermath\nBut in Baltimore I was there that Sunday when Freddie Gray pants\nAnd that Monday I went into west Baltimore and I've been to Detroit I've been to Chicago But West Baltimore I felt like I was in a third world country\nI mean I was looking at the landscape and it just caught me off guard and I I don't know why and I immediately started photographing the landscape and there was some people around and they told me to get out\nAnd said they didn't want me here why people here are the media because the only time when you come into these community is when it was our country is so negative right so you know you had to think fast on your feet and I'm kind of like a little girl sometimes and I said well\nI'm from the home of the civil rights movement and I want to tell our story they looked me up up up and down ... and they said yes\nAnd then a woman came up to me she said I'm gonna tell you the truth she said I just got out of jail and I don't have any money you have any money I looked at it and I said ma'am I don't have any money I could give you a hug don't know why I said it and we don't we try\nAnd so I felt that it was important for me as an artist to tell the stories because I had different experience in different areas in Ferguson\nWhen I went to the aftermath and I was on the ground you could just feel the tension in the air it was like a\nBubbling ... are are around I mean I'm the people were telling me about how the police stations and the people in the community all work together and how they would give them tickets in it ... pal upon pal up\nAnd they can and then they go to jail though it was an ... it's like a perpetual revolution constant never ending\nSo yeah the photo journalist you were able to really get the real story well I don't consider ... well I mean yeah we're will take the journalist or this target for\nBecause most people still don't understand what Ferguson was about right they think it was just about Mike Brown but when you had all white police department right and a black town\nNot one black officer off for the most part I think they had one um but every body of the town had just hundreds some thousands of dollars worth of kids that they will base their only being used as ... ... you know as a way to control the populace\nI'm thousands of dollars worth of it is that they will basically being used as you used to read a you know as a way to control the population\nAnd extract money from them like it was some kind of crazy system um you know so that was ... we learned that early on but you know people like miss that part of it you got it down a hundred people all seven hundred and some people got tickets\nTo the tune the hundreds of thousands of dollars it made no sense at all and the people rebelled against it\nFor for eight nine to two seven zero three when we come back on the book world to tell people how to get the book it is not in black and white\nAnd I'm sure that's on purpose yesterday and when we come back and once you tell us why don't go to place they can stay with us on special guests inside the studio is our ... he is the owner of our ... gallery and Sheila pre bright
