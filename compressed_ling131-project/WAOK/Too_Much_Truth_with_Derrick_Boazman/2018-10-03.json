lot on your plate um you know ... is with the state conference in double ACP\nAh one of these issues like gentrification I mean what what from a public policy standpoint um what are these what are these issues and why should people be concerned about not on that it goes but the overall phenomenon of justification\nI think they need to be concerned because this is overall changing the face of the city and and the region\nUm as we ... we heard from Reverend Jackson the phenomenon of white flight and now we see justification during the reverse we see now hum that new people coming into the city and there's not enough affordable housing for the residents who've been here\nYou know forever like you said with grandma and you're on cheese and all of those people who live there and so when you have a deal like the girls they need to put a real agreement in place that protects\nOr those who you know are not making a large amounts of money you know to have you know affordable housing stock and you know looking at the deal from lawyers perspective\nYou know when I look at the Affordable housing trust which are seeing my eyes agree to pay twenty eight million or two affordable housing when you have a five billion dollar plan\nUm it's just a drop in the bucket it needs to be renegotiated and then you have equal payments that are made two thousand Eighteen two thousand Nineteen two thousand twenty\nTotaling fourteen million and then three more equal payments and twenty twenty two twenty twenty three and twenty twenty four so we were talking about fully funding it at the front in right so my concern was when I was at the meeting with the mayor last Wednesday and she tried to outline his proposal or was that we don't even know where the twenty eight million is\nIs is is this is Joe ... led to even talk about the meeting a oh yeah because um it would just I'll be honest with you um I wouldn't know big teaching them bottom supporters ... saw stuff like this coming fall I mean I just had to tell you my listeners know\nUm I wouldn't know ... bottom supporters ... stuff like this coming right or I mean I just had to tell you my listeners know [laughter] ain't no big I relived rarely have a say no big\nStays Abrams supporter because I have watcher politic and when I got to worry about when you get to the table mhm would you cut the deal for the masses\nOr for the classes because one of the conversation we got to have a conversation intra black folks now I don't even do it here and I called the show too much roof that some class warfare going on into our own group now and his true um that the black bourgeoisie just feel like\nIn the black elite look we we might have will we like to see I Am ... we like we like coffee houses and we like to see a wife or walk their dogs in our neighborhood that means is going to be safe and we like to be able to go to Starbucks and have put an Arab ... next to us and\nWe'd like to I mean if it was real I mean it's a money thing your grandma me to try and survive I don't believe you get to be\nRiver jak they Seventy seven and you got to worry about whether you can maintain the house is paid for just based on the taxes taxes to tell the people I just happened to look near my house\nYou know they're building somehow is woods near me that is so big you could put my little house and there's three times and I'm like now what it does go on sale for\n... ... what is this going to sell for what is this going to do to my property value so at the end of the day we just got to you know you know public ... politics all politics is about public policy and what a attorney Greg is talking about what is the best policy\nThat could come out of this um\nWhat do you want to see happen kid is there'll be fix it do it needs to go back to the drawing board of what what if what advocates say\nWell before I went to the meeting I Believe that it could be fixed\nBut and I was talking about the meeting itself I lost my fear is held in a small\nThere's room holiday whoa whoa where did you get half of the people already with green shirt zone people who have never seen before green shirt so yeah they have the room filled up with you know it was\nOnly within the city employees and then the police are there in in force and they're keeping you know citizens out of the meeting I I I Will not but that was disappointing I was ... percent of the fourth try to get into the meeting with other citizens and I was looking at the mayor's face\n... and she looked at first it shocked and then she just kinda sit back and didn't do anything and I I'm sitting here thinking to myself I was going to come here to listen want to hear how this was going to impact the city water an open mind and then when I see how that's like that it takes me back to ...\nA forty some ... percent occupancy rate for commercial properties or that me they do not have to ... and ... and just build a new building similar to that\nAnd so they want to make you think that this is some huge economic impact they sold their biggest asset that here\nIf Norfolk Southern was such a huge conglomerates they would've never given up their ownership interest in a building that's a block loan and see I Am group is developing that for the loss a high end once again last apartment\nA let's go to a sin to for the U.S read like the ... group is meeting tomorrow at six thirty at first I Kony and what else do we need to know a sin for\nA well we need to know a that this deal is even worse than we thought\nThe more we read the six hundred page study or the six hundred page proposal rather by the I Am\nWe realize how bad it is or can we try to get people together to we're going to do it each in tomorrow or at first I currently a Baptist church five forty two mall an avenue beginning at six thirty a you know and one thing I Do want to save up for\nA statement when you say well the the uh property the Gulch isn't doing any property taxes now so\nAnything that given is really not being given away\nThe bottom line is this\nThe five billion dollars worth of development going on in the Gulf is five billion dollars of development that is not going on in other places a restaurant if you have a more in or another restaurant for example going in the Gulf\nThat that's a Martin's restaurant that has not somewhere else in the city earnings tax revenues so don't believe the height when they say\nOr in the restaurant that is not somewhere else in the city earning tax revenues so I don't believe the height when they say that it's not going to take anything from this it's going to be two and a half billion dollars\nTo two billion dollars worth of property taxes it five hundred thousand five hundred million dollars of sales tax that the city will be losing to this development and we're not getting almost anything back\nHere's the thing that I Want you to answer for me the coalition says he's great does get at the facts and give all the information has this group come up with a position\nOr a ... a proposal to just kill the deal for do you all have an alternative to what should come off the table because that's all want to begin to do because that someone would say the gals going to vote on this I'm going to ask you how many me do you have this is going to be voted on probably next Monday\nWell it's going to be voted on and what we're saying is it this deal is so bad okay and you're not you're you're not going to make it any better than a couple of weeks where we are a say right here now is we want to stop it on the fifteenth yeah ah they're a little\nYou know for all about who they were going to try Noel all national and now what about housing or jobs in non as\nWell well the fallback position is let's get to the table a let's get to the table and talk about this because they're giving a ten percent equity one minority competing\nWe got that ... you know literally a Thirty Years' around loop on Monday we're going to put it down to ... votes come ...\nI don't know about that I don't know about that all up\nAnd down on Monday but what I Am saying is I Can't the city be in that part of the city has done him profit sharing and other development for example the palm city market much smaller deal but the city\nIs it wasn't a profit share with that deal game so you know the end this point uh we're in a position where we're saying\nLet's keep our eight votes against it let's stop but on Monday and let it at that point negotiate a better deal for the city if that's possible okay\nI mean going to be tomorrow what time\nTomorrow Thursday October for six thirty PM or at first I Coney Baptist church at five forty to boil an avenue south east\nUh so we're asking people to come out [noise] learn about this deal but more importantly we're going to have an action item we're going to tell you what you do we now in the fifth theme to stop this deal and get a a better deal on the table\nI is that the next time the city council meeting on the fifteenth\nThat's right next time they meet is on the ... a a week from Monday we've someone yeah Hi All right

Starbucks that was a A N result that area's wanted to talk to this this\nSo the profile a Starbucks that was a a an end result of that area is one of the top to the ... the surrounding neighborhoods

part of California\nI'm from Los Angeles your brother but I've just flew out here I'm In Atlanta Georgia at the moment\nOkay well my town there and welcome to my town\nBank your brother Trey said you

times when it comes down to the real estate and these business for starting up ... lobby\nSo obvious to her job and accomplish tomorrow and I'll be speaking out another car for math ... must must you

push conference at the Hyatt tomorrow or they have a justification panel at two o'clock and I understand your folks like you and I are Thomas can make a lot of money don't get me wrong right but what we got to look out for people like miss Geneva\nWho work are back in the fifties and sixties who retired in the seventies who now in her eighties and whose income is not going to go up and if she stayed in that a hundred thousand that million dollar home she would have to already she would have already been moved out right\nAnd so unless she bought four or five of those when she was young like you and I held on to them now she can cash in four million dollars\nBut generally that's not what we did right and so a while it is a and investors market if you got that kind of real loot\nUm you know if you held onto your stuff through the storm or some of us you know kind of cleared the decks of member toward particular homes when it all collapse in two thousand uh eight two thousand nine some of our guest stuck out here with dozens of homes that we had to liquidate\nBut those were able to ride it out man if you could if you wrote it out in Atlanta I can tell you just owned a little bit of ...\nEight but those were able to ride it out man if you could if you wrote it out in Atlanta I can tell you just owned a little bit of stuff I got a a house that we're renting for Eighteen hundred just uh but that we're renting for eight hundred\nOr just two years ago I'm On a very low and you can get Fifteen sixteen hundred for it is it it had built up a little different man is so great inside the city\nNow I got one that I Am really happened to that a dilemma with right because I Do I can double the rent on it but I'm asking should I Do it you know do I do I need to have an eight hundred dollars now this is the benevolent capitalism me\nI should add that some family that work at a hospital in maybe fried chicken that the my favorite chicken spot continue to written this place for a hundred dollars\nAnd so the pure capitalism and yeah get that might offer but the benevolence said no help somebody\nThere you go yeah and so you have to struggle while his attorney or at least I'm saying I've just been on it and say that I still have an internal contradiction\nOr not what making money now 'cause I ain't nothing about being broke that I like nothing right but that's where some of us at ... and I got some friends who don't care what they say look not only are they going to get the Eighteen hundreds they'll put the family deck and all that for the eight hundred out\nNow leads out of the people read the let the least run out\nAnd they told me they go move now I got a decision to make so [noise]\nBut uh that's great minded to be made man but money is not the end all\nA flavor or the book is not just about to tell us what your book or you call them to push booksellers about the book so now now not necessarily they'll call in to help with the ... you know I'm not going to tell about what we're going to learn what the building them in the book is called monetize gentrification\nAnd it's called the uh subtitled building black ownership meaning we got to start the conversation about ownership because of the people who are all things and getting pushed out you don't have to worry about the landlord telling you you're not going to know you\nKnow you have the problem with that Tom and them put you on hold so we come back it it does have a down side and the less public policy meet your ownership because gram on my own it outright but guess what happens to grandma\nWhen it gets to a million dollars she cannot afford to pay the taxes on it simply can't afford it and they they can't afford to pay it gives who come knocking on doors it come to reverse mortgage people we'll take care of that for your grandma ... in fact all you gotta do is use this little pinch off your monthly equity\nAnd ah then you don't have to pay one dime you can stay in the home when you die whoever sells it will just lose that percentage of equity that you have used up and we've seen these games over and over again because ... who bought a house forty years ago for forty thousand dollars if it was in South central she could have done that [noise]\nBut now she can't afford the nine hundred thousand because the taxes on that even with a homestead exemption you're still paying tens of thousands of dollars in taxes all [noise] and see that in ... alone and so you know and so I'm saying\nDo for a ... foot you're willing to do for the developing Atlanta\nFreeze the taxes that the current market rate current levels\nAfter they get certain age then the taxes should never go up again\nAnd let them keep their home and age in place because all we can do is move in with her grandson\nBecause that's who gonna end up paying those taxes and if she got two two or three other property he's not going to be able to afford it\nMove in with her grandson\nBecause that's who gonna end up paying those taxes and if she got two two or three other property he's not going to be able to afford it\nThough there is a downside to this they'll go into
