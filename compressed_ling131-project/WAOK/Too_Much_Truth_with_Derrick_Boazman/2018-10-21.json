I'm ... I decided I'm just kind of a baby on my own so I saw the perfect opportunity to make that happen slide thruway precaution maybe that happened got pregnant and when I told the guy even though the the gentleman and I were engaged at the time\nWhen I told him of the pregnancy lost it he had a emotional breakdown on the spot and was like are you kidding were forty years old our kids are in their twenties I'm done\nAnd I was like yeah well I'm not done and this is an accident so if you want to be done you can move on\n... and that's exactly what he did but he did it with such anger and defiance and so\nHalf of the reason that he and I uh maintained a fantastic relationship even to this day is because I saw the era of my ways right here so many celebrities and so many men\nOn the street today that can identify with women taking it upon themselves to throw caution to the wind even though you know the man wants protection and you don't do it because you either want to paycheck or if you're like me you just want a baby and you're not thinking of the ramifications of now it's just me and my child\nMost of my friends are in their fifties they don't even I lost a lot of friends from that because they're like a baby\nHave you lost our kids are in college the same thing the the my child's father said we're too old we can't do this so now I Can't hang out with you because I don't I don't I'm not into diaper phase I Want to hear your kid screaming or no I had a girlfriend tell them you know fortieth\nBirthday code the pony so can I ask this than when the child came yes and uh did you have any problems or issues in the father and the child yeah having a connection\nAbsolutely I'm the father moved out immediately I'm I was sickly he moved down the street maybe two or three blocks from me but he never came over and never visited never called\nDidn't do anything until about I'll say he showed up for Christmases so he was good for the finances we both went to child support immediately he got his child support so he pays that and then but then he was just never around and only until recently very recently in the last I'm going to say the last two years they've developed a relationship where they interact with each other\nThough when the child was getting out of kindergarten he came around grandma came around you know and then now that the child is seven and able to speak up for himself a little bit more he's interacting but it wasn't until two weeks ago that the my uh my\nChild's father came to me and he said I keep hearing you recount the story of being a single mom he sent his really ticks me off because you're not a single mom I pay child support I'm here every now and again\nAnd I said to him well the problem is you've never been here with regularity we have never schedule to visit for seven years and if you don't schedule a visit that means the burden is on me twenty four seven as to how to care for the shouting I'm willing to take that burden because again I\nMade the shady move of having a baby and secretly doing that\nBehind my partner's backwards lady's let's just stop doing that let's just I'm doing it but then just recently this last week he sees\nOh okay well if I don't have a regular arranged schedule that means me and the child don't really get to know each other with any regularity\nWeeks he sees oh okay well if I don't have a regular arranged schedule that means mean a child don't really get to know each other with any regularity and there's no real foundation has in his mind as long as he pay child support him around once a month human chow has relationship\nThe time um you know just because you're you're ... your money is nearly every day your emotional ... every day you you're not you're missing something I and I talked to a Romeo spinning hey Ronnie ...\nHow ya doing ... hey\nI wanted to tell you I came home and my baby mama looked at me and she said my daughter\nYou know diapers ain't got no diapers I said well I'm gonna go try to sail for him and me and my mother told me I could say I am a name on their property\nSo what I did I took the trying I went to ... and I stood in front of the target and not at all the white people going to target I sent my daughter need diapers and one man told me come on it took me back then he bought me two packs of diapers and I went back home and my family was very very very happy\nI had to make the decision to get that I was from a family\nWhere you are right on Brazil was upset she was highly she really mad but ah\nI laid a happier when I brought those titles but but what I Want to try to tell you or if you don't have something you have to go out in public and ask for it because if you try to make money on his way industry now they will block you from making that money because they bought me for selling my only males so\nYou just have to ask people to go out of a show for what you eat and what you want if they had they gave it to you if they don't they won't\nWant to me and my kids went out of food I Would as labor they do they gave me a little bit for the last three months\nAnd I was ... you know what I had the ... the the beauty of what Romeo is saying is the ... and when he he would take legally to help some ... his children ... and you know and and and that's the the the beauty of it a\nTime they'll Joyce Missy fellow me okay\nI saw I didn't see the entire video but it appeared me on the portion that I saw she was attempting to show that she could drowned her kid but I didn't get the impression that she she really trying to drown\nHe knew he wasn't a matter I mean he was just really transit matter Brian ...\nActually does matter is bad enough is bad enough that she will traumatize a five year old kid like that five months\nFive ... yes if five ... five month old kid like that but\nThe the the actual facts of the matter show a little bit little differences what was really going on it and how much control self control she actually did have by the separate from that\nThen it gives you a little bit more insight of what what the actual month to month physical quarter fiscal quarter cost is\nThen on the ideal circumstances because things go wrong sometimes then if you take in consideration the time and energy not just the money then you start thinking about the you start talking about things like okay what type of a recreational programs what type of\nAcademic setting the want to be in to what degree do you need to be involved in understanding the teachers of the school that your child is in as well as the ministry of staff\nAs well as the other um adult supervisors of the organizations that they're involved in\nThey start talking about things such as planning a planning a structure for this person to move into adulthood where you could just lift your hands from them for the most part and move forward\nAnd it wouldn't just be talking about money it will be talking about time energy and forward thinking and we deal with\nThe information handy thing ... would not what you want to hear that much and\nHe said what would you do with the information what would you do with information\nYou will you put it in front of people who have interests at some point in life and become their parents and give them some better insight detailed conversation some better insight or what is actually going to take them to get to zero which means before the child is even conceive up to the age of twenty two where\nThey want to at least get that child into where they can move independently on your own death which you would that's what they would do with the information is good and and the reason why they account for war because you want an isolated one isolated to a very small area and you don't want a whole bunch of folks coming in\nGiven unnecessary pain is separate from what the actual to folks is our economic and social structure\nNow as opposed to structure their grant to cut you off there are grants that actually a deal with accidents or an ... an accident in in in those courses um you are you deal with the financial cost of ... or ... or as raising a child and I know that because I used to work for nonprofit um who\nYou are you deal with the financial cost of ... or ... or as raising a child and I know that because I used to work for a nonprofit um who who did that who do specific goal was to do that so there is information out there but what I what I learned even in in teaching those courses to children is that\nIf they don't think that you are a human when you're teaching your ... if if you're looking at it they don't I didn't write all get in there as you know as an authority but you don't have any humidity this ... this this sort of in the car with you they're not going to look at is no different from knowing how much it costs to to fix keep a car\nOr maintain over the course of his life what do you do with it as that makes you a better drivers make us safer driver to the ... like what what do you do is we have to ... in my opinion you know it it goes a little bit deeper then finding out the coast time and energy I don't I don't know how you measure that\nBut then we end measurable right we we have to get to the core of his thing one thing I wanted to say before we before we we closed the\nWorst thing that ever happened to us artistically was the song that's just my baby daddy ... because because that's just my\nThat'd be little it it it minimizes the most important job you'll likely ever have in your life ... and when we got to the point where we were saying that's just my baby daddy baby mama\nThan we thought we could do everything else but be a good dad would be a good mom wouldn't be a good team ... so we have to really\nOn we had to deconstruct it and figure out what is what is leading us to to to say things like that's just my ... that's just the person that's going to carry my legacy and it's going to ... my my limit you know other community\nFeels that way or or responds to parenting in that way and also no other community kicks kids out at Eighteen other communities understand if you're female you're in a home with your family to you Mary ... and if you never marry your your your family's going to still\nCarry that that way of helping you provide re with you with that that's just my baby's daddy if I'm Around a lot of people in other cultures and this is why they look down on African Americans so much because of our parenting styles are lack of respect for marriage or lack of respect for community you know even the brother who talked about selling them and them\nYou know on one hand people congestion but on the other hand this man is willing to put him in his frailties out there or you didn't judge him and that's exactly what we're saying the mom who dumped her baby she should have put her frailties out there and said hey look\nI Can't get a job I have other mental issues going on I Can't find out how to keep a house for the baby somebody needs to take my kids and moms out there\nPlease please please start sending your children to your father to their fathers who are willing able and happy to care for their child that's another conversation we need to have the wire women holding on to kids when their dad should be especially if you've got a black male child mhm and you have a a willing father\nSo would you let them know what you say then Missy that uh she should have made the phone call and said hey I can not handle this any more\nThat's right we need to eat when I'm On I'm going to send send this five month old or this five year old ... says hey you're older this nine year old to you because if my if the mothers of my sons are children were to call my son and say\nI Can't take care of the baby we take it I can guarantee you even though my son is not necessary he's an artist so he doesn't work nine to five he will call me call up his sister and say hey look

your show um hello to everybody out there listening\nI'm as that have been stated on betray Ferguson young I had been doing advocacy work two and a domestic violence intimate partner violence or violence against women for the past eleven years um I started with the women's resource entertain domestic violence as a domestic violence agency based in DeKalb County\nUm have been a a a chaplain and women's advocate there um and then worked swing Fulton County in the legal advocate a victim advocate for a survivors of violence ominous solicitor general's office with a family miles down there\nAnd I also had the opportunity to work with um the side of accountability with those who perpetrate violence in DeKalb County magistrate court I Would like a probation officer I was caught a compliance officer I was someone who monitored people who have protective orders issued against them\nAnd making sure that they went to their intervention classes in programs on I'm also an ordained minister or that have been in my former professor\nYou tell them that [laughter] [laughter] no no no [laughter] got old and a\nAnd an excellent one at that of course um and so as a professional advocate as um you know theologian an ordained minister um I saw of course at the intersection and the\nThe crossroads if you will of the church or faith communities and us and victims and survivors and perpetrators of violence um in knowing that for so many ah victims of violence going to their faith community for health is one of the first places that they go\nBut unfortunately I'm a leaders and ministers within faith communities are often not trained have no experience no no I'm depths of understanding as to how to properly addressed in response to this issue and so I have done a lot of work and working to bridge that gap and to quit more faith\nLeaders um with the knowledge of how to address and prevent um intimate partner violence and gender based violence and then also um you know with ah with with domestic violence agencies throughout the Atlanta area to know more about faith communities as well in ways that can work together because it's while aberration in partners\nSo you've had your you've had your hands full with this this type of thing and it seems that there is a passion that you have for this for this this\nSo you've had your you've had your hands full with this this type of thing and it seems that there is a passion that you have for this for this this this situation let me let me ask you something and I want you to tell me um how how prevalent or as prevalent might not be the right word but how widespread is this issue of\nOf intimate partner vows and and specifically what you do with dealing with old dark and that's that's the piece that that that fascinates me about what you do because I Do think a lot of us when we think about intimate partner of ours we don't think about all we only think about a certain segment of the population that I don't know if we think that much about\nHow this thing caches out itself with respect to older\nYes yes adults um I just this in regards to that I've recently um completed working now with the camp county with their ending of use in later life project as the coordinator for that project\nAnd so for them when we were to do was improve services throughout the Kevin particular um that makes it easier for older adults to come forward to get help and also to equip those who respond to um the elder abuse and and the mess around with older adults are so so that would be law enforcement that'd be judges prosecutors\nUm community leaders and advocates and and also other domestic violence agencies so that there's a heightened awareness insensitivity as to how to specifically address and work with older adults um especially those who have challenges with mobility who maybe have some\nDementia or Alzheimer's related issues um who are just in need of a lot more help and assistance and maybe aren't able bodied like as they were um aren't as you know connected to their community because they're older\nAnd so they they have even more barriers to getting help and even knowing what to the animal\nAnd so we have worked for the past four years to to bridge a lot of gaps thankfully being into cab\nThere's a lot of resources but a lot of the agencies and even a leaders in this work weren't so much working together you know working in tandem and so we've worked really Branstad so I'm like closing gaps things like that the people working together so it has to have more effective services um for older adults so that is particularly what I've done there um\nAnd what we find with those who are older um additionally a lot of times I'll overwhelmingly with older adults\nUm the violence that one of the most prevalent form of ounces going to be financial mhm where their finances are taking advantage of um\nTheir Social Security if you use oftentimes by their adult children or even caregivers that they know and so I'm unfortunately they put their trust in those who have to get medications for them or taken to the doctor\nOr help to pay their bills because maybe they just physically or mentally cannot do that mhm and unfortunately they can get taken advantage of him being neglected which can lead to\nUm you know just stare malnourish Mitt and mistreatment and even more tremor for them and isolate them even more from\nThe community so it's I'm even more taboo in what you know even see with um a with a lot of agencies their domestic violence agencies um sometimes their outreach materials have pictures of younger women are with children um and even like the safe houses are shelters may not\nHave that on the the combinations or you know I'm for that can help older adults and so wanting them to just be more aware of that and so we ... we created no more materials that older adults to show this is okay for you can call here too because we find the elder do say I didn't think I could call their looked like it was just for\nYounger people so wanting agencies who do outreach to be intentional about reaching out to places that seniors frequent um and that they're using the language that's inclusive for older adults and things like that so\nThat's been um that's a lot of what we focused on over the past few years and have been able to make some good strides\nI tell you what what I'd like to do is spend spend a little more time kinda\nThat's been um that's a lot of what we focused on over the past few years and have been able to\n... I I tell you what what I'd like to do is spend spend a little more time kind of flashing out or shall I say I'm painting or the the this picture of of abuse mhm what in what it looks like for older adults because I'm Wondering how many of us actually\nI have thought about this and then\nHow many of us I'm might be wanting to to recognize if someone who is ... how would you know if how could you see how could you recognize it\nHow could you identify because one of the things I'm Wondering\nIs in methods not wandering but I Would even go as far as to say that it's kind of hard to do something about something if you don't know what they're of course if you don't give you don't know if they're so I mean what does it look like you know water some of the ... what some of the uh I guess symptoms how could you go about seeing are recognizing a knowing\nUm and so if you're not seeing them if they're not\nComing around on that something ticket\nWho um you know that person is connected to from place that they may frequent um and so if you're not seeing them if they're not coming around um that's something to get curious about doesn't necessarily mean that it's happening but to you know to check in with him see how things are going\nOn in making sure that are they going to their doctors asking questions like you know ... are you going to your doctor's appointments are you going like you're supposed to argue but have you been getting your medication um things like that because those are ways in which neglect can take place if someone is being a views um that they are not getting too you know they're they're not being taken to the doctor like they're supposed to\nUm so those those are some things you know it's if if something and also trusting your instincts you know something seems strange or odd or um you know there's\nAgain you're not maybe seeing someone or you know that you know the situation maybe with who's helping to take care of them isn't doesn't seem right\nOr maybe you you know they have a caregiver but they're not you can tell they're now well taken care of or if you go visit in you know you may see things like padlocks on the refrigerator or things locked up or you know the house maybe as in you know clean or there can you know there can be signs in which\nYou know you're in the U.S can tell you I Wonder if everything's okay here um and sometimes you know people people need additional help or maybe there's additional care that's needed maybe it's not necessarily always intentional\nUm but if something does not seem right you know ethically it's always good to ask questions on and to recognize that there's you know in in the cabin Fulton County some and metro Atlanta we do have a lot of resources is a lot of senior centers\nUm their senior leak lines in DeKalb County which you can get connected to more resources and help if you're wondering I Know somebody needs some more help 'em or maybe people can't take care of themselves that they want to stay home you know older folks are have a lot of pride and they ... they don't win when things change with their independence it's hard to let go and that's understandable\nAnd so wanting to make sure that people get the help that they need so there's help that's out there and available um but it's but it's important to ask in a way to see 'em you know people need help you know let them know I'm concerned about you [noise] um and here's why and\nYou know when that happens when you let someone now they may you know someone who is experiencing violence may say\nNow like now I'm good you know everything's okay but when you let them know I'm concerned about you I'm here if you need something they may come back to you a few weeks later and say you know what I Do need to talk to you [noise] um so you know you want to always let someone now who your suspect may be\nExperiencing violence um or maybe that you know is experiencing violence that you that you can be someone that that can help or you're you're willing to do what you can't help them um and to dance to listen to them and to believe them if people do if if someone shares are discloses violence at their experience\nMy mug goodness my my my goodness so what I'm what I'm hearing you do a sheer in terms of giving you kind of sketchy and you're kind of outlining kind of giving us your term was red flags yeah you know these are you see these kinds of things that might not necessarily be indicate order\nBut there there are some things that should make us say okay let me perhaps a look into mhm look into this this situation\nI'm I'm interested in and I I don't know if our callers are are thinking about this but I'm I'm really really wandering the you know this whole idea of a virus I I Love the way you're explaining it and you\nYou you're talking about it in a way that doesn't necessarily mean that someone was actually being punched correct our our our ... for a walk or you know um would you want to say more about that\nSure um and I didn't just speak to them but obviously that is probably the most common and an often thought of type ... his physical violence and you can see bruises and black guys and cuts\nI didn't disputes with them but obviously that is probably the most common and an often thought of type ... write his physical violence you can see bruises in black guys and cuts and bruises and things like that\nUm but recognizing that there are multiple forms of violence and the violence is is rooted in um in abuses rooted in power and control ... any way in which someone is using their privilege um their status\nTheir strength um to take advantage to to to control another person\nUm to not allow them to have their own voice or agency is a form of abuse\nOr some may be more agree just or worse or more um you know just as difficult or or frightening than others um but there's you know it's still a form of abuse and\nAnd in any any type of power and control um any way in which that happens you know there there's not there's there's wheels and their descriptions but honestly there are so many ways in which someone can be a ... abuse can be used against him or violence can be used against them and recognizing that\nUsing power control against someone is a form of violence yes yeah without using it though it may not be physical I'm taking advantage of someone's money again going back to elder abuse which is very common with with abuse with with older adults an elder adults um is a form of violence\nRude us that's powerful there and I want to\nAs as they say I Want to let that just kinda like just marinate on that for a minute you know\nThe whole issue of whatever we misuse\nPower Authority yeah influence our resources to manipulate to control the vide you'll meet someone else's agency right\nYou know you know I Love that kind of language I Love what that ... was looking into those kinds of things were going to talk about that when we come back on the other side we go to pick somebody is called us up for zero for eight\nNine to two seven zero three we're going to go to the lines and we're going to see what you're
