Adrian is in the building and we're talking about the trauma\nAnd after effect of sexual harassment we also watching the last Fifteen fourteen Thirteen seconds of the falcons game where up thirty six thirty one and I believe it might be old burglar\nOr yeah it might be because they were running on fourth down\nLet's see let us he hopes less so we need this way and we need this way but Dr Adrian I tell you you know if you turn on anybody's TV if you you know look on any digital platform including W A L caves and V. what oh threes\nYou'll see some form of sexual harassment being talked about\nYet and you know I think that with social media and just the media in general are providing us with so much information these days\nKnow I often question is it really that we have more harassment going on or is it just that\nOn or is it just that we have a platform where we see it more\nAnd so I think it's just that we are able to see it more I think it has always existed\nAnd when you look at some of the statistics concerning sexual abuse and the actual harassment they're pretty alarming and um have always been present mhm just didn't have the same outlet to talk about it right right\nRight I think I think that I think when when we talk about social media and we're talking about the Internet\nI think that has been just like you said the vehicle in which a word can get out right whereas that have been times in which things have happened but because we don't have we didn't have that vehicle other than you know thirty five years of radio or or TV or things like that\nThen you didn't you couldn't you didn't get the information right now the information is available to you so in light of the bill Cosby's sentencing and what he is convicted for\nHow can we overcome some tragic circumstances such as rape sexual ... a sexual assault and mobile station in order to build\nHealthy relationships again with our mates with our partners in significant others\nSo I Want to start by just kind of talking about some of the statistics that are out here so that I can provide some context of 'em and started with defining sexual abuse\nBecause sexual abuse is any form of sexual violence that includes rape child molestation incest and simulate forms of any type of non essential non consensual sexual contact\nSo Ninety percent of all rapes are committed against women one in six women in America have experienced rate\nOne in five girls and one and twenty bullets experience childhood sexual abuse forty four percent of sexual assault victims are under age Eighteen and of those twenty percent\nAre abused before age eight while those are some alarming ... scary\nBecause I think about that group of women yesterday in that room and so if we were to count all never six person in that room has probably experienced some form of sexual assault sexual abuse\nAnd you know a lot of times it's because it's not talked about and even with the me too movement the me too movement actually started in two thousand and six ... but it has gotten a lot of a lot more\nPublicity because of the things that are going on with people who have such a higher stature mhm and that that is the reason now we're starting to hear more about me me too but it's been around for very long time over ten years\nYeah yeah I I remember when um the young lady talked about in and and um\nYou know she didn't get the response like she should have gotten ... or because she didn't\nHave a a a ... a ... caliber of life right that you know could have pushed it to the levels in which it is now and and\nSo now I go back to the question that I\nThen\nKnowing that six of those ladies you said that we're in the room with us\nYesterday morning could have possibly been affected by rape sexual assault molestation or any any of those then how do they and anyone else even build healthy relationships from that\nHere's the thing joy you know when you start talking about trauma that has occurred in childhood and especially\nWith regards to some sort of sexual abuse trauma\nYou have to have a support system because most people will not come forward and they don't come forward for a variety of reasons a lot of times is because there's a fear of some form of reprimand and\nOne of the ... most glaring reasons is because if the\nThe person that has\nCreated the effect is known by the victim ... a lotta times they will not called for because they don't want to see that person get in trouble\nThey don't want that person to be hurt by some sort of criminal charges being brought against them because a lot of times when the offenses a car\nIt's by people that the victim no and so that makes it even more difficult but there has to be a level of healing that needs to take place and of course I'm a proponent for therapy and I'm always going to say\nYou know you got to go on talking to somebody outside of your family because it takes a lot to process through somebody hurting you in that way [noise] Mm yeah\nMm you you you you talked about um a person not wanting to come forward ... person not wanting to talk\nOf person not wanting to say I've been harassed I've been raped and I've been whatever that that trauma a has been to them then you know from your perspective what could you say because it could be some people that are listening right now\nYou know and here's the thing a lot of times what people don't realize even with Dr Ford who had to testify\nAgainst a missed a cabin now when you have to recount that story it is almost as if you are being pushed right back into that place and that a lot of time\nDiscourages a lot of people from coming forward because it's hard enough that you had to deal with it but now you've got to be put in a position where you've got to explain it to someone else\nAnd a lotta times people are accusing you of being dishonest not telling the truth and especially when you're on a public spotlight but even when you're not\nIt's still a shame that goes along with that and it's the question of\nDid I Do something to calls this a fence towards me\nAnd so people don't have the support that they need that makes them feel comfortable to say\nYou were the victim right who didn't do anything wrong right has nothing to do with how you address right where you were walking who you know who you don't have nothing to do with that nobody's fines up to be abused to receive any form of you know what when when\nYou have had some type of traumatic experience in that sense and you know\nThat you want to move your life for you want to try to live you as as middle Duvall said live the best ... that you can but you know that you've got this\nThing that you know that you haven't really a tactic and and and help yourself in in in the way that you should\nWhen we come back then are you being fair to the person that you meet in hopes of having a future\nWith that mate with that part of new with that significant other when you know that you would have had this traumatic experience and you haven't had the treatment that you should have had is that being fair to the person that now got to deal with you and all\nA community of women entrepreneur supporting one another connecting with one another and being able to do business with on one another and it really kind of started from there because well we have our meetings and even I'm always trying to make sure that you connect with another sister because we do this thing together\nAnd I support her really came about with us\nI'm really focusing on how do we connect women business to women business and so then we started talking about what other ways do we support each other and\nWe want it to be specific so support is an acronym and I'm so F is for how do you show up for her you as for how do you do night and collaborate with her ... how do you pay it forward to her\nThe other pie is how do you put your money where your mouth is\nFor her because we all say oh I'll support you you got a business on about every button in front of it but also for a Jew I'm old is for how do you open doors for her art is for how do you reveal your resources to her and tea how do you train and mental her wow big round of applause\nFor that and they can afford then\nAll the women around the table then why is it still hard for women to be support ... why is that still hard from from from your opinion\nWho ever want to start back in ... I I think it has\nHad a lot to do with the fact that we have a adopted a competitive spirit Mm I'm not understanding what it means to be in the same room with um different individuals and appreciate the difference and uplifting won and yeah\nSo we automatically began to say oh well we had the one up another individual or feel like that they have to you know surpassed someone versus understanding the fact that it my sister to the right of me is doing great there were all doing great mhm\nMhm mhm anyone else when it comes to agree with a first lady\nUh I think I just always have grown up with a supporting you know just the support him on his beard and I am all about supporting the black women and just like businesses and really all businesses but\nBecause I think as they are very important for us and again it is about the competitiveness and um I feel that we're moving forward towards moving away from that I'm sending more and more I think with all the empowerment\nIndustries and and and the ministries and the different just a groups and for the platforms that people have now I'm seeing that we're moving from that anyone else\nI just want to throw in a went Becky described are in and told us what the acronym is I mean that's powerful right and I made me you know I kind of worship Becky a little\nBit [laughter] but my black fashion [laughter] I Would have had a mammoth [laughter] but\nYou know what I realize is that we need each other and we knew we maybe we're coming in to that realization I think that's what worked so well with us here in around this table\nIs areas like past relationship there's no competition there is a genuine desire to lift each other up and to help and support intangible ways not just by our our words but um I think we're getting there it's slow it's slow\nBecause we historically have been in competition with one another no matter what your field is no matter what\nUh the the the the feel of expertise you may have is is that I got to pull you back so I can lift the myself up\nHigher and so I'm thanking God for the revelation that we are one we are women here supporting one another so it's a pleasure to be a part of a such a powerful group of women\nYou know just one of the things that we we had a conversation when we were taping the the commercial for I support her and we started to have a conversation and\nThere's a couple of things I realized that came out 'cause I asked that question why why do you think women\nDon't support each other was a struggle and several of the women that were there said they're big a issue with supporting women it stemmed from their relationships with their mothers Mm and that was like OK so tell me more and it was really about a a a bad relationship\nThat made them kind of push away from from a a supporting other women and that just continue to manifest itself during their life because one of the things that probably hurt my feelings the most is when I hear\nOther women say I don't do women out of I mean that I Do I mean that just hurts my feelings and and any Yvonne ... von ... has said it perfectly does something in you know that you're not supporting as another woman but that was one of the things that came out of that conversation of women supporting other women\nBad relationships with their mothers in their family and one lady shared\nFrom a mental health standpoint um she couldn't support any one woman man anything so she just steered away from from everything and it took her going and getting some help and other women loving on her for her to really finally put our guard down yeah I Know I I had a recent ...\nThe Jewish and um that um someone spoke a about um treatment and how they were being treated and they made it public you know they made it they put it on social media\nAnd I was like so what are you what are you looking for when you put it out there publicly\nWhat are you looking for and I hope that you receive it yeah because it could have been something that could have just been\nPersonally discuss yes and so so so my question is and when we come back and I want people who are listening we are live now we are live for for eight nine to two seven oh three when you do not\nSee and want to support and you put bad Vides out there what do you think people are looking for ... ... women particular learns the what are you looking\nFor because we're a bunch of course up here and we need to help the whole purpose of assistance getting together is to be of support in to be of help and we have to speak out our truth and we have to be transparent and things and\nAnd when I saw this on Facebook and it was it was pretty much directed towards me I did not respond to it and I have not responded personally\nBecause I Hope that she got what she got and and and you got what you got but I Know at some point it has to be a conversation because we are we had been too close for it to cause a relationship to be\n... ... and

I'm not\nI'm not just represent powers um power the exercise of the boss or manager a supervisor I've seen it when it was a matter of having the uh the deciding vote in your last one to vote on the matter and if it comes out to another woman versus another\nAllow that doesn't happen on November six in a in a way that we see you know history can be made and have the power to help make that happen you know it it it because the\nVote will come from us mhm I've seen both I mean I've seen you know women used their power not for good but I've also been fortunate enough to see women used their power to open doors for other women and I've been truly blessed even to corporate America to have\nSome amazing women open the door for me to get to the next level and the next level and you know one of my boss told me and she was she was a white woman and she pulled me aside and she said ... you have you have what it takes and she said uh I'm it's not going to be easy shift\nIt's not going to be either she says not going to be easy as a woman and she said is not going to be easy as a black woman and she said I'm a white woman and I know how this this world works and I know there's some things are going to have to deal with it I'm not going to have to deal with\nSo here's some things I Want you to do and she just I mean and everything she said I was I think you got and I was on I was on top of what she said because she was paving away to open the door for someone not based on color but based on a skill that I had that she\nUm that she saw so I I think you got good and bad on both sides of the table people who will take the power and run with it uh negatively and those that were used their power for good to really be able to help and support and pull another woman up with them mhm from a person\nA Delores who is the president over an organization that is out there to do for women period to the best of their abilities\nThen what do you see from your standpoint when it comes to the struggles or the communication between women in ... in hopes of empowering or you know having some type of a issue with\nI think a would definitely try to be out in the community and we try to Randolph sales which we try to be out there and people understand who we are I think a lot of times and and there's some negative things out there that you'd be surprised of\nThere are people who feel that we're not inclusive a\nAnd which is not true uh\nAnd so I think they have to be educated learn about the people who you're around are you trying to associate with a B on your circle so say if women are trying to be a part of an organization like our organization I find that\nThey don't go and research they don't try to learn about the organization but they want to come you know meeting Greece try to get in and then I'll find that when they do get and\nThen there's all these issues that you didn't read it because they're not reading than not understanding they don't research and then not listening ... and ... and those a lot of issues that I have that I buy in\nAnd out it's just a lot of misconceptions out there about women organizations and were definite just about empowering women mhm and I think they miss understand our organization and we're about advocacy\nWork we're not a social club and that's a big misconceptions and they come in making what we just going to a party and get dressed up [laughter] that's not what we were you know we work in areas of education probably deposit and an empowerment of when ...\nWhen I Want to get to what does it mean to be equally yoked ladies\nMhm and Ken a couple of survive if they are not equally yoked well\nIt's hard to survive it [laughter] [laughter] but I mean come on and so I can\nImagine the walk that if you're not equally yoked what you're going through what it is that you have to face because you know with God all things are possible and you can stand on his word and you can stand on his promises for your marriage for your family and stuff you have one person is all God\nAnd one is not that that's a struggle you know where you have one person that has a totally different a perception of what\nThe um the husband and wife relationship is supposed to look like you know that that that trouble you know and so those are the things that you're supposed to kind of find out beforehand and if we're not walking on that same\nAnd I said well I Want to let tell you that so and so is um is pregnant and so my daughter goes oh my God [laughter] you know and and I was like well um and so my son um tags and he's just so interesting that he's hate it was like she never\nHad a birth control [laughter]\nIt's hard to him I said you know he's eight\nAnd he says yes mommy everybody knows about birth control and I was like oh my God\nOh I I had missed the conversation here my my son knows about birth control and then so then my daughter says I mean you know why didn't she youth protection and so I said\nYou know about protection [laughter] and so we're talking about an eight year old an eleven year old and so there are having these conversations at school and so we haven't had this conversation at home and I'm like oh my gosh I Want to know how much they know if I\nForget them separate and southern Jackson says we've been waiting for you um for the longest but you just tell us what they came from you know\nThey've been waiting to have the company but your eighth right and you write in Lebanon mhm so um I think ... I think Todd said it when they started asking questions about you know where they came from that is a good time to start developing for conversations we've been saying\nWhere they come from you know that God brings and you know I've just been very creative with that but these kids know a whole lot and so they didn't have access to they have\nSince they had asked no matter how much you try to put the cold on anything that ... that is at eight and he led because they can't get to it some of their friends can sit here and and so they learn a lot of what they think they know and so I I'm a firm believer that you got to go in early\n[laughter] hey I was\nAnd they know that their parents have it to you know so there is you know some idea that well um do you oh that's so funny you and dad have sex\nAnd so my daughter times they get they they did it on the anniversary\n[laughter]\nI had to nip it in [laughter] that was that was that was just for us that's fascinating\nBut it just lets me know like how much do you think it's going over their head\nIs not going on and it's not\nGoing over that yeah they do this and I had a parent want a teacher actually and I had our son and my class and he went home one day it was five years old wants to know about sex babies I'll never forget it she came and she told me they she and her husband sat him down had that talk and everything and then he\nSays and she says babies\nCome from this and we had sex and then out of that game our three children you're one of them\nAnd he said well good then you only did it three\nTimes [laughter]\n\nOkay [laughter] I ... I I did because because of the conversation that they have\nWith you and especially if you put it in a in a position to where they know that they can come to you for anything and that's to this day that twenty two year old steel comes with everything in it 'cause he knows that he can you still going to be a parrot and you're going to answer according to\nBut I'm thankful that he knows that he can come and so given all came early and I came back [laughter] let me share that with [laughter] so I think I think when they're ready\nTo to to be able to understand it you gotta you gotta have the conversation your kids\nA man [laughter] lord they said they was waiting maybe [laughter] we my wife is from your experience\nBecause all of your experience ladies in here from your experience what do you think men is getting wrong when it comes to understanding the woman\nKnown to be quiet now just go deep bond\nRelationship talk you know some day [laughter]\nI'm not saying we just want to be equal and [laughter] and I I don't know how you\nFeel you up here I'm Down here I I just want to be equal ...

A. okay the voice of the community listen I think that we're talking about something today that is a very real issue\nIn our communities and you just heard the\n... up there that talks a little bit about intimate partner violence and um the the black community and specifically talking about the black church and and in many ways how it raises this question for us about our churches are religious organizations and\nUm why why this issue you know it's just so important because um you you've heard it said on the show was before the Pew Research center on religion talks about how how black folks say a religion plays such a creep a key part I'm almost a critical part in our in our lives eighty six percent\nI think that's the latest figure that the Pew Research center put out and so often so often I'm I've often wondered how does the rhetoric the preaching a lot of the things that I see in here in the black church and even stuff that I've encountered with Islam\nYou know how might this promote you know intimate partner violence does it doesn't promote it does it prohibit I mean because you think about it so many times you hear this rhetoric that talks about and I'm gonna lay it out there and I noticed might get some of us a little upset that that the man is the head of the house he's the spiritual leader and\nAnd that the good wife a godly wife what is she going to do is she going to support her husband she is going to in some kind of way be there to put up with what is going on she's going to\nHide her pain she's going to deal with her issues in her home and and and and and I think sometimes the church creates this idea in women were that's what you're supposed to do while at the same time ... that means somehow and know that it's okay for me to to behave and that type of\nThat type of way and so I I'm I'm Wondering what you think about that what do you think about the role that I that I Will face\nYou know in terms of shaping our coal vantage Kathy how does it you know promote this this this foolishness\nThat are called intimate partner violence fall for it now to to seven zero three I'm going to go to the mind and I think I'm going to hit I'm going to hit my button number four number four Nicole hello how are you you know what I'm so happy now that you are on the other end how you doing\nI'm good and I'm so sorry I missed your show last week 'cause I looked at the um the comments and then I saw the um the you all the you know they'll face but the lab and ride around the sun glad you're kind of repeating that this leak or containing the conversation\nThis is one of the status as bothered me the most men have been reading up on it um the CDC published I'm a I'm an article about it and it goes across racial lines it's humans um\nIt gets some leverage to me I mean it's it's hard to break down the most of the women who were found that most limited murdered\n... percent it's done by intimate partner across racial lines of course\nThey've had for African Americans at a higher percent than anybody else on now but I I just know it's a problem period and I really don't I'm Glad you're bringing up because I really don't even know how to have the conversation on what to say it is a bother me at all and then the thing about it also said that\nWhen women get pregnant this does something to somebody and that's the that's the main person the kill a pregnant woman is the person they got their breath in it and then never\nTouched me but I I Love that you're opening the conversation I call because I knew people going to call and then I'm going to get at the beginning even have anything to say but you know stop a bothered by it I don't even know what the conversation should be how to being what to do I've never been in that type of relationship\nI've never been in that type of relationship um but it it bothers me that a man would put his hand on a pregnant woman like the ... to the point of gets you know really well in life I'm into true crime pot smoking light I'm oh yeah\nOh you know law and I I I like what you do you you're doing a good job it\nRight and well I'm listening to these true crime typecast they had which mainly to concentrate on white on white crime it bothers me that people of color and highlight but what about our top now south top of my dad about it I was saying what I listen to this I was a white woman\nI Would leave the house up\nListening real that CDC study a woman period I don't even need to leave the house I mean do you know this is where we're from that part of your brother or your father uncle people that are supposed to be close to us as women who we should have to depend on people with people we give our bodies to you know what I mean\nYou know I Do and I I sometimes I Wonder do Nicole I warned about our churches and what role does our churches in in in ... where this is acceptable were were that women are somehow or another somehow the redwood makes them think that these polls to\nOr they don't have any personnel to have to make sure that say anything to\nAllow 'cause you don't and I but I really love that you inserted the religion and the church and especially with the black community them independent on religion and the church with so much mhm I Know if it hadn't been for Jesus ethically and I tell people in a minute these last four years I Would not have made it so\nI just I really love the ... how does that play into this and I hope we all get will serve because this is this is just devastate them to read it and just know that the men in our lives whether it's in the not somebody has a ... that is so daunting\nThat are doing this to us it is it's like ...
