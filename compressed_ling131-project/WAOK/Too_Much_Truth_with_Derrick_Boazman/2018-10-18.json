A. okay the voice of the community calling for for eight nine to two seven zero three gets involved in the conversation\nOr makes you guys uh stay a prize was going on in the news 'cause I think the Saudis situation um is going to escalate quicker than I think the president intends uh whereas he thinks it's a minor minor issue involving\nA one journalist I think on the international stage wants the United states begins basically selling out our uh our residents he's not a citizen but resident\nUh in order to maintain deals across the globe it does not look good on the global stage uh so I don't think this is one of those stories is going to die out quickly you know this isn't Kavanaugh and being drunk at a party forty years ago this is the one being dismembered and murdered\nOr in the U.S taking no action because we don't want to mess up a arms deal and I don't think that's something the international community will stay in four\nOh one thing that I think is very interesting I think we also have to ah to look at\nIs the the twenty Eighteen midterms are going to be the preamble for twenty twenty of course\nAnd with that what we see is\nThe Democrats have that yet articulated a message there not not yet articulated anything that will give any confidence to anyone to the idea that there'll be able to pull out the Senate and twenty Eighteen or the presidency and twenty twenty\nIt will be nice if they would I Know I Wish they would but as of right now there's nothing to indicate that they have anything along those lines of an ability to do so\nOr they don't have any clear messaging give somebody you can call in and tell me exactly what the democratic messages for twenty Eighteen besides Trump is the devil\nAnd I don't think that you all the way there I don't think that there's enough hatred to make it interesting but it was not enough hatred around the country to win an election just on Trump is the devil\nThere has to be more there has to be a clear plan on what you would do differently and with the economy going well right now how is your plan for what to do differently would not destroy the economic progress we've made\nThere's plenty of things out there to talk about even talk about the exploding deficit were Twenty one trillion dollars and talk about the fact that all the tax cuts at one point five trillion dollars or a trillion dollars in tax cuts went almost exclusively to the rich and have not trickle down to the rest of the economy\nYou can discuss the fact that the health care system is in shambles because the president decided to shutter most parts of Obamacare throwing things in the chaos\nThere's plenty of things to talk about but right now the only thing you're hearing out of them is calling me Russia um Kavanaugh spying dot CA those sorts of things that most people don't care about and the reason I think it's important for them to get this missus together now is that\nLooking forward to twenty twenty there's an absolute chance to President Trump could get thirty percent of the black male vote thirty\nFor to twenty twenty there's an absolute chance to President Trump could get thirty percent of the black male vote thirty percent of the black male vote remember being twenty sixteen he got Thirteen percent of the black vote but\nAt the same time you have to account his number as the the net number the aggregate number of not just the votes he got the decrease in votes for the Democrat over the they'll turn out from the previous election and black men simply put the not turn out for Hillary Clinton\nSo between the number of votes he got the Thirteen percent and the number of people who simply did not turn out because they weren't inspired are interested in the Clinton campaign Trump was right around twenty percent for black men\nNow how does that go up to thirty percent in twenty twenty well\nLet's listen to the speech by a con game and understand that it was not an insane rant as the uh media likes to tell you instead he was making severe pushing it points one point to key in on the part where he said this pet um makes me feel like a man\nThis ... gives me power of this ... makes me a superhero\nWhat are your ... something that you hear pervades Lillian barber shops in bars where black men feel like they are under attack by the media\nWere men in general field but they are now the enemies of America as spelled it by the progressive movement\nAll of a sudden you're guilty until proven innocent if you're accused of rape or sexual assault or harassment or anything along those lines you'll see you'll lose your job you you lose your family you'll get locked up like Cosby did on unconfirmed allegation from twenty thirty forty years ago\nThis how many men are thinking today\nMany men also our understanding of the realities of the modern economy where women are more educated women have better jobs women have more money and there is no longer the patriarchal or understanding of society\nWhere the male is automatically assumed to be in a leadership role simply because he is a male or a male is considered to be the head of the household because he is male that no longer exist and there's a great amount of resentment around that\nThe PC nature of coach of our culture today is not conducive to inspiring men to as ... said feel like men\nConstantly being told you can't say that you can joke about that you can go over there you can look at that don't act like that would be quite put that you know don't go over there\nYou had a lot of grown men walking around him pet to death feeling not children\nAnd so when that happens the order automatically what occurs is a rejection of those things a quiet secret majority\nThat surrounds the nation on those things\nAnd some of these people who are the most adamant never Trump ... the ones who call him forty five that she do oh rank a tank that orange minutes so on and so forth no women I hate to tell you this and this may be a shock to your systems\nSometimes men lie and sometimes they lie because they hold an unpopular or uncomfortable position\nThat they don't quite want to tell you about so if you say late last pizza chicken he'll look over the who what you'll say we're not able to meet you in the house I Know what happened here look you know I don't know what happened either you say you only need a while I Know I didn't need it you short it could've been you\nAble to meet you in the house I Know what happened here look you know I don't know what happened either you say you know what I needed one I didn't need it you short it could've been you and they would treat you like you lost your mind because they don't feel like being in an uncomfortable position\nSo if you ask them are you going to vote for Trump oh heck no that evil forty five Cheadle orange mint is our number but then when they get into the voting booth\nIt's a different story\nBack remember back during the campaign when the video came out of Trump saying grab 'em by the you know what\nAnd everybody was outraged universal outrage everybody could not handle it how could he be so evil so disgusting so terrible\nYou get three due to gather and ask them do you kind of funny actually sounds just like something I Would say my friend who I've had that is that conversation that was they fought for bringing up the video it didn't affect the outcome of the election at all\nJust put several hundred billion dollars into the military which means that we're ... we're the world's policeman so when you take the job is the world's policeman that means that a human rights abuses happening uh one one of your elbow on when you have to hold them to the fall you're on it that is your job you took the job\nThey are doing their own and glad to be a Gen Xer they are doing their own investigation\nMeals or two could do it into a room with Fifteen girls little bones or remember what do you mean they\nThey authorities over there I Do on their own investigation we have that money goes to the military was to build our military up to where it was supposed to be when Obama did not do anything for our military but say something about a\n... where would you don't have to do this or a wars remember those wars in Iraq and Afghanistan the Bush got us for no reason Obama got us all to be the best thing that you can do from the military or keep them all the stupid and pointless wars\nWell I still want to and that is not important for us to be worried about the saddest thing I think I think it's more important for us to worry about as far as like west optic caravan coming here we have so much going on in our own country we need to worry about us first and I'm afraid that wet everything I heard you say so far is actually very correct\nI Democrat in math is I've never voted Republican before I've ... I bought a car bomb us twice as old as far as that\nBut I wanted to not vote for him the last time but I just I was afraid my husband will be mad at me and stuff and my eyes have been wide open all that hate us come from a Democrat with no message is over everything you just said is absolutely true\nWe don't want these government control as we want to work we want to lift up ourselves and this is what's happening under this economy we want to work and feed our families I said that's all we want we don't want all this hate and Maxine call and for all of this discourse\nWe met that there is no Democrat and actually south I'm I'm gonna hang up but I'm a kid listening what haven't we\nHated him one day we usually meant scenes view and all the Trump does the exact same thing to a as a student for greater we're hoping to lock her up they still transit roads will both know knock the hell out of the winners were well protesters were both in the world\nIs the same thing as what my husband says what you just said earlier about you know you can have someone in the president's someone in the oval office cursing as someone saying grab 'em by the way to all of that stuff that came out people still voted for him why\nBecause the same old wiggle room message and nothing getting done was just tired\nI he's not my passport he's not someone I Want my daughter to marry I don't want my son looking up to him as a role model what I Do want is for him to get our country back focusing on us and I don't care about this side stuff ... I just don't want\nTo add a lot and I live\nBy it not healthy he he lp that's lesbians and gays half of them and now voting for him to walk away campaign so it is over he's getting more than thirty percent of the black vote for\n... to me more than Obama is going to run into historically any nation has been an isolationist\nHas not succeeded ... either you get economically destroyed or you'd get invaded you can't be an isolationist nation in a in this well Libya just won't work too we have to be involved in the international community because once we\nIsolation I thought I thought what\nMission in a in this well let me just won't work too we have to be involved in the international community because once we\nThe isolation I\nThought we were making nice with like Korea and all these other places\nThat haven't been able to find that\nWhen you say that the United states does not need to be involved in the middle east of me being involved with these foreign\nTo say that I Know we don't need to worry about this Saudi Arabia gentleman I I didn't have we have to have a license what her later\nIf you allow one thing if you are one journalist to be a security murdered or the way this drone was was then that makes it dangerous for every single journalist in the region or ... or ... freedom of press the entire region so then\nIt would rain that lack of rattle him ... home\nBring that back home if you like it but I think if I may talking about this one's ... than it makes advantage to everybody else turn it around and what's happening our own country you have all the mainstream media shutting down conservative voices whether that black leather white\nHispanic or ... that's a myth okay it's not what I was going to go in there and I got to\nStop at the end conservative and black and all my black friends that were all of them that they do for\nBeing conservative and blood because the biggest people own political social media\nAre all conservatives Jones Candace a whistle and canvas Owens Tommy lords of Charlie Kurt the biggest news station in the world right there'll be hard for news stations Fox News the conservative news they should be a best selling a\nRegular people ran if it's all media shutting down conservatives how would you do not have a big deal out of our old or conservative\nPull them all up Alex Jones jak Alex Jones got kicked off I don't follow him or whatever but most of the people that I Know that are black conservatives all that shadow bad and it's even in the news now even the mainstream media couldn't not report on it\nThey're shutting down anyone who doesn't agree with a socialist agenda and it's not going to happen it's over the black vote you might get a few still on the Democratic plantation but most of us have got our eyes open\nAnd it's a beautiful thing and the only way to fix the Democrat Party it's a break it down and rebuild it the our founding fathers always said that that that was fun to be more than one party that never got to be just one party\nLike no democratic were highly moral ducking down ...\n... ... that Washington expressly said he did not want there to be political parties at all because it causes such good which is what led to other European wars will be sixteen to seventeenth century that\nWhen I went up signing off on it or write that constitution when I found it and when I thought that was the Democrats and Republicans in that room I think it took him three months there worry and not run Republicans\nAt the time but go ahead\nMark had to put together the constitution and it had to involve more than one side very smart man and within the four corners of that constitution waiting now had a black president not just a Weinstein buffet southern constitutional rights you and me\nAll parties is never going to be what you were saying I'm all about that that is a Democrat Party is going to kind of ... and not be there anymore it's gonna be there but it's going to be right and you're not going to have somebody in there forever who want to keep talking and not doing that than\nAdults Copeland heading voted out at one when the constitution was written there could be a black president because we weren't allowed to vote and there were we were up to Iran\nOh it to one when the constitution was written there could be a black president because we weren't allowed to vote and there were we were up\nTo ramp up but I Know now that I now have\nParties live and die all the time political parties disappear uh all the time just like the reform party Ross Perot was no longer around\nAnd about going anywhere but a Democrat Patty welcome back strong it is to be broken down now like cleaned it come back in ...

I couldn't go to\nMake I mean it's a it's a major city I mean you're not come and go into making to try to make it big and just to name out there and you know I use a lot of personality coming into Atlanta for making on who they are and\nIt's a Hollywood like that yeah it's the higher it's literally is listening to one of the biggest cities in the south I mean you can't go anywhere in Miami Miami it's not as big as the land I mean it is literally this is the this is the south city\nBut we're so ... and that's always interesting to me why people think you come to Atlanta to make it a meanwhile most folks come here with NO PLAN or idea and they end up you know\nI'm living in swat somewhere trying to get by\nVersus their hopes and dreams and aspirations before they ought to be ... or ... or ... summarize for all my people and the other acronyms ... Kew was a liberal eight or many of us are going to leave it right there are we going to pass that what so what what why was that land to feel like it's such an accepting place\nWhere there's not that stigma that you will get before the ... places in the south\nI like again like I said I just think it's a bigger city by being about having so much diversity\nI mean it's it's just more of an open mind to kind of places everywhere else in the south there's literally one mind frame one culture typically when once you move to a place either you're gonna have to fit in or you or you're going to be excluded and that is one of those places where it's just it's diverse it's you can't have your own mind because everybody is from everywhere is literally the melting pot of the south well\nYou know it's interesting because a lot of people feel that the LDP CQ community has surpassed the black community as far as power and political influence\nThat you you know politicians have no problem tear down a black neighborhood or you know the sayings on saying or doing things that are discriminatory derogatory towards the black community but they would not dare trans grips\nThe gay community are are meant when they had the eagle raid maybe a decade ago and the whole city shut down when the police officers raided the the American Eagle a gay bar nightclub or wherever you call it\nBut meanwhile we'll have ready for that all the time on the side of town and nobody says anything why won't how have they been able to gangs so much power influence so quickly\nOr the thing about it in and and I and I hate to just strictly go with race but\nIf if if if if the gay community was just black I'm sure it has its name influence you know what I mean because we have uh the the um I'm just going to go ahead and take Caucasian or people that are more influence will in the community\nThat that's just what we get ... it's more power in it I mean like I say it back to the whole pride things black pride there's two there's the Labor Day and that's the American in Atlanta\nThey don't get as much recognition they don't even have a parade they literally shut down the city for what's considered white pride\nThere's the Labor Day and that's OK in Atlanta they don't get as much recognition they don't even have a parade they literally shut down the city for what's considered white pride we have a whole parade there's there's all these sponsored events and all this stuff is because the the the majority the white power is is involved\nSo you're saying there's just as much intersection or racism in the gay community as there is an district community\nThat the ... every single city every every every major city that has a pride has white pride what's considered white pride in actually is white pride is not call white price just call a gay pride and then Black Friday called black pride every single major city segregation still exists a hundred percent and the gay community\nBut into our once said except it was the mayor anything\nYou know because it seems like whenever something happens for the gay community but folks are expected to get on line and be part of that and fight for their rights when something happens in the black community or in the gay community are using some of these rich white gay guys raw demand and their mini Coopers to try to help us so was that ... was there nothing done about that\nBecause they can get away with ignoring something like that I mean\nI think in the gay community when\nThe gay community gets attacked as far as black and you just coming to the rescue I mean there are white gays as well being involved as well so they need to speak up and something needs to be done to do with the black community I mean white man see something I mean the black community and aren't going to say anything because they can get away with\nI mean honestly I be ... I mean of course they don't know the allergic to the straight guy he sounds ...\n[laughter] so for\nMe like I mean I I'm I'm the gay guy in the room and and and I've been to a a lot of different states and cities in it'd been involved with the gay community and I don't see where a lot of um\nWhite people really get involved with the um black ... I I I think it's the exact same issue is is two different wars is the straight um it's the straight black and white war and is it and it's the gay white black and white war\n... ... and so on on that point a or a ... or not the big too deeply ... when it comes down to the line when it comes down to you have an issue between the black community and the gay community where would you find yourself a form your alliance like who came down by ... we bought the fight we bought the rumble you pick a fight with Saudi you pick up\nSo this this this is my thing and I think this is where I'm black has always been big before the whole Black Panther movement and and the and I'm just going to choose a black or in general for me I feel like I'm just I'm just a peacemaker you know I I actually choose gay as gay\nAnd black ... and as as as a people obviously want I mean I'm I'm On both sides\nOr write another question why or why or why or why is it that are so\nMany men are on the down low in Atlanta when it's so so\nEasy being out in Atlanta I'm trying to translate Internet even OSHA yeah\nI so okay so for me and I and I I Can't just say it's in Atlanta because I mean honestly it's just\nIn the United states and and you can be open you could just be you could be free but I you know what I call the um DL man it's a coward you know what I mean it's just it's like you know you don't you don't you you you ... you still scared about what people think about you when you free and you you who you are under Moser lately yeah you know they just do you why why do you care about with somebody else thing\nBut the thing is in Atlanta since there's no benefit to being in the clouds it's like you get more benefits from being an openly gay man in Atlanta than being a straight\nI Am ... I Can't say that because you know a lot of gay guys still have this whole straight man fantasy kind of the this this this this thing this status so a guy that's in the closet it's just more appealing I I I Can't explain\nWhy is this is what it is break that down summer we meet you lost me lazy\n[laughter] okay so I like you again and I think it goes back to like\nI'm wanting to be out wants to be free want us to just just like your home girls in like high school middle school grade school whatever they're free to say oh my God this guy so hot I meant to him we didn't have that privilege 'cause a lot of people don't come out until later on ... and ... like in like maybe college\nSo when it gets to like the college years and they find is the guy who fits the exact same description as the guy in the past who is not like the gay guy\nYou know what I'm saying it's it's just like oh my God now that this fast is exactly what I Want to fulfill\nHas got we're there that Lacey I'm just letting you are now being lazy I fear observing I hadn't I Know those girls I Know those\nExactly what I Want to fulfill\nThis has got weird that Lacey I'm just letting ya know me lazy I fear observing I hadn't I Know those girls and all those girls they want the men [laughter]\nOr a question back on publishes wise\nThe gay community so cohesive on political issues while the black community so fractured well it seems like you're going to set an issue set an agenda and everybody's on it just like when they said we need to have gay marriage\nEvery gay personal just all that's exactly what we're doing that's the main thing we're working on right now you all just wrote that through all the way to you got it done so was it that community can be so cohesive\nBut black folks you ... you said an agenda item and you've got folks will you got to convince half the people that there is a problem then half once you've convinced you may have to convince them how the problem get solved then you have to explain to people that it needs to be solved in the first place so\nHow's it going to set an agenda in Europe like meetings like a leadership council live like an email chain or something where everybody gets the messaging\nNo okay so here's the thing like I say it will the gay community has a lot more powerful than the black community when it comes to getting stuff done because\nWe're bigger group because I mean it it's it's not it's not limited to suggest a race is literally a lot like it it's all coaches an outrageous but together and white people just power for me I mean I I I keep going back to might be because look at the whole Caitlyn Jenner thing a black woman come out let 'em let that Wesley Snipes\nCome out and say I'm transitioning into not the most ... you know let let him come out and transition he would have been criticized she would have had the hardest time ... came out as a hero and they gave the courage award SPs put on the cover of magazines them another year you know what I mean\nSo basically you're saying that it's that alliance with white gays that makes the gay community so strong\nI Believe it because I mean every wing me like when I go out to like like gay spots like in every city again\nWhite clubs ... totally different from black clubs I mean it's just it's just a whole it's just the whole thing it's just it's just it's the communities bigger from the white perspective\nThe black perspective just looked like the ghetto the ghetto neighborhoods clubs to get the get the ghetto gay clubs the ones where you go and they say in a way I Do know so Easter I worry about getting stabbed in a row you know what I mean\nOkay so we saw on the on that note is things that for people in the LDP T.

you are they are ...\nYou know in ... that that's exactly what they're doing but again like I decided to maintain some sort of a situation\nOr so demar how do you you know ... during the break you know and recalled Welby I Am delivery boy who went before the church and said no I gave him more um delivered and now he's run around with like a girlfriend or something like that so they can somebody be delivered from homosexuality\nYou know what I Would say this I'm growing up growing up in a church in uh saint the fat home with a glorified mother I uh I just I just feel like you know\nI'm One of the believers that\nYou're born gay you know what I mean so if if you can be delivered I mean I I think some people think it's a psychological thing some people can feel like they can be a uh I I I don't know I mean some people like\nThey can't be change some people think that they can they can change what what the into maybe become more sexually active with women I said I don't know for me I'd never been an insecure I ... you know I I Am I'm Glad I've always been gay proud I knew I was born gay and I was just I'm going to go slow\nYou know what I mean so kind of person be delivered to answer your question possibly but I think that you would definitely have to be interested in doing so and\nSo this is a a a question another Internet question before we go go back to the phone lines so if\nIf the if all it is it's a ... a preference for central desire was there a whole community in lifestyle was the thing that that will preference to find you so\nFor example if I say I'm attracted to dark skinned women versus being a threat to the light skinned women\nThat doesn't have any effect in my life deeper than the color of person that I'm attracted to but things that when someone is a threat to our headsets will preference for men than their voice changes the way they dress changed they socialize with changes it becomes a integral part of their identity as opposed to simply being what you have a preference for ... why is that\nYou know I Wish I Wish I had an exact answer for that I Would give you my opinion so based off just my experience with being a gay guy I Would I ... at an early age I knew that I was attracted to the guy so I Would say at our age of four years I'd rather checked into guys so I Would relate to what else I knew was it\nInto a new environment just I mean we I feel like we all do a lot of a in a black man it's a lot of people like to say I'm the term at white so I went when you go to interview a lot of people turn eight tiny white on I like to call it who they turn a coup known to get the job you know what I mean it's the same thing\nI don't think calling this the same thing is trying to take on a professional demeanor I think it's a whole different thing I think you want to put it all in the same category but it's not an insane\nSo what's the difference between what I was just talking about what the purpose of professional demeanor I mean coming coming in coming in a little flamboyant is just not consider in society right now I mean really that professional it it it is still frowned upon one right but what I what\nI mean thinking that you can wear the same math anywhere you go right but what I'm not a huge\nUsing that same logic in a in a real masculine male with a high tone and its porch and using that same logic would come in and modify himself\nTo fit into that environment you really validate in my part but you're not seeing ... going to explode after they a lot of it I think a lot of it is\nSocial engineering I'm not saying that you say have their social lives in it but I'm thinking that the lifestyle of homosexuality and the growth and the spraying and I'll take a lot of it is just socially engineered\nOf it so it's been here in Atlanta okay the second thing is you mentioned the point that nobody else mentioned about Eric Holder\nEric cold I Wish people would do some research on Eric Holder and think about him for the president Aaron hold him before he became an attorney general he was a big time lawyer I Know you know this fall or in New York with the big big ... who fault for\nThe ... center so that's why I have mine is in a way he has been properly train all during the Obama a time that's why a lot ...\nThat's the next next point and then the third most important point is the reason why why in hope is that there's a lot of ... after that it's about ... about voting\nAnd the reason why is because we use the word accountable but we were we'll ... we'll let out fishing there ... there are\nConcerned black her to go to the church and the knowledge that we feel like we have done our job we're like what we need a think tank somebody like you were ever walk not the rubble and more house or\nA back history class and so while some people who are independent who could have a thing and track these people but I feel we get home from a town of been\nTracking these people as they go\nAnd they know that we have this track and all the ... uh that's what it is and the main reason why we have not\nSolve the vow or a a a pressure internal pressure\nSo hello Yes sir I I Hope that it was a lot I say it but I Hope that you can identify that our our whole in because you know I got the friendship that you were saying that you still pick owl calls and it was\nImportant because I knew I Would have after you get all the time you need a good you know so little\nYeah and I appreciate that but we got I mean really we've got to change our way of looking at how we vote it read this book about it and that thing who are ... Obama and anybody else we got the holding them accountable and on and what you don't do that is have a think tank hit album\nThat I think I'm above because they're about\nTo ask her father ...\nRubber Wilma Vaught did maybe seven but I'll go by and visit them and is already going to go to Richard online to Richard [noise] hey Derek I think you might be talking to me ... which one are you\nI'm just fine how are you today well we'll just an amazing topic I really enjoy listening to this I'm I'm a straight white guy and I I'm a have be supportive\nOf a equality I'm and I'm happy to see the uh the gains that have been made a just in recent years\nA and I I picked up the phone to call you just after the loan exchange with the caller\nUm who had reference to leaky alone in a a an Adam and the Bible a lot and so um I thought your gifts did a very fine job of keeping the gentle what the way it is it\nYeah he he was he was wrong\nOf keeping a gentle\nWhat they went into yeah\nHe he was he was wrong and mistakes okay let's see what I Want to make sure I said with a lot of love is that there was there was some wisdom in what he was saying\nOh he lost his school a little bit but there is the wisdom and what he was saying in a there's a lot of wisdom in the Bible that I just cannot discount lord knows I live my life\nI'm not really a quarter of what his wishes would be but um I Believe that God\nCreated gays it's lucky created us and I believe\nAnd complete the plenty of Manhattan so might as well learn how to get along\nI Know that's right 'cause I'm going to come in with a whole glamour roe\n[laughter] but it's also recall Richard\nThank you thank you\nAll right and and so on that point what why do you think people are so interested\nIn how other people live my my whole thing with people who are like actively homophobic is what does that have to do view what he's doing over there I\nAm not saying that you have to get up there to be at the parades and be all up around it but why does it actively bother you or someone else is doing what why do you think that is\nA\nAlgae no they are not good for radio [laughter] they'd go if anything I mean they're\nProbably upset about something else now is like what like like literally like that they would with their own life worried about somebody else's and somebody else's anybody's tell you what you're doing wrong with your life so I can avoid taking responsibility for\nMy it made me where somebody will be you know on their third marriage five felonies or no money\nUnemployed drunk at the bar and say look at the nasty games over the you know what I was like what does that mean I just\nPosted the other day and I found hilarious and it said um it was the straight person acts how can you explain to a child that they had two daddies and they gave responded how can you explain that you've got three baby that is\nYou know what I mean well I I I've had the age of no big thing is just get your own stuff together and just don't worry about other folks housing on your road to acceptance you have to at some point say you know what it ate my problem whatever they're doing over there\nI don't want to know and I'm not involved in it you know and just let it be like that the difference when tolerance and acceptance is\nTolerance is I just don't care what you do it I can you do what you do is right steps is why after we come in and want to be part of notes and understand it become more active but at least give folks tolerance where you you know either what you do when I went to ...\nWith somebody else is going that absolutely nothing to do with the with like for what you might as well just get along and\nSay right now when it comes to me they got the right one All right we're going to go to a break after the break we have jihad labor king in Antwon Rose calling for a for eight nine to two seven zero three news and talk Thirteen eighty W.
