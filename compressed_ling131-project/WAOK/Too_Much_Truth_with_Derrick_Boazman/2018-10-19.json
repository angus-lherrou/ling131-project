A. okay the voice of the community called in for for eight nine to two seven zero three so during the rubber pillow sitting in for their Bozeman\nWho was on those higher fees will be out when I have to find myself a good radio side hustle I mean I feel like everybody else got all kinds of the other stuff going on to use their platform to uh you know get a couple of dollars in a pocket\nSo y'all let me know what I Need to be doing because this whole working things overrated I mean severely over it never look ... not not to to rent on people but I have a client who I've represented for ten years 'cause he stays in trouble once a year for ten years\nOr the last case he had was a Twenty one town felony case or they were trying to put him in jail for Thirty years\nSo of course he didn't serve a day literally not are we're not a minute in jail um you know most of their charges dismissed beat the other ones and so he held me around thirty thousand dollars now you know former NFL player so he got it I called his brother today he says man you know\nA man I had to pay my other lawyer so knob broke right now\nAlmost drove off the road\nSo you paid your divorce lawyer but didn't pay your criminal lawyer you do realize that if you are in jail you ain't gotta worry about No Child support or alimony or anything else that you're in jail for Thirty years I feel like that should be the priority\nIn your bill payment plan a strategy not you know the other way around you know I see a cell phone is still on your on your Facebook page at like eating good you know ... destitute living in a box\nYou know maybe I'm the one who's wrong maybe I misunderstand but you know that's part of the job when you were practicing while you kind of have to just do it and then hope that somebody decides to pay you when it's fair to the lord touched them and just the right way in order for them to be compelled by that spirit\nTo actually pay their bill and unfortunately you can sue them and then do follow the bar complaint claim malpractice than do end up suing you back and you'll still never collect the money\nYou can send them to a collection agency we all know how well that's ... that works well they do is just keep calling your phone\nOr even if you do get a judgment against them is almost impossible to actually get any money from them so these are things that don't really tell you on ... bill law and order any of those other lawyer shows you just kind of assume lawyers get paid for the work they do but generally speaking if you click thirty percent of what you Bill you or have done an amazing job for this year\nGoing back to the phone lines one thing we decided to them lazy and I try to look up the actual ages of the people who are talking about running in twenty twenty\nSo you've got John Kerry who was born in Nineteen forty three during World War two who is Seventy years old you got Joe Biden\nUncle Joe who was born a year before John Kerry during World War two in Nineteen forty two who was Seventy five you got Hillary Clinton you know she's a young buck ovum she'll born in Nineteen forty seven and she's Seventy years old\nAs long as these people continue to soak up all the money in the party all the airspace all the room\nIs very difficult for new voices to bubble up remember even an oh eight Obama they told him to just go ahead and be Hillary's vice president because he was too young to run in a no big deal combined ticket he said nah nah nah nah I'm gonna go\nOh they told him to just go ahead and be Hillary's vice president because he was too young to run them you know be combined ticket he said no no no no go ahead and do this thing now right now\nAnd so it may take something very similar to that in a in twenty twenty and away body will or Obama's running against Joe Biden's a senior statesmen Christ is God a senior statesmen Hillary Clinton a former senator former first lady\nAnd he had to go to overcome all of that why can't these people that are still going for the top spot themselves just moving to the visor erode that Graham who bought role you raise money for people you get out there and campaign for them you talk to voters you give them leadership mentors at when you set the agenda for the party\nInstead of actually trying to be the candidate yourself let some young folks come up we had a on a Presley Beto O'Rourke we got all kinds of a young and exciting candidate around the country who are really ... really really ready to step up into that spotlight but they can't do it\nIf you still have these stole work so the party or standing in the way not to say there's anything wrong with old people I Love old people I'm going to go hang out much Catherine uh after the show today because I feel like and he spends more time with her\nBut at some point in time you have to transition over into that leadership role that mentor ship role instead of simply trying to continue after these goals and dreams and aspirations you may have had from youth because there's nothing wrong with passing the torch on then go to Vincent on line for Vincent\nVenting there\nOr we go put vents and back on hold up think uh you can't hear us oh a sea of Lacey can get him on tomatoes or but on the same note regarding the ah the historical nature of not moving inside those understand that with President Obama\nDuring the time that he was president Democrats lost one thousand at forty four state local and national races over the course of that decade or the that eight years that he was in office\nBecause they didn't bring up those bootstraps under them remember when President Obama left the dean the with nearly broke a Donald Brazil's on the show earlier this year and she explained that when she stepped in AS Party chair person\nIt was impossible for them to have a a a a national apparatus because there was no money left in the party\nThen it ended up being they had to basically coal mingled the Clinton money with the DNC money which is why they were able to rig the primary against Bernie because there was no additional money out there for other candidates\nSo instead of the reason for this was the entire time that Obama was a was president these other folks were out here raising money talking the donors solidifying their grass from power\nIn hopes that they will be the nominee and twenty sixteen it destroys the party to prop up this many older states persons who aren't involved in day to day operations of the part and then we have Vince back\n... go ahead yeah can you hear me now\nAre All right you're right and see that we are random we're talking the other day about ... talking about being on get out of the way you know rather than crab walking and care a lot you know get out and make me think of John ...\nI really do I don't I don't when I hear ya I hear talk about is him come across the bridge and getting what\nYou know and all this year but I don't see the champions like you can't you can't be canceled fighters tomorrow he surrounding them and introducing us to a generation off ramp has a young lady in our community who is the ...\nOh he's around in them and introducing us to a generation I'm off ramp had a young lady in our community who is the national Action Network or you meant you know on TALK Mary pat\nGarrett yes yes and even more he'd eat conditioning her and she joined in other you even want to turn this over to turn this over to the mall and that's what has happened you're exactly right it's got it's it it if you don't develop any church you for tomorrow then you will we won't have no health tomorrow\nAnd you know just on that same no just look at the the civil rights organizations as an example\nSo many of the titans of the sixties and seventies or didn't bring up any book strip behind them remember wrote a Dr King raised a Reverend jets and the following his footsteps most of the other organizations didn't do anything like that so when that person died or moved on a retired or couldn't work anymore\nWell there was there was no organization was the cult of personality\nSo when they were gone the organization was going that's what we're seeing with the Democratic party as it slowly dies out because they will not invest in younger people coming up\nIn the format of unity within our our\nUm killer as people um\nDo you do you get what I'm saying by making it functional\nYeah ... ... I'm not that you don't just want to pass it on for the sake of passing it on your you know you're thirty eight years old so you get to be the person in line no I'm not saying that but I Do think that you have to start grooming people from a from a young age from uh like Reverend Sharpton didn't with Mary pat once he was I think twelve\nA source of studying under Janice when I was Seventeen or Eighteen or you have to start that training process to matriculate them through and so then by the time you were a golden age you can start you have the ability to pass it on to somebody who who's still have the same values and that will just you\nKnow we we have to change that dynamic from passing on to living out in growing into the cause I I don't want to pass all the ability to represent us with other people to anyone wild knocked\nThe developing an infrastructure with the remainder of the\nPeople see you know politics can make some ... out of leadership when leadership is Lee needed at all levels and we we lose focus on the the the wealth and it is an absolute wealth\nOf different levels of border we can be maintaining while we're also utilizing those who will be best suited to be ambassadors to other\nFolks and that's the difference that we have a highly melon needed people\nCheering ourselves from the tragedy that we experience as a people over the last few hundred years so our our elderly people have to be functional with so that we recognize going into that I'm\nLevel of ... and that's what we will be teaching about what sells services to ourselves we have to understand that things we are not teaching ourselves\nFor our students that are are being diminished because of focus on a picture that is not so much us but we are definitely a part of an affected by so\nWe've got to balance to keep while we have elders in young dynamic man like yourself who are right in the mix of success\nIn the outer realm of what our community in the inner realm as well you can do the work to make many more lawyers if we'd meet and hopefully we won't\nBut the the point being there's a balance for our people that doesn't exist with other people have the same manner they already have a an an established culture\nTo to maintain their cultural dynamic from we are creative people and create tours for our dynamic is\nIs coming out of the worst possible situation to create the best possible situation\nI ... just politically I agree with you there early thanks for calling these are going to Herman on line for Herman\nCain with the Daily Caller [laughter] ah what I say uh\nYou should call him he's arguing Herman on line for Herman\nSaying here today in the coal ah want to see for shorter than ... years old\nPeople boys here they don't want to move away and they want to on their head and says as we say always come and they all they really follow them later died of it\nIs it more people died in Chicago or day we read laws to understand and then ... ... ... and uh they uh\nUh you know I said to the aid that I Am Seventy namely ... here should move oh that must have\nThey had had a last week ... dominated by Republican Party needed to seniors out that are on my Tennessee had seen the medication and put it in the Senate in line to vote you know\nWe all I Know most of them was against their will you know ... ... ... you know a kind of straying hatred with that much now\nThat say ... investigate that who had paid for that but she had said that it be seen as a writer Dan Kammen three shaded McAllen is Roy Moore alright\nAlright thank you Herman or write one uh I don't you don't know what I was talking about if we can clarify please let me know knows is about a buck and a plot a so a Facebook group let me know what was going on\nAfter the break we're going to talk about women's health ... women from the center for black women's wellness a gym a Dorothy him as a pet who will be in here so stay tuned for that news into Thirteen eighty W.

A. okay if you're young and you're listening to do much truth with ... all news in town to eighty W. H. B. O. K.\nGoes the moral for eight nine ... to have an oak tree on news in top Thirteen eighty [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] oh that was in\nTank top summed up [noise] you wanna smoke don't smoke [noise] you saw something that you also watch\nYour tap married for race gender sexual assault the fact cannot Chaplin [laughter] what do you want to see\nSomething how much money on your list something fun\nTo watch I saw it will be one of the\nTo watch the fence so why\nWork on those calling for\nA nine to two seven zero three you know you got to be on a certain mood at losing the big ... just you know aggressive I mean that's a very detailed account of Robin old lady\nAh yeah man I might listen to some country music or gospel after that I got to\nClean my spirit calling for for eight nine to two seven zero three are making millions and Powerball or this weekend mega millions is over a billion dollars Powerball is like three hundred and Ninety million dollars of just letting them know you're not going to win\nI'm just been completely ... view there is no chance of winning there is a better chance of being attacked by dinosaur while trying to buy a lottery ticket then you actually winning the lottery what the lottery is is a reverse excise tax on the poor\nWhat my by that I mean that basically what the lottery does is convince people who have very little money that they should spend that money and give it to the government and then the government will use that to pay for its resources on the\nA one point seven trillion dollar tax cuts corporations named paying money millionaires ain't paying money billionaires ain't paying no money\nAnd that's why we have a two Twenty one trillion dollar national deficit and on the state levels in states can't run these same deficits they have to find a way to plug those holes in their budget a great way to do it is a lottery and casino gambling\nPlay on people's mental health in gambling addiction and then take their money their use their last four or five dollars that they spent on that they have\nAnd use that to sin rich kids to school because the GPA requirements for most states scholarship putting HOPE Scholarship disproportionately impact rich kids\nThis sounds like one of the worst Ponzi schemes on earth but somehow we fall for it year after year time after time and allow the rich legislatures because you have to be rich from those for it to be a state legislator because the state legislature doesn't really pay you anything\nAnd who has you know two months to take off from work to service the legislator unless you have your own business you're or you're independently wealthy so those are the people who make the laws for us people either have a economic support system that allows them to do so\nOr individuals who are just simply independently wealthy and they do it as a hobby\nSo they pass bills that benefit themselves so every time you're playing the lottery you were just putting money into some rich white person's hands with a the minimum is\nI mean the minimum is opportunity at ever winning and not to mention the you know why the loss of jackpots have been so much bigger the last couple of years you know every once in a while back in the day you have a hundred million dollar Jack Potter two hundred million dollar jet but doesn't seem like there's always two three four hundred million dollars now\nBecause the lotto change the algorithm result team fewer people winning per year which allows for them to have bigger jackpots build up\nIsn't that brilliant it sounds like it's a rigged game where they can just change the algorithm to allow them to allow the jet part to build up even higher\nSo stop playing their game stop being involved with the ... the make really tough governmental decisions made them make the tough decisions on cutting spending or raising taxes are finding some other way to support the government\nOther than raiding the pocket so poor old grandmas who they're going to make it with the lotto going about their phone lines where Walter online for Walter\n[noise] I don't I don't know where to start you have a cap is like um\nGraham laying or Jackson State\nUm you're saying that side of the old players you say Clark Clark should not be playing anybody but somebody on Clark's level\nBut North Carolina and went over to east Carolina handle business and I had no business pretty well and they get paid a sense it come forward and that six figure calm support the schools athletic budget\nAnd look it up right there that support the athletic budget but every year or so some little black boys gets his butt heads split open up her spine broken have run into these big old red necked doors so that sounds like sacrifice them plus\nPlus some black child at mass or tested does get offered so what does it make\nIt you know violent sport at those schools they have that toppled the line SEC now and I do not have the same money if they see you know they do\nThey have it but the athletes\nOf the line FCC and they do not have the same money if they see you know what they do they do\nNot have it but the athletes and their father athlete hey grandma jak couldn't stay in Arkansas piled up here just as big as a kid at LSU it's Carolina or they wouldn't be able to beat them\nAnd some of the games are competitive and some of them or not but the main thing is is that you're gonna get hurt by playing the sport Patel oh whether you're at any level plan to get anybody\nBut look like you got any absolutely no difference and run into in boys out there the bus they had opened it gives the big written the boys than they're doing it for valley horn them girls out to every businessman who\nWait a minute either you're doing this thing your whole body like\nDid you like this so lost a dear friends\nWhen your alma mater went down to Baton Rouge and they got they held handed to them by a sub them and they're not on the same level clock is much smaller school will solve that wants to debit between\nA choir going out there and getting crushed by southern or selling them coming up here are getting crushed by Georgia not then I'll pay\nThe difference is Nick Saban is the highest paid employee in the state of Alabama the Georgia football coach at the highest paid employee in the state of Georgia the Lsu football coach\nAt the highest paid employee in the state of Louisiana these folks are competing on a an entirely different levels Nick savings contract could take care of the entire hey you see football budget for the next ten years\nThey're dealing with a different kind of medical care they're doing for different kinds of trained routine they didn't want\nTo die for medication you love you're playing against NFL Owners\nBut tell out every other year you've set one child\nCan split open right now and again given Saturday they're getting split open Eddie ... white schools against other big why schools and I get a game and I just gave you a scenario to black schools\nThat are on our on the same level and wants to go against match but after that and you know have you know some of them coming in Georgia in Utah alone car going at Jackson State I Know you don't want that\nWell the only one the reason I didn't like the court versus southern game could have been and got blown up by plane from going back in the day but to you're still at least dealing with\nPeople who are on the on who are on a similar athletic level that was similar training where it's no it was you know what you want to look I'm Still doing well you know\nTo get him to school\nIn one school\nAnd the reason why an eight foot there isn't one double a football Clark getting loud debate on all the way they are they invaded two there are a lot of saying that and that's why the score a flag day while you're banned reflected it every day of like how much bigger sub any then cart\nShe did not do anything illegal she didn't say she didn't do it she says that it wasn't really looms or this that's not that's not a good sign when that's your lawyers defense\nBut my argument is I don't see how this has any different than as we said earlier sending our young boys out to play against these big FCC schools sacrifice their body in order to make a bunch of old man a bunch of money\nHow exactly is that different when one boy is breaking his neck or breaking his spine move to get ... hundred thousand dollars for the school and these girls are here doing whatever it is they doing to get to school money's all thrown out what what are you guys and cares what what's your opinion on this\nOh wow so that was the first okay All right so first of all what what was her name\nUm so the lady I I Will look it up for you okay I'm hiring us in her friend requests like yeah I'll just as I got a you know what I was one of the way anyway number one she's smart enough so I'm going to just unparalleled with with what you have she's smart enough to have at least somebody\nSix days with the ... so she had six of them and let's see what the seven correct yeah it's a it's a leash a genetic Johnson forty eight years old ... from Fort valley right so she had a game plan ... a lot\nThe football team or the bachelor the ... you see where I'm going to you know I think for at least they they really have something going on I think they really have good plans are but\nWord that she used that she didn't do anything illegal or so that's a little stretch\n... even if you read and write a story from a Ernie ... in a store just in the AJC but they really do detail all the charges\nA little stretch it out even if you read there are very story from a Ernie ... in a store just in the AJC but they really do detail all the charges against the individuals\nAnd well apparently is what's going on for a long period of time they just happened to finally get caught and have the case or matriculate to find out more information Jay what's your take on it\nMy first take when I first started this was wow um that's when you when you look at it yet at some point you have to look at things that you know maybe we went a little bit too far now in all fairness I'm\nFull disclosure I didn't go to college I went straight to the military mhm okay um I've heard stories of this their stories of that you always hear that stuff so I've heard of\nI'm not gonna name any particular sororities Marines anybody's um fraternities cars on along that hate mail ... rights but you know you hear stories of\nI guess for lack of a better word these young ladies being pimped out to these fraternity guys you know when they are sweet hearts or whatever\nDiamonds and so on to another or I don't want like I'm not I'm not as deep in I'm not deep into it because that's not my my space that's not my area but of course I have a lot of friends and went to college and\nWhat have you in um you hear about it and you know everybody in line so this is another level of it in the words of the great negro poet a temp see the game is deeper than just working off the\nBeep or you know this ... ... as with anything if anybody you've ever done anything there are different\nLevels to it so now we were at the levels at one point where just okay we're loaning them out to our\nFraternity friends the next level is a man you pay me I hook you up with her or were you know this is the next this is another or the next level where someone else's you know what you need this\nThey have this this is what you gotta do to get\nSay no I think also it's important that we mentioned the men who were uh who had warrants issued Tuesday we have Ernest Harvey

I hate to make this analogy but that was not a normal occurrence in Sandy Hook\nAs much as it pains me to say and Wade decision where desensitized to it we would because it was happening so frequently in ah Chicago it was a normal occurrence but first I was a normal occurrence\nFrequently in Chicago it was a normal occurrence but of course it was a normal occurrence so they're the reaction is going to be different and we have to be fair about it but\nTo be fair about a governmental at you can actually affect shootings in places like Chicago because those guns don't just look let's say on the side of the whole or don't get to it\nSo those girls aren't just grown up on the ground that cocaine isn't just growing somewhere on a ... a cottage grove but meanwhile the school shootings or almost impossible to stop because they're completely random occurrences that can happen anywhere in the country\nAnd any given time there's literally nothing you can do to stop them from happening you can't armed teachers can't armed security guard you can't hurt him to school so why didn't he addressed the two political issue that he could affect and fix which is violence in Chicago which governmental action could actually do is it a crime with little white kids\nWell um I Can't say too 'cause you make a good point he and I don't know about the government action everything fix and all that but you're right is she should've addressed it more but to marginalize the Sandy Hook shootings\nUm that that's yeah that's not fair well no that's not in your marginalizing that but in in again in the in fairness in the context that it was not a normal occurrence up there wasn't it wasn't anything that we see all the time so they're just going to be a different reaction you would agree with that\nI feel like we see school shooting wait a minute we were going to do that we have a final you agree with that are out I can agree with that but I won't say that we have enough school student where you're going to spend some points on white children suitable schools two or three times and I don't\nCare if they were white Chinese black whatever when you have this whole like I'm not finished when you have a school\nShooting that killed five and six year old children anything is tragic okay you ran mother is dying is tragic a a an eighty nine year old grandmother dying as tragic fifty nine year old\nMother a forty nine year old mother is a is even more tragic I'm twenty nine even more Nineteen nine five as we go down as even more tragic 'cause that's less life that has\nBeen but five year olds get shot what'd you are going to I'm a mom I'm a pin you down or would you agree with that part actually oddly enough I Would ... you ... do you what you you wouldn't\nCry more over a five year old and lives\nIn eighty nine year old has done more they've they're you're losing more with them you're losing eighty nine years of knowledge and experience losing eighty nine years\nI had ever had a ... you're losing out here and never had that ... yeah you ever had your share losing\n... their generations after eighty nine year old they're going to more of them who the looked up to them they're matriarch or patriots you feel worse for the old person dying but that does make them a greater was a hundred and six when she died so I like old people\nBut [laughter] but um my my point about the ... we ... we got sidetracked my point on that is that because Obama called him a name\nDefended the white woman would not go and protect Chicago were literally take any action at all when thousands of people were getting shot Kanye saying you know what\nI'm going to go to the other team I'm gonna have to put some consequences behind what I said so widely he gets rejected for actually doing what we all say we should do\nTanya a didn't get rejected for doing what we all seem on do I think you're I'm over ... over simplification um\nHe wasn't jackass when he did what he did period point blank that's that's non negotiable now like how you set it up and you know and a um as the as the um what's that does it you know when to what is the movie was even tried it on ...\n[laughter]\nThey would have said they would have taken debate on that but no that\nAnd what does the movie was even tried it on my GD brother\n[laughter] they were saying they would have taken debate on that but\nNo that he was a jackass when he did it and that's when he called him he didn't call them a jackass because he asking too has come you ask him to step in Chicago is they ask him his opinion on it at the award show\nBut at this look moving on from that what you think about the concept of actually putting some meat on the bone when we say we're going to give public consequences I think it was perfect you ain't got to do nothing about the cargo while put on these redhead else it right here in the White House and guess what this white man to scare to me he ain't gonna call me no names that he's going to sit here and smile\nWhile talking him the first of all white man ain't scared of Kanye West and he's using them as a pond easy just he's he's he's the token negro\nFor the moment I'm a ... a morose wasn't available um so let let's be clear about that um as far as ... I I agree with you that I always rate people always you know them though with President Obama say his first term was in a it was in a holiday\nThat isn't the issue that has been table isn't it wasn't that wasn't what he's doing for you is not the issue that has been tell you that they should have been table is whether he was soft or hard is that correct Robert\n... ... yeah that's good that's that's the address this issue that they have in my hands and let them go with them and I know my claim I turn on your photo [laughter] I'm applying why being a soft\nOr hard president matters because if President Obama was more of the mold of a a Andrew Jackson or Donald Trump or one of the president did literate just don't care and going to do what he feels like then when you had George Zimmerman killed Trayvon Obama will just shut them for drone he don't care what you don't think Trump would do that\nThen when it comes to things like affirmative action he'll just push it through he's not worried about whether he'll win re election he doesn't care how it affects the electoral college he doesn't care how the ...\nThe Turks don't want her to the lawyer but he didn't care he just wants to get it done he wants to push his agenda through\nAnd a lot of us that's what somebody or did you say ... how are you OK so alright Coby Coby stores\nAny point six reports a deploys the game doesn't go to the playoffs doesn't do anything LeBron's consider solve right in the NBA\nNo they're going to come on now they come up skip belly southern calling I'm Sorry this is the old or a ... a lot of people don't feel that okay go okay look around and so\nBut what what does he go every year to the fine okay because point take it so\nYou want your Alaska I don't know how how do you know I Know you don't\nStudy I'm OK outside of the other and I'll jump in here that is a difference that Robert or not we we because we weren't talking about what someone did for us because that isn't\nOkay so the whole image though I'm a jumping off into her that's what you were in about\nSo no is not the image what we were discussing is the lack of will the lack of and that's probably that's where you are referring to the Bronx now lack of will the lack of killer instinct whereas Donald Trump uses the bully pulpit I mean as a means to an\nEnd he uses whatever tools they need right whether Obama vials\nPresident Obama lead every he let the Republicans defined him\nAt every turn he never reply the ways it's the way that Donald Trump and nothing else we call him stupid we call him dumb we call them crazy we come everything in the world you know he does she fights back he pushes back he pushes back\nThey called President Obama everything in a book see let me let me let me get here being docile is not always the solution okay getting picked on and never fighting back is not always the solution okay and let's be let's be real America likes a fighter\nAmerica light hates weakness America when it comes down to a we're not talking about who you are we talking about who we are as a collective so\nThe American um America they like someone who fights back punches back gives it to him now I had this discussion with President Obama was a first run and everybody's like well he's he's not that person is not that person you have to fight the fight that you are you not to fight that you want to be okay\nYou already got me you got me you got me you got Robert well maybe not Robert ... me we got you cast he already had us the people that you don't have those are the ones that you have to go out and get those are the people like they want to say okay gotta love fire and his belly you know he's ... and ...\nWell that you don't have those are the ones that you have to go out and get those are the people like they want to say okay gotta love fire and his belly you know he's ... and that's what you all don't understand the concepts will be nice to be nice no you've already got the nice vote\nNow you have to go out and get the folks that you do not have oh like Trump is or\nYou know that they have stopped basing ... literature passed on to him face them you do you not like apparently when your own fight so this whole this whole segment was the comparison about Obama in\n... it was a contrast styles is not about Obama and Trump congressional styles whether it be Obama Trump jacks and I'm\nIn ...\nWhomever right and and the this is the reason that I won't go in between twenty\nWhat we're seeing are contracting styles all of a sudden Cory Booker went from being ... and that's why I don't like about Cory Booker when Obama was president\nCory Booker was like Obama he was nice and professorial and you know saving women in our cat sort of buildings and stuff now Trump is mean now Cory Booker is me and he's doing Spartacus moments all of a sudden he's yelling in the bugging out Democrats have to develop a natural personality quizzes right when the waves Ryan's\nPick something that you actually want to live in\nYou have to fight the fight that you are in not to fight that you want to be in and when Democrats understand that and grass that concept then they will move forward until the end his new movie that James Carville Amazon or saw this quote\nUm they represent James Carville on MORNING Joe this morning and when he was that represent about Michelle Obama said when they go low we go high\nJames Carville said not when they go low you kick him\nAnd I think that is the mentality that you have to develop now\nI'm going to go so far as I said I don't want to I don't want to uh put off any uh falcons fans now my I myself I'm a Kansas City chiefs saying okay and we we are both of our teams have had that same problem over the years\nYou they didn't have that dog in them they may have that going to let me see if we don't you don't have that finishing you don't have that that in you to finish it off so I'm not talking about those in those two ... and the falcons but the chiefs had the same thing you have to be able to put somebody away and instead of\nPutting somebody away the Democrats want to help you up and brush off it okay you're with us and you know what happens\nThe person that they help up and Russian mafia slap some dead in the face\nAnd I I think for for me the thing is if you're gonna do if you're going to be the fighting party don't be faked it don't mean an off than it don't make it just obvious you just put it onto the cameras I'm part of the kids I don't care about getting kicked out of the Senate if you
