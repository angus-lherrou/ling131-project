of prostitution mhm opinions and George\nAnd sell the challenges that they brought against a euro climb in others in a boy ballot or I'll do the allegations fit that\nWell yeah peppers and wonders

kinds of meeting our share them that's a profit is made up a meeting\nFor that particular person parts do to start process I think the best mate with me right off the tissue now one of the these are going to find as in this case is is Bachmann come knock offs to pimp a person that's already a prostitute ooh\nLeave that they're now a prior to meeting Michael ... noted they hear this alleged

didn't you go back to two of them out there to accuses\nI well right well we will name than that one is one mhm now\nA possibility too but let's go let's go back to what we're talking about earlier where he met me at first initial allegations of go all the rate of\nWomen that led to a prostitute it somewhat on that's what it sounded like we\nWe've already won now because you don't go to the as we won already why when something like the John ... about missing mhm now with the ... all of a sudden I'm from a score\nOf people wouldn't last one to two to one or two I don't know\nI don't know why are they gonna so parts which will reign on yet another when they say they wouldn't be a range that knocked on my ... so the question though is that is what is the real reason they blew the thing out of proportion\nAnd why ... why would you we been able to know who the last of shoes or our cheeses are so we can look at their issue ... to get their records\nSo why would they already involved in the air with other motives those will be causing them answered during the trial do you think this case would come to terms yes\nWell the reason I asked that question Adrian is because as you said it went from twenty women down to and telling these down to one maybe two and misdemeanors it looks like it's going in the direction away from that trial down with another guy that\nI well I think it is for you know the thing about budgetary wise budget wise you have to do something\nBe sent a hundred ages allegedly Andre who's I'm not sure I don't know how many down to investigate a case that he was ... that did not exist\nAllegedly Andre who is I'm not sure how many down to investigate a case that he was costs to ensuring that did not exist\nClearly ... now you come back and say hey we found a few with news at best that they don't have to do that have to they got them so they can come and say look we blew it and we'll just let it go\nBy position of this we're ready either way we'd all go to trial would go to trial we do know if they did so much fun I don't think that business is based on my legs implemented so they're not dismissive say they're gone cold they're going forward this is still trying to put it in my car and I was just huge madam\nHighly parts of mhm no no no ... money menthol after no mine has been found the best they've fallen by ... as a whole bunch of bills ...\nAnd you said from the very beginning when we talk to you months ago that there was no madam um there was no ring and it was just saying the same thing now that you were saying here is\n... ... as the more confident hasn't a more complete now after they've been in there but there's I mean I've gotten their discovery yet but just that there's no moment here I'm confident that far yet\nSo how does ms Johnson get her life back after this is over I haven't haven't even thought that far\nWell what what we'll do all it was not the answer the question in the one I Want to tell you I'm hoping that announcement and she has no telling what you know uh how this has been back to her and tell her tell oh I'm Rick Pluta jokes have reached that know how you plan on on the fact that you and your child and\nI'm a A R you plan on trying to get things go together\nAnd we certainly want to hear her is Michele isn't ready now I only hear oh miss Johnson thank you so much for our listeners let me just say we are speaking to them is at least ... jobs and she is a choice in the Fort Valley State case\nOf for a very important reasons this Johnson can only give a statement because this is a pending investigation and they are pinning charges against her we thank you for being on and go forward with your statement\nChore thanks a lot for having me my first thing that I'd like to say this has been extremely difficult time for my family and um\nI have a son I Am a mother on an only child and my daughter is well this is his senior year all we want it to to have a really good year for him and\nSaid this all broke in April they have been very challenging but I must say that\nIn spite of all he has really doing well I've had some tremendous support from my family my church family on her on the few friends that I have left\nAnd um we are now holding fast to face\nAnd I am not perfect by eating but my personal lines and not professional life with two totally different things and as Mr Patrick's Day that there are a lot of things I cannot say because it is an ongoing investigation but those who know me know that I worked at the institution for fourteen years\nMy son has lasted did\nInbox messages are all kinds of Twitter messages all kinds of you know Instagram method that some students that I don't even remember\nAbout messages are all kinds of Twitter messages all kinds of\nYou know if the ground that that that some students that I don't even remember running across but they've been sending making out to him what they do to help what can they do because if it was it from me they don't know that they would have ever graduated\nI was driving down the vote yesterday young man like me down south to please pull over I I don't know how I Would have made it my father was involved in a sex scandal not last year in college as you made a colon\nIf it wasn't for you I wouldn't have graduated that year so that would say you know encouraged you know reading my Bible listening and must have had I'll do the T pay you to keep me courage right now and all I can do is\nPray that hopefully and personally that the evidence will stay for seven when everything that people will not\nYou know everyone\nWho they are you know got made us ... we all have our own things that we ... we all have to get an account of what and who we are and what I can only see for me I Can't think for anyone else\nHa ha you probably haven't thought ahead or this or or maybe half cause you a lawyer or have you considered\nWhether or not this case is one where you would file a civil suit events like any need to do for free and all this mayhem on your clients life\nFor years government I'm not a civil law you but I'm definitely a kind of contract so large that can handle that type thing one of them big or go on with what you're you staying there is this I think one of the biggest living with the axe was that\nPeople will go forward to this point harm\nTo Betty out the credibility of the accused are accuser\nOut Rocco prosecution to determine who your witnesses potential witnesses are and to deter their bias and credibility\nExactly exactly and that was done we wouldn't be here now but\nIn a rush to try to get some type of ... a a raft of something\nThey overlook all day and then ... reckless and doing and now we have this situation now I respect the fact that she was jumps was arrested what ... found them they were very quarter in terms of you know to find out of\nUh the uh to the subject and turn us up and so forth\nI think that there is some time and made it tanked taken in terms of what type charge they're charged with a ... cell phones phone what you do appreciate those themes\nHowever I Do believe that that sort of more diligent taken more research done prior to that like I said to come to the credibility of our ... our our accusers I got that we wouldn't be an All right now\n... that's\nThe whole thing in shock and then the missing piece for me whether ... several missing pieces but one day just stands out is that where is the money the money that this ring was supposed to make 'cause the purpose of a marine used to make money whereas the money has anybody even mention money may\nWell they they are tempted to say scholarship money that was you know whatever but that's not even address the issue the point you're making\nPhone not a scholarship money even if they had right it's like if you want to have the skills scholarship mine was she did not do clear that that will be at trial will take care of that issue\nBut that didn't happen either so but I'm saying if you're an independent minded while she'd be trying to steal a scholarship money if that if I'm a Prospect Park announce it\nSeemed to me\nYeah\nSo that those type the company itself but yet the issue is still another issue and a half but not the issue here other man jazz\nWhen's Johnston ran the ring that did not was not the er this is a ghost prostitution ring of all these women that you know none of those students will come forward and say hey you know she was making me do this you likely to do that I haven't heard her one of those well yeah\nYeah that's the other ... missing glaring missing piece\nLong because ... does it go out and was caught on fire\nThe other ... missing glaring missing piece\nDoes yeah well because it does does it go out and as long as it goes you know so and the you know and but yet my client who live is destroyed\n... who's on now hire her whether we went on loom\nFor these allegations\nIn a wreck in our in our past all over the world not just local around the world now appointed is yes I Do share great ground for civil suits um\nBeing that that has the way the wild civil war you know the criminal ... specifically only by I think we should definitely that's now so that we are looking to personal problems with all the words that hand right now they're trying to win this trial\nOf course and let the public know that my clients not appear up about 'em out and buy them\nFor aging parents we appreciate it isn't anything else that oh Mr Johnson has prepared to say I don't want to infringe on her or her right\nLet me say that I appreciate all going to have a chance to vent she's a big part of me are so my style I Know she wants to say something that you should see a professional level of a vote this part of the protests were all given a chance to talk and ... you're the only people who maybe ... we would talk\nThings out of your calls all over the\nWorld and they all wanted the tall and not everybody but I don't trust the\nMedia certainly some either trust to trust you all you say that are called up the ... I mean you don't take it to the right the with it I'm afraid of our maker said let's go through them chocolate up headed it sounds like something out for\nHype and stuff like that so anyway the Jonathan you can say you're going to make a final statement because\nUm I just want to say thank you for giving opportunity to um to share from Fox looking and you're listening to me I'm not the evil person that the world is being made to believe me and I'd be happy like I said to share\nA lot of the comments that were recently found so many of the past fool some some some on the current events and even um alumni and really died down a lot of support and um\nI Can't say everything is bad I don't watch the news so\nI think that's the only way to keep my sanity um\nBut you know people forget that you have a child and the school committee and the cold and I'm always tell people to put yourself in that person's shoes and they single mother that get no help at all\nFrom five on\nA ... has to walk to the play offs whatever I Want to get to take care man I Do and some people talk to her mother put your stuff in my shoes you'd walk on our my shoulders and then you can pass judgment\nThank you so much ms at least you didn't have the\nTime I turn on the Internet in Tennessee I pray my friends they use this is the truth comes quickly\nAnd filling a and that will bless every bad Oh thank you very much a outdoors always open you can always talk to us because I listen to scare thank you so you might see and listening to sisters in law ...

I'm a victim of lots of political set up and I know all the ... to do that but this is so extreme\nYou know I just and then this is not the first time we've been hearing her name so I'm Wondering why hurt and fly repeatedly you know\nAnd are not as neither one of them of course she was so gingerly and sweet my deal South Carolina and\nAuthor you you're the first person in the older person who said that about ... I mean a lot of comments [laughter]\nHe says so high and you know I was in the goodness of Vita ethical real question we [laughter]\nBut you\nKnow this was the same manner that thing brought up in April\nOh yeah oh so this is a continuation\nOf that was just all same thing except they were talking about felonies then in the overall misdemeanors now\nOK okay now that makes it a lot on the road from me okay well that's because I'm I'm a little slow\nInvestigating a a ring of prostitution and now the ring is down to one person and know students who have come forward apparently who participated in the rain\nYeah yeah I feel I you know the big question for me is why in why her but of course as you say we will perhaps hear more about it at some\nPhoto truth will come out that's the way criminal cases oh oh yeah but it's more in any of the students charged no\nDuring those students who are witnesses to go to our knowledge\nWhat so what are they do very odd we all have a lot of questions but you know the thing that upsets me as an AKA why do they keep adjoining her name to the sorority\nI mean it could when she was an adviser and have it was a language that she so listed a K A student too oh perform acts for money so they could pay they could do now is not proven but that we the original allegations\nYeah oh gosh that is so absurd but you know the other part of this is at you know she said to me it seems to me every time they mention the a K A advice that I keep thinking well perhaps there so few on vacation a they got somebody who was not an ...\nTo me it seems to me every time they mention the a K A advice that I keep thinking well perhaps is so they ... they got somebody who was not an AKA did she ever declare yourself\nAs a really good yeah oh I was hoping you wouldn't say that you know and the\nQuestions were and this might make more sense now where all the students who were involved in the ring and where's the money that they may thank you and they have identified either one of those not\nIn any pointed they let you know that is so quick well what is the motivation in here is what I guess the next question is where everybody\nWill handle read back in April was the motivation was so that these young ladies ... do you say well yeah it was for girls to pay the dues where all those girls they got me to be arrested but right and\nThose young ladies would be have criminal liability but none of them have been identified and I'm going and none of them are getting dressed and I'm Glad about that with ... gigantic missing pieces the money and the prostitute\nAnd the correlation between the alpha Catholic else's right has been so grossly defame here so I guess I guess I'll just like my little rooms and say well don't worry you're not active right now\nWe're ... ... is better and worse is better yeah the case doesn't sound that strong men as worse because all these people's lives have been turned upside down\nIt's still defamatory you know 'cause that's the one thing people will remember the a K A from Fort Valley State\nMan okay his whether bin Laden storms and it does help bring this will bring your sorority now\nAnd I don't think anybody thinks the headquarters of alpha Kappa alpha sorority sanctions whatever happened at Fort them\nOh yeah I don't think that either but I'm just thinking you know most people nowadays don't really know a lot I keep hearing the misuse of ... and\nSo people love to say bullet\nLeft so the justice existence food that they probably will listen to a lot of other things but I commend you for having put it on it that it couldn't have been a little longer but it's like you were dependent on their face to face in super\nLives be Fifteen minutes oh oh oh in LA for
