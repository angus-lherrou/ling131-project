A. okay\nI'm council president Felicia Morris and you're listening to too much truth with Gary those men on news into Thirteen eighty yeah but you hey okay [noise]\n\nAnd on\n\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nSaw the a ... a senator who saw it with you now have\nYou been around the one of the great we we don't know Vincent is about what a great historians and I know the government is does it give a historic overview this area ... is very historic yeah and that is\nIt's very historic yeah and that it was the place that it once a house of what was our equivalent to a Penn Station is was the transit area where all the trains Atlanta which one's named term is\nUh because of all the trains that uh terminated here uh this coach areas it was well trained stomp beyond the uh\nUm so give us the idea of what we're talking about for those who may not be as familiar with the downtown area this particular area of what were we talking about when we say well I'll watch\nThe Gulch is right between the Russell building federal building in a Philips Arena\nUh and uh several hundred acres it is really it has served discounted the dividing line between downtown in the west side downtown and places like most brown and the west side um several hundred acres I think for for ... for\nForty acres and acres so it's say various store but ah down on its heels area now and I'm\nIn a city that is going through so many changes ten years ago Atlanta was twenty five percent to ... now the word the research shows that were about Seventy five percent judge five\nNinety percent of the Ninety to Ninety five percent of the building residential building in the last couple of years has been what is considered luxury\nAnd so this will continue that trend the mayor is wrong the mayor is dead wrong when she talks about how intensely\nIt just ironic she says where it's focused on affordable housing\nThey're putting out tied you watch the ... [laughter] it just you know it's it's just a\nDo a a no limit to the kind of a lot as city audacity yet um and so now what I'm mainly concerned about is the that the Atlanta that we all want a land of diversity inclusion economically racially et cetera\nIs really going to be blunt it by this project\nA you know the it will be but I said about the belt line but this is definitely true about this this will be the engine for justification or people working people\nOr the kid that you talked about the kid that works at Burger King up little ... Ashby street or during I drive no way they're going to be able to afford to live in this place you know the the research of the housing Justice League showed that people were being moved out by the bell line going south\nCleveland avenue Jonesboro\nOr when you have a project like this driving up rent and of forcing people out of the neighborhood you're going to have a trend where people are you know not going to be if you do ... she talked about uh eleven hundred twelve hundred fifty dead you like it was\nA [laughter] you know some of the Democratic or or\nWrite a twelve eighty percent of am by twelve hundred dollars a month for a one bedroom is not affordable it's affordable if you're wealthy\nBut it's not only if the if you're near bottom it's affordable if you don't have a house in Martha's Vineyard it's affordable but uh for people who are working people in Atlanta\nThis will be an engine for jets vacation\nAnd that's why I'm fighting so hard because after the subsidy of the aquarium the Turner Field deal\nIn multiple deals that are being done in Atlanta this will be the deal that drives Atlanta over the cliff into a justified city\nMultiple deals that are being done in Atlanta this will be the deal that\nDrives Atlanta over the cliff into a justified city that's a place where certain people can live but not working people\nA full for eight nine to two seven zero three if you want to get into conversation let's unpack some of that 'cause I think a lot of times you know one of the things that just learn how to do a city hall was to specialize in development we did probably the most ... redevelopment that has happened in the city to prop record or\nA when you get through an aggregate it was\nA ... was of about a quarter of a billion dollar will for new development but we did not place displays resident in fact we had only owned site relocation\nA public housing ... was the only one so there are ways to do this because we weren't going to let out residents move out then veto they may not be able to come back well let's let's just talk about a couple of things are affordable housing and the mayor did kind of spit out these numbers\nUm eleven hundred dollars for one bedroom Thirteen fifty four two bedroom a Fifteen hundred for three bedroom\nUm let's take the person making eight dollars an hour\nUm you know and they don't work on the weekend you know that's about twenty five\nThousand dollars a year roughly if that mhm I'm about twenty twenty two yeah I'm a ... eleven just some quick math would tell us at eleven hundred dollars a month ... bedroom\nUm use the uh twelve thousand Thirteen thousand almost twelve thousand and some change\nIn rent which is more than fifty percent of the income before\nYou even pay a gas light water a martyr bill um that's not a margin in which people can live now just say that person has one or two children are happen to be married it is not for that is not an affordable rent for the person working\nA at a turn to feel a working at a Mercedes Benz um\nWhat do you say to ... what rich need to be to be affordable if we're going to give away one point seven five billion what should be the expectation\nWell you know the at eighty percent of your mind you're gonna have to be making six over sixty thousand dollars a year we're talking about thirty percent I Am a fifty percent and my for working people who can afford\nWhat you just talked about four hundred six hundred four hundred seven hundred dollars a month is it you're going to that's worth thirty to fifty percent ... aid to send a message I\nThat the ... posing as a displacement criteria it's yeah we'll we'll\nSay of mine that just simply area median income which now when you aggregate because I'd like to teach a professor um we tell by the metropolitan Atlanta area which now includes twenty plus counties the area median income I Believe some was about eighty thousand eighty two thousand dollars\nAnd remember this just in the last few weeks we've got some data on income inequality in the larger than landed than anywhere in the country the top five percent make Eighteen times more than the bottom twenty percent or so when you're talking\nAbout I like guys you're you're missing the point this is a billionaires deal eh not interested in this affordable housing up their interest in taking a whole lot of money away from all of us and we're taking it away from the schools taken away from ... so\nYou know the the affordable housing the the two hundred units is laughable you you've got a job\nIt from the schools taken away from ... services and all that so you know the the affordable housing the the two hundred units is laughable you you get ... how long will come back we're going to let you unpack oil\nAs you sit on the board that is going to be acts to float bonds and financed most of this you came off the board two months ago yet though you can speak from the inside baseball\nUntil the ah the truth as it relates this deal and the other things that are the development authority had been a product that's a good break we'll come back we will uh answer all of those question our goal to date is to give you the information that you haven't got from the mayor\nThe Gen gap from city hall that nobody else will provide you OK full for eight nine to two seven zero three phone lines you've got

[noise]\n[noise]\nOh\nOkay [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nHi welcome back to the news and tell surgeon aided W. have adult [noise]\nIt has been um [noise]\nThe vein of some folks existence apparently into it or they're saying stop the Gulch red light it um the counter a narrative is the green like the goes there's a hole in our city that needs to be feel would one point seven billion dollars in tax payer money\nAnd I'm a ... been a a served on the board and you you to numbers man they ended up the aisle just don't understand is is a complex deal and the average person who just don't have the capacity to understand how these deals are put together\nUm and the same because I said why why what what is driving this from what you said and what you've been able to analyze\nI Do think that these deals get put together in a way that it's very hard for folks to understand uh I I think that's pretty deliberate\nUh because actually is rather simple you're saying hey guys you don't have to pay taxes in this a development for Thirty years that is a phenomenal loss of revenue for the city and the schools and that ends up either\nThe residents get worse services and they should have had or\nThey had to pay higher taxes I mean there's there's no two ways right is so huge is twenty thousand dollars\nFor every family of four is what this is going to cost so they this is not chump change people just need to understand they are being ripped off you know to put it in very simple terms you're being ripped off by billionaires when billionaires come to town you need to watch your wallet real closely because billionaires\nAre good at taking other people's money away that's how they got that way okay so let's not fool ourselves they are not here\nThey don't care about your affordable housing they don't care about anything except making the maximum amount of money and that's what they're doing\nSo they have everything to gain from it the people that they are paying as for the public relations for their legal and all the rest of it they of course have something to\nWe had a couple of people down at the city speaking for the Gulch this off new they didn't announce their conflict of interests but one was an engineer who's being paid to design the platform and the Gulch and another one is working from Norfolk sudden\nUm Norfolk Southern stands to make a fortune at the moment land they owned and there was worthless because it would cost a lot to develop it\nThat's why it's not been developed it's expensive to put a platform up there you can buy land a lot cheaper and midtown in downtown than than putting a platform everything else that you know if you let the market do its thing or you're not going to develop the Gulch for another I guess in Twenty years um and\nPeople talk about holding on to the land that they will be a hole in all of Atlanta we vote for this there'll be a hole in our heads to if we're stupid and and the whole than um pockets and a massive holding that part and so I think on hold onto your while they talk about because they talk about\nFor this there'll be a hole in our heads to if we're stupid and and the whole than um pockets and a massive hole in that part and so I think on hold onto your wallet\nTalk about because they talk about attacks allocation district and we don't take this couple of minutes to break it down um and so basically the basic concept is that they will build this five this twelve million square feet of a building\nThat the wants the improvements made as the improvements are being made the tax revenue that would be generated from the taxable I'm real estate there\nDoes not do just like your property taxes your house in mind it goes into the general fund some mogul fused didn't go to great in some go to ... to counter to the public schools in the bed goes to the city\nOr all of their money is going to stay in that area in those forty some acres to continue to fund it for the development so roughly that is one of the skim addicts for this yeah I mean it's\nIt's actually that's where it does get complicated ah my belief is that the billionaire is going to figure out how to get almost all of it into their own pockets it will pay for this platform\nNow no one is the city as verified how much that platform and really costs to build the develop as the CIA and the rest of our brothers said it was four hundred million when they were talking to a local elected officials a few months ago they dropped it to five hundred million and a half a billion dollars added will always say the\nA platform were saying they're saying they need to build the Gulch up to a street level yet so that they can then put buildings on top of it and that's going to be the major\n... and you got to let the trains going running underneath so you have to build something that can withstand the trains are interesting enough one of the council members said to me I'm not sure that they are obligated to build a platform over the whole thing ... they they could probably choose to to not to build all over the writer but\nYou got to have you got to have a skyline presidents you got to pay you want to be able to people who see it\nNow I Am so now they're going to build up I mean no one's going to sit in an office below street level so they're going to build up but of course you got to put your parking deck down there that that in them and some of your utilities and you know your dad will generate a whole lot of revenue yeah parking is that right Raymond down but I as you say so what happens\nIs that that tax instead of being paid to uh run the city and run the schools is paid into its self paced back to itself my belief is that they will find ways to make sure most of it comes to them I tell you you're looking at\nThis um what do you see what do you see what was as a resident of the city what bothers you\nAs a resident and as someone who teaches civil procedure I'm disturbed by the process the processes suspicious so few spent fourteen months\nWorking on this deal why wouldn't you want to give city council time to peruse it and talk to their that time member some days three days right ... well I wouldn't want them to parse the details and talk to their community and allow community to participate unless\nThere's some that you don't want them to see 'em\nAll three of you all I knew I was on the phone with ... and his phone went dead and now that I heard was screaming let me in here [laughter] did you make it to the that's really what really started me to say hold on now yeah and all of my days\nWe're talking about the era transparency we don't put the city wallet own line um but we hold them meeting for the public as any\nYou're talking about the era transparency we don't put the city wallet on line um but we hold the meeting for the public as a style late town hall public meeting we put it into small this area in city hall\nHave the overflow room in the largest area of city hall get some people were green shirts own to fill up yeah the ... the old city county\nYeah they will rent a crowd at home or astro turf hero of\nWas in the world was that let me just say this is a precedent for that because mayor bottoms did the same thing in Turner Field before the sale she had an open forum\nThis was as in her capacity as as they were okay and ... and her capacity either kayaking rather already ruptured\nSpleen couldn't ask our questions we had to write them down and they were edited as they read them and then when we started asking questions not using the protocol established then married came in and scouting out and that was the way it was done so this was not a surprise to me\nYeah well you know one thing that I Am not going to allow is a public meeting should be used as a way to push people or just shut people down that's why I got kind of\nThe U.S tell just ... you know when when does this bad so the ... and they could that you can't make it a good deal exactly or send the full when because here the cost is fifty five times what the benefits are worth the little benefits that\nThe mayor kind of scribbled out a over the over the last few weeks to try to get canceled on board\nAnd I would say let's not beat up on council too badly the there's a bunch of them that don't want this deal so they need to be reinforced yeah and that that's always saying but I can tell you I haven't\nBeen down there right this is more money than any deal that I was involved in and I can tell you the level of arm twisting that comes with is from the chamber of commerce they all going to receive a call\nLet me tell you how this goes down must have been a so you see the inside baseball I remember we had some big deal similar to this\nFirst thing I get a call from chamber of commerce well\nI've represented where I Lived and I said if I can get elected by the people I don't need to be elected or they want to know why were they started calling people jobs most city council people have a second job\nAnd I told him looking at my house in my car pay for so that that ain't gonna work right okay I remember one councilmember they call this from\nRight and uh when he got through like man they you know and we would talk\nSo they call you a job where you where are they put excruciating pressure yup or on the city council people and so that's you standing you talking about eight members standing between them and about uh what do you\nTurn up through not billion dollars would have to nominate news so now you're absolutely ... joker will hit you in the head for fifty dollars yeah yeah it was two and a half ... and they and they called me up stories they've been unable to that got him I miss it yeah\nLet's just be very real this this is a serious and that's why\nAnd that's why we have to give a counterbalance people will have to know that their constituents right you know our ... and so that's why I call your district council member those that's for telephone call that everybody is so ...\nHow it goes down is done it and then you can show up one is the next next semester the member that was how many have let this week then they found them by now the executive\nCommittee meeting tomorrow but the full city council meets we're really asking people to turn out on Monday October Fifteen this coming Monday\nOr for the city council being ... people to get there by well\nThe meetings that one but we are trying to turn out a large crowd out you know I you already know I Believe in civil disobedience\nWell how'd and so we may it may have to get to that point you know what should people what times did they beat as a ... there and be there at well there are people who want to sign in you\nHave to sign in before twelve thirty so you need to get\nThere early or add on ... let's get to these phones is a let's go to a free Monday a\nQuestion to come and very quickly for a Julian been a in a Center for\nYes or rather be like ... like a
