A. okay the voice of the community calling for a for eight nine to two seven zero three get you involved in the conversation\nOr makes you guys are they a prize was going on in the new describing the Saudis situation um is going to escalate quicker than I think the president intends uh whereas he thinks it's a minor minor issue involving\nA one journalist or anything on the international stage wants the United states begins\nBasically selling out our uh our residents he's not a citizen but residents\nAre in order to maintain deals across the globe it does not look good on the global stage uh so I don't think this is one of those stories is going to die out quickly you know this isn't Kavanaugh\nAnd being drunk at a party forty years ago this is the one being dismembered and murdered or in the U.S taking no action because we don't want to mess up a arms deal and I don't think that's something the international community will stay in four\nOh one thing that I think is very interesting I think we also have to uh to look at\nIs the the twenty eighth team in terms of the preamble for twenty twenty of course and with that what we see is\nThe Democrats are back yet articulated a message there not not yet articulated anything\nClear messaging ... if somebody can call in and tell me exactly what the Democrats messages for twenty Eighteen besides Trump is the devil\nAnd I don't think that you all the way there I don't think that there's enough hatred to make it interesting but it was not enough hatred around the country to win an election just on Trump is the devil\nThere has to be more there has to be a clear plan on what you would do differently and with the economy going well right now how is your plan for what to do differently would not destroy the economic progress we've made\nThere's plenty of things out there to talk about you talk about the exploding deficit were Twenty one trillion dollars and talking about the fact that all the tax cuts to one point five trillion dollars or a trillion dollars in tax cut went almost exclusively to the rich and have not trickle down to the rest of the economy\nYou can discuss the fact that the healthcare system is in shambles because the president decided to shutter most parts of Obamacare throwing things in the chaos\nThere's plenty of things to talk about but right now the only thing you're hearing out of them is calling me Russia I'm having a spying dot CA those sorts of things that most people don't care about\nAnd the reason I think it's important for them to get this message together now is that looking forward to twenty twenty\nThere's an absolute chance that President Trump could get thirty percent\nOf the black male vote thirty percent of the black male vote remember being twenty sixteen he got Thirteen percent of the black vote\nBut at the same time you have to account his number as the the net number the aggregate number of not just the votes he got with the decrease in votes for the Democrat over the low turnout from the previous election and black man simply put the not turn out for Hillary Clinton\nSo between the number of votes he got the Thirteen percent and the number of people who simply did not turn out because they weren't inspired are interested in the Clinton campaign Trump was right around twenty percent for black men\nNow how does that go up to thirty percent in twenty twenty well let's listen to the speech\nA con game and understand that it was not an insane rant as the uh media likes to tell you is that he was making severe ... points one point to key in on the part where he said this pet um makes me feel like a man\nThis ... gives me power of this ... makes me a superhero\nWhat are your ... something that you hear pervasive Leon barber shops in in bars where black men feel like they're under attack by the media\nWere men in general field but they are now the enemies of America as founded by the progressive movement\nAll of a sudden you're guilty until proven innocent if you're accused of rape or sexual assault or harassment or anything along those lines you'll see you'll lose your job you you lose your family you'll get a lot up like Cosby did on\nUnconfirmed allegations from twenty thirty forty years ago this how many men are thinking today\nMany men also our understanding of the realities of the modern economy where women are more educated women have better jobs women have more money and there is no longer the patriarchal or understanding of society\nWhere the male is automatically assumed to be in a leadership role simply because he is a male or a male is considered to be the head of the household because he is male that no longer exist and there's a great amount of resentment around that\nThe PC nature of coach of our culture today is not conducive to inspiring men\nMitt around that the PC nature of coach of our culture today is not conducive to inspiring men to as ... said feel like men\nConstantly being totally you can't say that you can joke about that you can't go over there you can look at that don't act like that will be quite put that you know don't go over there and a lot of grown men walking around him pet to death\nFeeling my children\nAnd so when that happens the author automatically what occurs is a rejection of those things a quiet secret majority\nThat surrounds the nation on those things\nAnd some of these people who are the most adamant never Trump hers the ones who call him forty five that Cheetos oh rank a tank that ... minutes so on and so forth no women I hate to tell you this and this may be a shock to your system\nSometimes men lie and sometimes they lie because they hold an unpopular an uncomfortable position\nThat they don't quite want to tell you about so if you say who late last pizza chicken he'll look over the who what you'll\nSay well you know able to meet you in the house I Know what happened here look you know I don't know what happened either you say you only need ... well I Know I didn't need it you short it could've been you and they will treat you like you lost your mind because they don't feel like being an uncomfortable position\nOne of the biggest problems that Democrats have is they for some reason I think that just because of their agenda you know in San Francisco or LA or New Yorker DC\nThat are supposed to be everybody else's into two\nI remember in twenty ten being on the campaign trail uh down in South Georgia and the talking points to come back from the DNC and they'll say well our big things we want to talk about are the Paris climate accord ah also the Iran nuclear deal over there like what I don't know why uh Brunswick care about the Paris climate accord\nDon't nobody states broke here was going on the Iran nuclear deal talk about jobs education fits into school sits in the road\nDo something useful for your lives and that's why so important and we understand that when these people putting this messaging out there they're going to risk losing an election that shouldn't be lose will go into the four months we'll pay them on line for paid him\nI'm here can you hear me yes ma'am\nI'm I thought this was on black my husband's back when they test your living his stature I Am a Trump supporter and I want to know what business we have whining about\nThat's Saudi situation when our boys and thank God the boys in Chicago are on Americans I think ... what is the emphasis on that and why is that Saudi she trapped problem\nOr a a a group you are to a point but I think the reason this is a a ... is our fault in our our thing to worry about is after World War two of the world came together and basically said us You're in charge\nThey had to Britain was protocols we have the uh the the treaties with everything that brought us together and put the U.S is the world hedge amount of power part of that is being the world's policeman\nOr because we have the biggest military will be next twenty nations combined because we have the biggest navy\nAs out here is not adequately ran on that we are going to do and I'm not being America's place anyway was Mad Men are so just\nPut several hundred billion dollars into the military which means that we're ... we're the world's policeman so when you take the job is the world's policeman that means that have a human rights abuses happening among one of your allies and you have to hold them to the fire on it that is your job you took the job\nThey argued around and ... and they're doing their own investigation investigation\nIs they took her do into a room with Fifteen guys and a bone so he never walked out that's the best\nThey already over there I Do on their own investigation we have that money he got to the military wesa build our military up to the way it was supposed to be when Obama did not do anything for our military ... say something about Obama\nThem well Obama their military don't have to get us out of those wars remember those wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to Bush got us in for no reason Obama got us out of there the best thing to you can do for the military or keep them out of the stupid and pointless wars\nI still want to and that is not quite a threat to the worried about the saddest thing I think I think it's more important if that's the way by at first I quest ethic caravan coming here we have so much going on in our own country when it\nThing I think I think it's more important for us to worry about as far as like west up that caravan come in here we have so much going on in our own country we need to worry about us first and I'm afraid that wet everything I heard you say so far is actually very correct\nI Democrat in math is I've never voted Republican before I've been a debt I bought about ... oldest pleasure but I wanted to not vote for him the last time but I just\nI was afraid my husband will be mad at me and stuff on my eyes have been wide open all that hate us come from a Democrat with no message is over everything you just said is absolutely true\nWe don't want these government control is we want to work\nWe want to lift up ourselves and this is what's happening under this economy we want to work and feed our families I said that's all we want we don't want all this hate and Maxine call and for all of this discourse\nWe met that there is no Democrat message now I'm I'm gonna hang up but I'm a kid listening to what you\nHave to pay them well one thing we usually ... scenes view and all the Trump does the exact same thing to a as a student for greater we're hoping to lock her up who still transit rarely will both go knock the hell out of the winters are well protesters were both the burger is will be able to look\nAt the same thing as what my husband says what you said earlier about you know you can't have someone in the president's someone in the oval office cursing as someone saying grab 'em by the way to all of that stuff that came out people still voted for him why\nBecause the same old way the message and nothing getting done was just tired\nI he's not my passport he'd met someone I Want my daughter to marry I don't want my son looking up to him as a role model what I Do want is for him to get our country back focusing on us and I don't care about this side stuff\nI had to stop but boy and a lot and I moved by it not\nLp seat he lp that last year's and gay half of them and now voting for him to walk away campaign so it is over he's getting more than thirty percent of the black vote for\n... to me more than Obama is going to run into historically any mention has been on a solution is\nHas not succeeded ... economically destroyed or you'd get invaded you can't be an isolationist nation in a in this will be just won't work too we have to be all in the international community because once we the isolation I thought I\nThought we were making nice with like Korea and all these other places that no one's ever been able to\nDo that we find that when you say that the United states does not need to be involved in the middle east of me to be mobile fees for not say that I Know\nWe don't need to worry about this Saudi Arabia gentleman I I didn't have well we we have to have good relations\nWith her later if you will love one thing if you are one journalist to be a security murdered or the withdrawal was was then that makes it dangerous for every single journalist in the region limits or ... or ... freedom all depressed the entire region so then ... ... ... homes\nBring that back home if you're just because I think if I may talking about this one's ... than it makes it the end is that everybody else turn it around and what's happening our own country you have all the mainstream media shutting down conservative voices whether they're black white\nHispanics are ... ... ... oh no it's not what I Would want to go with\nHer and I got really bad for a band conservative and black and then all of my black friends that were all of\nThat at all for being conservative or blood because it's\nI got it backwards and conservative and black and then all of my black friends that were all of them that I'm all for\nBeing conservative or blood because the biggest people own political social media\nOr all conservatives Jones to induce a whistle and Ken as always Tommy lords of Charlie Kurt the biggest news station in the world right there'll be ... new stations Fox News the conservative moved there should be a best selling a lot of\nNothing about regular people ... don't media shutting down conservatives how do you have a big old or conservative\nPull them all up Alex Jones that got kicked off I don't follow him or whatever but most of the people that I Know that are black conservatives all that shadow bad and it's even in the news now even the mainstream media couldn't not report on it\nThey're shutting down anyone who doesn't agree with a socialist agenda and it's not going to happen it's over the black vote you might get a few still on the Democratic plantation but most of us have got our eyes open\nAnd it's a beautiful thing and the only way to fix the Democrat Party it's a break it down and rebuild it the founding fathers always said that that that was fun to be more than one party that never got to be just one party\nMy current democratic ... up and down and were\nQuick point on that ... members of the

went up on it or write that constitution when I found it and when I thought that the Democrats and Republicans in that room I think it took him three months there weren't when Republicans\nAt the time

A. okay you want answers\nTo handle the truth\nThis is Danny Glover and you are listening to too much true with their Bozeman on news into Thirteen eighty W A L K she's dancing with the guard\nThe physician who shot these controversial videos in the operating room\nNow speaking you know I've done nothing wrong Dr window ... told the actual and cable network and that she got permission from her patients to make the video educate the public about cosmetic surgery in an entertaining way there is not only education\nInspiration there celebration\nWhen the former patient arts celebrating the ... work my daughters have like a shocking to me in this inside edition exclusive they're comparing their just figuring scars rolling liposuction performed by Dr boots day this was\nLittle it was all over my stomach um and now these areas that you see that are black or now scarred\nI'm Wondering what you all think now looking at those videos ferry the Saturday\nNight Saturday I felt horrible for all of the women that are on there if I had seen those in advance I certainly would not have made her my choice for cosmetic surgery is a slap in the face what\nHappened to this patient with way beyond scars she went into cardiac arrest during a Tony talk she is now an invalid looked after by her son OJ Leiber\nI had to literally do everything for her ... her brush her teeth feed her\nThis former patient who asked not to be a dental ... says she woke up on the operating table during one of the dancing daughters routine you woke\nUp during the surgery you saw people singing dancing up I'm assuming you thought you were losing any\nI'd definitely thought was eliminated I felt like fellow and stabbing the stomach\nMegaphone ... who is a dermatologist not a board certified cosmetic surgery and then the adverse outcome ... out of her control\n\nBut now that she's just rented it may be some time before it got to say he's allowed to cut it again\nAt least nine lawsuits have been filed against the doctor a previous action on behalf of Mr Cornelius that woman you saw who allegedly suffered brain damage when her heart stopped during the procedure was settled as he's saying the doctor has denied any wrongdoing\nI'd welcome back to the top Thirteen aided W okay we'll start off as a local case will turn into an international news story\nThat was like the Entertainment Weekly thing that comes on\nUh and so in this they're dealing with this dog in particular but I Do want to deal with the practice in general because I Do want a dog to boot said what I really wanted people to understand was how your profession approaches this and I want to go back to so we're very clear\nSo this is talk about let's cause I'm On my my audience also know you\nSurgeon they've gone through four years of college ... four years of medical school mhm and then once written medical school you decide whether you want to be a dermatologist and ER Dr plastics\nAnd you and I got this plastic surgery and you knew all the law you wanted to be a plastic\nCertain exactly I was very ... and art and science writer and you know growing up in a family where you know you really had to have a job my mother said you need to go ahead and be a doctor and I'm a plastic being a plastic surgeon would be fine\nAnd I didn't know any plastic surgeons that I knew that it took an artistic I is it really required someone who was that with your hand ... and\nI actually sculpt so I had that you know Fidel tactile ability um and then I also studied hard sport high on the exams and then I got into a plastic surgery program one of the top programs ... I was the first African American\nAnd you're going to go to that brag a little bit more did you go to ... because I Would prefer wondering what are they always young girls and others who are listening can be inspired sometimes ... store\nYeah I mean so basically I didn't really know people who are plastic surgeon however I knew this is something I was interested in and so while I was in um college\nUm I made sure I met other alumni who came back ... physicians so doing my programs over the summer\nAnd also doing a winter break I Would actually shadow doctors because I Want to be sure and I want it to be a plastic surgeon and actually entertain pediatric surgery at one time because I did love that\nUm so after that um you know all of these a shadowy and programs I decided to apply to medical school so I went to Albert Einstein College of medicine I got a pretty much a full\nScholarship is that Raul thousand dollars a year well that's why I picked it I got into a number of holes but for me I didn't want\nDebt right um so I went there was a great program they had a lot of international programs for plastic surgeons where they did reconstructive surgery in children yeah and I love that\nUm and while I was there I decided to do some research that I've worked in the wound healing and laugh because I was interested in how the how a scar would actually\nImprove or become worse so I had an interest in a while yeah just no because I wanted to make sure that\nWhatever ... picked in surgery 'cause once I was in medical school I knew I wanted to be a surgeon I wanted to keep my research um aligned with the skill when Arielle of surgery there and if you operate you're going to cut somebody and they feel\nThat match it in because you're in one of the things that doctors always do because you were smart minimize your debt and I I Want to go into the\nBig paying feel mhm\nPlastic surgery can be performed by ear nose and throat doctor especially when it had a knack right that makes sense\nSo they'll do on a nose job they can do facelift they can do islet cell\nMy objection is is that it is not your core area of training right then you know you have to pot or at least the patient pause because if you have a complication who do you go to they have to pass off to another ... ...\nPatients should oh how'd you know we've wherever I go and I've been just fortunate knock on wood I was born a greater hospital and when I had my fall or in July that the second time I've been to the hospital\nYeah and no surgery no cat\nAnd so uh we'll talk a little bit about that and a little bit but um it's been very fortunate health wise and um but empower patients I even walking around now like you know so many people need to be asked and some question I have one sister who\nWho happened to visit man I Love the ... about ten thousand question but there's nothing like it empowered patient to know that you can go\nYou leave and landed up into bed you can put that much of your phone and check is it down to zero to ... to do a B C D\nI think the problem that people have it is true out of time people will go to their friends Dr right and then because their friend had surgery by that person they will assume they did the homework right and that isn't the case for a lot of people do you hold on let me just get to\nYou are you knew all along you want to be a plastic surgeon you could have gone into pediatric yet pediatric could have gone into operating room I won't be a trauma surgeon\nI'm a yeah they can all that kind of pediatric surgery is such a wonderful specialty\nWe argue that that whole fan but they could drop all here and there and then I wanted to just do a facelift who I won't do they do something\nTo that 'cause I mean I that's my second love our our ... surgery it's such a thing\nBut the dermatologist could decide I Want to be asking doctors right so I'm going to start doing that\nWill also say that you know liposuction itself was really discovered by dermatology yeah so that's\nWhat opened a do or German but if I wanted us to stop and let's just keep it that you just been so nice all these people in your professional ... it'd be nice though I look I don't you know I\nIt it I get it you're like OK here it is I Want to plastic\nSurgery I Need to get me play if I'm trying to get ... you know demand moved down and trying to get a breast implant\nI shouldn't go and just look for I should be looking for somebody who specializes in plastic surgery and\nI mean you have any you know the day this is what I tell people so let's see the surgeries pretty straightforward right management and the complications have potentially are that are hurt and we're going to tell you my heart I fall for a\nNight to to observe three look if you wanted to let you talk about what people are getting now they will get Sharon on the phone she been home for a minute let me just get to share of question maybe we could just get to a unity the

glad to be back almost look it up by may stay on the lives to ten o'clock tonight since I've\nBeen [laughter] alleged today well\nI Want to tell the doctor that God I have much admiration for her profession now says if she's well studied and trained she and she has a passion for it now now I have a comment\nAnd question now let's hear it to the question first\n[laughter] do you think that reality television shows has really increased um the interest and maybe more procedures around the country\nHave reality uh shows kind of in Korea of course who wouldn't want to have a\nUm I don't know none of them love and hip hop body right have who wouldn't want to how wide knowledge guy but most of us who wouldn't want to look like Tyson back for my medicine for the doctor you guys have yeah I I Want some of those but I I wake up every morning go good\nMeal cheeseburger mix [laughter] hey we're willing to pay that price low grade or so but\nYeah I mean it is is that the whole and then of selfies\nRemember we are now we've been ... at it and we take in a different angles you know we all know how to handle our our phones now that you know that you're right what we're doing this complimenting ourself with ... with her ... and then you have people on TV and reality shows and these are people who were everyday people\nSupposedly food looks like this wake up like that nor and we know it's not true they feel the pressure\nTo look at all the time I mean another thing that's very very popular now is permanent makeup we all know a lot of permanent makeup because they want to look up they want to wake up looking refreshed you don't want to look washed out\nAnd that's the new stream and you know as a society we have to somehow come to terms with who we are absolutely right now we're kind of caught up\nAnd that's the new stream\nIn you know as a society we have to somehow to terms with who we are absolutely right now we're kind of\nCaught up that's the best I just write a quarter\nI Would agree I now uh as far as permanent makeup is concerned I I wouldn't mind having that lip color\nYou went through some permitted live go and not just the just the collar yeah later maybe ten maybe you know and why yeah I don't know I I was just something that\nYou only blue one day and read the literature those rooms with him\nI said I think at a light to wake up okay now I'm not sure I Know it's your lawyer\nWait a minute now see I had a I had an injury okay All right as a young girl and that's the only reason why I asked about that okay now I have\nHad two experiences with people that they had a plastic surgery cosmetic surgery wine or two of which are deceased but one hat or two surgeries and to put that wouldn't liposuction\nAnd she um she contracted and fiction and I think it was because it was so new to the area at the time\nAnd my aunt experienced brand oh there you know and I believe has she live and survive her procedure she definitely would have done reconstruction and I know a lot of people that do ah liposuction and they seem to be doing well\nYeah I mean as you here's the thing I don't want to you know do I go down to\nDo whatever you I I don't

Justin since Nineteen oh one\nOr two Thirteen eighty W. A. okay for you to teach 'em an oak tree or news and talk Thirteen\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWhat if\nWhat if what if what what are your people coming to just give us the list and you go see\nMy top for three four procedures are what\nWas it a top procedures are going to be a tech liposuction breast augmentation breathless those are like my number one because that may have demographic yeah ... ... to me it between\nAt what age do people come for the first time me too but it's tough to do I get more than one you can get more than when I actually do a lot of secondary and okay so the people who've already had that and they come back and go and ... but as you like peace in Hamburg unreal then you'll be back\nYeah will be better to be back on 'cause I Know you all you have to prepare people psychologically for\nA different kind of lifestyle I mean when you do it\nClients will humming have their surgery and they have to eat like a kid's meal for good six to eight months because they they can't finish in adult meal\nSold about tightening the muscles you're like I Am basically highly reason off the stomach\nA little bit right so you're tightening the container and therefore when you get hungry or when you're eating your stomach stretches yeah but it'll feel the tightness of the container and then you are uncomfortable right you're uncomfortable you ... you could open up your belt but it ain't gonna help\nBecause you just had your muscles tightening you're really flat and so I Would say most of my clients use lose lose between ten and twenty pounds after surgery wad of that\nAnd a breast reduction and we already talked a little bit about that if people are just too heavy and you have any data in their defense redhead augmentation\nAnd that's for people who aren't um graced with large breast and then they had implanted women still lichen locking them I mean men you know we like ... well I Would say for the African American population I deal volume is probably about a C. plus\nI'm an address some Arizona skill ABC yeah indeed that's pretty much you know you can go to the e and doubled either ... or more\nFor I Would think for other populations happening more for the Caucasian population to but the average African American woman is looking for somewhere around a C.\nD. if you're on reality t._v.\nWhat what do you feel good but they they're getting like that but you know okay let's let's be Frank about that like the ... bottom in the best way to average the average for it in Atlanta is not a script\nFor our guy guy I'm actually I got I got it up\nAnd job would have been getting a ... member I wrote a dime you wrote talk ... talk because I'm getting for them they don't want them lines across the forehead you don't have any oh you're in the last you know they have angry Eleven's down the middle of between their brand right\nUm and then get islet surgery I Know I ... a mob is is a radically right so that's what people do what should we do stretch amount of what what is out of this surgery I let\nSurgery you're actually removing the skin of the upper limit and you can actually take the\nKind of place up I run a little higher if they meet once I got a little higher you can remove that does that make me look younger it would make you look younger because you get older you look sleepy air you know OK rouse fall I got you get ... around the globe\nBut I didn't want to talk about breast cancer so people can come to me for um breast reconstruction\n'em and they're women who have um\nMastectomies either a single mistakes me or a double mastectomy but this is breast cancer awareness month yeah and we need to know some facts um basically about a quarter of a million people were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer this year in the United states alone\nYou have to understand the African American women under the age of forty have a greater incidence of breast cancer than the white population mhm and breast cancer is the most common cancer among his stand Hispanic winning\nSo this is a very serious issue for us you know we have a poor prognosis because we are diagnosed at a later stage\nBut it really just requires daily or you know yearly mammogram did you get a yearly mammogram people say why do I do a yearly well not all mammograms will pick up a breast cancer ... percent of the time a mammogram will not show\nAny thing you may have alone so what mammogram may not show them what's the best with Dr\nSo what's the best way because they are a couple of years ago there were like breast self exam like they they know good whether you agree or not\nIt's really breast self exam\nThe best way because they are a couple of years ago there were like breast self exam like they they know good whether you agree\nOr not it's really breast self exam whether that Dr feels the mass and then the mammogram and then they have other imaging okay that is now\nBut the mammogram Israeli every year for him and\nIt's every year because that's you know in some way to go not very good examination themselves also when you go for your annual physical and your doctor Phil's lesion they're gonna persistently tried to follow up on that ... see you know there are other things to do which\nI've heard of them have close friends who are who are in their forties now been diagnosed recently they trigger age that you see they danger zone age wise of what would and when does ... what are you generally\nSo when I when I Want people to understand that there really isn't a trigger age because when you have a lump or a mass and you're right you really have to be focused and make sure it's not malignant cancer vets and needs to be dealt with aggressive her and a lot of times you know I can see women who were very young with breast cancer and they don't think it's breast cancer they think it's a benign lump\nSo I don't like to say that there's an average age of course as you get older rights more than likely the cancer in general so generally between you know for ... years where we're going to see our biggest bombs\nSo you know fat that question is very complex so fat is not the same because when people have the gastric bypass\nYou notice that most of them lose their weight almost from their heads to their stomach and then their bottoms or usually a little bigger still so the fat doesn't isn't mobilized from your\nBottom half mast as it is with the rest of the body however I always think it's kind of a union yang if you have that you don't want in one area is genius to put it in another another need volume\nSo where people moving it from and moving it to\nDo that when I say their trunks that means the front and the ... app demand the back they move it to their but their hips\nUm they move it into their face to help with wrinkles to fill out volume in the face you can also use it as a reef instructive agent that means like if you had a higher injury and you have a dip it in your leg you can move it into that area to smooth it out again\nSo I Would say the buck area the hips and the face or the major places people are placing their fat\nA cigar English talk about that you kind of them young was ... you got to specialize in researching and let's talk a little bit about\nCars you know when you have a breast reduction breast reduction is um like an upside down and verdict teams to this round the nipple down from the nipple and as a scholar in the fall so far over time will heal and change over one to two years\nSo after two years of car is done of its ugly it's going to stay ugly\nUm most of the time you think about of garbage and after three to six months after the injury and with people of color\nUm we have it's very complex because we can have a car where there is a lot of it's very pigments it in ... tracks attention um it can also have multiple little blemishes around this car ... call that a halo of dark list or ... and then you can have a car\nThat the hyper tropics car and a good way to know hyper stroke car hyper Troeh fix car is that it's like a speed bump so when you raise your hand wash your if your body and you have a car I should be nice smooth\nThat's a nice flat car now maybe wide 'cause you don't like that is why didn't you can do it's garbage and to make it here that [noise] but it it there's a speed bump then that means the hyper trophy car it's been more than two years it's basically a few\nLawyers are are at that point so let's do goes after two years you've got it probably permitted ... generally be whether the ugly ugly art\nAnd let's just take much for whom I had to follow them a house ... throat did you you just saw the day for the first the ... and you were telling me I'm just about three months in ... so so what I look like to look for ... what do you\nDon't look like Eddie Freddie Krueger and you're very blessed to have this car\nAnd they ... into the soil worried and I can't really say much you can see\nIt unless they're very close and in your personal space so on your car it's a high for trophies car so it's a little speed bumps when you write in your hand across her neck ... a little bump right and so um you can just base with that scar inside three to six months you can just\nSpeed bumps when you write in your hand across her neck grill a little bump right and so um you can just base with that scar inside three to six months you can just say I had enough of those you for your insurance car out hadn't exercised and have the scar um you know have a scar removed and how to repair it in a controlled manner\nWhen it's controlled there are things we can inject into the car itself or into the skin ... that basically slows that whole process down you're not going to get that bubble or ... for that speed bumps car now\nYou're telling me I could I should start new sergeant\nAnd so if you want to non surgical approach\nSo thinking about as far as a tight rubber band so what do you do a tight little band your ... your polling you're squeezing that you're doing I Can't say well you must charge us far aggressively that's exactly what you have to do and so you can manipulate the car by distracting and pulling away\nFrom you know the cartoon that's trapped in to the underlying issue you squeeze it and let me tell you this is not fun it hurts\nSo usually I tell my clients and you really want to aggressively treated car do it three days a week so this way if you watch the daily news at ten o'clock you know Don Lemon okay great or you know if they're here if you listen to your show okay sit down and massage your car Monday Wednesday friday and you do for a program\nThis way when you go to your doctor and your doctor says well what have you been doing to help yourself you can say well I Try and Madame ... onion extract so it helps on the in a third of people so yes or no so that didn't work I massage aggressively and their doctor always goes well what does that mean to you because most people think that just I didn't have that done\nBut when you show that you've been aggressively massaging that means is really just not really amenable to massage and the only next therapy is you can inject it with a chemical to help flatten it\nAnd that's wrong analog and what that does is basically slow slows the process of covering the genesis down the college and makes the scar it makes too much of a scar and that's why you had to speed bumps and when it to feel the way that makes a lot of car and well roaches beyond the borders of the scar\nAnd it becomes almost in a piece of meat on us yeah and so those are treated where'd you can try injection therapy but that sometimes very painful\nUm and so you can go on from the injection therapy to have it excites even have radiation you're treated so there's a whole spectrum\nSays a lot of different options so we started just I Would say you got any laws\nWhere you are kind of a non surgical kind of guy you don't want to have surgery nine that crazy about so we're going to start with aggressive massage\nAnd I sat and act you've done for ... is not as bad as much as I Want to\nExactly in you'll actually see all the different the next thing I Would recommend is probably just inject you with the little bit and along okay and that's a steroid that basically flattened SARS now can along has to be injected very carefully because if you have high dose cataloguing cause your color cells to go away and you\nGet a ... term of why are we going to just be I'd be coming to\nThe white you got to have a doctor who knows what they're doing you know we have to deal with people tell her that's it I got rid of all we're All right there you go I get\nTo these phone calls or let's go to Stacy in Boston you got to a question for Dr Lisa\nGuy Dr Lisa ... so um [noise] my question is I've had three ... with my children [noise] and I've also had the gastric I'm not bypass but the sweet surgery\nAnd ... with my children and I've also had the gastric I'm not bypass but the sweet surgery\nUh-huh I'd had that also now I have a ton of me that hangs down a little bit and I wanted to know what can I Do to get rid of it like I I Can't see my bottle area\nBecause like stomach hangs down a little bit not to mention okay talk about blast\nUm I my she was like an upside down here I have ... go lower I have no booty I just am blessed I'm a liberal the size and also a\nBig one I recommend probably so when\nYou've had 'em some type of gastric or massive weight loss surgery that's great insurance companies now have restricted their coverage for um repairing or doing up and if you like to me that you can look ... policy and see if massive weight loss surgery is a benefit if it's a dentist that\nThen you you see a plastic surgeon and then they may be able to depending on your symptoms submit some information for ... not punished you like to me is part of a tummy tucked that a tiny tack that isn't it so if you like to me is its own surgery and if and if you like to me is included in a tiny town\nBut it's true that is not included in it than if you like to me it's just the lower half\nOf the skin is removed now the reserves I Try to do it through insurance is because that's going to decrease the costs somewhat and the other thing you can do is you can do a mommy make over half a breast reduction done and it's the same time do your tummy and that will also decrease the costs\nSo there are a lot of surgeons that will work with you you may have to wait and change your insurance and make sure at the covered benefits and you know you have to jump through these hoops like he may have to see a physical therapist you may have to take some molten dishes for your back pain shoulder pain that Cain is that\nUm but by and large just make sure you find out it's a covered benefit is a breast reduction a covered benefit is a picnic electing a covered benefit is massive weight loss surgery a covered benefit if it is then you start looking for your plastic surgeon\nAnd just discuss it with a make sure they take insurance and they also do cosmetic surgery 'cause a lotta times we can create extreme
