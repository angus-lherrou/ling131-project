you back some ... some I'm\nFull for eight nine to two seven zero three so let's go to our phones let's go to a Isaiah on line for eyes there how are you [noise]\nI'm doing well today how you doing today those last\nDay of my life now did you have the day off are you retired or what it did you you're celebrating Columbus Day of what\nNo I was making a lot of work out a big world today I had to go\nStay close a day I had to go in and work today as well\nRight and I was I Would just regular Monday was in ... was on your mind I was there\nFor one thing you know how we often hear that if you don't know history that it will repeat itself now that's what they say\nOkay so I got to thinking about they always ask this question about black on black crime and\nI think that in this country black on black crime probably originally started as\nIndian on India and crime you know being being agitated by the white man who gives both sides weapons and drugs and their stand back and say look at these people in every population of color with at the white man has accounted they employ just this tactic of their strategy and we sit back and act like it's something new you know\nNow now I I listen to last week when we talk about Cosby bought the actors that we've seen is twenty times in our life in the last Thirty years\nWhere they go out and get a prosperous black man and we buy into the narrative and feed into it and next thing you know we're all over the border to get their with their shenanigans but we have to learn to do better\nYeah loud and clear I mean I think again there's a nomenclature this language we've been given his purpose of the given to us as well as a subliminal\nSuggestions ah the fact that you call yourself a minority when you are a number the of a Caucasian twelve to one all across the planet um and so there are many things that we sometimes call ourselves or subconsciously without knowing that words have power\nAnd I'm so of course were given a certain narrative it is in cultivated in every facet of your life in order to make you believe that one uh people is the period you are in Syria and um sometime it becomes a self\nPerpetuating Kansas thing um but uh you know I agree with you all the way up to The Cosby issue now uh because uh I Believe that that brother did everything they said he did and unfortunately\nNow that the punishment should be the same uh you know we never got equal justice\nHere but one of the eggs also want us to be very cognizant of it just because they don't apply a standard to themselves don't mean that we should have we should not have a stand for our own actions and behavior\nI agree with you and lastly let me lady what's this I I firmly believe that it's all black people seek out the guy that they worship before they were sold into captivity ... and it goes back to that will never be blessed as the people we accepted ... go ahead I'm Sorry\nWe we we basically except it was given to us into that this was God and you will get out happiness in there after the after world and all these things but\nIt will require people in this country that I think too deeply to think about it just changed everything you've ever been taught about religion in this culture in this society here and that's a lot of hard work for a lot of people so that if I don't think that'll ever come to pass you know what\nDo you believe out there what is your religious affiliation identification\nAll I Would consider myself to be spiritual panhandler I mean I'll I'll take the best of what works for me from all different types of faiths and because\nOf that that seems to work for me or whether the the the discipline that the that the Muslims display or the austerity that the Buddhist undergo and it takes a whole bunch not just one particular thing because we have people who have been praying for years and years and still suffering injustice in this society\nI think if we're we're always run into when we began to try to delve into this thing of religion is your interpretation of it because some people do black Christian naturalist they believe is ...\nHome what'd you been doing all day to day we want to remind you to get out and vote voting is very bored\nThe November six election is coming up and is one of the most important races will have enjoyed it for a long time make sure you're register by going through my voter page ah at as old as that G. A. dot Gov if you're not registered the deadline to get registered is tomorrow the night\nAnd uh so make sure you go and get registered you can register online that SOS that Ga\nGo so you can register online dead you can check your voter status on line that is well what it reminds you joined ministers you read the ten thousand feel as he had just make a call out about thirty minutes ago a foot all

I'm sure they grateful that you're going to show up and stand in the gap for uh those aren't going to get a lot of seniors over there as well\nBut these little joke was don't care who they robbed
