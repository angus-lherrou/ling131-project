W A L K locally through the community to call in for four to seven\nZero the ball in the conversation knows why do you ever ... have that ...\nA ... so during one of the commercial breaks I had to run down to the car and because of the pride parade in order to do was located I had like run around to the back of the building and grab something out there running back in I got about half way you put a run back and realize you know your fat\nLike I'm Talking about ripping where heartbeat and hard we use and like ... looters melt it sounded like that Albert so uh I guess I got to go on a diet\nOh I'm a dripping wet heartbeat and hard we use in like the litter smelt satellite fat Albert so uh I guess I got to go on a diet still here Joe Profit a black conservative former NFL player during the break now the falcons almost got into a fight most proud of the novel season [laughter]\nAnd you know we're discussing it in for getting the Joe is a professional football player so he has the final word on what hits or legal at what Hitler not legal but a job before the break we were talking about this idea behind um a a kind of the\nUh work based economy a work based\nUh ethic for the the black community as opposed to a handout based uh ethic because often what Democrats do\nEr during election time as they start threatened saying you know there's a threat to the social programs as the Republicans get into office they're going to take away the welfare they're going to take away the food stamp they're going to take away Obamacare they're gonna take away Medicaid and Medicare or they never talk about what is needed to bring black folks\nOut of the point of meeting these things he'd program from it is three hours\nTo help during the Nineteen fifties and sixties Michael ... called the poverty programs in poverty and because they keep you know they keep you in mind the same way a pimp does by saying they're going to take away your food or shelter you're section eight and all those things\nHow can we get out of this mentality was clearly has stagnated growth of our community\nWhere I wanted one of the things that that I've always been in economic development is that even when we were sharecroppers back in Louisiana I could hear my father sent a guy I forgot to work our way off this farm\nAnd and in doing that we had a sense of pride we took that pride I took it proud my brothers um all got athletic scholarships my sister's got academic scholarship so my dad didn't have to write out any checks but he would have and we wouldn't have gone or any place for free\nBut my my position is that economic development usually comes with conservatism\nAnd by that I mean um it's it's not magic I mean I ... I grew up with more conservative black and white they went to church on Sundays they wish that the lord\nThey worked hard summer which had two and three jobs\nAre very little divorce um in in brown edition and in Monroe, Louisiana I think there were five or families we call the father and his five\nIt was that rare so economic development comes with a from within you want to build something you want to provide an environment\nOf respect a retirement of authority which your children in your home so when they go out into the world than they were how that respect for age and authority ... so taken away the social programs if not needed\nThat is a good thing social programs were meant for folks that needed in everybody at some point in the other hand up\nBut no one should always ... except the handing out and that's just the way you look at the world I I think\nPart of it also goes into the were from the urban rural split earlier that in early urban environments it's harder to\nKind of Ford's your own destiny because there isn't land around there is a property that you can just simply work and often the cities have so many regulations in place the only people who can deal with them were folks who already have money ... ... ... talk about the need to break down regulations to help people be able to\nAh to start their own entrepreneurship\nLet me give you an idea of what I Would do as an ex congressman from the fourth congressional district one of the first things I Would do would come and talk to the base about coming in making loans available in in some of these communities\nFrom the fourth congressional district one of the first things I Would do would come and talk to the base about coming in making loans available in in some of these communities because they're not\nMade any um loans available in black neighborhoods for for entrepreneur and for small business people the second thing I Would do is talk to the insurance companies and\nTalk to the homeowners' associations that talk to a each community about lowering the crime rate we lower the crime rate the insurance companies will lower their race the companies will come in and\nWe're going to train our kids to be prepared for those jobs when they come\nSo I Want to make a friendly environment for business and I also want to talk to parents and I'm a parent you know I got seven kids\nAnd I busy well I got up for natural kids and three adopt orders or I Would sleep [laughter] I Would adopt more if I could [laughter] but the thing that I I Try to promote in everybody's kid is that I Want to have\nA better environment for your kids then you had and that's what I Would like to see so as a result of that I Want to be able to really work for the people when I go to Washington or\nGet getting directly into a couple of things on this economic development side one thing one of the problems we have is urban for urban blight\nAnd are in our communities boarded up empty buildings completely fine buildings but people in the absolute community can't afford\nDon't have the capitalization requirements needed in order to satisfy you know as the a ... a the loan or a small business loan or even often you have these absentee landowners who still have these ridiculously high rent on them they don't believe in the state you know as a corporate entity\nUm you know New York somewhere who owns the property you can't afford the rent it out what can we do to uh to help people the rate on the regulations\nBreak down some of these corporate monopoly on property and get the hands of the people can actually get these businesses into the hands of people can actually do something with them\nWell first of all what I Would I Would do is uh it in that regard to help\nDevelop local communities and the buildings that are boarded up the first thing I Would do with talk to\nThose land laws about re investing in those communities in our communities because in the president's tax bill there's a provision reinvestment act so if they reinvest in certain communities they'll get a tax break kind of credit\nI Want to be able to ask sit down with those companies and a local community leaders about how can we are form a relationship that will eliminate the fear\nOf companies coming in\nThe fear of crime but people living in our communities\nOnce we get together and start discussing those items and things start to happen because everything in this world is is is a um centered around money mhm the people that have those buildings and other states got 'em border up they don't want that because no no income coming in\nOur food and to have something to clean to drink that won't make us sick and that are inevitably leads to a huge shock\nAnd the store shelves running empty and people panicking because the idea of taking personal responsibility has become an alien to us now\nLike you know it's interesting because every time there's a any event in Atlanta you know we we will be closed down the city over the threat of snow like one ants will shut down everything out but a few people run into the store and they buy eggs milk she inbred\nInto my mind I'm like why are you buying perishable items when you refrigeration might go out in a couple of hours what what do people stock up on just for the most basic bug out kid most basic being able to take care of yourself in case of emergency\nWell if if if there's a a strong chance that you'll have to leave you you should be thinking about weight and they're the widest food you can get his course freeze dried but free speech rights also really expensive\nEven if what you had was a a a fact stock of processed foods um liked canned goods they they last for a long time I'm a ... as basics like\nA dry run and um and and then water water is really the biggest problem we require\nEven without doing washer bathing we required about one gallon of water polo family member per day and if you start running the math on that let's say a hurts\nSure bathing we required about one gallon of water polo family member per day\nAnd if you start running the math on that let's say of hurricanes getting hit you got a family of four you're going to be gone for eight days if you're going to be living um you're going to be living at the back of your car maybe because of the massive exodus from that area\nAnd you're if you figure eight days as a gallon says that's thirty two gallons that's um you're working on a fifty five gallon drum with water just to survive that period of time in fifty five gallon drum is way bigger even putting your car your if you start by flats of water\nIt takes a lot a lot more flats water discovered down on one gallon for family members per day some really job number one is in food even though it's going to become important job no one has actually water clean water\nAnd and so forth since you're saying we can't carry a fifty fifty five gallon rumble water around we can't I'm necessarily a hope to find clean water supplies water people's will to do to purify water they might find a darn emergency situation\nUm well there is if you believe that definitely start out\nWith um bottles of water so if you have five gallons\nBought a five gallon jugs or even one gallon jugs from your old mill say you've cleaned really carefully and filled with water and maybe put a tiny amount of chlorine or Clorox I'm In it\nSo that it it it so that it remains to replace it every year then you've got water you can actually loaded into the back of your car sort of level one as you started with actually clean water and you can buy flats\nOf bottled water that's just a really expensive way to go I'm so just having a having that amount of water in in containers that you can laugh so probably maximum of five gallons that's where you begin so you'd say maybe have a week's worth to two weeks' worth\nUm that you can put in your car and drive away with the next step would then be carrying a water purification and you can have a fancy solution which would be a um water purifier um such as the platypus water purifier\nAnd uh if you like camping you'd probably want to own one anyway um that you could take virtually any water alongside the road run it through the ... and ended up with clean water but you don't even have to spend\n\nI think we broke up for a for a second uh on that one will see we can get Jason back on the on the line um so what about things important that we talk about the issues of ... and of\nUm making sure that we're ready in case of emergency because as Jason was saying before uh before the call broke up\nIt's very difficult for us to just as bad for all these things to be in place and all these things to be available to us when we got Jason back Jason deal there yep alright are before you were talking about the importance of water a before we we run out of time water just kind of a checklist of things people need to have in their house\nI'm just in case the storms come in they don't have the chance to uh to escape or to get away with other things have you know you're going to be going through or for a long power outage for a long a lack of access to basic necessities\nWell I'm In we're very reliant on electricity um so to just basically charge your cell phone which is where you get most of your\nUm information and as well be you're able to coordinate with family so some form of an ability to either charge your cell phone for a week on either with a battery\nTo coordinate with family so some form of an ability to either charge your cell phone for a week\nUm either with a battery or with a solar panels so goals zero makes it a solar panel that you can put it outside of talking to help your whole lot of rain struggles that forever to charge your phone\nBut some sort of a battery backup that you can charge your cell phone you have to assume that you're going to probably lose any of the good as you were mentioning before your your refrigerator that you're going to have to eat those right away though was um um\nBut bottom line I Would say power is important electrical power at ease at very least keep your cellphone charged\nAlso flashlights um they're the obvious\nUm and then the next step I start looking at your ability to cook your food so um [noise] some sort of a small cooking appliance like a jet boil stove so you can heat up water\nBoil water if you want to purify by boiling and you know make a woman or to reconstitute dried food\nAll right well before we go those really quick about black autumn and how people can get in contact with you'll find out more about your your writings and to find the publishing\nGreat will blackout and it's just a it's a fiction books you get to experience what would life be like if we've lost um you can uh if we lost these systems and what should I\nThink about the beauty of fiction as you get to live at um while you're reading and and gain or really
