this gubernatorial race the governor's race for this with the state\nIs bringing much attention lots as I said it's laps on this story\nSo lots of intriguing suspense and\nDifferent details unfold each and every day\nIn this particular election um last night there was the first debate and it was a it was a\nAn interesting one our experience um I took the time to take a look at it is to see what was being said and I'm going to be honest I don't know what if you saw what you saw what'd you took away from\n'em but I just saw\nOne candidate that was just Supreme leader prepared oh and very just sink in an inch sharp and articulate in the delivery of their platform\nThanks and an end sharp and articulate in the delivery of their\nPlatform and I thought that was just very impressive\nOr there were two others that I wasn't impressed with it all\nAnd I'll be more specific um as we go deeper into the conversation that you already know welcoming from in a way you know I'm not trying to tell you who to vote for\nI'm just telling you what I think about folks you know what I'm saying some of this I'd like to do I like to know was what I think you know you think what you think can you do what you do with this station does not\nEndorse any candidate for anything okay let's just get that straight so as we engage conversation the main thing to maintain the main thing you saw last night's debate\nYour thoughts concerning for all for a nine to two seven zero three is the number\nOf when I said that this story has some um slaps on yes that was this debate last night and while I was looking at the debate watching it\nSomething popped up I don't know from some sort some either social media source or or popped up on the television or something that I'm an old film clip\nOf show Stacey Abrams participating in the old in burning the old Georgia State flag and\nI was wondering I was I was just thinking you know where we are now\nAre these kinds of things really shouldn't make a difference and probably won't make a difference because people are locked in where they are and they won't be changing too much in the next few weeks\nOr but one of the things that's ... that has been revealed um does that\nAnd we should have known this even though a Stacey Abrams is taking some moderate stances\nOn some issues are and in\nBright bright camp is unequivocally totally conservative okay but\nI'm\nStacey Abrams come to find out is very very liberal in the top two percent\nOf liberal or legislators and um since the nineties in the Georgia State legislatures so there I Am saying that to say that these two candidates or a polar opposites of each other\nAnd what we're dealing with ... in this country is a a a real polarized\nKind of a environment a meal you if you will\nEnd up such um we have to I'm\nJust be prepared to see who is going to support their candidate\nEverybody is already made their choice everybody's already owned the size of their own\nBut I Wonder if uh anything was said last night in the debate that good of push anybody to the left or to the right make you move off of where you are ready to stand for all for a nine to two seven zero three is the
