I'm saying two millimeters of a white chalk with the ball in print it for that looked like a farewell to me Mr Kovacs miserably vendetta you guys do differently that looks out that look fair to me man\nIt's so close but if I had to go one way I side with you I think it was fair but so close\nI Will disagree I thought it was ... I really see a little bit of like the dirt that came up from the ... on the line but I didn't see any of the white come up when it actually landed\nSo maybe it was so close that the ... was in the dirt and the white moved out because the ball hit of because of dirt pushed against it right from the ...\nThat is a it was really really close and this is what you know we always talk about on the show or very shows I've done about baseball I Love baseball it's a ... I'm not a Rockies fan I'm not a brewers fan but I'm captivated by this bat\nI Wish there was a way for baseball to find the means and the opportunity to make\nThis word is riveting when it's not your team like some of the guys 'cause we're based I'm In Vegas right now but I'm not from New York I Lived there now but most of the guys who work at CBS portrayed her a lot of them naturally our New Yorkers in their roots\nAre there and certainly behind the scenes and on some of the national shows in the morning one of the ah one of the guys that that's on there are a lot talking a lot of Yankees and was going to have at the end I Love it I Love your passion\nIt's interesting what is it about baseball at this moment right now ... isn't as nationally interesting rebutting even happens three weeks ago even\nWrite like it has to this small window where basically becomes incredibly relevant and incredibly interesting and I don't know what the solution is and I I Love the feeling the tension in baseball\nAnd I'm trying to think of his his right if I'm just saying if you were going to baseball segment but to me I think by the way single just happened you're talking about Iraqis team first and second none out two to one just got to the bullpen\nGuys correct me if I I guess it's a ... for each of you for Tom for students for all day five five to one to foresee be as if you want to weigh in when I Try to measure when I Try to measure like what the most tension isn't a sporting event\nI think for me baseball playoffs is up there like I find obviously the NFL's really exciting but I rarely feel a tone of tension it happens but in baseball it seems like it's just night after night after night in the postseason\nNBA there's a lot of tension or the end of the game but I feel stress intention sometimes when I'm watching baseball playoff games in the second or third or fourth inning and then just you might guys if there's a or am I just am I just more into baseball than other people\nKnow you're totally right I think I think the not having a clock kind of helps baseball in the sense because at any point of the game again could be out of hand true you know it to one game could become a three to game basketball for about a little different 'cause you still have you know it depends it was the third quarter fourth quarter but I think the not having a clock kind of helps baseball in that regard\nI Love the like the nod in my stomach than they get like the nerves that get and obviously for me that is exponentially increased ... what is the team that I root for which is the cubs and I'm sure it's the same for each of you when it's your team but again watching the game and like there's there's attention there's an energy right now\nNo I root for which is the cubs and I'm sure it's the same for each of you when it's your team but again I'm watching this gay man like there's there's a tension and there's an energy\nRight now warning one as\nThe big game that's the five series cholera wins\nThis game and all of a sudden that momentum trained becomes really really powerful I take the Yankees I mean the Yankees are not as good a team is\nThe red Sox but they didn't win a hundred games and the red Sox ace the guy that\nReally a difference maker when you guys are somebody out there Chris sell his velocity being down to where it is it seems like a really big problem by the way the uh brewer's just blew a home I got\nThese guys were just who was that two and a and Mr a RC uh for the brewers are short star shortstop\nAmount of more of a delay I think part of the reason baseball's such a cool hold for people in attention maybe I'm wrong I think most of us played it right like I did not play high school football but I just played I played baseball most of my life and I can remember boot and balls and in big moments or teammates doing it\nAnd it gives them six and a two ... two thirds shutout innings against it people in the championship two years ago and he looked really impressive I wrote about it for CBS Sports than just how we really good he was with his shots like it's such a good job of spotty and it was all inside corner outside on a\nVery impressive or I felt a little bit on his match with Chris Bryant and acknowledge it Chris ... shoulder no question but he was doing it to Brian he was doing it to everybody really really thought of that\nAnd then of course we should go to the late innings the thirteenth ending deep into the night Tony Walters is the third string catcher comes up with the game winning hit wrote my game or get a cat with the Rockies the writer we're a good friend of my we were both on trucks\nAnd went to sleep at six am that night and I'm going to do that about three more times that I've looked at the time of year and sleep is for the dead\nBest selling author CBS boards writers CBS for days you analysts among other things fantasy dominated Jonah Keri\nHere on the show Jonah you um you wrote a book about Tampa Bay memory serves when Madden was their writing your book\nOverlapped with his time there what do you use them as someone who has spent a lot of time focusing on an organization that man was the the manager for what do you make of this notion or this this pushback or this\nFan response to that mad and for some reason should not be the cubs manager of the future\nI mean everybody\nYou know has a hot tape now at this point and any tactical error God Forbid and it doesn't need to be an error process it could be something that you know by the percentages look right but it didn't work while the hounds of how we're coming for you because we've all got sweater and we've all got you know run expectancy charts and all that stuff and you can't get away with stuff\nYou know does not make tactical mistakes of course he does does every manager and the history of baseball make tactical mistake\nYou bet they do to me the job of managers to keep your team from killing each other you here and the cost us four hundred and sixty games mighty Seventy degrees in St Louis digging them after a night game nobody wants to be there that's when you have to manage and that could be that you have the team not take BP or it could be that you\nKnow give them something fun or or or whatever and leave them alone or ... whatever is going to get it done just figure out a way\nAnd that becomes very difficult to quantify I to give us a parallel here I this is the fighting force you're on the road that I had to go for an album manager of the year I'm I'm In my Colorado chapter although won't be there next year to them about Canada but they're not a Colorado chapter and that's what's been assigned to me for years and ... you know hard it's for management here\nAs a manager of the year to me he was on the south guy does not come down the stats it comes down to leadership and I cannot quantify it and even if I Am down the road it do and\n... and everybody else that they thought I'd get twenty five different answers and there'd be no answer\nSo really nobody knows anything about hiring managers\nNobody knows anything about firing manager is the only good thing that I've heard recently is that the Toronto blue jays are looking for a new manager and they said that they want something by legal because they feel very important first new and fresh idea or every managers by what you bilingual in my mind because Latin players make up a giant part of the game and it'd be nice if you can communicate with\nJonah Keri here on the show showed up so it looks like and I'm a cubs fan so I'm I'm not able to look at these things\nJust nationally I Love ... and he's forever my good graces out just 'cause I think he's great when he does but obviously he was a guy when they won the world series\nHe's going to operate under his current deal knock it extended through next year in a parallel David Roberts doesn't have a contract extension right now but the Dodgers have an option on him the Roberts in LA the manager of the Dodgers his bosses Andrew Freeman Andrew\nDavid Roberts doesn't have a contract extension right now but the Dodgers have an option on him the Roberts in LA the manager of the Dodgers his bosses Andrew Freeman Andrew Freedman was the Boston in a close relation with maddening Tampa Bay is there a scenario\nYou that you see where if the cubs do not extend mad and he could become a Dodgers manager in two thousand twenty\nTwo I mean they definitely had a good relationship and\nYou know speaking of has a book called the extra two percent of the guardian to not just that it's a ... and it's about the organizational culture more than anything and that organizational culture this years after ... been in that and that's\nWhat's the most innovative thing that happened in baseball this year it's a Tampa Bay rays this idea of a bullpen game yet we see I'm watching the Rockies game as speaking the brewers\nWent through a bunch of all the reason we're seeing with other teams the rate didn't even pretend they put in a closer Sergio won't start games how'd it go warning and then they bring in like ... there was like a long Rand who pitch for five minutes then they go to ...\nAnd they did this for about five days because all their stars except Chris I'm Sorry to except now where do you get hurt\nOr got traded or whatever they have nobody I mean that's pretty interesting\nAnd so going back to freedom in at night and they both connecting that White Mountain isn't necessarily Justin analytics got there's lots of analytical inclined managers now especially now that there are guys what our age being hired but what makes it interesting is that they see eye to eye on so many other things how there'll be organizational culture how to motivate players\nFreeman isn't just a number crunching and he was mad and they got along really well and I think that'd be a great fit I'm frankly a lot of fun if it were to go and that's where I should get\nJonah Keri what kind of odds are you're given the Yankees against the red Sox and the series\nI got a good shot I wrote about it at a sports today that piece by like check on my stuff everyday TB that's all month long 'cause I'm going to be writing class was due on credit Yankees Red Sox\nPreview as we speak so you're right on point here but this was a separate piece which was more about relief pitchers than the red Sox per se or the Yankees per se although it did I get your content\nAnd what I said was he liked the Yankees in ... and these are the two clubs with the best full tens of any remaining team can potentially over achieve because they're not going to go through the motions of oh my stars in the game is getting tired and it's a sixth inning but I always think about how many times\nHow Clinton curriculum veteran a planet the doctor tried to write him and that didn't work not to say the ...\nHe's not capable or whatever it's just set a fresh picture is better usually than a non fresh fruits or even if the other guy Clinton gr saw and so by the Yankees and floors doing it sets up an interesting scenario where maybe the Yankees could beat Bush took a Jack of leaving the Yankees I Would say the better team\nHave better personnel but if the red Sox are trying to squeeze it six sending out of court sale let's say an salesman interest that year it'd be a little rusty or whatever and the Yankees are saying we're going to fresh Chad green and the third inning\nOr we shouldn't get Chris mail is better than chat green if one guy fired one guy's fresh\nI sure about that so I think if the Yankees are doing a series\nI think they're not as good a team on paper but if they're going to win it's going to be\nAaron Boone just using the hell out of that old time being as aggressive as possible not even bothering with all the benches remember when we used to care about the when oh let's leave the guy in except for and she was going to cost around six five four gonna leave meant that's the dumbest thing ever pointy headed nerves like the up and saying it's it's I don't know the ... and that managers managing that way\nThat's exciting stuff for baseball and oppose well for the like the Yankees\nAnd you hit on that in your common CBS board dot com about the ... the Yankees and the brewers as the strength of the ... not living up to that today but if the brewers advance how do you see a magic ... against presumably I guess presumably we think is the Dodgers how seriously do you take the Dodgers this ...\nWell first of all gonna play we disagree with you and I know what you're saying we're watching the game and the ...\nYou're from walkie against presumably I guess presumably we think is the Dodgers how seriously do you take the Dodgers this ...\nThis well first of all gonna play we disagree with you and I know what you're saying we're watching the game and the first give it up and then I think that night sitting in the bullpen e as it gets\nThere were all those other things that happen first Brendan what started the game\nHe could loosely be described as a starter but really he will be pushed into starting role so that's reading released to start the game even if you want to call the starter though\nThey had given up I Believe it was either one hit or to get for the next five innings no rods and one hit for five and eight before a couple of the singles in the ninth traded a tie so I think that it is working and that you're going to have to ask the question again because I got really excited about what you said that I had to contradict you right away literally for God's\nGoing that direction on the brewers great bullpen despite not be able to close out in the night how seriously do you take the brewers in this series and against the Dodgers what's your assessment of them as a World Series contender\nI have a friend who asked me for a for gambling advice on baseball and of course you know try to steer clear by myself but I think if I were hypothetically way during dumping bears\nAren't even favorites the birth of the best record liquor and the number one seed in the national league but they're not considered the favorite to win the pennant that would be the doctors the brewers we're on opposite nine to Portland and it's nice that you could do a lot worse than that hypothetically if people or to talk about these things\nAnd not necessarily move on that but talk to their friends about it because this team has a lot going for them if you look at that both and it's monstrous yes Jeffers gave it up at this point but Josh haters obese\nAnd you look at the court can able he's been fantastic since late August and they have a monster often yell at you probably know when the MVP even though I'd vote for tickets um\nThey have watch shark Kane a whole bunch of hitters and by advance metrics they had the second that he said that all the baseball too so you got a dominant decent a dominant off and it's a monster bullpen the only thing that they don't have starting pitching and going back to that column in today's day and age\nWhen teens are more and more going to the bullpen\nDo we even have starting pitching ace Clayton freaking Kirk shop the God of God's cold facts reincarnate is not ... in the postseason who is reliable the postseason and why are we even bothering try to separate relievers pregame it'd be done with it\nJonah Keri who just told us that I Believe you just said you voted were you will vote for the ground from BP would you elaborate for us and why that was your choice\nWater on the ballot on that my ... my ... as if you're actually can't tell you what I voted for for management here I can tell you about that\nHe doesn't really you're not you're not allowed to talk about an advance really\nNo no I I don't know why you have an NFL voters that write\nThe NBA ... and you are a lot about\nIt after you both fortunately\nYeah I mean they don't love it so if you want to vote next year you should do it but it's not a rule against it\nBaseball's were really really they don't love it and then fuzzy on that I Love it they they really strongly encourage us not to uh but that's a fun one too I mean I just I just when we were talking about before our conscious it's difficult it's over manager Andy ... comes

Celtic how how seriously do you take\nThe idea in October then a guy knows whether he's going to stick around in a place comes alive\nOh I think it very seriously um listen\nWhen somebody equipment case if they say\nYou know listen uh this is a great team but I'm going to make that decision when I get to the end of the season or me and my guys have to discuss it or whatever I'm not going to answer that or you know hey this is who I'm with right now when people do all that stuff when they stay ambiguous and they give those\nKind of like semi commitments where it sounds like you know you're leaving your option that's when you worry about things that are set in October when somebody says very noncommittal or just ambiguous things about why like where I Am or we're just we're not going to talk about it right now that's when the warning flags should go up\nKyrie Irving this news today I don't think she'd surprise anyone now I Know carries\nA unique individual um I've got a story coming up about that very thing or in a couple of weeks here I'm unique guy he's hard to read he sometimes says things that are a little hard to unpack\nBut he has given every indication over the last couple of weeks including in conversation with me a week ago up in Boston including on media day with all of the Boston media including them in various other places\nThat he is happy there that he has all the regarding the world for Danny Ainge for Brad Stevens that he knows how good he cut it with as much talent is he's got around him\nHe's given every indication short of what he said today which was the actual you know more formal commitment\nUm verbally he's given every indication before that that there was no reason to think he was going to college and everything else was more just you know the usual NBA gossip and speculation and hey he he's from New Jersey so maybe wants to play for the next the next up cap room and all that stuff I don't know why anybody would want to leave the situation in these in in Boston\nHoward back without giving too much away maybe a sneak peak of your Kyrie Irving story that will be out of bleach report the next few weeks I'm just curious as a as a writer whether you were interested in and tried to get into his um Perry's comments about a flat earth versus mental together\n[laughter] you know it's funny because this is how these things go right like I'm up there a last week Monday Tuesday Wednesday and um I got him I think it was Tuesday night we chatted for a while and so we talked about the letter thing and he he he said two things that indicated that he had some regrets\nAbout that and it's okay I got some really good stuff there and then of course yesterday he's he's at the ... under thirty thing and he he steals the whole thing on my cart Kyrie just scooped me on that part\nAnd then there were some things he said about his happiness and Boston everything am I going to miss some pretty good stuff what and you know today there's there's this so yeah this is how these things go this story is broader than any of that it's it's more about I'm just kind of ... you know unique makeup I'm as a person and and as a as a player\nAnd um we did talk about the flat or stuff and you know my you know there there's any number of ways of of of um interpreting\nAnd um we did talk about the flat or stuff and you know my you know there there is any number of ways of of of um interpreting his various statements about this over the last Eighteen months or whatever it's been since he first started out there my belief is that\nHe didn't necessarily believe that the moment he set it and then you know once you get the backlash you know depending on your personality there's a bunch of ways you can go and I think his personality is just such that he likes messing with people everybody I talked to for this story tells you he likes messing with people\nIn one on one basis doesn't have to be flatter stuff doesn't have to be public he just he's a provocative toured that's what he does and so I think he just I think it got away from him frankly and then\nYou know maybe he just didn't really how how you know it would be interpreted or\nUm didn't know how to walk it back whatever I'm Glad he gave a full throated apology um yesterday because um he's a really really smart guy and he put himself in a in an unfortunate light I think you I think he made the right decision by by finally just decided to kind of a deserve our that\nOur back you're on the show excellent MBA writer for bleach report in a man

upcoming free agency and what is the level of concern you think ... fans were executives might rightfully ads about the possibility of Katy going somewhere else next year\nYeah that one is much much tougher to to ascertain just because he's not an easy guy to read either I mean we've seen this you know over and over with Kevin Turan that um he's he's got to kind of a complicated makeup um he you know I Know you saw it coming when he left Oklahoma really\nUm and you know there's\nI think the most interesting thing he has said period and this isn't about free agency but I think it's an insight into to his his his ah thought process or his emotional process was that when you are after winning a championship and I think he was in a story with me Jenkins\nWere inside where he said some of the affected by you know I thought I Would have this there you'd be dislike lasting feeling of like joy or satisfaction or whatever and and ... and ... and I didn't have it like it\nHe realized how

Beach Boys would would be ... right now we're going to go to the segment we call ... were very happy to welcome in a very very spiritual\nGood it is the commissioner of the super ... degrees athletic association we I double A. jak human Williams welcome to reach me so you boy\nOh thank you it's my pleasure to be with the all\n... of where to begin with you but let's begin at the beginning you being the commissioner of this Congress now in your six year how do you describe being the ...\nOh my gosh it's um I Can't believe it's the fix the event and um the six year and then um it's been exhilarating it's been challenging its fan I'm a progressive if then\nI don't know it's been all kinds of emotions I've been up and down in a good way you know it's sad to say I came in to a situation where they're needed to be some changes um and they happened pretty quickly\nUm and I think we've grown so fast like the CIA double A. is just continues to evolve and it's really fun to be a part of an organization that has so much history in value not just to this community ... of our member institutions but in the country\nWhere you are the person who has your ... your heart because you're regretted reducing reducing the ... member of the time and have university to talk about your experiences as an undergraduate and do the pride that brings you have in their position now did you ever see yourself wanting to be in this ...\nI did but it was later on you know I think when you're in college and you know you my undergraduate psychology and then I went and got my masters in sports management\nAnd I'm not sure that I knew what a commissioner really was I mean you know you you know that you want to work in sports are have that opportunity but there's so many um opportunities and athletics um from compliance to coaching\nAnd academic um could professional um to the Olympics and so they have the opportunity to\nTo work in college athletics has been the fit for me and my coach at Hampton really encouraged me I think he tried to encourage women um us to stay in athletics because there's just such a shortage of women particularly a African American women\nWho are in the field and I think he kind of pushed me to stay in athletics and go get my masters and\nI'm I'm Glad that I went to Hampton and it was probably the best\nExperience ever for me collegiate experience I can tell you like most of us should go in your freshman year a little home sick and you might hear you trying to party a little bit too much particularly at age VCU um but reality sets in when the midterm grades come in and your coaches\n\nThat you're about to go home if you don't get it together and so you know I was an athlete under ... who then went to Norfolk but I've stayed in Hampton I didn't want to transfer cause Hampton was my choice of this petition\nI had a great collegiate experience I'm even as you know the devil a with that met in college\nBecause Hampton was my choice of is the tuition and had a great collegiate experience I'm even as you know the idea of a lay with that met in college um I had no clue what being the all conference all tournament all player player the year with that really looked like until now I look back and be like that was a huge\nUm opportunity for me to play us to sports that I Love but then even to have this success and then take that success and be in this position as commissioner so it's kind of surreal um to kind of watch our athletes and understand\nThat I have the opportunity to play the game but then use the platform I'm to grow you know um academically athletically but also as an administrator to be in this role in position it's pretty cool\nNow commissioner you are the first African American female ever who'd due to their position I'm sure that was monumental for you as well\n[noise] you know Russia I ... I don't think I ever thought about until people start communicating it like you were the you're the first um 'cause I definitely don't ever want to be the last um I'd love to see more women particular African American women um be commissioners\nAnd it's not an easy opportunity to access to as has been fortunate\nTo be under some great mentors to have some great opportunities repair me for the position and so I definitely you know it's\nI don't know it's an honor to legacy in my family you know for my daughter to see me in this roller other girls and women or even men to see me and the roles and and have the desire to figure out how how did I get it\nUm as early as this weekend an older gentleman at the Virginia union games that how did you like how does this look like for you you know how did you get here and to give him you know an elevator pitch and he was like wow you have to tell more people about your story and so I just feel blessed\nAnd extremely honor to be in this rural and have the opportunity\nTo use this platform to demonstrate my passion for athletics college athletics\nOn but also find ways to bring other people along\nIf you're just joining us we're talking to the Seattle police commissioner Jackie Williams now you were recently inducted into the Hampton University athletic hall of fame has been this summer actually\nWere being to sport athlete in basketball and volleyball which he talked about a little bit but receiving this honor being inducted into the hall of fame ... just describe your emotions when you found out in the going through that ceremony\nWow so you can make me cry this early in the morning of [laughter] you know I got the letter from the athletic director Jane who's also a dear colleague and\nI think I just stared at it and I'm like oh and I didn't even tell anybody for a minute my daughter was with me and I said I'm In the hall of fame and um and I kind of held it to myself and then I shared it with a couple of my best friends and um I don't think I really and I got that letter like early in the year\nUm you know I think when I got there and I saw you know so many other athletes it almost was like\nYou know am I worthy and one of my um football players ah ah Richard Taylor who he was a senior when I was a freshman always or junior he always took care of me like the big brother him and his wife\nHave been so encouraging to me since I've been here and what he said to me um before the ceremony is walk into your blessings you deserve this and it was in that moment when I was like okay this is it's okay it's okay to receive this on it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre I mean it's always you know every year we're just trying to think of new ways to engage people and get them excited about coming into the venue you know sometimes it's about talent\nSometimes it's about if you're connected to the alumni to the school sometimes it's about reuniting like we have people come this was their fiftieth tournament that they've been to so there's tradition there so when you are and then now we're trying to get the the young the genetics\nOr millennials or the younger the students in the building and trying to find ways to to get them inside\nSo I think will will have some new ideas come this year working with our member institutions new ticket packages that we've explored that will be offering um this spring this fall I'm beginning in November I'm so discounts I'm\nSome opportunities with hotel reductions on that so I think we're trying to get creative to engage more people in the building the reality is is that you know people want to be a part of the atmosphere\nAnd part of the ... not necessarily the game's not necessarily the fans says they just want to reunite\nUm but we're always looking for ways if there is a hundred and forty thousand people in the city of Charlotte\nThen why is that there are tens of thousands of twenty thousand people trying to get into the building and so that is a constant um challenge that we have to work on and it's not just start then you know every conference has have these type of issues that they have to work on annually based on\nA conference and their member institutions but see I double a is a pretty unique footprint that gives us a little bit more challenges I think there's some other conferences\nWell I Know I'm not yeah doubling much can I throw in my ... my ... to ... ... ...\nWe do you know Atlanta this summit of bed at this point so you know it's it's we put it out there for all hosts cities and so you know it's really up to the city to determine if that if that\nAnd at this point so you know it's it's we put it out there for all host cities and so you know it's really up to the city to determine if that if that opportunity for them to host is worse\nUm see I ... in Atlanta I think the challenge for us with Atlanta is just the footprint nine\nEight of our schools are in Charlotte North Carolina\nWe have two schools in Virginia we have one in Maryland won in Pennsylvania so when you go to Atlanta you're kind of spreading the footprint a little bit further so that discussion with the board would have to be you know extremely what would be the offerings to pull 'em most of our members more south than what we are currently are here in Charlotte\n... to ... to me they're probably open book Colombia is the most boys get\nA class Lynne is work scientists have class Lynne in our conference I mean they are ready to go I mean\nUm July one was their entry point into the\n... devil lay their alumni as strong the school is strong um they're great template for um what they do in their athletic program um their president's involvement and so our board and our member conferences very excited\nAbout having them and again there in South Carolina so that does open up a new footprint for our member institutions to look at championships I'm In their area\nMoved from Tom ... commissioner who grew up with the ... the a ... and we just talked about a new member coming into the norm for ...\n... new members would ... a new member\n... ... where you calling from ... to ... you know she's a worst recoup your alma mater ... joined a call ... ... ... the only one in the ... ... ... in the lord\nThat at all show on university is currently a member of our conference are actually moving out next year I'm expanded their sports platforms and a lot of the sports that they are now offering like lacrosse and field hockey hockey and soccer\nUm we don't offer that is so you know I think what what institutions look for is a place that fits for their sports programs are academic programs and whether an H. B. C. or not\nUm you know the Congress has to determine do they bring value added on to the conference and social won has been a member of probably over twelve or Thirteen Years\nOr maybe a little longer and the sad devil a they'll keep football in our conference and also women's bowling I'm prior to class and getting in our conference had a policy that you had to have football\nUm in order to be a member of our conference classical and doesn't have football a year and a half ago the conversation and it was our board became do we want to strap ourselves with not being able to expand by having or requiring member institutions\nWho may not want football because of the um the cost of football but have all other programs and maybe even more that we don't offer that made benefits a conference\nAnd so once they made that decision and open up the door to evaluate other member institutions who could fit our platform and who can be a member of the CIA devil lay about four years ago we did a feasibility study on and part of that feasibility study listed evaluate expansion for the Congress and what schools particularly\n... fit into the the ad that lay based on where we're located from division one to any I ate a division two or schools or division three who could move up to division to um\nAnd where we're located from division one to any I ate a division two or schools or division three you'll get move up to division to classical if it's a platform\nFor it they had an interest to come to the devil lay on but again we had a policy that wouldn't allow them to come in one set policy change there was more dialogue from them about their interest than being a member of the\nDevil a and so yeah they are a\nThreat at this point you know we had Thirteen school show wanna leave out next year so we'll have twelve again we're constantly looking at associate members um we would like to bring back baseball and men's tennis and identify schools not maybe as fall numbers but associate and then but that could help us bring those too for that so that our men and so\nForth are just as healthy as our Women's Sports slow\nCommissioner we just want to thank you for joining us here on H. B. the play and we greatly appreciate on the inside all the guys that you just drop done\nA St Louis has salmon appreciate you guys is covering HVAC is down here just as passionate as me and my other colleagues and it's this uh this is a unique face that we get to work in every single day I'm culturally it's different\nUm diversity is different um it's just a a place I Love the idea of all a if it's a grounding foundation for me\nAnd to be a part of this because I log and tell people life story is always great so thank you so much for the office\nBut you so much for joining us rebellion maybe will come up and visit with you for the tournament in February\nYou need to come on up here and how do you care that where it is to me now like a trip [laughter] thank\nYou what would you for joining the voters ...
