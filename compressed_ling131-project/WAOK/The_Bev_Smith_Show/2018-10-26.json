[noise]\nJust like a\nYou know you can't do all the difference between the two and a line\nYou know what people are doing what the motivation\nIs so much to consider some what to think about 'em\nAnd I think the only way that we get to ... to come into space like this and I'm sure would have used that we think and hopefully we can out of sharing a come to a consensus oh about what's going on so we won't be walking around in the dark right\nAll right I'm let's go to learn new during this bomb\nI Want to ask you however by where to maintain who is more responsible for the current social political climate in the country the president or the Beatty I see you Joel ammonia\nYes sir hearted good morning brother Joe it's a it's a\nVery a job I have a new on the air that we can express our opinion on various things\nMy my um with a advocate a record store decay up uh-huh and uh you know a Donald Trump or your brother's point about Donald Trump is not the main a person that starting to stay but Donald Trump\nIs ill and the fact he is the deal that faith back ... and all these folks out here just like this device just all these devices that bad a delivery uh-huh it's because of Donald Trump now uh when did you talk about the news media\n... we might be a computer I\nDon't know whether the truth to to do to believe the truth uh uh uh uh uh ally\n... the thing is is that if we can still to that\nPoint we are in the dark kind of test would tell you what cameras says we'll show you that the Republicans down the trial is built into by all the ... and in this country\nMhm and it's imperative that we as a people\nGo to the polls and vote that's the only power we have and if we can see on November to say yes what we've got to be sent back almost fifty years because the Republican Party without a job is back in the federal government a stack\nOf the federal courts right where his conservative base people okay Mm and would that be sad that's not that we can\nIf we go to the polls and vote\nAnd with that being said that's not that we can\nWe go to the polls and vote you mind if I had my id are\nThe rap or their own own own own own own radio or singing about states Abe we have to be a a force a powerful force to the polls we got to show you folks that we have powers to the ballot box ... that's the only way because we see okay\nAll right thank you for your call ...\n... for the next two to seven zero three people moving in the movie and I see you've seen\nThese them blessed to your doctor flounder same to you distance than Mm\nYes and I guess I'll get right to the main thing um basically I say that both the media and the Republicans and Trump are responsible but\nMore so the Republicans and Trump and the reason I say that well those of us who were blessed to have any steamed education from HCC you ...\nWe are required and and I think I can speak on your behalf we were required to take of course how logical reasoning\nAnd logical reasoning we learned about something called fallacies which are committed by this administration daily and\nAbout you know bottom line\nThat well [laughter] that's talking about ball they live in a\nFlash flavor you'll recall there is a a fallacy called mob appeal number he'll many till the mob of people so what\n... and ... the conservative heads and the Republicans whatever you want to call them\nWhat they're doing is they're back in the those who are less educated and throwing a little seeds out here to get them riled up in this call of healing the mob and so you just take one thing that they fear they're fearing\nThe growth of the minority\nThe um power that black south that's why we need to get out and vote as the gentleman said prior to me and um we've got to show our power but they fear that power if the Europe uniting and come together and we need to just go ahead and let them be scared to show them what we can do\nBut um that that is um I I definitely blame Trump and the administration for appealing to this so that you know these things like these bombings were seen the song bomb things to different people that's part of it was all you have to do is just get the emotions riled up in these people do stupid things\nReal it appears that you again I appreciate your prospective\nI've heard other prospect dues you know I you know me I'm kind of a I I like the conspiracy theories you know um maybe do the Saudis I don't know uh you know it I wouldn't be honest with you know and you know in a robot caller earlier said you know just\nThey were confused that means that were blind and deaf I don't know that I'm not I'm not clear that we haven't been blind to you know somebody took the thinking my [laughter] you know is is\nI don't know if there's so many different what they have done his throat so many different options so many different uh\nScenarios that could be\nYou're from what they have done his throat so many different options so many different uh scenarios that could be out there you know and without benefit of the truth\nIt's just hard to know this is hard to know from operas yeah my prospective are just looking at these new shows and reading and reading blogs and different articles\nAre these people don't know either [laughter] you're saying I all round here speculating\nBut it's some folks who do know right and what we've got to deal with up to do with how we impacted on the ground or on the ground how would the impact\nOf elections and or will people become afraid to go to the polls are\nAre definitely hope not at least a\nWhole black folks don't get scared to go to the bowl\nUh we've been bone before you know we we'd be received bomb they used to do it all the time in the in the fifties and sixties they always bark

and like all the right yeah\nYeah yeah it's it don't smell right and I don't know what they're not my thing is I just know that we won't ever find out the truth about at least I have no confidence in in in that because they don't tell us the truth they tell us the lives they want us to a year and we have to speculate about risk I mean I don't have any faith\nOr in in what the media is Sherry and a

you just never know man these folks man be trying to make it happen they try to make a point\nAnd you know they they are really want to call the people doing the crazy you know already so it sounds like to set up for a scapegoat or it sounds\nYou know what I'm saying how they they leak a little bit out here and live a little bit out there and before you know it you know they go and say well yeah it was just one crazy dude who did you know I\nMean you see what the election they trying to hold the they they have to\n... a year they still in the ... they're doing it all gerrymandering the voter

B. C. you play\nWell Sam thanks for having me inside the be on\nRoute to have you read the heavy and Bruce ... hear about you guys and able to like you know we start there about the last couple of weeks ago in Albany state and the things that you got to be married to do just do a few things a little bit normal well\nIt's been interesting you know a mother nature\nOr through a pretty a pretty good curve ball at our entire city here in Albany was hurricane particle and it still be in a category one hurricane Lewis came through here and he's got all kinds of destruction and trees down and power out and\nUh it had to move our team to Savannah Georgia there for about five days and and just to\nKind of a a a emergency management nightmare about a ... and\nA team and the president or\nA predator Marion Frederick here are just did a great job of supporting us finding ways to\nTo make things happen funding is just a practice field in a place to feed the guys and a and never wavered in their support uh which was really important for our players who are kept the asking hey do you want to play you want to play his foreign off they were just wears down day yeah yeah let's make it happen so uh\nUm so they made it happened and kids\nYou know overcame the difficulties and and then a hill last week we obviously the the ah tore up our stadium pretty good at the mood to\nMove homecoming which was a unique for sure [noise] um but we're able to play here or in Albany at a\nA city stadium at all the state of play that many times before\nAre not in the last ten years but down his trip down memory lane together female stadium ready and uh it was a great crowd and uh and other did win for so just real proud of our guys and the way they've kind of a overcome the various diversity as they've seen the last couple of weeks\nAnd then they had to you know over ... ... what was the mood like initially you know wind talented ... let me your name your guy I guess keeping smoking especially asking me telling you like hey college we didn't want to do that to me when the plane\nSure why I I think yeah it it has really helped that uh uh we got off to this started conference a year and he still had all of our goals in front of her as far as trying to win the sci fi a testament to our players and really our players parents you know for just a\nUm you know having the the fortitude and the and the desire to to want to keep pushing and and to you know I'm kinda\nAnd you know have the fortitude and the and the desire to to want to keep pushing the as to you know a kind of bend over backwards that a lot of circumstances and uh you know to try to help our guys practice a number one but then just support their young man that is\nYou know we went to Atlanta and and I think it's it's a testament to\nOur character or a football team um and uh and just been real proud of some of the off the field stuff I'm as well as the on sale stuff but but that stuff's a I think stuff that's going to help them fill out the rest of their life you know this is a character and the and just the uh\nThe Brotherhood and the brotherly love that these players and for each other to be there for one another and they go through the hard things together as a family\nWho can you talk a little bit more about that and especially would your continuing to play meant for the\nCommunity and you know last week was homecoming when does it mean would people come back and you guys do you\nPlay the game and you talk a little bit about her that meant to do the student body just Albany community because people were trying to pick their lives back up after the storm here but I'm sure would you guys have been able to do is been something to ah to give people a little something to smile about\nWell I just think people you know you you take all he can work in a hurry our ... and ... had been hit hard by\nHurricane and I could just say that I Would not one person that doesn't have a tree down in their yard and have their lights out for a few days\nUm you know there are secondary coach a better way to treat a right to their house or you don't have held where there is home right now in a wife and three kids answer or are they all that stuff that hit really close to 'em and so for everybody in our community\nOr is that the feeling of home coverage was what's the best homecoming humor and uh you know it it it it took on you have to try to get a cold coming after you take the tailgating and the and the social events\nOr the or in the gatherings that take place it at night and and what we turned it into this\nThis is the lead in the service projects it'll hit\nA two hundred people here are Saturday morning go out with some type of person and just sort of other people there are kids as\nA you know you have insurance company and it was a gigantic just like calm down I'm all for all their shirts adjuster and claims and that sort of being able to go out and the reference tea or have our team excuse me represent our community\nAnd to go out and play well one player hollered or be a ... and play with just ... is that the spirit of the town I mean\nI Would keep talking about our team and how to stay they improve or the year um and the biggest thing they've improved on the ... effort and wants to end desire and I think it's\nYeah they're playing better but I think it's part of it is that hey you know what they've been through and they play it for something bigger than themselves um and it's a nice story um but it's it's a story that I'm I'm Glad you got it it will tell\nRemarkable story indeed and despite all that you are now\nSteal your your your your goals are still in in in range for you the things that you want to do all new for you um you know talk about going forward and big game up coming up this weekend and then you've got to finish things up uh in Columbus talk about the focus of your team in in things you want to see them do you mean next year the next couple of games\nWell I think you know as a you know play on this\nBut the focus of your team and and things you want to see them do you mix you the next couple of games\nWell I think you know as a you know playing this game as bad as they were just you\nKnow where to turn to present focused on you know trying to beat them we're not trying to make it bigger than it is or even though we know it's a big game and all we know that you know we could lock up the eastern half of the conference if we win the game um but at the same time we're just we're making it up you know going to want to know this week\nUm and uh um I think our kids are excited about playing in a big game\nOr one that means a lot um and I think you know it was when you look at Benedict's team you know they're just they're just the big the the size wise they're teeming are they big defensive line they got to be offered the line ... quarterback for\nBig guy I mean you gotta tackle well and you got to you know block and trying to control what a scrimmage well in this game and so um you know it's going to be a great\nA great to be two games will be a hero or a great game for a league I think a and a cougar football cases that both probably want to win real real bad\nWho's most about you know the things that you talk about what would you team and the things we do now I mean from the time that you arrived there and and and what you found the things you wanted to implement and how many of those things have you put in place you would you go [laughter]\nWell I think you know last year you know getting here after spring ball and not really having a chance to recruit anybody except very few players the end of you\nKnow I I tell her we had a foundation that was two feet deep last year and now you know being able to have enough program and put in our character education program and\nUm you know go through a a a winter workouts with the guys put our fourth quarter program is that we've been able to tell you a quote foundation\nUm and I think that's what kind of help us whether the storms of the seasons are a force for you know playing to you know say three really good teams is getting of the year you know not starting off to see what it's all all through the hurricane and all that stuff\nUm you know I think last year was a talented the ah but I don't think we would have handled the or the versus these nearly as well as the scene of being able to handle so\nStill got a long way to go you know I guess you know there's there's always things you look at your program constantly evaluating\nYou know the uh you know the the talent ability or guys and what are the upstairs and I think that's the big areas we just want to get across the board of multiple guys at multiple positions be be really good players so\nUm I think we get closer to every day [noise] um but I think yeah you know this is a process and building a program I'm just doesn't happen overnight\nIf you're just joining us we're talking to head coach in Albany state gate guarding yeah we have to take a quick break the coach if you could do you have a few more minutes just saying that that can go into our next segment ... share your son\nOK Satan will have more coming out from college and the machine here alongside me Sam ... and you're listening to HBU play\nAnd then they had to you know over ... ... what was the mood like initially you know ... let me you're meant to your guy I guess keeping smoking especially asking me telling you like hey we don't want to do the Anthony when a plane\nSure I ... I I think yeah it it is really help that uh uh we got off to get started conference are you still had all of our goals in front of her as far colonel in the city is\nA testament to our players and really our players parents you know for just a um you know having the the fortitude and the and the desire to to want to keep pushing and and to\nYou know a kind of bend over backwards that a lot of a certain stance and there's been a you know to try to help our guys practice\nA number one but then just support their young men as you know we went to Atlanta and and I think it it it's a testament to our character or a football team um and uh and just been real proud of some of the off the field stuff\nI'm as well as the ... stuff but that stuff's a I think stuff that's going to help them to\nThat's just been real proud of some of the off the field stuff I'm as well as the ... stuff but that stuff's a I think stuff that's going to help them fill out the rest of their life you know this is the character and the and just the uh\nThe Brotherhood and the brotherly love that these players and for each other to be there for one another and they go through the hard things together as a family\nWho can you talk a little bit more about that and especially what\nYour continuing to play ... for\nThe community and you know last week was homecoming would it mean for the people come back and you guys do you\nPlay the game and you talk a little bit about the mid to the student body just to Albany community because people were trying to pick their lives back up after the storm here but I'm sure would you guys were have been able to do is been something to ah to give people a little something to smile about\nWell I I just think people if you take all where he'd go right here it's

going to have our team excuse me represent our community\nAnd to go out and play well one player hollered I'd be a ... and play with just that is that the spirit of the town I mean\nWe keep talking about our team and I would say they improve or the year um and the biggest thing they've improved on the ... effort and walk to and desire and I think it's\nYeah they're playing better but I think it's part of it is that hey you know what they've been through and they play it for something bigger than themselves with 'em and it's an eight story a but it's a story that I'm I'm Glad you got it will tell\nRemarkable story indeed and despite all that you are now steal your your your goals are still in in in range for you the things that you want to do all new for you um you know talk about going forward and big game up coming up this weekend and then you've got to do these things up\nIn Columbus talk about the focus of Eugene and and things you want to see them do you next year the next couple of games\nWell I think you know as a you know playing this game as bad as they were just\nYou know where to start our present focused on you know trying to beat them but I Try to make it bigger than it is or even though we know it's a big game on I'll do that you know we could lock up the eastern half of the conference if we win the game um but at the same time we're just we're making it up you know going to want to do this week\nUm and uh uh I think our kids are excited about playing in a big game uh one that means a lot\nYou know this week um and uh uh I think our kids are excited about playing in a big game or one that means a lot um\nAnd I think you know it was when you look at Benedict's team you're just a big he decides wise they're big the big big defensive line they got to be offered to learn full their quarterback for\nBig guy but you gotta tackle will and you've got to walk and trying to control of the scrimmage well in this game and so um you know it's going to be a great a\nGreat to be two games will be a hero or a great day for a league I think a and a cougar football crazy that both probably went away real real bad\nWho's most about you know the things that you talk about what would you team and the things we do now I mean from the time but you arrived there and and and what you found the things you wanted to implement and how many of those things have you put in place you would you could go\nWell I think you know last year you know getting here after spring ball and not really having a chance to recruit anybody that very few players the end of you know I I tell her with a foundation that was two feet deep\nLast year and now you know being able to have enough program and put in our character education program and um you know go through a a a winter workouts with the guys put our fourth quarter program is that we've been able to put you in a twelve foot foundation\nUm and I think that's what kind of helped us whether the storms of the season uh uh as far as you ... you know playing to you know say three really good taste is getting of the year you know not starting off the season was on all through the hurricane and all that stuff\nUm you know I think last year was a talented tea or but I don't think we would have handled the uh the inverse these nearly as well as the seasons and able to handle so I'm Still got a long way to go you know as a you know there's there's always things you look at your program constantly waiting\nYou know the uh it all the talent to do the guys and what are the steps is and I think that's the big areas we just want to get across the board of have multiple guys at multiple positions be it'd be really good players so\nUm I think we get every day [noise] um but I think yeah you know this is a process and building a program or just doesn't happen overnight\nIf you're just joining us we're talking to head coach in Albany state gate guard dean yeah we have to take a quick break the coach
