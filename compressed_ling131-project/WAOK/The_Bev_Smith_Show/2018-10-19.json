further ado I'm do my my guy you know big voice\nTone for Bill Ryder ... regular season two games in stupid over reactions number one I think that the guys was a lot better than a lot better than\nMine I Know it's fine [laughter] I have a voice for riding but here I Am thank you America two thousand Eighteenth Hi first big time overreaction\nOf the season there were two games in right it is time to just make bull pronouncements that can't possibly true unfortunately Marvin bag lead the third is an absolute and total\nBoss he's never going to succeed the guy was drafted one second and the draft this year only scores six points you're a botched you're a loser you're never going to make it the kings did it again Marvin\n... badly the third that three stands for the number of years he's going to be in the NBA based on how he performed on his opening night what a crazy crazy let down of a failure number two I really am digging the overreaction\nBy the way our number to watch out for the horn is at some of these by the way could be true I'm just going to say some of these could be true Charles got a brand new coach with a great background and they went up against a really I Love walking every year because of the honest\nHonest last night was twenty five Eighteen and aid he's an army they turn out but he sure just stood and yet something about the war and it was really

that\nI think mostly monks going to have a breakout season he had a pretty good nice score the almost twice and he was Eighteen points\nThat is a ... team despite the fact that their own one put up a fight against Milwaukee watch out for the hornet's they might be a playoff team numbers really just want to be true to quiet lenders the best player in Toronto Raptors history\nBut ... says it's seven and German made an eastern conference finals in the last couple of years it was really cool\nTo see him out there doing his thing he look really really good he looked like himself again which if you're a spurs fan rightfully so is utterly in totally infuriating but he was awesome twenty four points\nHe had twelve rebounds Lowery was awesome 'cause real super stars make the guys around them even better\nSo congratulations raptors one game in\n... the best player in the history of your organization number four\nBogey who New Orleans was awesome they smoke the rockets they just destroyed those guys merit ditches a star that organization is going to be built around a the they're a playoff team in western conference is probably that's also a stretch like if\nThere's like a double overreaction\nYou only ... they're making the playoffs because they want to know the ... the rockets they scored the most point in the might dance Kona era against ah the rocket ... scored against the

of course we'll play those ... used for you here on the radio show we just we just have some fun\nOvereat people react so aggressively NBA season is eighty two games at a ... inch long season but I Do think we saw some things in a legitimate way yesterday that are going to play themselves out\nThe course of the season I was wrong on the rockets last year I did not think they were going to be in the class of the warriors and they obviously were remarkable last season they want a ton of games a ton of basketball games and they gave the words everything the worst could handle\nUntil Chris' point down trading ... or at least allowed him to go allowing Trevor reserve go critical mistakes not not sexy name's not superstars last year\nOr at least allowed him to go allowing to have a reason to go critical mistakes not not sexy name's not superstars last year and this was the thing that made the rockets a legitimate contender and give ... credit and give give Mike and Tony credit\nLast year that rockets team high powered dolphins remarkable genius all kinds of MIT and Tony who's ... has had terrible defenses like the chiefs of the NBA does your piece of the NBA they were six in deep on the defensive efficiency ready\nAnd they also had a coordinator a basically assistant coaches serves a defensive coordinator and that gentleman retired a week before training camp this year which tells you his lack of confidence his lack of belief in that defensive group I think what we saw last night\nFrom the rockets and\nThe number of points they gave up to the pelicans which is what a hundred and thirty six hundred and thirty for the most\nIn the den Tony era I think that's the only be a last scene reality for Houston I think they've taken a huge step backwards defense matters it just it matters you give them guys especially on on the perimeter who can guard this new age athlete in the NBA particularly those guys on the Golden State warriors obviously\nTo beat the war is you have to you can't shut down to Iran and staff\nAnd clay and dream on but my goodness you got to slow at least a few of them down hope maybe one or the other to have a bit of an off time I also think of story line that's going to continue to play itself out\nIs the rise the immediate rise of Jason Tatum as a superstar in the NBA last year and we've seen guys develop because of this last year Gordon ever goes down\nCarrier eventually goes down Tatum had to step up until June brown and a lot of times the NBA when young guys step into a role or secondary guys step into a raw seem as if the Andre Jordan and then someone returned to star returns\nThose stars that confidence those new newly minted stars don't retreat from that it just makes their entire basketball team better I think we saw that\nIt might lead you went away and if you want to share your perspective on any takeaways you've seen so far early on in the NBA season love to hear from you on CBS portrayals toll free

cousin Ryan is with us and what's that Ryan some cars down in Florida it's got me to pick them leagues so I'm On the Broncos but at the same pick I'm not against Israel which made it a second also want to say there's not a lot of labor it\nDidn't hit this early on the show because it happened twenty four hours ago and I'm sure many of you if you've consumed sports media throughout the day have heard people's perspectives and I have nothing really new to say other than it is worth me adding it is a travesty that the Houston Astros\nWere robbed of that home run and potentially that game\nThese are two great baseball teams Red Sox won a hundred and eight games used one hundred and three games both of them are good enough to win not just the series but the world series this year and who gets\nThe as you get the advantage should not be decided on some botched ridiculous incompetent unacceptable replay call that has no bearing on reality or how the game is actually played\nAnd and I'm not mad at the Astros win the series and I'm not mad at the red Sox won the series I really do you know the old made the best man when made the best team win\nMajor league baseball's not supposed to get in the way of that are supposed to facilitate that they're supposed to root for that I mean baseball wants seven games and ... trust me sort of the broadcast partners\nWhat an absolute joke what an absolute travesty and I know it's been revisited many many times I don't know the theory should be too too but it's certainly the average should have had a chance to tie that game and perhaps one that game ever in Houston\nInstead it's three one burn lander trying to stem the bleeding right now runners on first and second in what looks like I guess it's the the second inning hear of this game so we'll keep you updated on that just\nAnd I know it's hard like being an umpire's are being an officials are told the story I was an umpire when I was a kid I Love doing it really tough I was a soccer visual at University of Missouri for like ... and ... have instant replay\nI hate instant replay if you're not supposed to have is a replay the get it wrong I suppose if it's a replay to get it right ... joke such an absolutely terrible call and we're not going to believe or too much we're going to turn in football where you go through every single game but it does it frustrates the hell out I mean\nIf you're a Red Sox fan you take it you always had good if you're a team of your Astros fan you feel cheated and you should use and it's totally unfair and so again I don't really care who wins the series because I think both are\nRe baseball teams and both are worthy of getting to the world series but I'm now rooting for Houston to win the next two games because they certainly deserve a shot a fair shot at this series by the way Broncos just went up assuming they make\nThe extra point you're fourteen nothing currently Thirteen nothing ending the a ... point the point after so let's see if you're if you're in Arizona Cardinals fan\nLeads to Phoenix sons are going to make the playoffs based on an overreaction Thursday at least you got at least you got that going for you

every game I've of this competition every single game\nFor five years she's won two years I went to your she's very good at it but we both hover around five hundred [noise] which I think is okay but it's certainly not very good but I think my logic on these picked is often very good uh [laughter]\nMost gamblers would say that to say the most you know like I'm dumb so I I have to deal with the line from Yahoo because that's what we that's what we used for this competition but I Will also give you the real\nVegas line I never heard of course I go to a sports yeah yeah [noise] oh\nGo through this and then shoot I'll just jump in and annoy you as you go\nOkay so I had Denver which is easy to say now but I was earlier I did a Denver tonight but we'll move on from that one was the line on this thing uh was plus one Denver was one yes but I'm On Denver to a I'm Sorry I was on a plus one Arizona got slight home dogs here and I think that was pretty obvious pick for the games already started so it's water under the\nRich are none of it where it will just skip as diverse zone a stew Heather's on the but we're not going to focus on that was fun [noise]\nOkay I didn't actually I'm up here in ah Tennessee at the chargers this is a pretty interesting game I'm getting a a minus seven for the chargers the real line in Vegas so it was six and a half\nAnd I think that's critical I'm picking the chargers even with the minus seven but I really think there's going to win a touchdown game and so if you can get the six and a half\nYou have to be on the six and a happy if you can only get seven I wouldn't even that the game I just you know and bill you know I like the titans I just think they cannot protect Mario to right now they can't run the ball the defense is solid and not it will take the chargers maybe the whole game to build up that morning or even to square one or the better team in there playing at home\nI have a I have a five and I'll leave that I've discussed that is um there's not free I'm Fifteen and sixteen this year sadly I'm In the top thirty it's like for the guys hundreds of the guys I'm On the ... I'm actually of one of the five games I picked I'm On I'm On the chart I'm so confident or you go one of my thought okay Stuart\nI'm On the charges to I'm a big on them this year in the titans how they did not protect Mary over the last week against uh the ravens that was kind of telling for me\nI'm On a charge to I'm a big on them this year in the titans how they did not protect Mary over the last week against ah the ravens that was kind of telling for me so I Would I think George went by touchdown it makes me nervous given the fact you were so high on the air is OK\nOkay next time here has a New England in Chicago to take on your bears bill a New England is minus three point five so the bears are getting three and a half points at home\nI don't think it's crazy to think that this could be a field goal game but I'm picking New England and I\nOn doing the right now the odds of a player that not a lot of people are talking about that I think it's a big breakout player for that team and that is ... I guess a roll through that is Sony Michel was one of my favorite players and the draft coming out has been a perfect fit for them he's a game changing player on the ground which is what they needed and\nI think they'll have an awful lot fence to win by four points but I could see it being a field or game I really couldn't\nAnd fun fact he only\nHe only was on the field for half of their officers now so big thirty eight of Seventy five less ...\nYeah they're running back rotation is basically the same as it ever was but he's just getting here that good in his opportunity\nI I'm I'm with it so you've got All right I I'm a I'm obviously a bears fan and I feel like there's a there's a rebound coming your voice this game I tried to bet on my own team but if I were picking with the spread I think I Would go I Would go bears\nThe bears that's fair enough what do you think that I Am with Tom on this I think the pages of when I think it'd be a close game I think it will be maybe like a six seven eight points\n... like close game ... to my team well it's it can be more than a three point gave it a patriot you're going to win there you go\nAnd I'm and I'm dealing with three and a half line but you can get a two and a half\nLine and if you can get that you have to take that because you could still win the feel go game I Would lose in the field ... next game here is that he takes the guy even though because like a bad ... by the met up at uh the next time your bills at\nCoal this is a pretty interesting game I'm getting nine points for buffalo side on this Eric Anderson is going to start for buffalo the end of the ...\nA real Vegas line is minus seven and a half against calls look I just watched the colds get beat by the jets last week I had a feeling about that game I pick the jets even though I'm a jets fan\nAnd I would picking again the jets against Angela is insane but I was right the Colts are Andrew Luck and a bunch of practice swap players that team is a joke Gary ... is a very good defensive player Marcus hunter and breaking up it isn't quite healthy I'm going to take the nine points and ride with Eric Cantor sending the bill ethical [noise]\nSo I don't I don't like it either is it a big number I Would avoid this game but if I were going to this game I think I Would ...\nEven to cover nine points\nYeah ... ... it's like Andrew Luck and there's bad football team against another bad football team I think I'm going to bed at ... ... are so as you say that you were to like take you ... if you'd across our colds and take Andrew Luck minus nine against Colts\nDoes your basement or crawl space of a damp must be smell will watch out that's a sign of too much moisture and not enough ventilation and that\nCould mean increased mold growth and build up a harmful toxins in gases don't bother with a D humidifier if just circulates the same on health a year now there's a better way to remove these dangers in odors it's with the computerized wave ventilation unit that reduces moisture and expel pollutants with wave units there are no buckets of water or\nFilters and they cost only pennies a day to run wave can transform your home into it drier healthier environment satisfaction guaranteed ask\nAbout our indoor air package that includes the wave ventilation unit plus six stage portable air purifier dealer opportunities available for more information visit dry house now dot com that's dry house now dot com or coal eight eight eight nine seven nine wave that's eight eight eight nine seven nine W.

I'm ... now you talked about the future not sure about ... not sure about this year what's your assessment of the bears this season two thousand a team\nI mean their their records on the defensive side of all I'm In the last year topped and defense the top ten scoring events and then you add the best pass Russia and and defensive player in the world and cultural Mac\nAnd all that do is it boosts your all it does to boost your defense of attacks but actually and we we've seen it you know they don't ... loading up right now I don't know how that's got a fair for the bears defense against New England because there and have their hands full on Lake Shore drive from front to back but\nYou know look at it the ... there often is not there yet I mean are they a year wait maybe are they a year away from being a year away\nThat's also a situation that could we could stare dead in the face but I just don't feel like ...\nIs there as as though the complete play color just yet and hopefully we're seeing with Michel ... what the rams saw last year and in in your prior which aired golf because if you think back go back two years ago everyone sitting there talking about Jared golf like he's a bomb was\nQuarterback ever I did last year yeah\nLast year the narrative was OK well he's only going to be showing McVeigh it's streamlined their play book and made it easy for him and now this year and some of the rumblings of kind of faded off and no one wants to say anything because you know what they'd have to say is that are geared off is pretty doggone good and he knows how to play the quarterback position at a high level [laughter]\nCold right here on the show runner and he was me bill writer on\nCBS portrayal coal what is your impression what are the impressions of the people that you talked to another phone network in terms of how likely what we've seen from Patrick my home's reflects the reality that he will at some point in the post breeze post brainy Arab be one of the three or four ... and the game\nWell I just think it's just because of you know his makeup I mean that they the guys as bad as it was it was an eleven year major league veteran he's come in contact with\nYou know with the the Derek Jeter of the world the al ... Rodriguez of the world guys who have lawn championships and he's just he's been around them and you're out doing a show with Maurice Jones grew and Ron Woods and you know rod what's in your head and the gold jacket\nAnd I asked I asked him J. D. the question how much does him being around champions no matter what the sport in a rod said no that's that's baseball but then I'm J. D. said it doesn't really matter you saw the work ethic that these guys put in and what they brought to the table and what made them great\nAnd I think that's one of the things that he has an itself yeah that belief in his own greatness I mean when you have a Ninety seven mile an hour fastball in high school and your dad's an eleven year major league veteran teams are it'd be tripping over themselves to give you you know some fat do\nAnd he said you know what I'm a football guy wanna play quarterback and not to take anything away from Texas Tech\nIt was going to be tripping over themselves to give you you know some fat do and he said you know what I'm a football guy want to play quarterback and not to take anything away from Texas Tech but it's not like patrimony turned down you know big time you know major league signing bonus money\nTo go and play quarterback at at Oklahoma or at the University of Texas you went to Texas Tech and you know who who knew what was going to happen and for him to take that gambling in himself\nI think that let you know with this kid is all about you and you see how cool years and when there's pressure around them I mean it doesn't matter that he can throw a football over those mountains but I mean there's so many things that make him a great and I think everyone sees it right now\nGo right here on the show speaking of or throwing a football over mountains really seminar and I remember you had a pretty mean fastball when we had a competition back in the day we got a guy on the show tons of data was a pitcher I Wonder what you the truth you guys would be able to to our radar gun the other guy it was like maybe competition part to\nWell I don't think there'll be much of a competition bill you know I get down um\nThe the other day [laughter] me David Carr if you check out Dave damage checks a Twitter feed we had a uh it's called the Patrick my home velocity invitational and um the thing about it was you got a football me and David Carr through a football we also through a baseball but we didn't have a mound\nSo I ... the highest I threw off of flat ground we gotta catch her CJ stuff for us to come over the NFL Network and offer flat ground the hardest through was eighty six\nDid you ever go against John ... and we had you know you mentioned Jay here on the show Jerry ... did you ever say something in the high school\nI don't think I did ever faced my faces brothers\nBut I don't remember pitching against Jerry though 'cause I didn't really pitch a whole bunch of the junior high pitched more senior year in like as a sophomore and then senior and then in college and by that time of year he was already it was already doggone you're on the Orioles so I never ... I don't think I've ever pitch against Jerry I go I played against them I play with his brothers but I'm the pitch against Jerry\nI might I might as our little ripped there I thought you once told me he struck him out so I just uh just a proud of course\nYeah of course you made that up and then try to throw gas on the fire when Jerry came on like major have met boys for years you try to make it seem like I was trying to dog I'm Out okay I said I Know how you do you\nGuys are boys I think he wouldn't respond the way I'm just trying to give me by surprise surprise\nYeah see I think I'll gladly again I\nGladly energy I gladly pitch against them what's the worst that could happen he take me are like I mean that's the worst that could happen\nBut he's a ... big leagues there's no there'd be no shame in that whatsoever\nNot at all but I I honestly feel like I don't feel like I don't want to sit here and be like a you know the the the the homecoming king a poke Hi al Bundy but I mean I I I I can throw a little gas and I can I can still throw gas at forty so it's All right I mean I don't throw Justin Vernon lander type of gas but\nYou know I can still get up get brushed Ninety you've seen it I Do and you got to get my back their bill\nI feel like it was ...

I think Tom just set on\nMe trying to set him up with Jerry Harrison junior 'cause we were all buddies do we have that can I just play me is there a way to get to me trying to so by the way I Will say this I have a distinct memory I maybe I'm wrong of coal right\nIntimating some kind of success gets teary hairs and junior and I now doing cold and I later but I did in the interest of you know the marketplace of ideas if you will just throw out there and see what rises right a thank you so much I'm like I don't remember\nWhatever it led me to this momentary here singer it's an all Naperville show you're from ... Cal writes on the show later goals going to pretend that he won struck out in the baseball game we all know that are true never write\nCover of coal use my guy but come on call right stop it didn't happen [laughter] uh it's really too bad coal dodge that duct that bullet\nReally really affected me ah Jerry all the dog goes about some baseball Jerry played in the big leagues for very long time his father played in the big leagues his grandfather if memory serves played in the negro leagues is is a\nStory baseball family and I I really respect Jerry that as a person and then I guess baseball knowledge is it is\nAs high as anyone and I always agree with him but he's and he says what he thinks it's just such a refreshing perspective and and so I found a particularly interesting in asking about China because Jerry played for the Dodgers he lose a big chunk of the year in LA and he's a Dodgers\nAnalyst over on sports in LA which is what broadcast Dodgers game during the regular season and so I found Jerry's perspective on what he made a man even tried to play at first base really interesting\nYou know I was on air uh after that game are doing the post game for the Dodgers here and it was probably one of the most difficult things\nUh to expressed the feeling that I I really had because I was I was saddened by his actions I was angry I was disappointed I'm because he's too good of a player and I was probably the one guy clamoring\nFor many Machado when ... going down because I came up in the Baltimore Orioles organization or just like many Machado did a and I've watched his career I sucked friends over there and I wanted him the opportunity to play out in LA and how he would play in the postseason and kinda showcase themselves to the world\nAnd when you're on this grand stage at the end of the actual hope for the world series everybody's watching not just fans not just um scouts or teams kids are watching\nYou know kids that look up to you and you know that's one of those places that I still can't believe he did it you know whether he was frustrated whether he's angry I I don't know I I Can't I'm not a mind reader but that ... that play can't happen in the game of baseball\nBut there he was frustrated whether he's angry I I don't know I I Can't I'm not a mind reader but that ... that play can't happen in the game of baseball he could've hurt Agnew are he could have hurt himself um he made no attempt to to avoid him he'd drug his left leg\nA and hit at you are and I think you know once you look back at the video and saw that he was embarrassed because while I didn't realize it did that so you know I I've spoken to many maternal quite a few times I really liked him he's one of my favorite players in baseball he's unbelievable talent but stuff\nUm you know a lot of teams don't like to see that and it's unfortunate and hopefully they'll be relaxing last time that happens\nAnd the Machado conversation continued and I Jerry actually broke down\nBut it almost feels like some breaking news because years really connected you share with us as he discussed even more and more and more detail the Machado situation 'cause it's like you know the money to the money thing and the and I don't hustle Jerry got to appoint you'll you'll hear here where he actually gave some insight into how major league teams that might have signed maternal feel about this\nThe last twenty four forty eight hours three people three different teams organizations\nAre said to have you know what we're going to kick the tires or many Machado\nA they're out the one thing you can do with how so he's a super star player I understand you can also all the time and because if you buy hundreds these games sometimes you get it wrong on the second base you're going to be angry upset slender fat or pop up and then you gotta then you are okay I understand that part but when you voice it\nYou know this is your free agent here uh I Wish you wouldn't that wouldn't have said those comments because guess what a lot of teams have to take you buy your word you said you're not that Johnny hustle type of guy\nOr a lot of things have to take you by by by your words are so are you going to invest three hundred million dollars\nI don't know um I Love the player I I think he's unbelievably talented I like him as a person I've talked to them quite a few times I I really liked him but it's unfortunate last forty eight hours it hasn't been um his best best forty eight hours\nSpeaking of baseball Boston Red Sox would that one to zero lead right now with the three one series lead in the Arabs see\nAs against the Astros the Astros trying to get the David Price would it be fair to price and it's hard to be fair to price 'cause he can be so remarkably on likable as if that does actual career goal has pitch\nPretty well in this game but it looks like a lead off no I'm Sorry I ate a double with two outs for the Astros or run or on second here in the force as Susan tries to\nEven the score the game again Boston when one nothing will will keep you updated I had been pretty vocal about\nI like lingers on the picture I think he's a great pitcher and the numbers to speak for themselves that he is not always pitched well in the postseason but Gerry has its own perspective and I respect it and I just want to give him the chance and this is an hour ago this is the Dodgers use your your ears engineers view on why perhaps people like me are being unfair and too critical of\nThe post season so called failures of Clinton crucial\nI think that's in the past I think they're they're just\nYou know the couple of times the struggles a ... it's been blown out of proportion you know he got beat by really good teams\nTeamed up I Believe went on to the when the world series or so you know there are only a couple of struggles in if I if I say this you know yesterday mark Clayton her shows eight not third not for a whole season start with one or or\nYou know yesterday worked great Herschel eight not third not for a whole season start\nWith one hour ... runs a loud and three or fewer hits eight that is the most by any picture in postseason history thinking about for a second now Roger Clemens now I'm not sure if you're not Pedro Martinez not just in ... and not Tom gladman Greg Mac doesn't matter\nWhat her shawl stands alone thing about eight postseason start with one or zero runs that's incredible so all this postseason narrative you know I I think it's blown out of proportion because he made a couple of ... starts but guess what\nThere's other super stars that have had bad games that's just the nature of the beach in the postseason I think you'll squash the nerdy if and when he wins or ring in order to win a ring you got to be able to have that complete team and you know I think the Dodgers have that scene the fees\nAnd and they're going to have every opportunity to ... and it's not an easy when they're a wind away from their second consecutive World Series parents\nAnd a showdown with probably the red Sox but obviously that series ongoing at least for the moment or the Astros at the ashes can stage\nA pretty significant come back and I think the Dodgers are great team and the Dodgers were my pick in the pre season to win the whole thing I I did the selective memory like yeah it definitely took them

make so much for joining the space to be so you play a pleasure to be on\nSome college you're in your first season there when the rat marriage should talk about how like being in how you've objected to land in your friend the area they have a big transition\nWell yeah there's always a transition whatever you know take over program um for me as you alluded to them from this area and so of the logistical things about buying a house in spite of school for the kids all those are pretty easy so we all we all the house here\nUh so we moved back in time in the original how are you into what's called out kids will be attending so um that made things a lot easier to sell the real adjustment was one of the getting back when they were being in\nThis area um when I left him from high school in Nineteen Ninety nine or ten Clemson um it was really the last time I lived here for the extended period of time so\nJust give them a bank back a fellow has changed a lot over the last Twenty years um but again it's been a great great experience but I really enjoyed being back in time with my family and the grandmother\nWe still do they'll send the ... at our house up at church\nAnd uh or those that that was that was a one of the things I look forward to aside from being able to coach at one of the most votes programs\nIn in the history of college football\nI'm to be able to be back home around my family of what we're up to him to the fact that\nYou're in a dinner I'll eat the ban huh [laughter] from grandma but\nI Know that's right I Know that's right 'cause\nYou you of course coming up a very successful doing you ... have you in this way I can I just wanted to ask you what does seem to be the greatest challenge for you restoring tradition or are changing the culture\nI mean you had a chance to do one of the one place and seems like you were in the process of doing the other you're in Florida and then what do you take the same approach\nWell I think those who actually won the site um you know we have a place that has issues such as a family uh I I think it's about restoring the culture because I said well you lose that tradition or such is still fan who has here over the last seven years so uh if because of the culture is changed I think back\nAnd I and I use the analogy all the time or not and now they're necessarily but you know I I ... when I go to the diplomatic rules or who may be all asking will wide span\nIt's an allergy all the time or another now there's necessarily but you know I I ... when I go see the different alumni group who may be all asking world wide span fall no sometimes walk everywhere in the way we have in the past\nI'm no signs of change in the landscape of college football has changed the way as you know maybe Thirty years ago um kids and have as many options to go to school or especially in the state of Florida are you look at it um Florida in the national Florida Atlantic you know those those guys have programs that are less than Twenty years old\nUm UC up in South Florida uh we're we're really thought up programs when I was coming out of high school so a kid coming out that time really had three schools in the state of Florida to from that will probably bigger than than me and that was for the state for the Miami\nWell now you have no more and more schools in danger of fat that South Alabama that at football at Georgia State has added football\nGeorgia southern the Arab states who team that used to be if CBS of not going to make the transition to STDs and so it's made a lot tougher to recruit the same caliber of quality assume athlete that might be recruited twenty Thirty years ago and so having to change the culture back to where there's love and and and\nAnd admiration for for the and now uh I think that's where stars and and then once you get to that point it's a little bit easier to to start to attract a certain caliber student athlete or the ones that you get here and make them have pride in in the program\nAnd I and that's what I've tried to do I try to restore fry back in Florida and and football and let those got no a major part of greatness and when you walk through the halls everyday and look up to see\nYou know Thirteen national championships you know countless conference championships I mean not a good program can boast that before the end them can and I think I I got to start to understand that in and they play with a lot of that\nA passion and pride when they take the field on Saturdays now\nTalking with coach really some of the head coach in Florida and I'm In in in ... you land there and they're pretty um you know amazing time uh when you reflect on the rebels winning the national championship round was one the one and only\nIn the a National Football championship by nature VCU and this is the forty use celebration talk about being there at that time and I'm Mandy near the time when people are reflecting on that because a lot of that type athlete were in those areas that you're talking about the now have those division one school\nYeah no question about it and and it it it's really been a\nA special um time for me to be able to commemorate the Seventy eight teams are for many reasons one being the fact that the coach who to help it or not have a personal relationship\nUm and I know goes up it for years and years even before I knew him as as coach Rudy um I I knew him as uncle ruined because his life is the ... of one of my best friends and so I asked them to spend a lot of time with them um you know even when I got done playing football when I was in that transition period of figuring out what I was going to do it in my life before\nI found my niece and coaching I Will say a life insurance for [laughter] and uh so uh we've had a great relationship I've always had a great respect for for ...\nAnd to be able to honor\nHe and his team a foot I send a championship was truly a great honor for us and I'm fortunate we didn't come up with the ... that that game but just to be able to be around those guys all weekend and just sit on a hit us stories and then didn't hear about those ice cold and they they played against Jackson State down in Texas and\nNow you know all those things is what football is all about and to see those guys who\nForty years later you know again all successful in life you were really great things in life all great fathers and husbands and business leaders in church members that's what we try to do it for a spot I got to get to\nAnd so just for them to be around for them to see that first hand\nMembers that's what we try to do it for a spot I got to get to\nAnd so just for them to be around for them to see that first hand was a truly humbling experience for me not only as a coat but as a fan of football and as soon as he is the base football so a great great honor for me and I hope that our players got as much out of that we can is that you\nKnow I Want to ask you about the recruiting process and how it's being especially when you maintain the programs that are in the state of Florida and now you made national news by having twenty Nineteen number one crew come visit the institution windy you made it happen and you have on the national attention\nUm primate has that been beneficial in the recruiting ... and how important is the student athletes\nWho he'll visit ... bc using understand their pride in power behind\nThat ballot football\nOne it was it was it was my mental um middle for the young man severe that campus um and he's a he's a walking billboard and that's what I really stressed and late Late Show a meditation understood I'm very very rarely at this level especially sea level would you have that opportunity to get that type of publicity\nAnd uh it didn't cost us a thing you know ... on official visit so he he came on his own dime um he paid for his own meals you know so we'd have to do anything extra put them in a hotel or anything like that so it was a free trip for us\nAgain it's free publicity because I mean he has no was ten Fifteen thousand followers on Twitter and Instagram and so for him to be on campus to walk around the salt and our um the Saddam out of over the rec center or to start over if those are black are causes that was first starting them\nAnd for him to be in their him to the post those things and talk about how great it is very it was and how every athlete needs to consider like you see the sort of the business process me all of those things really had a profound impact on not only our program but I think it's just across the country in\nA ... it's been an amazing journey ever since then it's like the moment he left camp was when we started getting contacted by\nOther top ... maybe not one hundred players but you know that's where we saw guys in the state of Florida you know who whose parents with the families\nWho have offers from power five program who say hey cocoa when I say go visit now you know hate cold winters homecoming because I Want to come to a game and the local guys who again it might have thought about ...\nTo ... and all he's done he's raised the question what is you know what else to talk some\nOf the top student athletes in the country started considerations use now what would that look like for the last good causes football if some of those guys will start considering a news coming out of high school so I I think it's a great conversation to have\nI think the administration's really need to understand the importance of magnitude of it the fan base that needs to understand the importance of it\nBecause for that to happen for them to really start to consider us we have to do a better job of of making sure that our facility is up to par um that you know I could to me I thought about schools a post doc games on ESPN three to make sure that the quality of the video I'm is up to par and then\nAnd like things that you pretty much an understanding of the identity and\nA lot like the thing so you know we we we product up and being a tough\nUm our nose blue collar football team in one of the things on the first things we talked about we got here and one of the things we hear over and over and over again is is how to overcome adversity and for us to the football team that kind of been saying that we stand all and people asked how do we overcome last week\nHow are you able to endure category for hurricane be held practice change the price of\nTurns out practice schedule get on the bus and drought of Greensboro be without lights the locker room and still be able to come from behind and win the game whether it's because we talk constantly about not letting situations they paid a ... you know whether it's football class or life\nYou know whatever comes out way we can't control that all we can control is how we respond to those different stimuli in for us as a football team we want to make sure that we always fun in a positive way\nAnd I think those guys are starting to really understand that and by that and that's why they didn't get rattle a when hurricane Michael Caine so that's why they didn't get rattled you know when he ran over to kick off for threats out or\nWe went down ... wants to have them because they're starting to understand what it takes to persevere in the face of adversity and I think that's the identity of the same and the hope that when people see us play um that's what they see as well\nTime with ... from Florida and um university on H. B. C. you place him cringe here on the rich the hairs and coach you guys go up and you you do\nThat's what they see as well spending\nTime with coach will be so much from Florida and M. university on H. B. C. you place in Princeton around the Richard Harris and coach you guys go up and you you do up in North Carolina and do you get the big win over a team that opened the season winds over Jacksonville state in east Carolina but it's what happens when you come back and you get off the plane\nSo somebody players went over to Quincy I'm your home town talk about the importance of that and uh and the kind of a lesson opposite view or that you went through with your players when you got back\nA little one of the things that we have the ... to talk about it is it's taken a holistic approach to this game you know a sense of hand the south people can relate you know football's a second religion\nAnd and winning games is really really what people want to do and um it was it was funny now I laugh about it now um after I lost ... states you know ... year are we at for God's will get baptized the next day and um I posted those pictures and you know put it and put them all social media\nAnd I'm In one of our fans comment and say we pay you to win games we get about guys get back to at least eight when football games and I and that's the ... says a lot of people take it and and and that's okay you know we're faced that parts of doing the wind um but we understand that this game I play the game my entire life\nFootball gives you so much if you have these guys are so many opportunities that otherwise it will be provided with so many chances to travel and see things and dispose of fame and get back and that's what we really want to make sure I got to understand so yes where they went in front of the biggest winners program has had in close to a decade but\nWhat's more important is what we just endured a week ago what people are still going through now which is the devastation\nThat was caused by hurricane Michael's and and there's only so much we can do with the football team to help that but that little bit that we can do we want to do and so um my first thought was just get these guys out we have a by we normally we practice on Sundays so\nGave him the Sunday also they let's take some time to go into the community you know going to get out of the county is this just next door and um this help some of the people who are without\nPower right now you know who who without clean running water the stores are bearing right now is you can't really go to Wal Mart or target to get\nYou know groceries or supplies because everything is so scares the let's take water is over to the community let's go take some hot meals because a lot of these people were without power so they can't eat hot meals and let's do our part to show this community that we want the support us\nThat will support them and their time of need and I think that's really important parts of the football program in an athletic department yeah we we did some community service on Sunday after some food out this summer again on Monday a and they went to the entire team on Wednesday or ... in parts of gas accounted to help out so\nI definitely want to try to do our part to show this great community\nUm how much we appreciate them\nAnd that will be willing to support them as well that is really really important I'm a platform is always something that I said favorite fiercely as the head coach and the football player the visibility that we have the exposure that we have\nThe type of influence that we have you know and if people see a football team after coming off the road and a big win get out get out there and help out\nWell maybe it was encouraged a local business to get involved or maybe and encourage her to get involved and that's what it's all about so you know force them to be able to do that\nAnd I hope that we can continue as\nMany people in this area and they need a very very uh special attention during this time\nLet's talk about you'd seen though you're doing those things you gotta buy week or maybe get some people rested and then he left and then you die back into the conference 'cause you you got four games to go a in an ideal scenario hobbies you win them all but ... ... talk\nSo then he'll up and then you die back into the conference skins you you got four games to go a in an ideal scenario hobbies you win the mall but we talk about what you want to see from your team in these final four games including that a than a Florida Classic\nOr did you want to see them do ah to give me something opportunity to commute to Atlanta or now for\nCelebration I mean we we we want to see the rat lives in a town and we go see the rat let's come to Atlanta\nBut before I had to be mindful now than they had to go to and worried about times on the radio now we're not supposed to buy for the radio but uh\nBut now we um you know and and you hate to sound like a cold and give cliched one game at a time features but really that's what we have to be able to you know there's so much football play um you know I told her to another day you know yes we're falling but\nThe commitments Thomas in column he called me on Mondays just graduating on the way he didn't call me on money they've handed accomplished championship trophy\nAnd so what foreign not feminine and so there's a lot of football let's play\nA lot of things that we need to do with the football team to continue to improve they get better and so for us that needs to be a folk you know right now our focus really is crazy found is that even though more states are focused right now he's on Florida and now this is our by weaknesses are we to focus on up and get better the football team so\nLet's do that you know that's that's when today and like I say we we we try to focus on what's important now you know what's in our face right now that went into his hat\nFor right now that you know getting healthy as you alluded to that getting caught up in the classroom academically because as you know people know during football season you've got this class on friday for travel purposes\nUm that you know getting out of community and helping out a little bit too and then as clean up some fundamental things that we hadn't done well over the last several weeks so this is what we're focusing on right now with a time wise in that regard\nAnd then come around Sunday when we get back will really start to shift the answers towards Morgan State because they are the next thing about the conference game and and as well as we did last week and one of the game last week\nIt will be all for not if we if we dropped the ball to Morgan State and they have shown this year that they can beat the number one team and the cops and they went on the road and be anti earlier this year\nAnd so you know pushed over a I have a ton of respect for Jones and the job he's done at the coast throughout his career and I know he'll have those godfather ready to play in this thing is\nNow wears a hunting season we're kind of a team that people were looking from the fact that well let's see what ... so then the weather for years so it'll take some kind of get them going but\nNow everyone has their eyes solely settled fan you know all the rat was really for real\nAnd I think people know that we are now so we're not going to step up on anybody and so I got to have to have laser sharp focus over the next couple of weeks and make sure that we don't have the emotional or or mental back down that we continue to keep the same role and and that we can hope let's see if I go to the one in the conference\nAnd represent ... celebration bowl\nThis will certainly be waiting to see that can happen as a coach who listens Lucretia spending some time with this this week arrest up and like I said focus on yourself ready to die back into conference play next against Morgan State once again congratulations to you and the rat was on the big win over North Carolina AME deep and thinks it's been some time with knowing you play in\nFact you guys and the other for the good guys against them\nAnd they know right that is really so much from Florida and them back with the kickoff I'm similar ... you're on H.
