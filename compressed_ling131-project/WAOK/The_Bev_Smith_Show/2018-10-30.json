them to be young differs of a defensive team you you have some play makers on his football team a lot of players they still do that more debt but they have assets and they have money to be able to do that so\nAnd I think I'm John Dorsey will also be able to attract um the top head coach a hit coaching candidate because when you look at him he's very well respected around the national football

[laughter] but I Love the ... the rope ...\nLet's get back\nIn the show was\nYeah see we don't we see in other stories like this\nAre coming from Africa I'm\nAnimal conservationists are alarmed over China's decision to partially reverse a ban on the train of tiger bones and rhino horn just listen\nRhinos than a rhinoceros and tigers are both endangered in the wild and China prohibited their trade in Nineteen Ninety three but\nOn Monday instead of it that it parts from or this or that parts from the captive animals will be authorized for scientific medical and cultural get it cultural use\nExperts worry that this will increase demand for the animals and jeopardize efforts to protect them run our service and tiger parts are highly value in traditional Chinese medicine\nOr they're prescribed to treat a large variety of ailments including fever in doubt insomnia and meningitis do any benefits\nOr or none of these benefits have been\nProven so I'm\nThe reason is the problem is is because they had to go to Africa to get the right now ...\nAnd the tigers which means they will deplete the uh\nThe supply of the animals because\nChina also has an economic grip on many of the countries in Africa now and so they seem to think that it's open season\nAfrica wake up a show closer to home\nIs going to be another emotional day in Pittsburgh a Tuesday today as the first victims of Saturday synagogue massacre will be funeral lives Barry funerals will continue the rest of the week through friday\nForty five and first lady millennia will also be playing a visit\nTo the city\nOn today however the mayor of Pittsburgh wants forty five to delay is visit to the city after the murder of eleven worship was at the synagogue tree of life\nA squirrel he you know democratic Mayor Bill de Vito says he would prefer if the president waited to visit the city instead of coming on Tuesday so the community can focus on burying the dead as I said enforced dated the funerals will spanned from Tuesday to\nFriday however or forty five\nTo go to date and is planning to go to date anyway even though the mayor of the city said it would be best if you wait\nBut of course you understand the reason that he does not want to wait is because he has campaign rallies set up between now and next Tuesday\nThese last seven days of campaign season and so he wants to go on and handle the dear folks first and then\nHe can get on with real serious business\nWhich is campaigning for the Republicans\nIf folks first and then you can get on with real serious business which is campaigning for the Republicans\n\nMeanwhile Sarah Sanders is defending forty five blaming uh the media for fueling anger and the U.S she told reporters today that the media seemed to blame the president for the slew of mail bombs aimed at high profile critics\nAnd I don't know about the media but most people who are or\nWho have a brain can see the connection and the correlation uh she said that he is not responsible for these acts no one said that he is responsible we said that he created the environment where about this is allowable\nHe did and he continued to do that and that's the truth\nOr Kentucky police chief said that last week's\nDeadly killings\nMurders\nAt a Kroger grocery store were racially motivated\nOkay we know that jumps in town was police chief Sam Roger spoke at a predominantly black church on Sunday calling the shooting that left to did racism in action we notice so they must\nBe charge or he must be charged with a hate crime and the death than the death penalty should be on the table for him just like it's on the table or for the dude up in Pittsburgh\nDo you see and hear all\nOf a North Carolina we talk to you about this yesterday and gray Gregory one of those callers made us aware or a North Carolina a woman\nCould face criminal charges after a viral video showing her harassing\nTwo African American women earlier this month in the video the fifty one year old woman can be seen threatening them slurring her words and boasting about her job salary to harassed women were waiting in a parking lot for AAA posted the video on Twitter\nAfter the incident on October the nineteenth the woman\nWas later fired from her job and I got to tell you it was a white woman right bothering to black women right where she got fired from a job for violating a company's code of conduct as she could go to jail see this will break up somewhere that foolishness\nUC for for a nine to two seven zeros three a sign on their mind in a ... well I got a couple of\nClose to even closer to home Jimmy Carter y'all is asking the secretary of state Brian Kemp to resign\nThe former president from Georgia wrote a letter to the Republican candidate for governor dated October the twenty second which urged him to step down and let a neutral authority oversee\nThe election so it's not just me is not just a couple of us that are calling for a fall for a camp to recuse himself from this position he has no business overseeing an election\n... is the main thing music now that's going to be the main that'll be dope\n[laughter] uh the main thing or\nA\nSo
