... which stands for\nCare and resources kindness inspired leaves Jim ... brothers put your hands together with my dear sister Dr Kiki shelled their brother Carlisle [noise]\nSo they can start [noise]\nI was just so glad to hear [noise]\nAll right we're talking about\nA subject\nYou know well first of all let's just say there's got to any any big covered up when it's going to be attempting to address of the fact that there are homeless children are in the Atlanta metropolitan area who are going without assistance we're going without cute and you want to address to\nAbsolutely thank you so much for the opportunity I'm intimately attacked while I\nWas astounded by the numbers holy snake in a metropolitan area mhm um people know how to dress it up and go through like a turtle lake so that election on any basis\nWhat an area mhm um people know how to dress it up to kind of go through life\nA certain way so that unless you want a nice no basis you don't know ... and that the biggest part of the research shows that um if you're staying at a hotel if you are on a couch if you're a veteran out it's a nice house might come in there\nIf you don't have your own fiscal addressed that as a definition of homelessness right while you can say now two or three years that said that finish and\nAnd so we want to bring awareness to it because\nThere's a lot of activities that go on for the holidays mhm but we're a people and what can they do January to October\nExactly exactly this is\nAn issue that is a new to me you know the kind of a reason that our church the way that we are approach ministry is is to make sure that we see about people of first and foremost take your basic needs you know food\nAnd we try to make sure that we provide clothing but we're not able to do the shelter peace\nAnd that's the piece that is it makes me feel inadequate\nYou know because that because that's what people call for more ... more so than anything else folk ... who are homeless or as you say you know squatting with somebody else's space or or living in a transitional spaces like\nHotels are each day you know and there's a role you know what I always talk about these morning\nOr the mom was in the dead as in the babies at the bus stop will what I'm Talking about is the people that I'm passing by\nWho live in the uh the hotel's owner strip own on almost grow all for them to do through the strip or to stroll whichever one is both of them okay and uh and so and I always wonder you know how people\nAre so I'm\nJust brave and and and resourceful and how people you know a whole family living in one little hotel room and how they're able to pull it together and pull off what looks like normalcy to people outside\nAbsolutely you know ... in doing childcare I was able to care for a homeless family may literally lived in their van ... mom and dad and three children and mom and dad knew how to go to the\nThe rest stop and use the public was you know facilities and wash up right the baby's cutting out later that because they you know they still had a sense they're close we're\nNot there they have holes in their clothes and one partly that spirit was sunk in you know the other children were like I look at you and you know running on them\nAnd that has never left me and I just I now I see why how it's all coming together and you know I'm just thankful said to be a ... that's all you know so hopefully\nUm bring more awareness but we don't really just me aware and as we need people who are willing to support the cause because we need places for them to go most shelters you got a check on their you know grab it run its the airplane thing is you know you know hey\nRight ... ... and they're not many shelters shelters are are going away instead of being increased you know cause we most you know the the government has to pay for these tax ah [laughter] for these tax breaks that rituals getting\nAnd got to pay a you know for that so the money comes out of that you know since they give the tax breaks less money is in the is in the system and of course we break we blame or they blame entitlements you know for a while\nYou know since they get into tax breaks less money is in the is in the system\nAnd of course we bring we blame or they blame entitlements you know for why the balance of for for the reason that the budget is in deficit and so you know you see the connection between the the greed an average of people who are in power\nAnd how it affects people who are just barely scraping by the we were talking about earlier of unfair\nAbout the different kinds of homelessness though there is a foot four children particularly which is your your concern\n[noise] homelessness with children does not necessarily mean that they are without the mother and father but it could mean that they have been abandoned and uh basically\nUh fending for themselves how did you how did you you know I Know that your your your work you're and you're in your

I probably should've brought up Zeke 'cause that's exactly what he's doing I I Do think Jerry Jones is a\nThey judge we release resort released ... fifty nine fifty five eight ...\nFifty nine fifty five or resorting released a job a call now [noise]\n\n[laughter] [noise]\nHe's right he's right I'm all about that with the ... of all about\nFracking has many fans as you can people take themselves too seriously find baseball player and therefore I won't show though should get out of here stop it come off you are listening to later than you would bill later what's\nOn to do right or whether you're a team of the week as broad bipartisan this week team is the Boston Red Sox after splitting the first two games of the Arabs see as against the Astros at home the red Sox have gone on the road to win two straight in Houston given to make three one series lead\nBoston as for no all the time a navy three one lead in a best of seven series rocky by burgers and hey trade bros Fergus is proud to be a part of what you do with over one thousand one stop shop counter locations expert associates\nAn on match selection of O.

guy Jerry hairs and junior\nIt's all just throw it in the show one of my favorite people in the business loved watch him when he was playing really really glad that I got to know the guy good do smart guy Jerry hairs in junior joined me right now from the west coast Mr Jerry hairs engineer the real Jay here on Twitter what's up\nBuddy bill what's going on how you doing a good man so what's a\nIt going by the way is an exuberant 'cause this this this this fan base has\nBeen here so many times and obviously of late has not gone that World Series ring is not going to a championship how how's the mood out west\nThe mood is great you know I think getting up in a series three games a to a really helps chains that mood for for the better I Know we were down two games to one a few days ago the mood here was a kind of nervousness or anxious\nOr worried because we do the birds are pretty good for a Red Bull ... really good manager and credit counseling there there is a good thing but\nThe last couple of days the Dodgers are found a way to win a you know the first four games or series I don't think they played their best baseball really struggled hitting hitting the ball\nA especially with runners and composition but your game five led by Clinton her show pitch a gym um they're able to scream or a gets together with runners are score musician and the Arabs to win so are the most great\nJerry ... junior here on the show Dr went off on this rant yesterday I'm curious if you think I'm I'm overreacting around right and you know you're not you're from Chicago suburbs originally I'm from Iowa and lived in the ... we both lived in ... when we were kids\nSo I'm not like a west coast or by birth but I loved living out there and I just got really enraged that the Dodgers had to play the Dodgers have won the last six years in a row or a game way from the world series had to have a two o'clock first pitch on a weekday when families can't get out there the traffic's bad in LA I just thought it was disrespectful\nFor major league baseball Yankees fans would never stand for it am I missing something here do you think based on your\n... your data you you are dead on that can't happen um you know my my son who is in Arizona He he's he was in class at two o'clock and no you know ... year phones and he's checking checking the score even touched me during the game and he asked me why did council pick up my alley after one batter you\nKnow what I find him with ... or doing um like when are you in class [laughter] just started laughing so\nI said just pay attention in class but you're allowed to\nDo uh just to see what's going on as far as the game because it's the playoffs you know um\nBut you know it's crazy here during school or you know people are at work men and women are at work and you know a lot of people had it had to leave work uh early to get to the game so those two o'clock start aren't fun uh but that being said Dodgers hacked the place\nUh yesterday a ... a sellout crowd yesterday for that to hug game it was loud a it was a fun atmosphere to be around so\nYou know the Dodgers fans are one of the best fan bases and all of a sports than they ... they prove that once again yesterday\n... and look at it it would not be acceptable to her Houston or or Seattle or Phoenix\nLA's the second biggest city in the country I mean I just terriers and junior on the show I'm Glad to hear that it's not just me being a right to a radio host it it made me really angry Jerry one thing that was cool to see we discussed this yesterday\nIn the lead up to the game or actually has the game was underway just the pressure on including curse all the excellence he's showing the regular season in the questions about who is in the postseason you said that he pitched a gym is\nThe point where that matters damn do you think he has a sigh of relief after the game or do you think he's utterly confident every single out in the postseason and his struggles in the past or his struggles in the past and he's not so\nI I think that's in the past I think they're they're just you know the couple of times the struggles uh it has been blown out of ...\nAnd he's not so well I I think that's in the past I think they're they're\nJust you know the couple of times the struggles a ... it's been blown out of proportion you know he got beat by really good teams seemed to have a I Believe went on to the when the world series or so you know there are only a couple of struggles in if I if I say this\nYou know yesterday mark Craig her shows eight not third not for a whole season start\nWith one ... runs allowed in three or fewer hits aid that is the most by any picture in postseason history thinking about that for a second now Roger Clemens not make sure you're not Pedro Martinez not just in Berlin and not Tom grab Greg Mac doesn't matter\nLake Herschel stands alone thing about eight postseason start with one or zero runs that incredible so all this postseason narrative you know I I think it's blown outta proportion because he made a couple of bad starts but guess what\nTheir other super stars that have had bad games that's just the nature of the beef in the postseason I think it will squash the narrative if and when he wins a ring in order to win a ring you got to be able to have\nThat complete team and you know I think the Dodgers had that scene the seas\nDear you played in the big leagues from a lot for a long time you come from a baseball family you know you're talking about when it comes to the rules and the code and how things actually work in\nA baseball game at the major league level what did you make of a mini McDonalds play first base\nWhere you know I was on air uh after that game are doing the post game for the Dodgers here and it was probably the one of the most difficult things\nUh to express the feeling that I I really had because I was I was saddened by his actions I was angry I was disappointed I'm because he's too good of a player and I was probably the one guy clamoring\nFor many Machado when ... going down because I came up in the Baltimore Orioles organization or just like many Machado did a and I've watched his career is uh friends over there and I wanted him the opportunity to play out in LA and how he would play in the postseason and kind of showcase themselves to the world\nAnd when you're on this grand stage of the NFC asked her hope for the world series everybody's watching not just fans not just um scouts or teams kids are watching\nYou know kids that look up to you and you know that's one of those places that I still can't believe he did it you know whether he was frustrated whether he's angry I I I don't know I Can't I'm not a mind reader but that ... that play can't happen in the game of baseball he could've hurt Agnew are he could have hurt himself\nUm he made no attempt to to avoid him he drug his left leg a and hit at you are and I think you know once you look back\nWhen do you want a spot that burglar when he's case in your home or after his head as Sean who's blink camera alerted him a burglar tried to break in while he and his family were home or Shannon who's blink camera caught a thief stealing packages both times blink video clips were sent to police to help convict the crux\nBlink motion activated indoor and outdoor cameras are wire free set up

further the value of their getting for that money ...\nBillion don't Mimi and your friends you understand I played for nine different organizations nine now three nine okay so I have a lot of friends throughout most of the baseball a lot of more scouts a lot of them are a couple of them are assistant GM's\nUm a few a few of them are coaches managers are a lot of my buddies are managed ... our score ages hence the Robert ... is in the postseason I Will tell you that I Can't speak for the Dodgers I have not spoken to them as far as in regarding manning the child\nBut I Will say this the last twenty four forty eight hours three people three different teams organizations are said to have you know what we're going to kick the tires on many Machado a they're out\nWhy kind of well I think you mentioned the reasons or they haven't said he said we can Rosenthal the waste play the game\nI'm the one thing you can do with how so he's a superstar play I understand you can also all the time and because if you buy a hundred seats to games sometimes you get a groundwater to second base you're gonna be angry upset slander pat or pop up and then you gotta then you are okay I understand that part but when you voice it\nYou know this is your free agent here so teams are saying this is what they told me okay if you're not doing it in your ... year we're going to give you a boatload of money",
