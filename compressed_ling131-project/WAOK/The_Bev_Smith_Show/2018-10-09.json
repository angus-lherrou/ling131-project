maybe we can go with them and we know what's the point you can read don't trust you know so we already knew that it was the most well I read the news because the ... some people put it all started with just don't show the powerless well let's\nSee what each flight left over less if women are not going to do anything when\nIt comes to a black woman what your expectations are suffering and a lot of that that might benefit is not what\nYou bring up my regular what'd you do run in my oh my God what about now\nYou know you want to know Monday\nNight why would you give me that she Republican withheld that could be a a flight liberal and progressive women won't do\nSo I I like we're all going to happen\nWhy would you give me that she would probably go with that thought what a a like liberal and progressive way more than\n... object that wasn't a thing for me because I said\nOh I knew I was growing up I knew they were going to push me too but it's still with the wrong thing to do and we say we can't say it was all it's okay 'cause it's not okay that was the wrong thing and now we got to live with it so the question is would as we go do going to\nDo okay we have to get a a what a watch\nThat show that this that and what used to stay out and and and don't allow anyone to distract us what it did in previous times F habits that bill and that's how we paid our main whatever the effect that through that if we have to\nWe'll know that's okay 'cause you know they will drop a bomb on you or do we while you're while you're there for you to do the ...\nI just I just would be waiting for them to lead the charge you know what I'm saying why this is your plan lead the charge a jumping\nOff door Nellie is\nDone and given that much credit when he said I Am\nA fan because of sound funny in a way for [laughter]\nFor for a nine to two sub zero three is the number is a magnificent ... millennial Monday or in the studio with me elders Washington this is what I wanted to do or rather he yes or\nI won't talk to 'em about the millennial response to the nomination and the\nApproval of Brett Kavanaugh 'cause I'm going to be they\nMhm right what y'all gonna have to live through this and live with the outcome of the policies that are going to be implemented and promulgated by a Supreme Court that has a five to four\nI'm a five to four majority for conservatives right so the EPA and that's going to get us today crow is is my way of your\nSo what ... what millennials how shall millennials respond\n[noise] you know as a first of all you know what I hear when I'm Talking to a lot of my\nPeers are they're definitely wasn't a surprise when he came through ... and no one felt like oh my God I agree with you because it isn't a surprise is not something that will do will ... years but it is you should call it out it is wrong it shouldn't be right but I think it was said in a day is\nThere has to be a re education of what this political process is to my generation in my opinion uh I Know that ... back in the day they used to have the seed ... programs citizen education program\nAnd that program was religious teaching black people how to be a first class citizen everything from elementary knowledge to local state and federal government or knowledge about the constitution knowledge about politics and how it works I don't think that has ever been broke down\nTo my generation so especially I just take it to a local Atlanta area ... no my generation we we hear\nAbout the great Maynard Jackson but\nWe don't know where that feel like we don't know what I feel like they have admitted you are going to stand up and go super ... I you know we got Kesha and you know I Know there's a lot of accuser level but anybody that has any uh inkling of knowledge you know it's not the same thing so we haven't seen\nPolitics go unapologetically heart for us ... ... and I think the reason why it look as we don't understand really had a political process work and what it should be doing for us so if you don't understand how can you really hold somebody accountable I mean Ashley from\nAnd this might seem like a dumb question but it wouldn't be the first ... okay All right um\nDo you think that growing up with eight years of Obama as president kind of threw y'all off into thinking that the world was fair and equal and it's all had equal opportunity like every other American citizen you think that might have\nIt'll tell it'll be I think it all it's all on your\nAge bracket where you fall in this millennial thing but that is so I I remember Bush I remember Bush winning or a his second term and it was the first time yeah I remember that and again I wasn't raised\nAnd I remember Bush winning 'em or his second term and it was the first thing yeah I remember that and again I wasn't raised in a conscious household lie I think a majority of my generation and we've always been raised that\nYou know this racism thing is over\nYou know we have a fair where I think we always been raised that were brought to light that took off the veil in my opinion was social media\nAnd social media Trayvon Martin was the first\nSocial media thing that really just popped out where we no longer needed CNN to tell us what's going on I can look at the hash tag\nAnd see what's really happening in the streets right if you really want to know what was going on a ... and you didn't go to the news either win or Facebook Live right and they were showing his lab an edited it was wrong information so what happened before social media\nI Would experience something and it'll be like oh that's an isolated event\nRight Brian ... yeah they are causing me to show to like well this is the life a little bit of this happening all over the world right so I think yeah we were and then I think when Obama came in we were like oh ho hoping to see if we do\nIt went from ... like they got a society vote vote vote because he's black black black and they want to get an office and you like your ... to go ... he was like well you\nKnow and like everybody like regular like on an area that I read that and so we like day so you know we just went heart but getting married black you know ... so I ... I'm a person of color [laughter] so so life as we all I feel like a millennials have always\nBeen cheated of their blackness ... while we've been we've been cheated on that even even today and we really want to have a real then we got ...\nYou know and we don't do it on the brink coming back okay all\nAnd we will bring in some of these problems as we're for referring to to seven zero three is the number is ... I'm getting rid of the ring through college and we're going to do rapidly because a lot of folks have been holding 'em so they drew don't leave and I'd be black when I get back from what was going to grow the movement if\nThey can you get Fifteen minutes statistically were total [noise]\nA reception where they weren't where we can win money [laughter] some way to do something to do with it [laughter] okay alright alright [noise]\nAnyway wishful thinking the millennials who told me that WTO\nWhen I'm at home in Atlanta Georgia hang out with my voice their own their own\nGoals for each to teach them a new tree or news and talk Thirteen Haiti W.
