jobs from twenty eight twenty\nAssist becoming prime minister in April he has carried out numerous massive reforms in that one does will and he is spoken through\nI think and they put some weight behind what he saw as when I'm Talking about right there\nAre\nCloser to home and um\nThis is this is kind of dumb story but it's it's out there\nSenator Lindsey Graham is joining the mockery of Senator Elizabeth Warren is DNA test that revealed that she likely had a Native American ancestry six to ten generations ago\nOr the Massachusetts Democrat took the test after months of ridicule from forty five about her claim of Native American ancestry\nGraham of South Carolina Republican told Fox and friends don't last evening that he thinks that he could reveal of thinks thinks he could revealed he has more Native American DNA that Warren\nHe said that if a\nHe said that he said if that is indeed the case and listen to this he wants a casino and a million dollars\nYou know just the abject racism and sexism\nInherent in this commentary is almost beyond description he joins with forty five and\nThere's some kind of way that people also seemed to have a twisted and and some of the Native American folks are angry with Elizabeth Warren not at forty five and Lindsey Graham\nThe world is just twist it do they do they really think that\nThat forty five and Lindsey Graham care about

thing will be so er\nWas within the main things are so many things that they\nAre I or go to um magical sores All right a couple of days ago we had a record where Hillary Clinton was interview\nOr by its dude on CBS on CBS News and during the course of questioning\nOr a question was asked of Hillary or\nIf she believed bills relationship with Monica Lewinsky was an abusive power\nHillary said no I'm Wondering what you think\nFor for a nap to to seven zero three when we come back on the other side of the break man we can get into this conversation\nI'm\nThe founder of the me too movement also\nChimes in on this question you're familiar with the name to run a Burke by now she's the founder of me too and she kind of breaks down why Bill Clinton's affair\nWhole exchange right because she was a kid and so her life permanently altered to have to deal with all of those things but to people made a choice and one of those people but the most powerful man in the world and I said I just think it's unfortunate\nOh right that's where to run a bird falls down on the issue what about you\nRemember this is the women's world Wednesday and sisters are escorted to the front line we talking about abuse of power and I want to expand the conversation as well because abuses of power\nUm I mean clearly as you said the men who is the most powerful person in the world at the time clearly has uh\nAn overwhelming amount of power or that may have been exercised over ... an intern\nRight across the road that people play or do give them the perception of power even though no human being is a greater value than another you would be\nOh there are indicators that we look at that said that this person is powerful because they have access to these particular resources\nIt was that we look at that said that this person is powerful because they have access to these particular resources because they have a certain amount of control or the other ... other people's lives\nAre because they are are able\nTo move in ways that others are not able to move we save those people are powerful because their words can impact\nOur lives right so truly that was a power imbalance that exists but between bill and Monica\nI don't argue I won't argue that what I Will argue though in the hour we'll extract a extrapolate an argument\nAbout to say that uh there are many other power imbalances\nThat exist between people who are engaged in relationships\nSome people might even say that white people and black people\nWho are in relationships are dealing with an obvious power imbalance\nJust saying for all for a nine to two seven zero three because in this country\nPeople who are white have more power than people who are black\nTheir words can impact like people's lives right\nThat's what we were dealing with yesterday was it not when we were dealing with the wild black phenomena\nRight we were dealing with the idea that\nOne person a person because they're white feels that they can use their power to bring another source of power\nTo bear\nAnd I'm Talking about the police against black people who weren't doing anything but my own business [noise]\nSo yeah power imbalances exist all over the place\nHow do we use them and what's the outcomes become\nA out of how we use\nThem or create that\nWell it it causes us to make the decision as to whether it's the power has been abused or not and it's a whole no the other question [noise] uh [noise] with [noise]\nWhat is it like to ask somebody his wife that\n[laughter] you know that's a whole nother issue for over a nine to two seven zero three is the number you can blow me up and we can get it in a on the other side as we discuss\nA phone abuse of power\nAmong people in relationship in this region interview Hillary Clinton was asked to build relationships with Monica Lewinsky was an abuse of power and she said no\n[noise] what do you think\nIt's the movement [noise] I'll be black in the middle of the more\nYou get Fifteen minutes
