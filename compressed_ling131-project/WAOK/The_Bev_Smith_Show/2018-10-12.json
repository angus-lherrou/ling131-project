I Would say the getting primary research is some of the best also like going into the oral tradition because a lot of information I got for example uh I work from slave narratives\nI read hundreds of slave narratives ...\nWhich again where they fall tradition or the oral histories that were recorded\nAnd that's the that's a very good source of it just didn't and you know like I Know it just depends on who the person was that was a missing the narrative\nExactly because ... it was a white or your best to gator who were missing the narrative off in terms of like we would build the truth about what\nOr certain things were were toned down your samples\nDuring the period of the antebellum period when there was a lot not near ... near just were published by abolition is\nThe abolition is would highlight the atrocities and the horrors of slavery because they're trying to garner an anti slavery sentiment right but at the same time they would face any information\nAbout slave rebellions right ... right because you know if they if they wanted to create a kind of phone calls Tom character right what you got in Harriet Beecher still so\nFor example in twelve years a slave there's a a party there or maybe just one or two sentences where Solomon Northup says that now that they went by when there was not talk\nOf rebellion\nWell running away every day she talks about right but it's just again one sentence right and the emphasis\nAgain and way the whole story is you have you have the white savior syndrome where he's white but he's from New York come down and and free hammer I\nKnow um but right again ... to do just for that which is horse manure go right [laughter] watching it in\nThe uh during the um a period of the depression when FDR started the W. PA were or was it worth projects or agency\nAnd they had the federal writers project to federal theatre project a number of African American writers who ... out of work were sent to\nExactly get these oral histories of the slate narrow choose from people who were still living somebody wants to all the centenarians of that time in Nineteen thirty\nRuns or knew her husband was wanting to do was one of them Richard Rice\nThese are these slate mirror to some people who were still living with all the centenarians of their time in Nineteen\nThirty ... her husband were willing to do was one of them Richard Ryan run Margaret Walker was the number of ... brown headed up from a here in Washington\nDC you know you had thousands of narrative were collected during that process during that time and they were put in a book leader call from ... from sundown to sign up and uh and um\nAnd they were they were um a divided by state so you could go to the state and the demand is from that state now they're ... online you can actually go online and read these narrative\nOh man or a robbery rooted them from going down the road in\nNew York is what which but going back to what you um the caller was saying about yeah you hear about them a rose in Jamaica and and the rules and Brazil the the Kimble palm merits which was the whole nation states and throwing them away you head of the nation states in ... I'm\nAnd there's you know has organic gardens and in fact some of those students from to ski after they had dismantled their agricultural program started going out to her farm\nWho do you mean something to dismantle the the stuff\nThat I don't know I think I had heard that a while ago maybe I'm wrong\nBut I mean I ... you know I'm I'm going to have you read men are okay we're down you know in the greenhouse I mean I think you know agriculture and as a result is a mainstay of agricultural lawyers for that you are limited yes George Washington Carver money we do we ... we will play with that in the ... you're\nRight well I Know they were coming out to her ... yeah well in working at ...\nI Would imagine so would you know but no actually we took the so Weibo with NASA you know chemical you grow up really doing them and yeah but you're talking about talking about December donations and the three major centers of marine life\nYeah I'm picking up with the a sister who called and about the seminal today that was really a very large ruined community\nNot it started out in the seventeenth century many people from the south Carolina Georgia area in fact they were actually ... people\nAnd they spoke the language they had in migrating and index gaping from slavery and under the British and coming into Florida which was at that time controlled by the Spanish right to the Spanish had given them a ... ... but then when the when the\nBritish to control and then later the Americans especially when the Americans came in\nUm they joined up in fact the treat started coming later by Seventeen thirty nine and you're with thousands of rules living in Florida and later on by say the mid Eighteen century you get the Indians who had broken away from the recruits who wanted to assimilate\nAnd get the five civilized tribes there these group of freaks did not want to simulate so they come down in\nFlorida and they join up with the rules who were there and together they formed the someone no nation\nThat when the seminal confederation I returned to people that you know [laughter]\nTo break away so it was formed with these two groups who made in life is the slave formerly enslaved Africans ... rooms\nAnd the uh indigenous ... people who came together in a confederation and like any confederation\nEach nation that long kind of has their own autonomy soldier similar normal rooms with the black someone knows as they will call you own chiefs they had their own council of elders they had their own village even though it was side by side with the native someone else\nBut when it came to for example war mhm where they really benefit at each other particularly in military uh with when they were fighting the the Europeans the British and later the Americans\nAnd they fought three major wars\nRight wing begins in Eighteen sixteen\nOr with the bombing of Fort negro alone to apple lot Appalachia\nWhich is really endangered now that storm is going to be sitting in the pan handle that was in the panhandle\nOh they move out a man\nThey engaging the will of warfare for a few years\nThat was in the panhandle oh man they move out and\nThen they gauge it will uh warfare for a few years and then it kind of you know was quail the war but there was always real of warfare then the next major\nMeaning they will give them the Europeans the business\nOh absolutely in fact the Seminoles kill thousands of American Soldiers and hundreds perhaps thousands\nDeal even know how many ... you know a sharp suits that will just hired\nBy the army but they defeated and won a battle in during the second civil war which begins in Eighteen thirty five when Andrew Jackson begins the negro remove the first people to be removed whether\nChunks all in in the summer and all but the seminal because especially the black someone knows that they came they were had to move move they ...\nRight that's why they were the fiercest fighters\nSo fine they refuse to be moved in on the second some of the war started this is where they suffered major defeats in defeating Zachary Taylor hurdle at that time right what who later becomes president that lasted for seven years\nAnd then there was another one that it's a brown Eighteen fifty five is a small or a war which they call it the last summer when the war in Florida because by then many of the seminal did\nThis but they've when he left home a territory you've you've all of the authors on this and the book yeah not no not in my book I'm just kind of giving you well yeah you put it all together and

of\nThe people you know they All right whatever whatever go ahead with your parents do you\nI just like to make a comment alright that's my hands and I'm a black man sixty eight year old black man educated black man I don't think that religion is our problem as a race I think that economics is\nAre advertising to go forward movement in advance with a black people one of the things that we missed I think is that\nUh we're in the midst of a sad coal for season\nOr it's important for us to be able to look back\nOr to glean some of those are tendencies and practices\nThat were used by our people to achieve liberation in times past\nAnd begin to implement implement those are in the here and now both our main very for the day what can we learn from our more room and substance I don't want you to get away without a addressing that particular question which is our main thing for the day\nYes and um I think what we get from ancestors is\nFreedom and free and I think we also face and courage and most importantly not just sheer\nGas ... to ... because\nThey had to be in the state of mind where they did that in order to take the risk that they took\nAnd free because they were constantly you know are under siege constantly patrols the militias\nWere you know for them\nUnder siege you constantly the patrols the militias were you know\nYou know looking for them to bring them back to kill them too and they you know many times said they did where did catch you can find a Muslim camp\nAnd in the movies will harm but quite often or they were able to find refuge in usually get a sense of all places where they were able to live for decades maybe for their entire\nLife\nBut I think that again what we gain from them or rules and not only that there was also a certain type of spiritual consciousness\nMhm or a kind of almost like a mysticism write\nMany of them are rules or many of the nineteenth century inflamed Africans and those who for years well had still had knowledge of the metaphysical systems that had come from Africa\nYes what I mean by metaphysical system I mean in the way the way was defined it as\nThe science of spirit yes so they know how to enter into the spirit world and they knew how to do a lot of things than the twenty century African Americans no longer had knowledge\nThat you all for you know they could call for the power to answer them there were but to be sure do system or their their their bones or book bones in our midst then and then the circles and would you travel\nOr who are able to call for that same kind of a worry they are ... ... ... in the hearing now we just um I don't know if you interview that oh\nWe've been do you do you know ring the value of it\nExactly you know many of us don't don't believe that\nWe don't believe that a person could be in New York City and be in Miami within a few seconds\nYeah cause that they did that go movement\nAmong some of the balloons and you find that in every country where you had more rooms and including Louisiana or where again the difference in Louisiana because in each areas you know you have the kind of different manifestation of ma notch\nWith the some of those they were the major fighting the rooms with the great dismal swamp which was northern or southern and southeastern Virginia and north eastern North Carolina large area two thousand square miles\nYou hand moves that were able to take cover and we're on touched by army the militias patrols could not touch them I don't know what they had going for them\nNow and they make a big reasons like we could drained the swamp what they can drain the swamp down why couldn't they drained it thin right but there was something else happening same thing in Louisiana where you had really short\nWho had come on who had people who crackers\nAnd yeah no I'm Sorry I\nKnow your your book you know the the Haitians they were they had already shown by people who are on the bottom ... or ... or the world how ...\nHow to get free and\nWhat I learned about the Haitian Revolution and the whole idea of food do because I Know we kind of think of it as religion on unfortunately today it's just almost use anonymously and sorcery\nConflated immediately with some type of evil right what three rabbits\n... almost use anonymously as sorcery\nWas completed he needed it with some type of evil right over three rather than a religion but it is really done the religion or should they they did do when it\nWas more so than it was more of a metaphysical system\nAnd this mumble priest was telling me that\nIt during the Haitian Revolution or to do was really a combination of fifty one different\nMetaphysical systems ... from fifty one different nations wow who for example you would have to fool do shanty ... county voted off the Congolese room\nSaying bring it home and go on and on February and it all together in concentrated my God this is a source of liberation that's the same way it was used in Louisiana or emergency I

game you're again had been like that you know the past couple of games where you you have these comeback victories\nIn that kind of tough where you guys would you ... well I'm sure you would rather your team get off to bed and stuff we\nWe will we will but we also realize that you know hey we we have a really tough schedule a lick coming off of loses seats last season I mean you know you're you're not talking to the next day but not in the fall that scare coach in the universe Alabama where you know you expect the beat everybody\nI mean you know you're you're not talking to the next day but not in the fall has paid coach in the universe Alabama where\nYou know you expect the beat everybody [laughter] you talked to the coach framing and we're we're trying to turn out season around and we found proud of we've done that from last year so you know we we have a lot of you know that that's a good thing about\nUm ... when you have success you know uh everybody gets confident but you know sometimes we quick it'd be overconfident and to assume that we used to blow everybody out on the sketch\nWell that's that's not the case you know we're still at work in progress uh we we still have a long way to go and that's why I cherish every um every week throughout victory as far as secure in our conference in our chairs ... every pick through that we get\nTo ... in the head coach Morehouse ruin tiger they are six and ... ... talk about some guys are getting things done for you in our business out of the ball you running backs central done and go to Michael Sims a boat young players ... leaders and they've been very consistent for your\nGuests are ... are they're they're great key you know I I'll tell you you know a lot of times when you have very talented a player many times or at least through my coach's career you know you you you tend\nTo have a a this type of a percent of the way you carry yourself are entitled and things that nature you know from being do it all the way up from pop Warner all the way to the college you know it's a different type of mentality\nOr our kids a little bit different you know their their kids that are of their talent but at the science to a very humble as good spirit young me and it was almost like their supply\nOr when they make plays as well and and you know we we we really like that 'cause we we want to be a come from behind the we\nA football team I mean we don't want to be able to lose that so uh both uh Santo as Michael sales you know they're they're they're both respond as as responsible as they are productive you know Michael Sam's all they have\nTo um turnovers that to intercept should uh over six games inside so you know he has a easy\nTo lose the Hubble so I'm I'm very happy with that and I'm very happy that they're they're leaving with I'm not with their mouths but they're leading with our action\nAnd they also ... leaders on gang is the leading rationally takes engine in forty sending guide ranking intent nationally wow Michael stand leads to a conference in passing by over one thousand passing yards I'm pretty high recognition near\nAnd dear to ... you know they have some some guys around them no question about it as that support in my office of learned you know they they'll be armed song on sort of a the time we finish the seeds that will be ... you're not hearing any names up front lawn and so forth and\nYou know we've got a really good timing in Enron was saying he arguably one of the best received some\nConference I feel like in the country if we can get the ball some a little bit more that's Mr Smith\nYou know so it's there's some players that's not showing up along the stat sheet that\nI'm I'm pretty sure that before the season is over ... you know have some some breakout gangs I bagged up tell that I'm really really could be to start or Frank Bailey or let us in Russia last you know he's still yet to have his\nBreakout game and we you know we all know on the campus at Morehouse that has come so those guys are getting it done off escalate and I'm proud of\nHad to break out game and we you know we all know on the campus at Morehouse College so those guys are getting it done off actually and I'm proud of\nI Want to make sure I correct ... from Michael in easily he's leading the ... when ... hundred and thirty eight can be ... I wanted to give it to kind of given these kind of get into any proper acknowledge me\nYou will do the go talk about the fact that I'm real the last four games or at home you guys have been everywhere Columbus, Georgia Frank would Kentucky uh Pine Bluff Arkansas or Chicago or at least three other next boy you're getting your own bed at least\nI'll be honest with you know um\nWe we travel really away a lot to take my hat off ... ...\nAnd ... D you know that they allow us to to travel and expose I yeah I mean I'm In the first class fashion so it hasn't been all that that bad you know just the experiences that the kids are number for the rest of their lives but you're right that ... than anything be being able to play in front of\nYou know your mom and dad you know your grandmother you you'd not going to ministry ... girlfriends as a you know just people that you hold a near and dear to you so it'd be pretty good to to be settled not be rushing to to make the bus on friday morning\nYou know some some of these things that we're doing in the ... hour ... minutes straight of lead to make sure things\nSo smoothly that it'll be good to to to play at home and I'm looking forward to it and I'll take 'em I think fans deserve um to to see these guys have only seen them in our stadium one time this year so they see these guys are making some of these milestones that they're making this year\nAnd so they don't want to talk about coach Freeman you just mentioned reruns classmates girlfriends wherever they are a whole lot of folks\nAre going to come over want to take this team out now did you have this record into basketball team went through something similar during basketball season or go to an amazing start and people started I'm making their way over the more how to check them out\nYou guys were correct to a lot of attention that crowd I Believe we changed them both about that\nWell with you know that's that's something that we're we're looking forward to you know that's the twelfth man\nI'm you know to be able to assist during the course of the game and that's something that we have to you don't have to overcome a we had to overcome and I'm an hour six rescues me five to six games that we play and that can be tough you\nKnow I mean because you hear somebody everything kind of coming out of those stands and you know sometimes you know you're talking to Eighteen to twenty two year olds you know sometimes it's\nIt's kinda tough to keep compose you something to say that you hear and I'm definitely not saying that\nUh will get advantage from that standpoint I think we have a a classy a crowd and you know I'm you know that excludes sportsmanship and so on and so forth but you know it'd be it'd be good to to have some extra folks craving for you I think that helps you might play so we're looking forward to\nLast question before we let you go to you guys are getting ready for a ... State University ... home what are they going to take to pull a basement out\nOh my God they're off it this time they start to um to jail and then click there and then I'll know they want that lasts three strikes you know and um they got off to a somewhat rocky start and probably because they play some of the better team to countries ...\nI'm ... and and I just think that um you know they they they make a change made it tried quarterback got someone who are the best\nAnd and I just think that um you know they they look like they're making ... made a trade quarterback got someone who are the best from a statistical standpoint has better numbers particular out and run into football so that causes the three the with the quarterback run into football here's\nA foreigner counted for number so that that that that's always a scary thing too\nBecause the coordinators which I Am by trade and um so that's that's what we'll have to do your were after barrier for the trip to stop that running game um there were prepared for the player ...\nAnd I'm focused football because we have to be able to get out to start off as severe and we can't settle for a twenty four parts which was what were their store in the past you know two or three ball games are so\nYou know we we can't settle for that we're going to have to try to see if we can get that ball and get touchdowns not feel goes we have to score touched down here in the end zone and try to play opportunities to football and they run the option\nSo the um the downsides are running out of football there's the frequency of changing hands with football so hopefully we can get some turnover summit and get an age\n... to reach agreement or the tigers in more house did like this weekend and thank you for joining us on the labor\nHey thank you for having me you have a go go for the game once again six PM this entity it'd be the army stadium when the cameras are born house college back with the kickoff that's on the way next with similar richer on H.
