I\nDon't know if I Would feel comfortable purchasing a vehicle own line having never driven when I first saw this technology a few years ago\nI thought the same thing who would buy a vehicle that they've never seen touched driven will parenting millennials will and I don't know what millennials ... with a bomb now people are my age group people middle age will buy it I have I have helped people my age\nBy vehicles through ... and so far they have all said that was the best experience they had ever had bought a car company salespeople nobody's calling you back trying to make a deal the price is fixed some people think that is good who thinks it think it's bad but I'll tell you\nEven your local car dealers have this new technology their algorithms that are run that can look out over the Internet and see what vehicles are being priced for\nThose computers automatically run those numbers and price those vehicles to make everybody competitive so it's really hard to go in and find a vehicle or two or three thousand dollars cheaper if it's an equally match the vehicle meaning the same equipment same mileage same year\nI'm relatively the same um\nCondition so ... did a good job they figured that piece out if that\nBut then there's still haven't driven a car when when you buy a car through ...\nYou have seven days wants their vehicles delivered to you you have seven days to test drive the car thing is like a two or three hundred miles you could drive so\nThere are places like here in in in Georgia there's a\nA a they call it a vending machine you can go pick the carcass like these garage doors you go to pick it up your vehicle that you've ordered is there and cleaned up and ready to go you get to go in and walk around and look at it without talking to any salespeople and see if you really like it before you sign your final paper work\nUm I saw and I think I was in Nashville that was a there vending machine was a tall intimacy like eight levels high and it looks like you know the cars come down like a vending machine when you put your money in at a at a you know in your vending machine the office or wherever and you use next fall out it looks just like that I think it's pretty cool is more of a\nA a gimmick than anything else but I think it's really cool to where it happens but they say you get the car to Seventy and you can pick it up from the vending machine or they have a flatbed trucks with all this car vulgar signage all over and they'll deliver the cardio Homer office wherever you asked\nYou can pick it up from the vending machine or they have a flatbed tow trucks with all this car butter signage all over and they'll deliver the cardio Homer office wherever you ask them deliberate vehicle to they deliver it\nYou found the paperwork and then you could drive that car for seven days\nThey'll get it inspected by your mechanic take their bodies out and get it checked out all those things and there and just see if you like it if you do paperwork is finalized you're done if you don't you call them up go lie to them you don't want it they sending a truck back out to you pick the vehicle up and that deal is ...\n... and has done you don't own a heavier can know trading it back in any of that so I thought that was a good thing too so so far [noise] they were hitting on all cylinders everything was perfect well I finally helped some on a navigate this car on a site who had a trade in\nAnd they were upside down their trade and that's the upside down I mean they had negative equity [noise]\nWhat that vehicle they over the more to the bank than their vehicle is currently work and that happens in many different ways one is you can put a lot of miles on it so that just drives the value down it could be a vehicle that didn't do well which means is not a high demand for it in the resale market\nOr it can be a vehicle that you pay too much for it\nAnd in this case somebody paid too much they rushed and bought a car they told their car [noise] so they didn't negotiate when they bought this new vehicle and they pay too much money for it then they went out and put too many miles on it [noise] and now\nThey have to try to get rid of cars and problems with they don't want it is to that point where they're spending more to maintain it and the notes are so I really want to get out of because they can't afford to keep fixing it and paying into\nSewing and this person went to ... to to do this whole deal you can trade your vehicle own Carver\nBecause one has a limit to what they'll give you know negotiations on the price of vehicle and there's no negotiations on what they're going to give you for that vehicle so they look at you go into carbon a site and you put your your information about\nThe vehicle then number all of the options is on the vehicle they give you back what they called the A. C. V. which is the actual cash value of the vehicle sometimes you'll see things as they trade allowance when you go to trade your vehicle in and then you'll see things called a Seavey they are\nThey can be the same but in many cases those two things can be very different actual cash value is what can what does the market bear on his vehicle when I go to a black book and these other sites and I go to the auction what do I know this vehicle will sell for [noise] that all carbon will give\nNow when you're dealing with traditional car dealers\nA lot of times if you find yourself in a position where you have negative equity in your vehicle the dealer we'll give you a trade allowance and a couple of ways they do that one\nThey figure out you cannot put a little money in his car and fix it and sell it do I have a local wholesaler who needs a vehicle like this will give me a little more than actual cash value do I have a ... a potential customer who's looking for this kind of vehicle that I can then mark this vehicle way up and get it sold\nOr do I have enough room to negotiate on the price and the vehicle and I'm selling is it a new vehicle that has a incentives and rebates from the manufactured they send it out if it has those things I can use as a dealer those incentives and rebates\nAnd they just added to what your pain and you just finance so they roll and then and if you have a that's one of the pitfalls of having a\nStrong credit scores\nIf you have a pretty good credit score banks these days will lend you more\nThan the vehicle is worth so they'll do a hundred and ten percent loan to value on a vehicle you're about to have you and I got ... and then about who lives in those I deal in round numbers ... math and never been my thing so have you been to a a a ten thousand dollar car\nThey'll loan you love a hundred dollars a ... I'm Out in the car they'll give you more than what the car\nIs worth and when you do that that the and become negative equity the cars they're going to appreciate at the same rate is going to appreciate the beginning so you find yourself upside down their vehicle a lot\nSooner and it takes to a lot longer to pay it off I mean not to be able to get a lot longer to get that equity back on their vehicle so there are a lot of people you know my\nAnd it takes to a lot longer to pay it off I mean not to panic to get a lot longer to get that equity back on their vehicle so there are a lot of people you know my first instinct is the first piece of advice I give them is pay the vehicle\nDrive it until you prepare to maintain it um be diligent about what you do with it take good care of it get everything done on time and pay it off\nBecause when you're not stuck the negative equity not then you're gonna have to do you spend money to get rid of their car and his name is never a good feeling to have to write a check to get rid of something that you had been paying for for the last four or five years so\nI then invite this person ... new vehicle that has some dealer incentives and rebates\nAnd you can do that by going lots of websites like Kelley Blue book and you can go in and they have a section called rebates and it said if you go they're buying cars with incentives these days a lot of trucks have been sending the Camaro that are the view this morning I would've looked on line I was doing my view on it there is about two thousand dollars a a\nA William Cash if you finance through them and that's like another Fifteen hundred dollar a cash incentive to buy the cars just like thirty five hundred bucks off of their car\nThat's the type of money that you can use the payoff negative equity and don't let the car dealer fool you that is factory money it's not the dealer money so the dealer if they give you that money they still selling the carpet sticker price so you can steal\nNegotiate the sales price of the vehicle\nAnd get those instead of a lot of hard work but you can get it or you find the right dealer who do it for you that's what I have the person I was hoping to go find a car that has an incentive I got a caller on the are going to see if we\nWant to ask you to bang I'm great how are you just want\nA good [laughter] I got a question that you buy a car you probably remember\nAh I I didn't have a choice because show or get a call Steiner yes they are all on my old car have negative equity on the old car even when we have all the time that I enjoy it and then [noise] because they say\nIt's one of my car um and\nI I mean I also like three thousand dollars on the carpet they said they couldn't take because so many miles\nOn a car so and and and they will probably cost me more money to pay a pass it ... and I didn't have that type of fine but [noise] like my question is how\nLong can they be they don't get that person off my car driving now who calls found for me\nSo I don't think there's really a time limit but what what typically happens is after you pay on their car [noise] toward [noise] Ninety\nDays to six months you can go in and see if you can have their vehicle refinance so you can call your credit union\nOr you could he could potentially go back to where you bought the vehicle\nAnd see if they can help you get the vehicle refinance to take that personnel but it's going to be based on the payments that you've made you had to be current\nAll the time when a car that you have now you're going to um have to show a significant improvement in your credit score and maybe even your income and you can do those things in the bank or the finance\nCompany determines that you are credit worthy and you can afford to make the argument that they can refinance the car\nDo those things in the bank or the finance company determines that you are credit worthy and you can afford to make the payment then making refinance the car your name by yourself but it's like buying a car all over again\nSo all the feed that go along with buying a car to first of all those fees going again so then you end up you know financed a little more on their car but then you can get another person off of it and you're in a\nCertain um be like um basically dying over a man like all that money I paid it gone at church as well\nYour money won't go into trans 'cause what they're going to do refinance the car for the balance so I don't know what you pay for an hour long you've had it but hopefully you've paid the balance down some less as you'd be around if you if you pay ten thousand for it and now you're down to seven thousand you'll just be financing the seven thousand dollars not to\nKnow like so you'd be financing that seven thousand dollars that left over and then you just don't qualify for that amount of money or whatever that pay off\nIn their you know that they're not coming off a [laughter] but the other car that I had so many mouths on that I couldn't trade in I'm going to be off for their car wants to become the finance come pick it up what you're going to leave was is\nI mean what else can do it you
