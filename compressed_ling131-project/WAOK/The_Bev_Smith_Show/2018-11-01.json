night for news and look up a you know those\nOf oh I've been made aware and I've seen it on social media about twenty Twenty one year old\nI'm\nA gentleman a ... a Navy SEAL ... black ... black man in the navy seal\nA pulled over a\nTo try to help all motorists a Brandon Javier ... or ... we can just about to do that he was either Hispanic Latino or white\nWell he killed the shot his brother down in cold blood or because he was attempting to help him he thought he was the stranded motorist but ask them to do was trying to steal the car\nAnd he shot this young black man a Navy SEAL send them down in cold blood and a tempting to be a good Samaritan when in the morning a man as a\nYoung man black lives matter you know like I say yes I'm Talking about what you're talking about what would a literacy\nAnd uh oh this is a brother does that combines a activism with a\nSuccess with just everything he does let me bring whether her own ear or to the conversation rather her room also as well I don't have\nLike a man I'm Out of your mind doing it then you got to do you know would we do and how we do it was would you see I see you may you your your narrative your focus down a little bit\nOh yeah I ...\nYou know [laughter] we got to\nWe've got to mobilize zone that rascal know\nVery much fun man\nI was a threat\nOr you are putting on the line you know even if you saw that the white to what am I Am a true story Stacy down the costs are\nReally the one hand officially on all the way we're gonna have to make you rich Stacey April\nAre it's yeah oh okay I'm Sorry you know whatever man what you want to teach a salamander\nRight Mm interesting interesting yeah we're we're we're playing that did not want I play in that one at all and\nUh so what's the what's the plan was to move what would you need for the people to do rather her room and said this is one thing I Love about your bra or your the people come go\nIf the people don't call them cold you shut up anyway they go and go make your presence felt and I respect that brother because that's that's what being a respectable black man is all about uh being down what'd you say you being down with so what what's ... what's to move on this one\nIs what I Need to go vote because of the good old boy they act on food\nYeah okay I Can't stand\nBut what was left was to move on this one\nIs what I Need to go vote because of the good old boy they act food yeah okay I Can't stand with that goes deal when I seen government deals that way you know got to deal back get like well yeah let you know that's the Klan move ... going to stop it before they put a stop on that\nI feel I feel your own that I feel your own so the the message from brother her room\nInstead of a no vote\nThat is we are we in so when one hundred percent agreement on that one hundred percent\nOf the thing about literacy or there is a definite connection between literacy and voting I mean think about the history of the country a literacy was used as an operator as to whether one could vote or not and then you know uh and think about it\nWhat this is another reason why the world to do it so important\nWe the only people in the history of this country who ever denied the right the right to learn to read and write nobody I Know other people in this country have been denied that basic fundamental human rights to communicate\nYou know what I'm saying and uh you know that cannot be lost on us at this moment uh that's why something like the African American ...\n... is very important and it's tied to making us aware of our responsibilities I mean you can't even vote right unless you can read and write you can't you can't\n[laughter] I mean you you you can't do the requisite research didn't necessarily research the Nobel who you're voting for that unless you can get to read and you need it\nAnd get their ... and would clearly when and I'm also just the other statistics correct a little bit of statistics I can say that I can say that\nIt just takes such as I say yeah\n'cause that's just she's in tone has very little literate let my lips just get in the way you know of a sudden ... certain words but lives had nothing to do with that term that time [laughter]\nI was going to blame it on my list [laughter]\nStatistics nothing to do with the lives man it's just strictly teeth into it together abroad [laughter] um [noise] uh you know what I was talking about other statistics that say oh they're fifty percent of a book a children's drop out of school\nDrop out of high school or near near near ... percent sixteen user yet as it's legal to do ...\nAnd most of that has to do with people not doing well and being\nOn it and you can read and write and everything is made in the way to take a word yes everything has to make them a\nPlane and they don't learn words are not exposed away they can't we create them inviting speaking and we can change that that's a problem that can be solved illiteracy is a problem that can be so so let's get on and that's you know\nAnd I I don't know what's wrong with me I mean I I don't know how black people are engaged in such a deep levels of delusion or to the point where you can't understand why somebody don't have your best interest at heart I mean you can't be by folks like that's stupid\nCurrently do over here in Manhattan in in about it and break the van and then having manner ministry for them to get married younger ... record what ... ...\n... ... it it tells it tells you everything that you need to know oh and then you know and it's not just a ... when all of those folks\nYou know what I'm Sorry this is the policies of the Republicans that make me said that they are are they are racist and white supremacists or not the individual personalities I don't care nothing about the individual personality is what I'm concerned with is the policies that they create\nThat negatively impact black people in other people of color and Paul folks\nI don't like that so I don't roll with them and to me they represent anti Christ because if you try to keep people from you and you're trying to keep later getting yeah healthcare you're trying to make stuff\nDifficult for the people who are already having the most difficult time then what are you if you're white and he tries to making\nIt worse than I Am\nMhm yeah and yeah they play putting a writer for and making people choose and they'd given that given people the opportunity to choose our you rolling with anti Christ\nThey play putting a writer for and making people shoes and they given that given people the opportunity to choose our you rolling where the anti Christ arguing rolling with justice right\nEven even ... years old and a half of them had ever get a ...\nA ... it's all about it I I was wondering if somebody's gonna mentioned Kanye West today you know he said he had a change of heart he didn't figure even figure it out to many of them right now no\n... in your photo or yeah yeah well\nThat's what he said he didn't figure it out now and they lied on him about blacks that I reported earlier that he was behind a couple of days ago that he was behind the movie called ... ... ... means like exit from the Democratic Bob ... innards of the Republican Party\nHe said he really had to do with that but you know he just uh but you know he supports Candace Owens or the black woman who have black people are talking about it on the Internet every day or and also it was just do this Tatum do who took all the kids up they gave them do their own or make America great again hats\nAnd it took a whole bunch of black kids to go to the to the White House it had I'm wearing a make America great again has you know pick up and the kids out like that happened it looked like forty five had the power to draw that many black people to um the optics of it was shameful yeah right but all of that brought is connected all of its interconnected\nAnd it's all of a representation of white supremacy\n...
