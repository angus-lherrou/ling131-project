they see down here and more into things that they won't\nSee so I hear a lot of people talk on this year not voting well see a lot of the benefits of these people who are talking about not voting and disenfranchising trauma ... the nickel and ... they are getting values now some of the guy who probably called and they are old enough that the benefits that they're getting now\nBecause somebody voted back there for them or not you know and now you're going to tell the next generation who can't see them and we can see that they don't need to vote what's happening here in their community\nAnd I travel up and down the road there ... boulevard I see a lot of businesses and eat or eat and stuff like that\nAnd when I go to the other community around in there that I hear people say this in my I Want that it might be they won't be things in the community\nBut they don't want the parks they won't give asked me to the education and stuff that comes about about are voting in our collectively there are so that's what I'm saying you know all of this year I'm going to continue to vote and I'm going to sit down to the table with mine\nAnd not only talk to them about were being here now in the

well as as America wash that debacle on yesterday mhm coming to you from a legal standpoint I Know attorney but however I Do know that when you're in a court room you're looking for what the facts right\nAnd in that particular exchange he never ever ever answer any questions he filibustered it and the only questions he answered was those easy wimpy questions asked by the Republican yes no yes no\nBut he did not answer the question as to whether or not he wanted an FBI investigation he could have turned to his right and said to them I Want an FBI and vetted investigation to clear my name\nHowever I wanted to ask your opinion independent people what do you think is a fall out if in fact they go for when the ADA has already come forth is that it shouldn't be an investigation by the FBI how does that play out\nThat that would be interesting that that would be interesting I Wonder you know I don't know all you know just just how how far down the powers of the Supreme Court judges can't kind of reach you know I don't know all of the details of that but it would be interesting to see if you would actually have an FBI investigation into a sitting Supreme Court judge\nWell that's the one thing we need to keep a that would be its own because\nADA which is the licensed authority for attorneys yeah that can restrict them or or or suspend them yeah the or whatever the reason I think he's running down a road that may justify restrict\nYeah that can restrict them or or or suspend them yeah the or whatever the reason\nI think he's running down a road that may justify restricting or suspending his life is because\nOf this particular Supreme Court seat and I've often said what is the rush to do something when you add a lifetime to sit there if in fact confirmed\nWe're looking at a time frame and I understand that that person because they think that the numbers may change but if he's that good of a candidate than the heat was to be confirmed if in fact the investigation proof favorable to him\nAll right thank you so much I'm a go to the last caller Jill Jill you've got thirty seconds go ahead man you got thirty seconds go\nOr ... or ... or on a about a ... you know on a\nOf course and um there's some pieces here to talk about um you know African American up lift an African American success and I'm going to um read something to you unless um let's see if it uh it works well with you\nThis is what he says he says that it's a journey of a thousand miles journey of a thousand miles and you know that a life is like that it's just a series of of ... of of of short attempts to kind of get strung together hopefully to help move us toward a particular go says a journey of a thousand miles\nHe says it's interesting that people who have goals tend to live longer than people who have no goals it is as if they extend their lives simply because they have something to do\nFor example there are old ships that are beautifully maintain steel navigating the seas\nThey have weathered hundreds of storms and that successfully docked at thousands of ports now after each trip the ships are better equipped to handle the next assignment\nGoal oriented people are just like these vessels they always have something to look forward to and each go\nSuccessfully reached finds them better equipped to set the next go each goal is a bit more demanding\nAnd fulfilling than the one before it in a few years they find themselves accomplishing what surprising ease goals that have been impossible for them when they first began setting objectives\nNow years ago during the depression a young man was hitchhiking from the country where he was going I don't know\nBut he struck up a conversation with an older man who had offered him a ride\nThe older man asked him what was his goal in life\nWhat are you thinking about what you're trying to go where you're trying to do\nWhat are you trying to be the young man replied that his greatest desire was to be\nA millionaire oh no it isn't the old man said if that were true you wouldn't be wasting your time\nBombing rides all around the country and from place to place you would be hard at work trying to make your dreams\nCome true\nGoals are important\nWhen a person knows where he or she is going and is engaged in getting they're the most amazing coincidence begin to take place\nWhen we know where we're going and are occupied own our\nJourney it seems as if all the forces where ever and what ever they are will\nCome to our aid and by using these forces we find our desires and another goal will be reached\nThe purpose of life is a life of purpose today I Will develop a clear vision\nOf what is important to me\nDevelop a clear vision\nOf what is important to me\nAll right it's about setting goals\nIt's about seeing the life as a journey of a thousand miles or tests of endure a test of focus a test of self discipline understanding that each day our lives\nShould be directed in some kind of weight informed\nBy objectives or shall I say goals and as the day unfolds\nSpecific things to move us towards accomplishing that go have you gotten some go do you have some object is you know life is too short\nJust to simply be wasting time and that's what our author is sharing with us from this interesting piece alright jot down your goals\nRefined them keep them in front of you and keep 'em on your mind and hey hey and make sure that you're you're striving to accomplish those goals alright wonderful wonderful wonderful\nNews and talk radio be
