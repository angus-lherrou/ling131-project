I hadn't even recall in speaking English speaking molded I ... just how they present it and then we bring them together to create a unique the south African sound\nYes and the way they can learn\nTo to unify ... even though it out of it and tells us but unified through music\nAnd yeah a South Africa or are we we got to\nA deal with the context out of which are the sound to calm ... yes I'm the context in South Africa at least as his is reported here\nIt's it's a difficult space right now correct to negotiate particularly of the large amount of violence that is is going on for a as we'll let some of the transitions are that are occurring because of\nTheir in South Africa tell me how\nThe context is what's happening in South Africa actually impact and affects the music that this creates\nYes well I think you know there's just this is the this is the uniqueness of this group because everyone from the different cultures experience\nThis environment from a different perspective and and that's exactly what we want to try and bring bring them together and music is a universal language mhm\nSo even though we may have different perspectives [noise] a political views or cultural views mhm we come together and we have one\nOr one of his name which which is going to be using it to the debt we find each other we learned to appreciate each other's differences in different perspectives and learn to understand the perspective from which comes in and and I think we as we have been proof of the fact that through music we can unify and find the come and go\nThat was that last call yeah yeah I Do remember that I've been thinking about that call them the damn man I saw that was beautiful man just the way\nWhen you say you know like what you know I mean you know

exposed to possibilities for responding or to to whatever pops up in front of me or that would that would have been a good idea just getting the bomb and say main thank you may you may just so\nI really I was kind of thinking that I'm because I'm I was thinking about the fact that will ease listening which means that there are more people like Mark who\nAre listening and uh so which I think is

C. you place them richer along with Richard Harris when we're pleased to be joined for this segment I like to go straight from the source with the football coach who the Florida and um rattler in his first season there\nWill be some as coach make so much for joining space be so you play a pleasure to be out\nOf college you're in your first season there with the rattler shift talk about how like being in how you've adjusted to any I Know your friend the area but it's still a big transition\nWell yeah there's always a transition whatever you know pick up a program um for me as you alluded to them from this area and so ah the the logistical things about buying a house in spite of the school for the kids all those are pretty easy I Will read all the house here\nUh so we moved back a car rental house a yard into what's called out kids will be attending so um that make things a lot easier to sell the real adjustment was one of the getting back when they were being in\nThis area um when I left him from high school and no matter if you're not allowed to attend Clemson or rather the last time I lived here for the extended period of time so\nJust give them a bad back a fellow at the same lot over the last Twenty years um but again it's been a great great experience well I really enjoyed being back in time with my family and the grandmother\nWe still do they'll send the ... at our house up at church\nAnd uh or those that\nThat was that was a world of the things I look forward to aside from being able to coach at one of the most votes for rather than the history of college football\nI'm to be able to be back home around my family of what we're up to to the fact that\nYou're going to dinner I'll eat the ban huh\n[laughter] that's going to grandma's but\nNo that's right I Know that's where I could you you of course coming up with various exhibits with you a preview in this way I can I just wanted to ask you what does seem to be the greatest challenge for you restoring tradition or or changed\nWant to ask you what does seem to be the greatest challenge for you restoring a tradition or are changing the culture I mean you've had a chance to do one of the one place and seems like you in the process of doing the other here in Florida and then what do you take the same approach\n[noise] uh well I think those who actually won this I I'm you know we have a place that has issues such as a family uh I I think it's about re so when the culture because opposite when you lose that physicians are such is still family has here over the last seven years or so uh it's because of the culture is changing uh I I think back\nAnd I and I use the analogy all the time or another now there's necessarily but you know I I ... when I go see the different alumni group who may be all asking will wide span for most of time watching everywhere in the way that we have in the past\nI'm no signs of change and the landscape of college football has changed the\nWay you know maybe Thirty years ago I'm Keith and have as many options to go to school or in the state of Florida are you look at it\nUm Florida in the national Florida Atlantic you know those those guys they have programs that are less than Twenty years old\nUm UC up in South Florida uh we're we're really thought of programs when I was coming out of high school so a kid coming out that time really had three schools in the state of Florida to from that will probably bigger than than me and that was slow to stay for the Miami well\nNow you have no more and more schools in danger that the fact that South Alabama that a football at Georgia State of that at football\nGeorgia southern the Arab states who things that used to be if so yes I'm not going to make the transition to STDs and so ... is made a lot tougher to recruit the same caliber of qualities do athletes that might be recruited twenty Thirty years ago and so having to change the culture back to where there's love and and and\nAnd admiration for Florida and now uh I think that's where it starts and then once you get to that point it's a little bit easier to to start to attract a certain caliber student athlete or the ones that you get here and make them have pride in in the program\nAnd I and that's what I Try to do I try to restore pride back in Florida and and football and let those got no a major part of greatness and when you walk through the halls everyday and look up to see\nYou know Thirteen national championships you know countless conference championships I mean not every program can boast that before the end um can and I think I I got the starting to understand that in and they play with a lot of that a passion and pride when they take the field on Saturdays now\nTalking with coach really some of the head coach in Florida and I'm In in in ... you land there and a pretty um you know amazing time uh when you reflect on the rebels winning the national championship round was one the one and only\nIn the national football championship by nature VCU in this the forty years celebration talk about being there at that time in a landing there at a time when people are reflecting on that because a lot of that type athletes were in those areas that you're talking about that now have those division one school\nYeah no question about it and and it is it's really been a a special\nTime for me to sit there to commemorate the Seventy eight teams are for many reasons one being the fact that the coach route of helping to not have a personal relationship\nUm and I've known Cosell but for years and years even really before I knew him as as coach Rudy I'm a little bit uncle rotor because his wife is the ... of one of my best friends and so I asked them\nTo spend a lot of time with them um you know even when I got done playing football when I was in that transition period of figuring out what I was going to do it my life before\nI found my niece and coaching either failed life insurance for [laughter] and ah so ah we've had a great relationship I've always had a great sound respect for the coach Hubbard and to be able to honor he and his team\nOh so we've had a great relationship I've always had a great film to respect for the coach Hubbard\nAnd to be able to honor\nHe and his team or for that Senate championship was truly a great honor for us and I'm a fortunate we didn't come to that that game but just to be able to be around those guys all we can and just\nSit down and hear the stories and and then here about the ice cold and they played against Jackson State down in Texas and now you know all those things is what football is all about and to see those guys who\nForty years later you know again all of a successful in life doing really great things in life all great fathers and ... and business leaders in church members that's what we try to do it for the spot I got to get to\nAnd so just for them to be around for them to see that first hand was\nA truly humbling experience for me not on the other coast but as a fan of football and as as soon as he is the base football so a great great honor for me and I hope that our players got as much data that we can is that you\nKnow I Want to ask you about the recruiting process and how it's being especially when you maintain the program center in the state of Florida and now you may national news by having twenty Nineteen number one crew can visit the institution wind you made it happen\nAnd you have on at national attention um primate has that been beneficial in the recruiting ... and how important is it are student athletes who still visit H. B. C. you understand their pride in power behind that ballot football\nOne it was it was it was mine too I'm real for young man to be the campus um and he's a he's a walking billboard and that's what I really stressed and lay there and make sure that Minnesota understood I'm very very rarely at this level of safety sea level will you have that opportunity to get that type of ...\nAnd it didn't cost us a thing you know in his own official visit so he he came on his own dime or be paid for his own meals you know so we have to do anything extra put them in a hotel or anything like that so it was a free trip growth and again it's free publicity because of me as\nThough was ten Fifteen thousand followers on Twitter and Instagram and so for him to be on campus to walk around the thought and our um the starting uh uh over the rec center or to start over if those are black are causes that was first starting them\nEnough for him to be in there and the post those things and talk about how great it is ... I was in ... every athlete needs to consider and you see the father business process me all of those things really had a profound impact on not on the program but I think it is used across the country\nIn a ... it's been an amazing journey ever since then it's like the moment he left camp was\nWhen we started getting contacted by other top ... maybe not one hundred players but\nYou know that three star guys in the state of Florida\nYou know who whose parents with the family who have offers from power five programs who say hey look I Want to take a visit now you know hate cold winters homecoming 'cause I Want to come to a game and the local guys who again it might have thought about ... to ... and all he's done he's raised the question what is\nYou know what else to talk some of the top student athletes in this country started considering ... now what would that look like for the last good causes football if some of those guys will start considering a come out of high school so I think is a great conversation to have\nI think the administration's really need to understand the importance of magnitude of it the fan base Lombardi understand the importance of it\nFor that to happen for them to really start to consider us we have to do a better job of of making sure that our facilities of the park um that you know I could to me I thought about schools a post doc games on ESPN three to make sure that the quality of the video I'm is up to par and then we're\nAnd I could to me at all about schools a post doc games on ESPN three to make sure that the quality of the video is up to par and then\nAnd um so we saw that we can go to football with rice and leave one of the most efficient quarterback for the conference and um we've we've done a good job there we've struggled at times run into football that's something that I Want to see a fool fond of the end of the season because I really think that uh it takes a lot of pressure off not only a a quarterback and parents and the fact\nThat the deepest as Wales so whenever you compound that football is Keith ... veteran of it\nIt really keeps feeding us off the field and lift that caught one a little bit so wonderfully as one of the football a little bit better than the second half of the fence at least it's not many things I could say bad about that unit I mean those guys are playing really lights out right now I'm you know they've held conference opponents to\nReally follow the purpose is about ten points of games um Norfolk stay out of their home come in with its just come up for a game of gave up last week they have a Twenty one left within the\nUm no no for say a homecoming with no for just come up fifty four point game of gave up last week a in the uh twin one last week and he's like you look at it\nSeven other came off of a kickoff return to first kick off was run by four touchdown Sufi says wasn't on the field\nThe second test I came up with basically ... that they return to the one yard line and um you know they do a fate right on for example goes down so they will only had one drive or what have you always have lifted the feeling the score and so basically held them to seven points um look around a central\nGave up with us down on the first drive and didn't give up another touchdown and fill the game was way out of hand with Suzanne\nAnd then against the ban of a saint gave up Thirteen so those guys are planning to stream of well right now are really doing a great job of stopping to Ron I'm getting to the quarterback if that will be in the Congress in fact some type of laws and I'm getting getting them out to build on third down that they were about thirty percent which is really really good\nAnd then the special teams we've we've had great games I mean what we ... we\nMay feel goals and covered grade on kick off coverage and we've had a couple of guys will have to miss house I'm In a wheel of fortune to come out last week game with the wind because we felt the same time and time again that the two guys that we've lost we play the strings before especially in the fall guy who was on the up until a tea\nWith play really really well on special teams\nUh Saturday was the first time that we played pretty poorly all special things that were still able to come out with when so definitely got to clean up some things in that area in on the same fat free parking lot this year which is more than I've had my entire career\nAnd um and and we've got a kick off about four touchdown so gotta clean up the fans of that area but all the laws to be sitting here five and to a vote on conference play um I I couldn't be more pleased with with the airport and then the answer to that these guys play with this kind of cleaned up some fundamental and detailed things are as we get back into accomplished by next week against Morgan State\nAnd like things that you pretty much an understanding of the identity and the and the\n... thing so you know and we we we product up a fan of tough\nUm Arnold blue collar football team in one of the things on the first things we talked about we got here and one of the things that we hear over and over and over again is is how to overcome adversity and for us to the football team that kind of been saying that we stand all ... people asked how do we overcome last week\nHow he able to into a category ... hurricane be held practice change that for a\nChange that practice schedule get on the bus drivers Greensboro be without lights the locker room and still be able to come from behind and win the game whether it's because we've talked constantly about not letting situations dictator I I don't know whether it's football class or life\nYou know whatever comes our way we can't control that all we can control is how we respond to those different stimuli in for us as a football team we want to make sure that we always fun in a positive way\nAnd I think those guys are starting to really understand that and by that and that's why they didn't get rattle a when hurricane Michael Caine so that's why they can get ... you know when they ran over to kick off what cuts down ...\nWent down Twenty one six and a half time because they're starting to understand what it takes to persevere in the face of adversity and I think that's the identity of the same and hope that when people see us play or that's what they see as well\nSpending time with coach will be so much from Florida and um university on H. B. C. you place in preserving the reserve hairs and coach you guys go up and you you do with up in North Carolina and do you get the big win over a team that open the season wins over Jacksonville state in east Carolina but it's what happens when you come back and you get off the plane\nSo somebody players went over to Quincy I'm your home town to talk about the importance of that and uh and the the kind of a lesson opposite view or that you went through with your players when you got back a little one\nFrom town to talk about the importance of that and uh and the the kind of a lesson opposite view or that you went through with your players when you got back\nA little one of the things that we have the sap talk about it is it's taken a whole approach\nTo the games you know as their hand the south people can relate you know football is the second religion\nAnd and winning games is really really what people want to do and um it was it was funny now I laugh about it now um after I lost ... states you know again we're uh we're all God's will get baptized the next day\nAnd um I posted those pictures and you know put it and put them all social media and I'm In one of our fans\nComment and say we pay you to win games we feel about guys get back to at least eight and with football games and I and ... says a lot of people take it in and that's okay you know we raise that far too because we don't want to win but we understand that this game I play the game my entire life\nFootball gives you so much it gives you guys so many opportunities that otherwise they will be provided with so many chances to travel and see things and dispose of things and get back\nAnd that's what we really want to make sure I got to understand so yes where they went in front of the biggest winners program has had in close to a decade but what's more important is what we just endured a week ago what people are still going through now which is the devastation\nThat was caused by hurricane Michael's and and there's only so much we can do with the football team to help that but that little bit that we can do we want to do and so um my first thought was just get these guys out we have a ... a normal practice on Sunday\nSo gave him the Sunday also they let's take some time to go into the community you know Clinton together county is this just next door and um this help some of the people who are without\nPower right now you know who who adopt clean running water the stores are bearing right now is you can't really go to Wal Mart or target forget you know grow through the supply because everything is so scares the let's take water is over to the community let's go\nPick up some hot meals because\nA lot of these people were without power so they can be hot meals and let's do our part\nTo show this community is that we want the support us\nThat will support them and that time of need and I think that's really important for us as a football program in an athletic department yeah we we did some community service on Sunday or physical throughout this summer again on Monday a and they went to the entire team out on Wednesday and to Tallahassee and parts of gas accounted to help out so\nI definitely want to try to do our part to show this great community\nUm how much we appreciate them\nAnd that will be willing to support them as well that is really really important I'm a platform is always something that I take very seriously as a hit close to the football players the visibility that we have the exposure that we have\nThe type of influence that we have you know and if people see a football team after coming off the road and the great when you get out get out there and help out well\nMaybe it was encouraged a local business to get involved or maybe an encouraged her to get involved and that's what it's all about so you know force them to be able to do that and I hope that we can continue as many people in this area and he needs a very very special attention during this time\nCoach let's talk about you'd seen though you're doing those things you gotta buy week\nOr maybe get some people arrested in in Europe and then you die back into the conference 'cause you you got four games to go a in an ideal scenario hobbies you win the mall but we've been talking about what you want to see from Eugene in these final four games including backed a than a Florida Classic\nOr did you want to see them do ah to give me something opportunity to commute to Atlanta a nightmare for celebration\nI mean we we we want to see the rat lives in a town we go see the rat let's come to Atlanta but the thing you can go ahead and be mindful now than they had to go\nAnd we want to see the rat lives in a town we go see the route what's come to Atlanta number for any kind of had to be mindful\nNow than they had to go to and worried about times on the radio now we're not supposed to buy for the radio but uh\nBut now we um you know ... and you hate to sound like a cold and give cliched one game by the time features but really that's what we have to be able to do you know there's so much football play um you know I told her to another day you know he has worked for him but\nThe commitments Thomas in column he called me on Mondays just graduating on the when he didn't call me on Mondays they've handed accomplished championship trophy\nAnd so we're falling not feminine and so there's a lot of football let's play\nA lot of things that we need to do with the football team to continue to improve and get better\nAnd so for us that needs to be a folk you know right now our focus really is crazy it sounds it's not even know Morgan State a focus right now he's on Florida and now\nThis is our by weaknesses are we to focus on up and get better the football team so let's do that unless this winter day and like I say we we we try to focus on what's important now you know what's in our face right now that we need to attack\nFor right now that you know getting healthy as you alluded to that getting caught up in the classroom academically because as you know people know during football season you've got this class on friday for travel purposes\nUm that you know getting out of the community and helping out as a little bit too and then as clean up some fundamental things that we had done well over the last several weeks so this is what we're focusing on right now than it is time wise in that regard\nAnd then come around Sunday when we get back will really start to shift I emphasize Morgan State because they are and they came up to the conference game and and as well as we did last week and one of the game last week\nIt will be all for not if we if we dropped the ball against Morgan State and they have shown this year that they can beat the number one thing the cops and they went on the road and be anti earlier this year and so you know pushed over a I have a ton of respect for Jones and the job he's done to the coast throughout his career and I know he'll have the godfather ready to play in this thing is\nAnd um you know the time was right I again people are kind of tired with fine print and contracts and the doctor balls

W A L K embarrassing in your house since we've gotten a lot of information into the hope you guys are hope this is good for you because I felt that we need to share some information is a lot of opinionated stuff lately and I just\nWant to do something new like that GM I thought it was a big deal especially going to buy\nA new vehicle you may want to know about this new did what you I'm going to tell you about a trip that we took down to Hyundai a manufacturing plant in Montgomery a couple weeks ago\nTo see the new Hyundai Santa Fe\nTo actually see the debut of it\nThis brand new ... desire vehicle and also to see the behind the scenes in the plant of how the vehicle is built in how automation is a company to play\nIn the automotive we're having worked in an assembly line not tell you this changed the game I may still be working on the assembly line had it been like this when I worked there before we get to that let's go to learn to engage Leroy do more than we were\n\nNot much but how you doing\nHer you know the you know no more insurgents will be a lot better if they made it distorted the G ... Amy ... is you know to me like a real [noise] [noise]\nHey there stole their their warranty warranted seeming ainge\nLabs you know and to me like a real may\nDo you think the older vehicles lasted longer better than the newer ones\nOh absolutely absolutely uh uh\nI had my wife's engine rebuild on our our own once the barber right uh-huh\nPerson they're rebuilt to him in his job\nWas the old nine a escalate that was being rebuilt it said I mean he showed\nMe don't dominate the engine went out at a hundred and four thousand miles you're not making this stuff that last and making it so you have to come back to them to get you go brand new one or you know use to warrant you\nIf you're inside that farmers over the course but um I did have another question about somebody had told me Montreal\nOkay go ahead this you'll showman\nMan [laughter] you know I played my check is the way\nI guess I don't get access to you know but um I had asked you about um insurance and all you had told me because someone national something it's about um\nA claim I have and of course they're acting up on the plane that that wasn't my fault not that that should probably 'cause you know your pet insurance so through ... through your job hurt\n'em I was wondering if you still had the name of the place when you have an issue with the claim any more information on how they're supposed to do what they're supposed to do\nOr you would call the insurance commissioner is a man as a consumer complaint process that you would file hum the commission is a raft he hundreds\nYeah it was outside of insurance commissioners office I'm I remember that one 'cause I've been there before it was a different one\nA national something of America\nWas the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration\nKnow 'cause this specifically when insurance and their clients because the issue I'm having now is they're trying to settle but they're telling me\nThat\nThey initially they say look we all live taken receives for within a year of the accident that we're looking to rear British were they taking those receipts and misled they only offer me ten percent of\nSeven hundred dollars that on a man too much for that [noise]\nI don't know that those buses they called\nMe I can I can hear you you're\nGoing to throw 'em so now now okay I'll be ... percent of the several hundred dollars with the Seventy dollars I'm On that had people from probably talk too much\nSo now they're also coming back and saying that well the ... one of the reasons why that is so low is because we will not cover a labor we were all the parts where you go get a part\nThere are less you're putting it all yourself you got to pay for labor so how are you I mean are they able to say what what gives them the me way to say or do not pay for\nLabor will what happens is um they are banking on the fact that you're going to give up they say they got more time\nNot have for labor\nWill what happens is um they are banking on the fact that you're going to give up if they got more time than they got more time and money than you so they feel like if I if we drag this out\nHe will finally let it go away you know he'll get to the point where he needs and so here's the thing there are I'm trying to find the the website for disputing insurance claim because they're the process that you have to go through it\nBut getting your vehicle reappraised and reassess the based on those insurance those receipt I Will tell you that I Can't remember the name of that agency I'm going to find that before I leave here today and I'm gonna get it to you but one of the things that I found the most times\nYour claim is uses things about the same unless there was some huge something that you did that that you could prove but if he just came down and you just put breaks I I wouldn't be the same thing with my son like we just live breaks on the car we just put new tires on the car and in a car guy total\nAnd so they gave us a little bit of a bump put a new tires and a little bit of ... once they went and looked at it um but you would go in and it's a diminished value is what you're\nThere fear diminished value or Georgia\nYeah and so I'm trying to find a phone number four I Know there's a website out here and it's called ... minutes value of Georgia a oh I've got a phone number four to ... you read it for the phone number\nOr pull off or because they've got to call them doing 'cause they I mean their trip I can use it they said well we're not going to pay for ... you had when I got a few of them are uninsured law I well I got the part I and paying for labor go ahead and put it all they're not going to do it\nWith what you gotta remember insurance company hires people to protect their interest in to save their money their whole job is to not pay out as much\nAs the the claim it won't stuff that they get paid to do that so they feel like is one of you against a hundred of them and so they're going to drag it out and try to irritate you all the way to the point where you except where they don't give you a ...\nAnd and the person I talked to over their diminished value of jogging I remember him telling me he said that they are trying to ...\nCompanies are trained by a psychologist in how to say no and how to get on the air\nThe last time I spoke the u._s._a. I got under their skin because I chose to do some information they weren't aware of\nA ... um when they start to push back and said no and all that I told them that um well maybe that's why people that own insurance companies are looking at replace a justice where a lot in chat but\nDo you go along with all your ... own touch it [laughter]\nThat's how quiet because I I basically told him do your job is being threatened by the owners of the people in the company you work for them because they they were looking at cutting costs and saving money and you know I'm a an increase in their bottom line without you\nYeah you got it got real quiet maybe that's why they were trying to sell the stuff for a year man which that number\nSix seven eight okay for zero four zero four or five five\nAnd then is diminished value of George Zimmerman is value of Georgia yep\nYeah man and insurance companies there's info slimy you marry 'em blaming\nA before that part that bad and he misses his ... I don't it wouldn't be bad I wouldn't be like oh my God don't do it I just would not depend on that one hundred percent\nOkay well let's see well if I came in at least Ninety percent and there's no use to me and that's not the dollars that might as well go with the program as when the light cars don't just get it checked\nRight right and and that's what I Would recommend okay All right\nNot not a problem thank you so much they'll keep up the good work\nYou you and your ... your welcome thank you and good luck to Iraq because I\nRemember so talking about is Carson and technology\nWhen we got to visit the well I cause some own keys nodding her head that she didn't get to go and she wants to be anonymous on the show was he always chimes in when I'm doing a story so I got to keep seeing her name she didn't get to go just I got to go but it's the auto insider and I went on behalf of you the listeners\nTo Montgomery, Alabama just a few miles away is the Hyundai Motors assembly plant they bill the Saddam out a couple of the cars but\nBam a just a few miles away is the\nA Hyundai Motors assembly plant they bill the Saddam out a couple of the cars but I went down to see the new Santa Fe on days midsize SUVs Hyundai has a long line of SUVs\nFrom a small terrible to be three rows well there's new Santa Fe they just released for two thousand Nineteen\nAnd they to row SUV has a lot of technology technology like um it was called blue linked with a Hyundai you can download an app called talking about an hour you can download an app on your smartphone\nFrom Hyundai called blue link and it will give you information and diagnosis of your vehicle you can start your car lock the doors are locked their doors remotely\nOne of the new thing for two thousand and that's something that's been around with Hyundai for a while but one of the new things with the Santa Fe that a Hyundai has partnered with\n'em and a Google and so you can actually start your vehicle from one of those Google in home devices you know you could say hey and turn the radio station hey do this well you can also start your vehicle check your fuel\nAnd all those things from your smartphone device which\nI\nKnow whether I'm fully on board but if I'm Sorry not Google I I ... it's Amazon Alexa\nWas the Amazon Alexa that you can if you have an Amazon Alexei in your home you can download an app to your smartphone and connected to your blue link on your Hyundai a Santa Fe you can then [noise] from your home tell Alexa a city of Google homes electrical\n... start my car and Alexa will start your car you could say Alexa how much gas do I have in the vehicle it'll tell you if you have directions that you download it you could sing the directions from your\nHouse out to your vehicles that are already being a navigation system when you get there\nSo a lot of technology that's involved and they also have this thing called smart drive it's a whole um\nIt's a whole category of safety features that comes standard\nOwned a Hyundai Santa Fe and and and they sent a phase in the market with the ... the um key is rent toll or the suit the Subaru out back a couple of the vehicles\nWhen they look down the price comparison in standard features this new Santa Fe is going to come with the based model at twenty five thousand dollars with things that are only optional and not even optional and some of his competition\nSo you know for me and the other thirty journalists were there with me\nWe had conversations about it and\nI think it was you know this may be a bit of a game changer with SUVs 'cause there's so many SUVs and crossovers on the road today is harmful want to stand out over another those are some of the things that stood out and one of the things that I saw about that Hyundai Santa Fe plant that really struck me and probably not with as many other a journalist\nWas the automation and the plant when I worked at a assembly plant here in Georgia years ago when I was in college\nEverything was manual the hardest most labor intensive work that I've ever done in my life so much so that that's the job that I had to quit I walked off never went back to work at they mail my last paycheck that's a difficult job was\nWell in this plan to talk about automation first fear I had in fair for you know people I Know who I'm working on a similar\nA difficult job was well in this plan to talk about automation first fear I had and fair for you know people I Know who I'm working on a similar lines and people in unions is these\nComputers are going to take the jobs away from

A. okay [noise] All right and\nWe are back on one side of your loose circulated W. A. oh okay I'm Darryl kill your your health [noise] we've gotten a lot of information as the hope you guys are hope this is good for you because I felt that we needed to share some information's are a lot of opinionated stuff lately and I\nWant to do something new like that GM I thought it was a big deal especially going to buy\nA new vehicle you may want to know about this new did warn you I'm going to tell you about a trip that we took down to Hyundai a manufacturing plant in Montgomery a couple weeks ago\nSee the new Hyundai Santa Fe\nTo actually see the debut of it\nThis brand new ... desire vehicle and also to cedar behind the scenes and the plant of how the vehicle is built in how automation is that come into play\nIn the automotive we're having worked in an assembly line not tell you this changed the game I may still be working on these stimuli had it been like this when I worked there before we get to that let's go to learn to give Leroy\nGood morning Ira\nChange the game I may still be working on these stimuli it'd be like this when I worked there before we get to that let's go to ... to ... leave on the morning they were there or not much but how you doing\nYou know the you know no more incidents will be a lot better if they made their stuff that they are warranty warranted seamy aiming to last you know to me like a real [noise]\nSo you think the older vehicles lasted longer better than the newer ones\nOh absolutely absolutely uh uh\nI had my wife's engine rebuild on our our own once the barber right uh-huh\nPerson they're rebuilt to him in his job was the old nine a escalate that was being rebuilt it said I mean you show me the dominant the engine without a hundred and four thousand miles\nYou're not making this stuff to last and making it so you have to come back to them to get Hugo brand new one or you know used to warrant you\nIf you're inside the farmers of course but uh I did have another question about somebody had told me Montreal\nOkay go ahead this you'll show me how\nMuch you know I played my check is really well I guess I don't get access\nTo a high you know but um I had asked you about um insurance and all you had told me because someone national something it's about um\nA claim I have and of course they're acting up on the plane that that was my fault not that that should probably 'cause you know your pet insurance so to ... do your job but\nUm I was wondering if you still had the name of the place when you have an issue with the claim you made any more information on how they're supposed to do what they're supposed to do\nOr you would call the insurance commissioner is a man as a consumer complaint process that you file a commission is a raft he hundreds\nYeah it was outside of insurance commissioners office um I remember that one 'cause I've been there before it was a different one\nA national something of America\nWas the new national Highway Traffic Safety Administration\nKnow 'cause this specifically when insurance and their claims because the issue I'm having now is they're trying to settle but they're telling me\nThat\nThey initially they say look we all live taking receives for within a year of the accident that we're looking to rear British were they taken those receipts and misled they only offer me ten percent of\nSeven hundred dollars that on a man too much for that [laughter] [noise]\nI don't know that it does bug today\nI can hear I can hear you\nOn the road so now now okay so they are ... percent of the several hundred dollars with the Seventy dollars I'm On that had people properly talk too much so now they're also coming back and saying that well the ...\nOne of the reasons why that is so low is because we will not cover a labor we were only a couple of parts where you go get a part of this you put it all yourself\nYou got to pay for labor so how\nThat's where you go get a part of this year it all yourself you're going to pay for labor so how are you I mean are they able to say what what gives them the way to say or do not have for\nLabor will what happens is um they are banking on the fact that you're going to give up if they got more time than they got more time and money than you do they feel like if I if we drag this out\nHe will find and let it go away you know he'll get to the point where he needs and so here's the thing there are I'm trying to find the the website for disputing insurance claim because\nThere was a process that you have to go through it but getting your vehicle reappraised and reassess the based on those insurance those receipt I Will tell you that I Can't remember the name of that agency\nI'm going to find it before I leave here today in them and get it to you but one of the things that I've found the most times\nClean is use these things about the same unless there was some you something that you did that that you could prove but if he just came down and you just put breaks I I wouldn't be the same thing with my son like we just live breaks in the car we just put new tires on the car\nAnd in the car got total\nAnd so they gave us a little bit of a bump put a new tires and a little bit of a bump once they went and looked at it um if you will go in and it's a diminished value is what you're\nTheir sheer diminished value or Georgia\nYeah and so I'm trying to find a phone number four I Know there's a website I hear this caller just minutes value of Georgia a oh I got a phone number four to ... you ready for the phone number\nOr pull off or because they've got to call them doing because they I mean their trip that I can use it they said well we're not going to pay for cable you know had when I got a few of them are uninsured I well I got the part I ain't paying for labor go ahead and put it all they're not going to do it\nWith what you gotta remember insurance company hires people to protect their interest in to save their money their whole job is to not pay out as much\nAs the the claim it won't that they are they're getting paid to do that so they feel like is one of you against the hunting idioms and so they're going to drag it out and try to irritate you only went to the point where you step where they don't give you a ...\nAnd and the person I talked to over their diminished value of jogging I remember him coming rift instead that are they are trying to prepare\nTheir shirts companies are trained by a psychologist and how to say no and how to get under your skin or the last time I spoke\nTo USA I got under their skin because I Do some information they weren't aware of of told them there um\nWhen they started to push back and said no and all that I told them that um well maybe that's why people their own insurance companies are looking at replace a justice where a lot in chat but\nDo you go along with all your ... your own conscience [laughter]\nThat's how quiet it 'cause I I basically told him to do your job is being threatened by the owners of the people in the company you work for them because they they recommend couldn't cough and saving money and you know I'm a an increase in their bottom line without you\nYeah you got it got real quiet maybe that's why they try and this other stuff but uh yeah man which that number\nSix seven eight okay for zero four zero four or five five\nButter and sometimes it can be down the line some we had a guy here a few weeks ago talking about our emissions testing and has been his experience that just because it leads you to apart it doesn't necessarily always means that part is bad it could be a part\nA before that part that bad and the mission system I I don't it wouldn't be bad I Would be like oh my God don't do it I just would not depend on that one hundred percent\nOkay well let's see well if I was paying and all that at least Ninety percent and it's no use to me and that's the dollars that might as well go with the program as when the light kind of don't just get it checked\nRight and and that's what I Would recommend\nOkay All right not it's not a problem thank you so much they'll keep up the good work\nKnow when you're ... You're welcome thank you and good luck to you about that murmur so talking about these cars and technology\nYou know when you're ... You're welcome thank you and good luck to you about that remember\nSo talking about is Carson and technology\nWhen we got to visit the well I cause some own keys nodding her head that she didn't get to go and she wants to be anonymous on the show but she always chimes in when I'm doing a story so I got to keep seeing her name she didn't get to go just I got to go but if the auto inside and I went on behalf of you the listeners\nTo Montgomery, Alabama just a few miles away is the\nA Hyundai Motors assembly plant they bill the Saddam out a couple other cars but I went down to see the new Santa Fe and days midsize SUVs Hyundai has a long line of SUVs\nFrom a small terrible to be the three rows well there's new Santa Fe they just released for two thousand Nineteen\nTo row SUV has a lot of technology technology like um have this thing called blue link with Hyundai you can download an app called talking about an hour you can download an app on your smartphone\nFrom Hyundai called below link and it will give you information and diagnosis of your vehicle you can start your car lock the doors are locked their doors remotely\nOne of the new thing for two thousand and that's something that's been around with Hyundai for a while but one of the new things with the Santa Fe that a Hyundai is partner with\n'em and a Google and so you can actually start your vehicle from one of those Google in home devices you know you could say hey and turn the radio station hey do this\nWell you can also start your vehicle check your fuel and all those things from your smartphone device which\nI\nDon't know whether I'm fully on board but if I'm Sorry not Google or retract it Amazon Alexa was the Amazon Alexa that you can if you have an Amazon Alexei in your home you can download an app to your smartphone and connected to your blue link on your Hyundai a Santa Fe\nYou can then [noise] from your home 'til Alexa or so it is Google homes Alexa\n... start my car and Alexa will start your car you could say Alexa how much gas do I have in the vehicle it'll tell you if you have directions that you download it you can send the directions from your\nHouse out to your vehicles that are already being a navigation system when you get there\nWas a lot of technology that's involved and they also have this thing called smart drive it's a whole um\nIt's a whole category of safety features that comes standard\nOwned a Hyundai Santa Fe and in hunting Santa Fe is in the market with the ... the um key is er into uh the suit the super rule out back a couple of the vehicles\nWhen they look down the price comparison in standard features this new Santa Fe is going to come with the based model at twenty five thousand dollars with things that are only optional and that even optional and some of his competition\nSo you know for me and the other thirty journalists were there with me\nWe had conversations about it and\nI think it was you know this may be a bit of a game changer with SUVs 'cause there's so many SUVs and crossovers on the road today is harmful want to stand out over another those are some of the things that stood out\nAnd one of the things that I saw about that Hyundai Santa Fe plant that really struck me are probably not with as many other a journalist was the automation\nThe thing that I saw about that Hyundai Santa Fe plant that really struck me I'm probably not with as many other a journalist was the automation and the ... when I worked at a assembly plant here in Georgia years ago when I was in college\nEverything was manual the heart is most labor intensive work that I've ever done in my life so much so that that's the job that I had to quit I walked off never went back to work at their mail my last paycheck that's difficult that job was\nWell and this plan to talk about automation first fear I had and fair for you know people I Know who I'm working on a similar lines and people in unions is these\nComputers are going to take the jobs away from people when I got inside his plant I'll tell you he does not this plant employs about two thousand people think they built Thirteen hundred cars a day in this small town\nAnd these people are middle class job their upper middle to upper twenty dollars an hour pay a skill these people are making good money and his split\nTwo thousand people are working but what the automation did is it makes the job easier on the workers they haven't seen that lift the wheel and tired and put them in place\nNow I'm seeing that actually lift these heavy seat and put the seats in place in the car taking that strain of of the human back and then the human has come in and the bolted down screw it all makes sure it's right but all of that wear and tear on the body\nHas gone away I think that's probably lead to a better product on the assembly line and we'll see if these fan of phase when they hit the road I think they are out now\nAnd they hit the road where they are better vehicle you can get a minute to leader or you can get a to get a turbo in line for they range from twenty five thousand to a fully a laid out version close to forty thousand dollars for the SUV but I'll tell you if you're looking at safety a convenient\nYou can get a lot for twenty five thousand dollars if you don't have to have all the rest of the bells and whistles encourage you to go out to they'd be OK Facebook paid sick out the video I put up he's got the pricing price in comparison an SUV gets about twenty five\nTwenty six miles a gallon is better than the day and I drive from two thousand seven some small families don't check it out but let me know what you think about if you do test drive one\nComing back I mean those things but then new Hyundai Santa Fe when we come back when we wrap
