Sherman to somebody or or or for us to be the new mayor then they put you back in ... they put you back in slavery it's our video upside the head again and then you'll say well thank God we didn't vote\nBecause now the people who really hate us have all the power and they don't have to worry about us what does that who's your in game and telling people not devote\nWell this is the thing that you have failed to realize based on the uh manipulation of your mind through media we're still on slavery\nWe're still uh the for the last hired first fired what they've done is broken up our family through the political process and they are ... I think that they have been marginalized through the historical culture which many of them know nothing about\nSo the endgame for me is to understand my history my heritage my ancestry and being in this country you have found that you don't even recognize the\nImportance of your name of your the name of your ancestors the legacy of your ancestors and use the the\nThe importance of your name of your the name of your access to the legacy of your ancestors and you think the only in game is to join in with the people that hate you is that true or not true you\nKnow get a look do you get to a point where it's either get off the pot so if you're saying that you don't be part of the American system would always tell you leave\nBut otherwise you either have to be involved you know if you're not involved or you can't complain all the things that you're saying if you're not voting you have no say in it you have no you have no reason to complain because you're not part of the solution you can sit in the corner crying and complaining all you want when you're not really willing to do anything to fix it\nThen it just is is just a like a chart we'll call it\nYou're just not only are making making random noises ain't doing nothing you're talking about not say anything\nBut that's the best in our lives that they told you the ones who have nothing to say are the ones who vote for a very\nA system that has bomb poisoned corrupted insulated\nAh molested our people\nOn on a daily basis when you vote for something that means you supported the people who do not support it are the ones who don't vote for who do not ah who are systematically\nProject their own ideals versus the ones who support the oligarchy who control the voting system it's all based on money and the capitalist system is run by the corporate entities that control this that the economic engine of this country\nWill get in every true if you dislike capitalism why don't you give me your money\nI mean aren't there socialism isn't it you give me your money I spend it with us the appropriate or give you back what you think he should have if you don't like a democracy then go to the country less a dictatorship see how well that works out well you'll like it not having any say in what happens politically\nBut this is what you'd never you didn't get to the issue of what I said\nHow this country compromise is your thought process in thinking that if you vote for it then you somehow have a voice that vote means to you have no voice and vote means that you are going oh\nYou are a whiz whatever this cold rough country comes up with not voting Chavez day you can support your own interest in a fashion that would be antithetical to the oligarchy debt control of this country\nThe little you know getting so let me put it this way let's say that the you don't vote they elected a new mayor and city council who decides to use eminent domain to take your house and turn it into a dog park at that point and how have held has you know voting benefitted you in any way shape or form\nThat let me answer that briefly\nIs by letting you know our children now our community now in our people know we need to farming alliance against this corrupt system that would destroy us right now we're under the false impression that if you joined the says that's that if you support the and slave labor\nThe human trafficker this how you got over here through human trafficking that child molester that somehow you putting a person in the system that they created\nI eat who invented the voting system itself and the voting machine the people who are crushed you will change it is not running changes\nYou know you you realized voting started in Africa right no it didn't touch\nIt absolutely did it was out of the uh uh out of new being timid that's the first recorded voting in history the Greeks and the Romans got it from the Persian to get it from Africans you can dated\nA lot of new being Kim it that's the first recorded voting in history the Greeks and the Romans got it from the Persian to get it from Africans you can date it all the way back\nThe European system is older guard is not oligarch uncle but monarch goal they had either a patron or either primal janitor to pass down rule or God will conduit using the Carol Indian Empire to divide property between the eldest on the monarch\nAnd that's what he's been two or three thousand years in constant warfare because they didn't have the power to elect their leadership and so just one one person die with one ruler died the next country over him bait them that's why they were in the dark ages why we're beginning alphabet that's why they were in the medieval period\nWhile we were navigating the fees because we had a more advanced governmental system than the European system will just killing everybody every generation\nYeah but it wasn't based on voting it was based on a monarchy ... blood riots that was passed down through the historical standards of that a tribe or a culture of people you know that those\n\n[noise] [noise]\nMm [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nWell combat
