W A L K\nTwenty years of automotive expertise is one go away solve the auto insider and for for eight nine to twenty seven oh three vivid among driven a suitable donors ... W. A. okay [noise]\nRight and we're ...\nSucking about maintaining your vehicle and not just depending on the lights on the dash\nThose lights a good indication that something is wrong with your car that it's about broken if it's not already completely broken but it's not\nWhat you should depend on to rely on as far as getting your car service now I Know some automaker like board\nThey have an intelligent we'll monitoring system as opposed to monitor the sky city\nThe amount of time and and it will vary your oil chain intervals based on your ah the way you drive the car you're driving habits and the conditions which you drive a car so that's all great these are great because they do work will\nBut they don't replace the good old fashioned putting your hand and you're a zone\nLight came on there now Scott paranoid enough argues and a set riding the lights went out now let me ask you a question or my friend used to deliver gas and he said all gas at the same stuff or you know for eighty nine Ninety two or whatever those numbers a different place it basically\nAll the gas stations are the same as far as you know I wanted to ask you what is share our text travelers texture\nThe tech run is a oil and and it is a detergent they add to the oil your friend is absolutely right and you go over there off a boat and wrote inundated we there are fuel storage tanks over there right up to it if I have a boat and wrote\nAnd you will see quick trip truck pulls ... M co ... everybody come out of his name to get the gas from St Louis\nSo right housing in them you know the eighty nine nine when he's absolutely correct what ... what some places do is they put a detergent in the field so when they those trucks that come to different says they have a switch in there and another bladder in those uh carriers can have a detergent in\nWhat is designed to do is that as your vehicle um is burning the gas those detergents clean off your fuel injected and so it it it cleans all that carbon build up you know whenever you you said you have to take a match and hold on to something metal or whatever and you see the black a residue that gets on it\nYeah so that's what happens to you if you will inject 'cause they're just burning so you get that they'd be able to read\nDuring your feeling that died with him on them right away to live when I go home and have you\nIs it goes in and they claim that off and what your chicken and light is doing you're checking like monitors your emissions ... devices on your vehicle\nAnd federal government mandate that all cars have to have an a emissions control devices like oxygen sensors which determine how many pollutants that your vehicle is emitting into the environment in from the exhaust pipe\nAnd so in your electronic gas circulation ... you're listening to talk about a lot it goes in and it measures any on burn fuel that your car is not burning stuff you've or your car nut tune is not running properly\nYou can it's sometimes get on burn fuel come out of your exhaust as well what ... is an electron aghast circulation device it takes that fuel and ready to back into the engine so that it can be properly burned into it will come out as an ... involved in a gas rather than a liquid\nSo let me ask you that those are things like as the pay is that really need it for your car then is that needed sometimes the ad or not\nIt it's it's not bad so you can buy tech on one of the one I liked the best is the tech Ron or a few editor so else when you brought that up stuff\nI was talking about you know how you're going to the auto parts store and buy as teaching gas treatment or are those native now gas treatment\nIf you're buying 'em the right gas not necessarily but it does help is not is not bad what you do want to do if you use do you want to put him in when the cars are mostly empty\nAnd then fill your car up with gas so that they mix is real well in the tank\nAnd all it does it goes in and burns up some of the exit that excess someone you feel injected so it's it's not a bad idea and I wouldn't do it in a regular basis\nYou might do it every all change I I wouldn't do it too extensively no and also makes a you always just burn whenever I attend your car calls for that's all use if your car costs eighty seven and you Ninety three you wasted money\nOkay and one more question huh\nDo cars have a back in the day 'cause I'm a ... they have do they still have we got to get your deferential treatment changed now days on these cars\nBack in the day 'cause I'm a ... did they have do they still have we got to get your deferential treatment changed now days on these cars\nWith some car the disc is sealed and some is not when I worked to anchor yeah we used to do their services all the time um if it's if your vehicle will tell you if you ever see some ... transmission fluid anymore believe it or not they're sealed off some car you can't even drain so dependent upon the making Malta vehicle to dry\nOkay All right appreciate it or know prep thanks a lot for your call him a let's go ahead and it's getting a mark on line for the most of them are\nA little more fair a fire department about um the the people and ... both Raul uh-huh yes but\nOh tear gas that a bell evil and and the non ... matter of fact it was also on that um\nLost a lot of neighborhoods than what the law although that is legal but the charts and that there are people and they thought that was looking all over the entire talk last law here at that temperature now but the ... not ... or the most part and they\nWell I see an article you know it's funny you bought me that's interesting you brought that up some good information you share and why did you see here I'm looking on line is is a pure a gas station just open a postal Ian\nIndicator I didn't I didn't know about that\nYeah they don't want it because somebody filed a lawsuit\nI did not know about that I'm going to look more into that into a gas and so I then I stand corrected marketing maybe all of the games I think the same but I Know I have seen shale Chevron BP all they're coming out of that same place on his own building roads do and they just had it but you have you're right I see this play computer games I got to look into this a little bit more of good information Mart\nOkay sure thank you for sharing that like it\nI Love when people cause and give us something that we didn't know if you know something I don't let me come to any people the wrong thing from tell them something came up new to the last time I do to your account to Miami to them by the folk on the radio but for the most part besides this I got to look into this pure the gas going for each one of these guys they did the same needs to be this joke I had a friend of mine whose dad\nUsed to own amicable stays and he swore by Emma co gas it was American oil company and that he would he swore by he would get man if he saw anybody he knew binds you anywhere else we went to shell of something else when America or he fussing\nAnd his friends used to make you mad my Lindy by telling him I just saw the chemicals and the ah BP truck coming out of the same gas at St Paul this boy am I going to be doing he's a good source that we hear people talking about that but it really does come from saying places there's going to learn to him get Marie good morning Murray\nOh good morning\nI'm I'm On to 'em or asking a question or a couple of questions about yeah I have a two thousand five a hundred the army a with a little over a hundred and Seventeen thousand miles on it uh-huh\nUm I had an accident or what I was going into a business and they had a home\nOn the side that they didn't had not closed up and I ended up\nA fallen a ... my the rights right back on my car fail into the whole as a result of that I ended up with a bill close to close to a thousand dollars\nBecause the car was moving so it would have to be covered under your collision insurance\nRight that's what they did mhm\nAnd so for Clinton insurance if if the ... and so you found it on to college and the first time that your insurance company to pay for that\n[noise] uh yeah because of course I had um a you know the ... I had to pay the deductible and then they pay the rent the rat\nStudy and what I Would do nearly as I'll call so the the people who get a repair should now co your insurance adjuster back\nOkay now what they have to ask them to do that ... that was a former\nSomething they said that need to be filled out right at them up because I told him I wanted to see if I could add that right onto the claim senses less than six months since they paid\nRight at them a cause I told him I wanted to see if I could add that right onto the claim says is less than six months since they paid out the yeah\nThe oil if they can prove that it was a direct a has a direct relationship to that prior damage than they can say yeah this has happened from here here's what happened in your insurance company more than likely will go and take care of their repair and they should not be an additional deductible OK okay\nBecause insurance companies should have some adjuster out during that time\nTo look at the damage and Senate confirmed with the mechanics it and they should have given them an authorization to go ahead and repair so there was something that was missed the insurance companies just as much as ... as the mechanical was a ... a week and then this is one thing you might want to consider\nInsurance company could now say that these two things combined exceeds the value of the vehicle so we recommend totally in your vehicle oh and then when you don't want to go down that route [noise]\nNo I Can't afford right now this is not a year I can buy a new car right\nSo and in that is that particular car a I think has held up real well I see so many of them even though that that's a five that's ... you know close to twelve years old\nAnd basically I don't have other you know other issue is always happening you know\nIt's it's well it's the oil by a car right so I said rather than try and uh I just go on and pay this and then um [noise] uh uh just try maybe in the next year to two years to get a call but I just can't do it I Can't do it this year\nRight so I Would you know tread lightly there\nIn maybe even speak with the adjuster and see if the adjusted we'll give you a little bit of advice there they may they may not but just trade lightened there because you know they um could actually say okay well at this point the car is\nWith this damage exceeds the value of the car mhm and then they can recommend told in the vehicle mhm ah so to look into that but I Would I definitely think especially if you're not coming out of your pocket paying for it I'd definitely say I'm\nThem pay for it and I'm looking here Edmund dot com at your car um said the blue book by your car is about thirty six hundred dollars\nMhm yeah I knew somewhere between three thousand thirty five hundred I figured right so be able to get\nFor it so so anyway I was looking at the same thing with my insurance do I need to drop 'em some uh some coverage is because of the age of it now\nAh I Would not because most of this stuff really doesn't\nThe insurance is protecting your financial interest of the ... and stuff like that would cause if you get into an accident with someone else and you don't have enough coverage than the other person if they so desire could then sue you for anything that your insurance company to uncover so\nI it's it's a fine line but to protect your financial interest\nUm and you just said to me you know the position as you to buy a new car I Would probably keep my insurance covers the way that it is\nOkay alright okay now the other thing I didn't explain to him that they have for things they gonna do to my car because they told me I think I Do remember him saying something about\nThe actual um and then these other two things that they're saying is from the X. them before but it's a total of four thing so but as long as it's\nIn the same with the pillow\nTwo things that this is from the act them before but it's a total of four thing so\nBut as long as it's all in the same with the location and it's all connected don't wear ... ... it can be three pieces one piece if it's part of that don't worry about those ... lead them if they're going to replace that it's better if you can in a car going to last longer\nYeah yeah okay thank you very much at\nAll right thank you Murray that that was a a deep when Simone because a lot a lot of moving pieces there and a lot of times what I noticed a lot of people don't um\n[noise] I don't take enough steps into going in and and trying to figure out what's the worst case scenario and I think Murray has done a good job of looking up you know what's the value of a car with the hands of this year has come and go pay she already knew it had to be cleared and that can be comprehensive comprehensive but most of us\nWell for many of us comprehensive insurance policies carry a zero to double or Douglas mix them lower than our lives and\nDeductible so you've done all the rights that you started right away so good job kudos to the\nMurray in are going through those pieces so we're going to get back to this um maintaining your vehicle the old fashioned way we're going through the oil change

good quarterback he has been\nA terrific quarterback so far this year completing Seventy five percent\nOf his passes and I got a chance to catch up with a Buffalo's head coach yesterday I talk about that big season two years ago before the dip and now the terrific starts what's happened and what's been the key to the turnaround\nWell our um our young men are just playing really really well our coaching staff than a phenomenal job with them and in our quarterback is excellent and Steven Montana and he's making a lot of things happen portion defensively we've gotten a um a lot stout or on the fence and I'm just proud of what those guys are doing\n[noise] you know you mentioned Steven monitors and how well he is playing he's always had the physical abilities which is seemingly become a much better quarterback at least from the outside looking in each completed over Seventy five percent of his past is this year one has made him transform from an athlete that is a quarter back to a quarterback\nWell you know quarterbacks need that experience and he's gotten from great experience and and played really well I'm In his show signs of that he now learn\nReally he understood are off that's really well but now he is hard to understand that these answers or what they're trying to do to him so he can see it coming he's been able to anticipate it would react well\nHe's much more on balance fundamentally like throwing now and uh that's making him much more accurate um and he's and then he could also make plays with his feet 'cause he's truly a six four and a half years two hundred and twenty eight pounds and he can run he can throw it a great athletes\nAnd then you can also make plays with his feet because he's truly a six four and a half he's two hundred and twenty eight pounds and he can run and he can throw it a great athlete but he's also now a great quarterback\n... but it has been an electric combination of ... uh who right now is one of the best college football players in the nation has he been a victim of the east coast bias in the sense that he should really be in the Heisman conversation right now\nThis is a an extremely um excellent player he plays really well removing all around he's able to handle the able to fight in the factories like Titanic wide receiver um this is a great player and he'll continue like play this year and as he continues to play well in it and we hopefully continue to when I'm all those accolades will come as what\nWhat has he been lying to coach or a guy not only of his extraordinary talent but to come back from one he's been through growing up seeing his father killed in a car accident while being in the front seat it's certainly force you grow up fast\nYes it does that he is an exceptional young man a very humble\nUm he was a little shy when we first got him but now he's totally opened up she really wants to trust people and and uh he's a pleasure to have all the team players loving care about him and he does now he is just as happy for the other guy the score tests now that he does for him so he really does and uh that show you what kind of character I guess\nAnd I also don't want to forget about the running back position because that has been a big big key to the store it as well and Philip Lindsey terrific career and is now not too far from campus with the Broncos but how much did his parting gift to the program if you will help but of course we're talking about Trayvon McMillan his successor\nA Philip Levine let let the great legacy here a legacy leadership and the legacy of hard
