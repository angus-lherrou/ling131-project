Oh thank you thank you thank you for the question that you brought up the seminal maybe I can talk about that we are I think\nFirst shoot you I think it's important to have a passion for the subject that you that you're dealing with\nSomething that really spark shared interests in particular\nPeriod of time if you're talking about the historical novel and then of course you you have to take time and that's another thing that you really need those large lots of time where you can do research\nI'm a I mean I Would say that getting primary research is someone that is also like going into the oral tradition 'cause a lot of information I got for example uh I work from slave narratives I read\nHunt you as a slave narratives ... which\nAgain where they fall tradition or the oral histories that were recorded\nYou know that's the that's a very good source of it just didn't and you know like I Know it just depends on who the person was that was a missing the narrative\nExactly ... or ... it was a white or investigator who were missing the narrative oftentimes a lot of people would tell the truth about what\nYou or certain things were were toned down your samples\nDuring the period of the antebellum period when there was a lot not near ... near just were published by evolution is\nThe abolition is would highlight the atrocities and the horrors of slavery because they're trying to garner and anti slavery sentiment\nRight but at the same time they would face any information about slave rebellions\nMary notch right because you know they they wanted to create a kind of phone calls Tom character right what you got in Harriet Beecher still so for example in twelve years a slave there's a party there or maybe just one or two sentences where Solomon Northup says that now that day\nThere's a party there or maybe just one or two sentences where Solomon Northup says that now that they went by when there was not talk\nOf rebellion well running away every day she talks about right but it's just again one cent right and the emphasis again and way the\nWhole story ends you have you have the white savior syndrome where his wife buddies from New York come down and and free hammer I\nKnow um but right again ... ... do the dishes for that which is horse manure go right [laughter] watching it in\nThe er during the um a period of the depression when FDR started the W. PA were or was it the word project as a agency\nAnd they had the federal writers project a federal theatre project a number of African American writers who ... out of work\nWere sent to exactly get these oral histories of the slate near to some people who were still living someone wants to all the centenarians of that time in Nineteen thirty ... her husband was going to do was one of them Richard Ryan run Margaret Walker was the number of them were still in ground hit it up from a here in Washington DC\nYou know you had thousands of narrative were collected during that process uh during that time and then we were put in a book leader call from ... from a sundown to sign up and ah and um and they would they were um a divided by state\nSo you could go to each state and read the narratives from that state now very acceptable on line you can actually go on line in Rio de Janeiro chips\nMan I'm already written down from sundown and\nGet these new reactors for which but going back to what she was um the caller was saying about yeah you hear about them a rose in Jamaica and and the rules in Brazil the the cheese on ballpark merits which was the whole nation states in in ... now where you had a dog again nation states in ... now\nAnd my thinking was well wait a minute because when we chased me in school we never learned about the slave rebellions or anything right in fact they were still pushing the lost cause in there too that we like slavery and we're right after you know but my thinking is that wait a minute if they had all these billions\nI don't know I mean there's something to that well I've always had fantasies of being a farmer actually\nYou know me and now I Want to know more see a little too old and poor health\nTo do if I actually have some friends and uh one is in Georgia and not far she just came back from the blacks sustainability conference ... and I think her family had some land down in ... showed me this way back in the ... but she's thinking she's actually\nWorking towards clearing land and going back ... have another dear friend I Lived in Detroit I'm all for it then she moved about ten years ago the ski buck fifty seven acres of land\nOh my goodness and there's you know as an organic gardens and in fact some of these students from just ski after they had dismantled their agricultural program started going out to her farm\nWhere do you mean just to get his men of the the agricultural rumors that\nStuff and I think I had heard that one I thought maybe I'm wrong\nI mean I you know I'm I'm a ... man I'm OK worked out in the in the greenhouse let me I think you know agriculture is a result is a mainstay of agricultural science so that you love yes George Washington Carver money we don't we ... we always will play with that in ...\nRight well I Know they were coming out to her ... yeah well it's working\nI ... I ... I Would imagine so but you know but ... but are actually took the they do stuff with a with NASA and all kinds of food you know growing up during the ... really doing it in your health on against them but you're talking about talk about the seminal nations and the three major centers of more room when life\nYeah I'm picking up with a sister who called in about some of those states that was really a very large community\nNot it started out in the seventeenth century many people from the south Carolina and Georgia in fact they were actually got lucky\nAnd they spoke to a felon which\nThey had in life waiting in a mixtape from slave in under the British and coming in to Florida which was at that time control my Spanish right so the Spanish had given him asylum mhm and then when the British took control in later\nRight well the Spanish had given them an asylum ... but\nThen when the when the British to control and then later the Americans especially when the Americans came in\nUm they joined up infected treat started coming later by Seventeen thirty nine year with thousands of road rules living in Florida and later on by say the mid Eighteen century you get ... Indians who had broken away from\nThe ... creeks who wanted to assimilate and get the five civilized tribes there these group of ... did not want to simulate\nSo they come down in Florida and they join up with the rules who were there and together they formed this summer no nation\nThat one of the seminal confederation arbitrarily\nDo people that you want\nTo break away so it was formed with these two groups who made in life is the slave formerly enslaved Africans or more rooms\nAnd the uh indigenous ... people who came together in a confederation and like any confederation\nEach nation that belongs kind of has their own autonomy soldier civil normal rooms with the black someone knows if they will call you own sheets they had their own council of elders they had their own village even though it was side by side with the native someone else\nBut when it came to for example war where they really benefit at each other particularly in military uh with when they were fighting the the Europeans the British and does later the Americans\nAnd they fought three major wars right one begins and Eighteen sixteen or with the bombing of Fort negro alone the apple lot Appalachia\nWhich is really endangered now that storm is going to be shooting in the pan handle that was in the panhandle\nOh they move out a new\nEngaging the rule of warfare for a few years and then it kind of you know was quell the war but there was always the rule of warfare then the next major\nMeaning they will give you the business\nAbsolutely infect the Seminoles to thousands of American Soldiers\nAnd hundreds perhaps thousands they don't even know how many militia you know or a sharp sea just we'll just hired\nBy the army but they defeated and one or the battle battle in during the second civil war which begins in Eighteen Seventy five when Andrew Jackson begins the negro remove the first people to be removed\nWhether chopped off and then in the summer and all but the seminal because especially the black from or know knew that they came if they were had to remove removed they were going to be re enslaved right that's why\nThey were the fiercest fighters so thirty five they refuse to be moved in this was when the second some of the war started this is where they suffered major defeat Steven defeating Zachary Taylor who is the colonel at that time right wing who later becomes president that war lasted for seven years\nAnd then there was another one that it's a brown Eighteen fifty five there is a smaller\nOr war which they call the last summer when the war in St Louis because\nBy then many of the seminal did\nShe say this but they left home a territory because all of the authors on this book yeah not no not in my book I'm just kind of given you were you\nWhat's your toys you because all of this all this on this isn't a book\nYeah not no not in my book kind of giving you where you are you putting it all together and present but you're right the movement was talking about because we do have a book by its run on the black would not on the twenty right we go to and we we will talk about the to\nThe computer right there I got to bring us a call ... will be together this merger them by like the ... be blocked him a little bit okay alright alright of London\nOr that dot move your guy talking about some of those and how powerful people have been a what we can learn from our ancestors moved out to eat ...

were able to live for decades maybe for their entire life\nBut I think that again what we gain from the ... rules and not only that there was also a certain\nType of spiritual consciousness\nMhm uh a kind of almost like a mysticism write many of them are rules\nOr many of the nineteenth century inflamed Africans and those who were free as well had still had knowledge of the metaphysical systems that had come from Africa\nYes what I mean by metaphysical system I mean in the way the wave nobles defined it as the science of spirit yes so they know how to enter into the spirit world\nAnd they knew how to do a lot of things than the twenty century African Americans no longer had knowledge\nOr you know they could call for the power to amp up there we were to be sure do system or their their

could not touch them I don't know what they had going for them now and they make a big reasons like\nWe couldn't drained the swamp but they can drain the swamp down why couldn't they drained it thin right but there was something else happening same thing in Louisiana and we're going to have friends who had come to help people who practice\nAnd yeah no I'm Sorry I\nKnow your head but you know the Haitians they were they had already shown like people are on this ... or ... or the world how ...\nTo get free and what I learned about the Haitian Revolution and the whole idea of rule do because I Know we kind of think of it as religion and unfortunately today it's just almost use anonymously and sorcery yeah it was completely they needed it with some type of evil right what three\nUnfortunately today it's almost synonymous flea as sorcery\nConflated immediately with some type of evil right over three you know rather than a religion but it is a really dumb the religion\nOr should they they did do when it was more so than it was more of a metaphysical system\nAnd this mumble priest was telling me that\nIt during the Haitian Revolution or rude to was really a combination of fifty one different\nMetaphor physical systems ... fifty one different nations wow hope for example you would have to do a shanty ... the ... one of the Congolese to him\nAnd bring it
