its symptoms this idea of not of looking at oneself in not seen what is before them or is adding being you know wrapped up into this delusion\nOr that goes against reality and any kind of rational thought so you know man it's it's it's a sad situation oh but you also have to wonder though I'm about what she\nLearned from her her mother and her parents were in the\nS C I F R I touched a little bit of that or the concept of failed it jello before father died she was black\nRight I mean and I did I think that has a pocket because she said she thought that the white do who are momma was married to was a was a dad right and yeah he must be white because the white man was in her family exactly this is well\nDoctor so I Know you go get the\nThe ... the\n... of this ... this problem and I'm just lately here you go really breaking down\nAll right so appreciate your man appreciate your call because the mayor of\nI mean my expertise is in the area of psychology clinical psychology pastoral care pastoral counseling yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\nUh and\nThey're in in the in the DSM which I did look at I didn't find or\nAnything that correspond to directly to what this younger sister\nIs experiencing as I said the closest thing that I could find was just this thing a body body are just more fake disorder or ... and that's where one's\nBody or what part of one's body body is perceived to be flawed or in this case is appears to have a younger sister her name was treasure are perceived or skin to be logged\nClosest I've come for for you know to to seven zero three me I mean you get is hope would counseling and therapy and are just coming to an education you know\nEducation and and intense therapy or what I call a deep country ... she needs to learn some things and re learn some stuff that makes sense\nIn my view and but again it's\nGoing to require therapeutic individual let's go back to the last I see a brother to hot\n[laughter] hey Robert Lowery hey brother John how you feel good I don't know man holding on in their mind today you know I did you see a picture of this young lady I did beautiful blue line on assisted\nBeautiful your sister made a golf game instead of dogs rice can what what is she can be considered dark skinned about about about reflection\n... says to me\nA dark skinned we send a dog's rice game what what is she could be considered a dark skinned about about\nMuslims next maybe\n... maybe a little ... around between me and you're completely right Ronan are well let\nLet me say this because I haven't seen it so that's what I needed to know ... so she she talked about her skin and her looks being pretty yes right yes even though her skin and her looks look like me and you Yes sir\nYes do they all died as Florida some people we just need to write off or just let them have sixteen years old in America TV or Internet schools\nAll of a vast amount of information and contacts looking at a mother every day\nThis food have that\n... a a analysis you need to just be written out\nIn ... as I Know that that's the thing though is sixteen you'd think that I mean you know her brain and leave me feeling they're developing yet\nThough diamond louder yeah at sixteen years old\nIn the current environment and all of the information available\nRight mhm she needed Robin lie huh how do you need to ... to ...\n[laughter] if you remember that movie the ...\nWhen he was going to come and get to go and get your view negroes and rocket center coming in make I'm old enough to give more medical I'm\nGoing right or off now so that she won't become one of them all the people that's older that tells you have like an act like a good writer cause I mean some people are just what I mean she she has\nThat even Dr phil ... to my understanding of somebody told me Dr phil told her that they didn't want to in\nThe white race either really interested in the interview you know some are so so basically just brought her off you know what I mean she looked dark as me and you talk on this crazy we ain't got enough time to be dealing with that much like you know we got some other people we can help\nJust let up on them out of there and there's drop off at the next rallied at them guys have this in Virginia and you know what I mean that that that that talked about\nYou know how much they hate black people in age you just drop off in the middle of them and just walk in the middle of it I'm enjoying them and see how much love she get Louis numbers of ducking down we're going on that that's the best or not she needed\nBut let me just gotten out of jail you Doug Jones would [laughter] you know\nWe're we we will make it a little mistake I think and and you can you can count on the other side were confusing white people with white supremacy\nWhite supremacy is all evil all white people are not evil [noise]\nWhite supremacy is a mind set our construct\nThat ... what about um practice white supremacy\nUm and she is suffering from some type of psychological just order that causes her to be caught up in the delusion that she is white\nAnd I'm trying to wonder and figure out how that happens or is this year that her stepfather who died was white man\nAnd that he partially raised her along with her mother her mother is a black woman she seemed to be a a stable a black woman but\nObviously will she married a white man but that doesn't mean to she's unstable that just means that she has a choice that she made\nA but the impact that that had on her daughter is quite evident I think uh and I even think that there has to be some kind of trauma in their young ladies life besides the trauma that she described of\nOf moving from one neighborhood which she described as white and and healthy and led to another neighborhood that was black and\nUh and for her a incompatible match\nForty nine to two seven zero three is the number let's go to the lions and talk about how it is that this young sister comfortable either she is ... wife she's otherwise healthy\nHow old is that this young sister comfortable either she is white she's otherwise healthy what psychologically\nA man that's a ... one of the issue\nLet's go to the nines ICU rather Lucas baloney isn't you know\nAnd it could monitor the movement family do more to say is my understanding is that this young lady the sixteen year though Yes sir would it be fair to say that she's in the amber I stay up to ... minutes cause racism is concerned you\nKnow I don't think that would be fair I think that she's passed the embryonic stage oh she should have a grasp on reality oh where she occupies a wish he takes those spaces you ought to know how that system works where she is at age sixty\nOkay one would think that from idealistic standpoint but she's not alone and the way that she thinks\nThat how that might now that's that's ... that's true I Would imagine but still doesn't mean that it isn't your rent thinking\nCan we examine the totality of the reality at least making the ... the white girl she wanted to get a shot in a while to get a shot in a little no\nOne ever you don't want to give up being white though [laughter] you don't want to give up being white the rub\nShe don't want to get she don't want to give up the white but she was laying feel pain than she will go out in the sun when the sun to try and how it could turn up late\n... associate you one of the white matter or you want to be white\nAnd liberal they won't everything except the burden of being black okay\nWell the next [laughter] that could just lay on either side you felt that that they don't want to be black they'll come up I live in one of the what the results that must be but let me let me go safe\nNow\nWhite man that you know
