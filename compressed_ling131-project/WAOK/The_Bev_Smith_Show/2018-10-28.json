I guess another uh yeah I guess you hear a clip about an episode in the in the sole relationship between as they are in law\nAnd once again you see as their who has this idea of what it means to be I don't know a man or something and and you see how abuse if he is ... ... their their high school students that I mean\nCome on this mass can only but but but just just proliferate hey you left he was making a point about this whole business of where it'll mean get these ideas in these boys get these ideas high school that it's okay to to do this ... say well you you were making a point about that she\nWas showing the back of a second I'm it's tempting to\nAn understandable to focus on individual acts of aggression or violence against women\nAnd but we must see individuals act within broader context\nTo read best appreciated and to therefore think about what kind of prevention strategies we're going to employ and to make a difference context really matters\nAnd um my learning my understand in my experience says that this is about structured inequality right where the Republican about pay truck we're talking about the sexism ... within that sexism a dominant narrative is really a white male patriarchal notions of masculinity that\nBlack men many black men have internalized which include part of that instruction is the right to control and dominated women then quote unquote in that place mhm and so that notion of masculinity\nHas to be interrogated if we are to really make a difference with the young men were working with a college campus or in high school\nIf I had just one thing to do if I just had a few minutes to focus on a group of men and that's all I had that's where I Would go to interrogate where have you know their own notions of ... home and you were really resonating with this\nIs talk about that lately um\nI don't first of all I Want to state and fat actually that if a man abuses of woman he is wholly entirely responsible and accountable for his actions absolute here is at least unequivocal\nBut what I Would like to bring up something that a caller was possibly suggest an earlier caller was possibly suggesting towards earlier which is these things do not happen in a vacuum\nAnd he wanted to bring in Ray Rice\nI'm probably an unfortunate choice but but let me try to help them out a little bit with this example ray Rice's in a field where toxic masculinity if praised is not only praised he makes millions\nBased off the very idea of his physical strength his ability to conquer others on a field to take them down to be the strongest makes him the best\nI Am not surprised that this behavior does not end at the end of the field so I I ... in in no way am I saying anything he did was okay what I'm saying is that we have this very very pervasive\nUnderstanding in concept of masculinity but most of it is actually toxic or hyper masculinity were not being taught some even at a very young age\nMost of it is actually toxic or hyper masculinity were not being taught from even at a very young age what healthy masculinity or help the expressions of masculinity would be from\nThe very time when our boys may fall in cry and someone may think you know you're not a girl why are you crying like you're a week\nFrom that very moment when he's too or if he plays with adults\nOr if he wears a color that it's not consider masculine pink or if he's more interested in ballet and art than football and the basketball\nThese very I there is so pervasive that they actually start from the moment to a woman give birth to a child in the first thing they ask her which is what they asked me boy or girl\nThey need to know me ... how to start socializing that individual before that individuals even you know out in the world you know in a few seconds so I just wanted to bring back with the caller may have been trying to say about this if it bought a category and yes\nYes there's a lot of money to be made in perpetuating certain images of people he is not wrong to say that when black men are of status or in a famous position that their image is exploited either positively or negatively\nBut I think he missed the boat\nWhen he was trying to make Ray Rice the victim of that particular situation which you handle\nSo beautifully and what my my thing and I understand what what our previous caller was getting it in terms of tuna there are some larger systemic structural kinds of things that are in play however However I'm I'm always nervous when I said nervous I just don't I'm I'm\nI just don't like it I think it's too risky to try to totally you know blame somebody else for what what would I'm not going to put my hands on my wife and blamed the system for I had no business doing that you know and I mean personally personally I\nI have seen me beat their wives and and that's not a pretty sight you know I have seen me drunk beat their wives and their wives are running around with black guys and\n... and ... and and and makeup and whatnot that's not funny and and it's not something I think we should\nTake like but I Am convinced I'm convinced you less of that stuff starts early in life and I I think maybe when we see some of these brothers with isn't messed up notion about what it means to be a man in high school\nThat still gotta get nipped into books in high school\nOh it's it's the boy All right what what are the expectation that these\nGuys are male genitalia or rights particular colors you supposed to behave in a certain way if he if he veers away from those regions expectation there are consequences for him and said it gets very very very rigid very very early\nAnd it has again a lot of indications that the issue of violence against women as we discussed earlier\nWow wow sorry early let me let me go to the line I'm going to take a our friend Taylor hello tail you calling from Alabama [noise]\nTaylor Taylor going once hello hey man I was trying to get the how ya doing in Alabama\nI'm ... I'm In Nashville man I'm assuming that they're doing pretty good down now all\nGood you up to Nashville okay that's good what's happened to tailor\nWell I uh something came to my mind about what you're thinking about all of them turn TV [noise] okay [noise]\nAll right tell you would come home type setting up to an understanding how old were you in the seventies or depends\nOn which part of the seventies I Love Nineteen Seventy hours seven going on eight\nOkay unlike in reference to well in the fall I make this reference you have a gift it though and I have to guess to guess which one handed it or has a British accent\nYeah that's that's you less the diagnoses from the Caribbean you like to tell everybody what are you from there but I Love your accent\nType ... I'm from saint kits not only that by the way I'm throws a saint kits both both from the Caribbean\nNo telling where you from originally from New York that I Am here in Atlanta\nOkay well the reason I asked Bennett is the gentleman from the Caribbean or give British by your voice I get rich by your veins\nLand says\nOkay well the reason I asked Bennett is the gentleman from the Caribbean or give British by your voice you British by your veins\nI Am not British [laughter] well ...\nIs your accent originating from\nEnglish shaming the let me make\nThis point about running a minute this is very important in reference to the queen's English of Victoria Queen Victoria my roots are ... on my father's side so I'm just asking a question that's all\nI get there but we're talking about violence not okay but now and to make the point I'm making about ... and that's why I Want to hear the end the\nBook by SARS Ali this book came out in the seventies when I first saw it on the down in Houston\nThe people who read it they put on the air that uh well no Donahue grabbed a part in the book that said that the black man or the ... the black woman or something I hit the black woman\nAnd that is what went out on the television in the seventies everybody had grabbed that and was making reference to that point in reference to violence\nAnd I interviewed several people in Africa from Africa that will never been over there and he said that in Africa it expands on the age when they marry or more than one woman or something like that that he's still have the authority to quit her\nAnd this is when a lot of people are are jumped on ... talking about there because of the way Donahue put that on the air\nAnd so I wanted to speak from that perspective and being in Atlanta that was a lady from America where\nWere they were sprayed with that that men have the right to where women when I was\nSpeaking culturally speaking different coaches here I'm not speaking about yeah I'm just making the point about what I experienced a reference to that book and how different parts of it was punching two came out but the the other point\nIs yeah see my words for a minute and when you cut me off it causes me to lose my thought I see my words person hear them second now uh but the point about what I was making with his point was in ... in Atlanta one of my doctors\nUs from Nigeria and he said something that told me he started there was one time an African American woman in Nigeria and she saw this man whipping his wife or something so she called the police\nAnd when the police got there and found out what the story was he started they started weeping woman to now I'm not in Dallas and a woman being equipped to anything like that but I'm just making a point to show both sides now this is the other point and I think our mission\nWas on the ... or say what's the idea that this is what's coming what's come\nOkay here I mean give it to you let me bring it okay I learned to talk my listening to the way women learn to talk because\nI'm the youngest son on the four girls and I respond to sound and most men do not know how to interpret their women sounds so therefore he polls are he becomes impact\nAnd I say no but I mean isn't this what I Want you to do I'm ... I Want you to tell me about this issue of young ... was beaten up women I Want you to focus on that can go right to that didn't go right to do that but I Want you to do this\nSometimes is a curse in

children into where if you have him that when it was a woman becomes a mother\nAnd she doesn't have time for herself and she doesn't have\nTime to read they are going to rip down and when women get
