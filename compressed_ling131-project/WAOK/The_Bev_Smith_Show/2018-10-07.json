for the first time that we've been thinking about it we'd been anticipated get we are surrounded\nBy orange admiral mood strikes orange striped up and down the stadium and sixty five thousand here Ryan Harris and I don't know if they've been in the stadium where thirty five but it's for the game it was Ninety five percent for\nEvery body across the nation has been anticipating this game ball and fantastic where you actually arrive at the stadium and feel that anticipation it's been years you and I were done on the field you could feel it two hours ago walking through the parking lot the nation is ready for this ...\nAnd the Notre Dame Buddy Guy we spoke ball team they've been preparing for it all we get ready for the kind of noise\nThat is true they're going to be surrounded by for the next three and a half hours Eighteen minutes and thirty five seconds to tell kicked off\nI mean the noise the kind of atmosphere they're going to be surrounded by and for the next three and a half hours Eighteen minutes and thirty five seconds to tell kicked off right now and will be with you until that time but sort of a field jak don't want the third number of our team jak your practice all week it you know very\nWell specifically how his team got ready for what's waiting for them to not\nAll week long Notre Dame was listening to enter sandman the theme song that they play here when the whole he's entered the field they were listening to the crowd screams go ... go hokey they had it up\nTo a hundred and Fifteen decibels I'm told that the same level as an emergency vehicles siren\nI was there every day it was so loud by day too I was wearing airport so they are ready but the pomp and circumstance guys you're looking at the field\nThe Virginia tech ... that says on the field now I didn't know they had one they have their own band and then the real the official the non military marching band will come out\nThe pageantry here right now it looks like an Army Navy game so\nProbably one of the reasons why this place has already passed\nSeventeen minutes thirty five seconds down until kicked off jacket ride you and I walked down to the field before the game like\nWe always do and I wasn't really surprised to see actually it's real grass depict her real grass dry grass\nTo ah for for those of you who are watching at home as well it was raining\nVery heavily here up until about forty five minutes ago and that's one of the things I was looking at going down on the field also no benefit to kind of take it back up what the jak saying we talked to coach Kelley even he was kind of said he ... he was happy to get away from the noise that practice they were practicing so much but a great field great atmosphere this is why you play at Notre Dame Brian\nKelly was the head coach alone with his thoughts of fifty yard line and so we started to ever get over it started up a conversation I thought he was ... you could build intensity but also very comedy explain to us and he said I have so much confidence this team knows how to win in any environment makes you feel good when you end up in an environment like that\nYeah and he's done things we talked about it you know different things throwing water on the ball or during practice in training camp taking the ball out making all the ... the soccer ball he's trained this team for chaos and one of the big things that he talked about coming into the season coach Kelley\nWas a he wanted his team to dictate enter enter create in these games not react and I think you're going to see the fruits of that labor here tonight\nBecause like so many teams right now that they make it through September guess Notre Dame five and all but dealing with some injuries it's part of the deal at this point of the season especially up run all the offensive line we saw what happened\nUnfortunately last weekend of the Stanford went to captain and starting left or down which bars out for the rest of the season injured knee incomes Trevor ruined ...\nPlayed in fourteen games already has some great action in some big time wins this season to what I like it says nastiness his toughness his balance and I was talking with Sam must've heard before the game and he is confident in all with all get out\nThat tremor can do the job that he's a part of the unit he said they really seen him as a part of the unit all year so we so yes terrible didn't lose Alex bars of big strong guy with great leadership but several ends up to the task\nBubble nicer Ryan Harris jak do with all the field Fifteen minutes and thirty seconds until these six rank fighting Irish played for the first time against or for the first time at\nVirginia Tech jak unfortunately it let's keep it where the injury theme and we knew about Alex bars all week a bit of a surprise though the center for the Notre Dame decent\nAbsolutely jailing have suffered a shoulder stinger against Stanford he was that practice\nThis week but he didn't do a lot did not make the trip they did not announcing every but it was good fun for me this morning so he will not be here so I get afraid you're hearing a lot around the Saturday he didn't he\nThey did not announce the injury but it was good for me this morning so he will not be here so I get a free you're hearing a lot around the center they didn't hear much last year for part of coach Kelley philosophy that man in they've had some tea injuries there may be more to come true they are bringing back that philosophy in that mindset everybody's\nGot to be ready to step up and that will prove to be the case again here tonight\nJak as we've seen some growing up in September to make it very well heading into aren't over a perfect father do it's evolved and a lot of ways but one thing that stayed the same jobs have been able to get pressure on the quarterback a lotta times relentless pressure of a quarterback with only for Russia's\nI wondered if that changes without saying like hey\nI really don't think it will join a war of the name we called a lot and the Stanford game he's been her dressing all season long a tremendous tremendous with his hands I was watching them here on the field before the game working specifically on the hands other guys I started to do that ... in the NFL the markets where that's what\nThey did fourteen minutes left until kicked off the national

Nineteen gators and then a twenty five yard ticks six from rats door locked it up it was a twenty seven Nineteen final four the gators and indeed one hundred and Thirteen meaning of the red river

a program or or get with someone that's already in place\nYou know because that's a whole nother hold another issue I mean it's part of it they're like you can relate everything to domestic violence you know somebody lost their job and it was not acting doing their job right but you don't know that they didn't beat up at home so\nIt's related subjects related but it's its own thinning and can be built up or ... you know make an impact on the community if you drive or passion he could make a change in a community in our world\nWow thank you Dr roads for that I I really appreciate you offering that I'd also like to add that it would be helpful\nFor\nPrevious caller and those who may have some frustration\nIt would be helpful\nOr for the previous caller and those who may have some frustration with understanding anything about a intimate partner violence to look at uh the statistics are but I Would push\nTo go a little further and that is to really start to be more observant uh it's very difficult to\nTo know what's going on in relationships and know what's going on but I think if we're more observant in terms of patterns of behavior in terms of persons who are being isolated\nPersons who are\nSeem to be hypersensitive in terms of touch noise\nAll kinds of experiences I think that we will begin to see that it is much more prevalent intimate partner violence is much more prevalent than we realize but I think that's one of the things that we have to do it's a reckoning of recognizing that it really is prevalent\nIn our communities and not a bout shaming and blaming the person who has been abuse but I also want to add that we must understand that intimate partner violence is about control and pow\nWow I Want to go through the lens we have several calls for for ... you know to to seven zero hurry I'm going to Beverly Beverly hello\nBeverly Beverly\nBeverly are you there I Am good I can hear you know I couldn't hear you at first I thought I had a had a bad connection how you doing I'm good and yourself good good as you are you a first time caller I Am polo polo don't move don't move I guess I'm for you I guess on for what we got a ah\nYeah\nAre you going [noise]\nDo you go back and forth to to show that you go Beverly thank you so much for calling us yes what's going on what's on your mind\nYou know what I just wanted to give some some information on domestic violence the Atlantic called in earlier I don't know whether he was involved in a domestic violence at first he was the aggressor himself I'm just not sure but as for me and the reason I Am calling because I was listening to the broadcast\nAnd what I did want young women from real life fifty percent of women\nWere killed when God sixty five percent of why for intimate partner of the KIPP sixty five percent and black women were more likely to die is likely to be murdered by men in white women\nWow I Am too I Am a survivor of domestic violence and so I understand that clearly I was reporting to a job five days a week\nIn law enforcement\nSo the same woman I was bringing in had the same story of domestic violence I mean no one to them ... I was at St ... them I could have been the president I could've ended up in prison jets my doctoral Fox and one thing about domestic violence\nYeah they get into molds\nYou mhm Mm and if you don't have enough self esteem to say I can make it without you you're subject to states people actually all the time well why did you say I didn't have the answer for that because I didn't know anything\nWithout you you're subject to stage people ask me all the time well why did you say I didn't have any answers for that because I didn't know any better it was deep strict and security and then sometime when you're young you think is cute when somebody's oh they're so jealous\nAnd then those pushes begin show us in those shows begins flaps and most sweats begins don't then they'll start with those stones or like on next time I'll pull a gun on\nMine was like you leave me I'm going to kill you and I'm a kill the kids too but remember\nI'm going to work every day working in a prison seeing young women coming in\nWith a case of domestic violence doing like doctor what was part of what Dr Ro spark a failed to tell you\nWhen she was convicted in San Bernardino county she was looking at twenty seven years with the nails\nEvery day she continued to say I'm I'm I'm packing must do this president is is it for me I'm not I'm not going to be here I'm going home she trust that\nAs it was an open door policy during the life\nWith no possibility but I was one of those Dr rose Parker was one of those ... except for I work on the other side I was going home every night\nAnd inmates they're real keen on something going on I remember\nGoing to go on to work one morning he hit me and my and he broke my nose I had the call and go to the hospital and find out my nose the book and when I came to work I was wearing shades and one of the inmates she was looking and she was look as she said don't do that she said you don't want to come here where I Am\nShe came back from calling airy and she bought me some potato she said put things on your eyes\nBut this is a place that you want to be had I contemplated yes that's how come I tell everyone anybody can go to prison if you're pushed enough but I thank God for great because he was around in the Bush and it was her when she brought meat potatoes and she said don't do that\nYou don't want to end up where I Am and I had everything to lose and my biggest loss would have been my base so domestic violence\nIt's still happening and it's still happening in numbers black women or two times more likely to be murdered than their white counterparts mhm so that tells me what do we do now what do we say now how can we say it\nBecause if they get especially in in places like Las Vegas\nDomestic violence is is a huge epidemic in Las\nVegas Nevada wow it's a huge epidemic and warned say well what\nWhat do we do where do we go\nI have I have two daughters and three granddaughters have I told him about my story of course could it hadn't been me of course anybody can go to prison it doesn't mean they're less then\nExcept for the long damn were so different they didn't look at anything and they didn't look at a rose Parker she got beat up they didn't look at what was part of it she got me now they didn't look at rose Parker that this man she got her addicted to drugs they didn't look at that they just looked at the fact\nThat she shot somebody she killed him and she said she did it and they were given her twenty twenty five with the nails\nWill live team and she was released Beverly thank\nYou you have you have really really shared with us and I appreciate your comments and clearly the book beat up deep down a still stand in the rules Parker's story is worth\nIs worth of serious read Beverly thanks

before\nI learn how to talk by listening to the way my mother taught in the sisters were listening to the way my mother talked to me\nThey learn how to deceive and use different tones into nations in all of this I learnt that so what I'm simply saying that they won't give me the time to explain this on the radio but bloated brothers nice to hear this\nThey'd been ridiculed I was affected into first grade and in and grow up dealing with the being it masked elated not even knowing how to put it into words\nIt took me from Nineteen sixty one the Nineteen Ninety two\nTo work my way through

to Philips of prison\n\nThan it is using some of my research about males verbally abused by females and he's helping the man to put it is helping the man to see on the paper and put in to explain to the capital into whatever what they are not able to put into words and this is why\nI Am having the women in my family a risk that\nThis is why I ran for the presidency of the national council of negro women in Atlanta in Nineteen Ninety two and change my name and I talked to Dr Dorothy Height about this because I said I'm not going to be no slave to which have already been a slave when my father died in Nineteen Seventy ...\nAt all I took my father like what themselves the Dell\nTried to please them but it's not one sided and all the women Dr Bennett\nOlder women will tell you that it ain't one side but\nWhen you go thank you thank you so much for what you're saying because if you are listening earlier I did report yeah\nNot only one out of three women would be abused but one out
