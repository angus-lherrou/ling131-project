I have to I really have to let you expand upon that and the reason being is because I Am one of those I've got the old unit\nReally have to let you expand upon that and the reason being is because I Am one of those I've got the old unit\nSo I promise you might HVAC guy ... goes to great lengths to get me that old freon right if you're going to say about that please a little bit so that the people out there who own these older a little bit older homes what is it ten twelve years ... years okay or yes ma'am oh talk about that so they know what that is okay\nBased on the ... ranks all homes that are ten years or older that has a are twenty two freon system needs to be replaced based on the damage that's been done globally who the ozone layer\nOf this was brought up Rob brought about by the Montreal Protocol where the country's across across the country came together and discuss the damage that was that was happening globally with the chemicals that were being released the atmospheric ozone layer and dumped the nails on their\nSee I didn't know that right that do really good writer was major so you if you look at the number\nOf residential houses the number apartment complexes that I'm a commercial office buildings grocery stores restaurants across the world that has refrigeration systems that have traditionally been using free on the damage that's been done globally to the ozone layer has been tremendous tremendous and very dangerous for the economy\nSo this applies to even commercial\nResidential commercial industrial the entire game but\nThat crazy okay so you don't do you have a period of time that you have to change is out or is it just a phase out\nIs is a phase out in the face of goes into effect January twenty twenty okay January twenty twenty and our company we entered into a partnership with George power four years ago mhm uh we're probably Seventy thousand postcards to homeowners informing them up this upcoming phase out\nA note virtue that we realize that\nWe needed to go into what we call the educational mode yes to teach homeowners and informed them that if your system is ten years or older or if it's non functional were outdated or there now is a time for you to consider a changing out from a freon based system the what's known as our four to in a system\nAnd that's that's amazing and let me tell you why because the truth is I promise you Mr park's if I got that postcard in the mail I Would say up among trying to sell something that I Would go so education is key because that personally affects me yes I Need to get mine out of there and I've had that wing over my head for about a year year and a half\nEver since I've had to have it service and you know new free on it and I had my guys this young guy who's just started out and he's like you're gonna I'm having a hard time it's expensive right the old free on now\nRight right ... years is three four times as much because we're going towards the end of the phase out right so a number of contractors they're specialized more so in terms of a freon as opposed to service\nBecause there's so much money and that right now can make a dynamite exactly oh my God right\nRight so we but we are more so on the edge as an educational side mhm and informing homeowners about the change out and how you can really save money by by changing our systems now because of the money you save\nA ... on on the on on this on these new systems for instance if you average of twenty euro system you're losing probably sixty cents on the dollar in\nTerms of energy efficiency really ugly sixty\nSomething that I was talking to my my my cousin last night and we we brought him on board right oh change either system he lives in southwest Atlanta\nAre all homeless paid for a systems wouldn't homes for twenty five years and ah he just didn't want to change up and I said not but we talk to him was this older system is what we call up a a sewer system cold right now Mary starts at fourteen seer for for for ... for energy is in ... okay so he ...\nSystem is what we call a uh a sewer system cold right now Mary starts at fourteen seer for for for for energies in energy for ... okay so he was really behind the eight ball in fact the system that he has in his own better we make ... anymore\nSo ah you know by virtue of upgrading to a new energy for his vision system the money that he's going to say one of his utility bill will pay for the call the monthly payments words new society we are this is a critical\nThat's crazy yeah you know the truth is is that when you and I'm so thankful that you're here to talk about this because I'm really thankful that you bring education and information to it that your partner with W lay okay to bring the listeners right real truth and real information about things like that\nBecause I always when someone's trying to tell me about this I promise you miss ... I have that little ... I like okay you're trying to sell me something and if that really true\nWell there's not really are trying to sell you something we're ... we're providing more social service or more so that you really critically need yeah to upgrade your property and also increase your property value and improve the quality of life\nCompanies out there that have HVAC system you partnered with good men to bring I think a deal now\nBefore the show I said well okay what about ... what is the other one's brain drain Brian carrier right that you gave me a really interesting statistic that I didn't know about good man you want to share that\nA good man has a forty seven percent of the market share in the metro Atlanta market that is mind boggling grimy right and that that's that's\n... it's because of their Ford ability in pricing or the number of contractors that's that ... that that provide their product and easy assess the bull parts should there be a problem based on the tonight and emerge Wharton executive\nThat's like buying an American made car so you can get [laughter]\nExactly [laughter] didn't get has a ten year manufacture warning imports oh wow what the system so\nAnd also being it is an American based company based in in in Houston, Texas a is easy you know ... it's almost like having\nUniversal parts marry my if you need something to change out for parts you could go to the park than twenty four hours it could be a the ... the contractor can ordered it can be a within a distributorships applied house within twenty four hours\nThat's amazing that was interesting about that ... they put this in context they have forty percent forty seven percent Shia that's almost fifty percent so everybody else has to divide up the rat you've actually you've definitely right alright talk about\nThe installation talk about the program that you have going on to plan that you've laid out for everybody so that they can make it affordable\nIs what we've done we've hit that we've put a threshold of of selling five thousand systems right mhm so we're we're considered it up a premium distributor in the ... letter market\nIn with that comes some of some muscle if you will a whereby we we get calls on the red color from finance companies wanting us to use your pharmacy product\nIn and we tell them we're we're still and we're still working with homeowners that are recovering from the housing recession of away exactly right and and and we let them know that how this has impacted certain ethnic groups across the metro area\nEighty five Ninety percent of our clients are female homeowners\nWow any ... or more you know and that shocked as we did we did a partnership with ... in ... county on the local community newspapers and I'm within six weeks we sold over four hundred systems\nAnd we were in an in eighty five percent as as I mentioned were female homeowners in in ... county\nIn from that point on we realize that we need to take this message across\nTo a broader to a broader listening audience right so we started advertising on Sunday Morning phrase with ... ... and uh uh Eric Eric ah Freeman who was our rip mhm he showed us how we how we should ever gator proper a platform to use a W A L K as well right so we\nWe we decided we needed to focus more so on advertising and we called the grassroots level maybe we'll yes just entering the message about the phase out and the number of systems that were installing in the metro Atlanta area the entire metropolitan area for a home for FEMA homeowners now a lot of our homeowner's\nOr through this new will be caught up on this call him a moderate financing program easy pay we're homeowners will be called up with a moderate credit score or ... or a five thirty six\nA moderate financing program easy pay we're homeowners what we call it with a moderate credit score or ... or a five thirty\nSix twenty oh yeah that that can can receive financing\nWill be what we call this marry or F ha program yeah no I had it sounds like we try we try to stick close to the average a guidelines where you you typically for the qualify for every ... every day alone is a five eighty ... eighty hit in the door so we figured that we needed to be within the same platform\nTo provide a Tracy financing to our clients now in energy industry standards says that\nOn anything under six forty is considered poor credit\nNow we tell them look we we were dealing with a number of homeowners as I mentioned that are still recovering from the housing recession we'll wait so we're talking about homeowners who may have been making sixty Seventy eighty thousand dollars\nBut now they've been bumped down to forty thousand dollars exactly right and that's our market that's our market that's our that's our sweet spot so to say mhm so being that this is a national phase out\nWe had to make sure that we had a a financing platform financing model that weakest sail towards your towards ... towards Republican or an art viewing audience so\nWe talked a multiple climb as they were ... muscle finance companies ever causes said well Mr Brooks we can provide you this week abroad you that I says well we can't afford to pay thirty thirty five forty percent interest rates are these broad\nNo no no no we're just like the thing died right right right right so\nWe told them ideally will be like to do is that the financing product that base the look taken effect the homeowners utility bill payment\nTheir electric bill payment the gas bill payment into water bill payment\nAnd lift up on the ship and their whole if they've been in the home five years or longer we call them lifers in the industry ... number one they're home maybe upside down in terms of their mortgage so they're not going to go any place because of that fact alone\nAnd now their income is increasing whereby they can afford to do so well because some home maintenance products right and so the debt your income ratio that they have it it it allows them to have to purchase systems\nNow something very unique about the metro Atlanta area that we forget sometimes\nThe metro Atlanta area has the largest African American homeownership rate in the country oh wow the Seventeen counties that comprise it mentioned on an area is the largest African American homeless you're breaking the country you can't go any place else in the country or in the world can see the home ownership rate did you see an image from that area\nAnd with that comes the largest need for home improvement products as well home improvement financing mhm HVAC leading ... the number one leader in that in the platform so\nWe were we we we fought tooth and nail to for now\nTrying to find the best financing platform for our clients\nWho needed to upgrade rates racist system HVAC systems over ten years older and it would be impacted by this phase out\nSo we're to companies step up and they said well they said Percy we will give your company enough money to do twelve thousand installations\nThroughout the Richmond area so quite naturally we can't do that by herself so we said we're gonna we're gonna partner with other contractors they may have clients in in the city of Atlanta like Sonia East Point College Park Suffolk County Stone Mountain\nClayton County ... contractors ... homeowners that have been they've been used to working with their contractors in the past and they they have that that camaraderie if you will we can we can provide that contract with financing right to do your installation and we can count there towards our numbers in the ... grand scheme of things\nTo be clear threshold is twelve thousand for this for this for this one here okay cool right cook on hold you over the next ... that or take a break and let me come back on one type it into a kick you Larry sure an installation and financing thank you thank you very much for for eight and I just I mean there are three important
