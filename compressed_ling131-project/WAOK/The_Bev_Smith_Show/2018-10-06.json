I don't know where to begin with you but let's begin at the beginning you being the commissioner of discovers now in your six year how do you describe being the\nCommissioner Lucio dough boy\nOh my gosh it's um I Can't believe it's the fix the event and um the six year and it and um it's been exhilarating\nIf they're challenging its fan I'm a progressive it's thin [noise]\nI don't know it's been all kinds of emotions I've been up and down in a good way you know it's sad to have a way I came in to a situation\nWhere they're needed to be some changes um and they happened pretty quickly\nUm and I think we've grown so fast like the devil a is just continues to evolve and it's really fun to be a part of an organization that has so much history in value not just to this community ... of our member institutions but in the country\nWhere you are the person who has your ... your heart because your regret who wrote institution but it will lose your double a member of the time and have university talking about your experiences as an undergraduate and do the pride that brings you have in their position now did you ever see yourself wanting to be in this because\nI did but it was later on you know I think when you're in college and you know you my undergraduate psychology and then I went and got my masters for management\nAnd I'm not sure that I knew a commissioner really was I mean you know you you know that you want to work in sports are have that opportunity but there's so many um opportunities in athletics um from compliance cocaine\nAnd academic professional um to the Olympics and so they had the opportunity\nIts legs I'm from compliance to coaching\nA to academic to professional um to the Olympics and so they have the opportunity to to work in college athletics has been the fit for me and my coach at Hampton really encouraged me I think he tried to encourage women um us to stay in athletics\nBecause there's just such a shortage of women particularly a African American women\nWho are in the field and I think he kind of pushed me to stay in athletics and go get my masters and\nI'm I'm Glad that I went to ... and it was probably the best\nExperience ever for me collegiate experience I can tell you like most of us should go and your freshman year and a little home sick and you might hear you trying to party a little bit too much particularly at age VCU\nUm but reality sets in when the midterm grades come in and your coaches\n[laughter]\nThat you about to go home if you don't get it together and so you know I I was an athlete undercoat sweat who then went to Norfolk but I've stayed in Hampton I didn't want to transfer cause Hampton was my choice of this petition and\nHad a great collegiate experience I'm even as you know the idea of a lay what's that met in college um I had no clue what being the all conference all tournament all player player the year with that really looked like until now I look back and be like that was a huge um opportunity for me to play us to sports that I Love but then\nEven to have this success and then take that success and be in this position as commissioner so it's\nKind of surreal um to kind of watch our athletes and understand that I had the opportunity to play the game but then use the platform I'm to grow you know um academically athletically but also as an administrator to be in this role in position it's pretty cool\nNow commissioner you are the first African American female ever hold the position I'm sure that was monumental for you as well\n[noise] you know Russia I ... I don't think I ever thought about it until people start communicating it like you were the you're the first um 'cause I definitely don't ever want to be the last\nUm I'd love to see more women\nParticular African American women um be commissioners and it's not an easy opportunity to access to as has been fortunate to be under some great mentors um to have some great opportunities for repair me for the position and so I definitely you know it's\nI don't know it's an honor to legacy in my family you know for my daughter to see me in this roller other girls and women or even men to see me and the roles and and have the desire to figure out how how did I get it\nUm as early as this weekend and older gentleman at the Virginia union games that how did you like\nHow does this look like for you you know how did you get here and to give him you know an elevator pitch and he was like wow you have to tell more people about their story and so I just feel blessed and extremely honor to be in this rural and have the opportunity\nTo use this platform to demonstrate my passion for athletics college athletics\nUm but also find ways to bring other people along\nIf you're just joining us we're talking to the Seattle a commissioner Jackie Williams now you were recently inducted into the Hampton University athletic hall of fame has been this summer actually\nWere being more athlete in basketball volleyball which he talked about a little bit but receiving this honor being inducted into the hall of fame\nAnd just describe your emotions when you found out in the going through that ceremony\nWow so you can make me cry this early in the morning\n... just describe your emotions when you found out in name only through their money\nWhile they're going to make me cry this early in the morning I'm you know I got the letter from the athletic director Jane who's also a dear colleague and\nI think I just stared at it and I'm like oh and I didn't even tell anybody for a minute my daughter was with me and I said I'm In the hall of fame and um and I kind of held it to myself and then I've shared it with a couple of my best friends and um I don't think I really and I got that letter like\nEarly in the year and um you know I think when I got there and I saw you know so many other athletes that almost was like\nYou know and my worthy and one of my um football players ah ah Richard Taylor he was a senior when I was a freshman always or junior he always took care of me like the big brother him and his wife\nHave been so encouraging to me since I've been here and what he said to me um before the ceremony walk into your blessings you deserve this and it was in that moment when I was like okay this is it's okay it's okay to receive this honor because\nHonestly I just want to do great work and be a great person and to serve and be my best every day and I'm not looking to be honored for something I Know I should be doing any ways and so to get the honor was extremely humbling still humbling I'm and I'm thankful I'm thankful that Hampton\nSees me in that light and that I could represent them every single day I'm In a way that would please them or make them proud you know that I'm a Hampton graduate as I Am proud that had been a member of or be an alumnus of Hampton\nRoutes would go to ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... to ... to ... do exposure for your for your call proof or talk about some things are you doing you know the rich and ... ...\nWe um so we were ending our five years strategic plan um it is and twenty twenty or my board approved it back and Fifteen and that was huge for us we've been really focus on managing expectations in areas are finance but the exposure foreign student athletes whether it's championship experience\nWhether it's leadership development programs academic success\nUm and so those areas have been extremely important to us but finding key partners to help us\nHas also been critical we hired or a armed partnership with liquid so who are out of Atlanta minority owned company\nI'm an eighth VCU grad Tyrone Whitley is the I'm the CEO of the company we went in partnership with them to really help us identify new ways of exposing\nOur conference throughout the year living the legacy is one of our new brand names um to complement see I Believe for life\nAnd get engaging our students in that way has been important from our two aptly advisory committee on all the way to our ministry leaders um you know Under Armour as our new a brand of choice for uniforms\nThat we've explored that will be offering um this spring this fall\nI'm beginning in November So discounts I'm some opportunities with hotel reductions on that so I think we're trying to get creative to engage more people in the building the reality is\nIs that you know people want to be a part of the atmosphere and part of the ... not necessarily the game's not necessarily the fan says they just want to reunite um but we're always looking for ways if there is a hundred and forty thousand people in the city of Charlotte\nThen why isn't there ten thousands of twenty thousand people trying to get into the building and so that is a constant um challenge that we have to work on and it's not just start then you know every conference has have these type of issues that they have to work on annually based on\nUm their conference and their member institutions but see I definitely is a pretty unique footprint that gives us a little bit more challenges I think there's some other conferences\nWell I Know I'm not yeah doubling mom my can I throw in my in my opinion you get you to come in ... ... ... ...\nWe do you know Atlanta the summit of bed at this point so you know it's it's we put it out there for all hosts cities and so you know it's really up to the city to determine if that if that opportunity for them to host is ...\nOh it's it's we put it out there for all hosts cities and so you know it's really up to the city to determine if that if that opportunity for them to host is worse\nUm see I Believe being in Atlanta I think the challenge for us with Atlanta is just the footprint nine eight of our schools are in Charlotte North Carolina\nWe have two schools in Virginia we have one in Maryland won in Pennsylvania so when you go to Atlanta you kinda spreading the footprint a little bit further so that discussion with the board would have to be you know extremely what would be the offerings to pull 'em most of our members more south than what we are currently are here in Charlotte\n... more than ... to ... to me they're probably open book Columbia most boys get\nA class Lynne is work scientists have class Lynne and our conference I mean they are ready to go I mean um July one was their entry point into the ... devil lay their alumni is strong the school is strong\nUm they're great template for um what they do in their athletic program um their president's involvement and so our board and our member conferences very excited about having them and again there in South Carolina so that does open up a new footprint for\nOur member institutions to look at championships I'm In their area\nMoved from Tom ... commissioner of who drew you to go to a political ... we just talked about a new member coming into the gum from ... or talk about ... ... a new member\n... to ... for your conference in both of you as you were to recoup your alma mater ... joined the Congress ... were the only one in the big ... in the lord\nNot at all show on university is currently a member of our conference are actually moving out next year I'm expanded their sports platforms in a lot of the sports that they are now offering like lacrosse and field hockey hockey and soccer\nUm we don't offer that is so you know I think what what institutions look for is a place that fits for their sports programs are academic programs and whether in Asia VCU or not\nUm you know the conference has to determine do they bring value um add on to the conference and social won has been a member of probably over twelve or Thirteen Years or or maybe a little longer the devil a veil ... football in our conference and also women's bowling\nI'm prior to class and getting in our conference had a policy that you had to have football\nUm in order to be a member of our conference class one doesn't have football a year and a half ago the conversation with our board became do we want to strap ourselves with not being able to expand by having are requiring member institutions\nWho may not want football because of the um the cost of football but have all other programs and maybe even more that we don't offer that may benefit the conference\nAnd so once they made that decision and open up the door to evaluate other member institutions who could fit our platform and who can be a member of the CIA devil lay about four years ago we did a feasibility study\nOn and part of that feasibility study listed evaluate expansion for the Congress and what schools particularly could fit into the the devil a based on where we're located from division one to any I ate and division two or schools or division three who could move up to division to a class when fits a platform\nIt from a division want any I ate a division two or schools or division three who can move up to division to a class it's a platform for it they had an interest to come to the CIA LA um but again we had a policy that wouldn't allow them to come in once that policy change there was more dialogue from them\nAbout their interest than being a member of the devil a and so here they are um ... at this point you know we have Thirteen schools should want to leave out next year so we'll have twelve again we're constantly looking at associate members um we would like to bring that baseball in men's tennis\nAnd identify schools not maybe as full members but associate members that can help us bring those too for that so

uh for example a in South Carolina you know they I think they make good like your SUVs you know\nSo uh yeah I mean that definitely ... a shape some time but if you're ordering like an M series which is going to get built in Germany\nOr you know then obviously that's going to have a a little longer effect you know 'cause they going to put this on a boat and it's going to come across the ocean so

for the maintenance for the vehicle because it's out I heard you say that you know everybody standing maintenance playing it's actually had pretty much had the partying care from for the for you for ownership could you be more descriptive word which meant by that again\nOh yeah well okay so\nUh if you do the extended maintenance plan um it actually will upgrade you from just the basic which covers like all the maintenance required to fulfill your warranty\nBut it'll give you the the little extras that you know to maintain your vehicle that maybe are not really ... fall into the uh you know the warranty maintenance so for example like I'm\nNot only will they extend the time and the miles but things like you know your windshield wipers or or ... or a brake pads which are normally not ever recovered by any kind of maintenance program\nOr those things will actually be covered so it's kind of like a total ownership experience like you know anything that goes wrong with your car you can pull right up into the service drive your hand your keys to them they're going to fix it or if it's an extended period of time of course they'll give you a loan or car\nUm and when you go in your

standing maintenance plan is simply have pretty much had the cart taking care of them for the for you for ownership you'd you'd be more descriptive what what you meant by that again\nOh yeah well okay so\nUh if you do the extended maintenance plan um it actually will upgrade you from just the basic which covers like all the maintenance required to fulfill your warranty\nBut it'll give you the the little extras that you know to maintain your vehicle that maybe are not really to fall into the uh you know the warranty maintenance so for example like I'm\nNot only will they extend the time and the miles but things like you know your windshield wipers or or ... or a brake pads which are normally not recovered by any kind of maintenance program\nOr those things will actually be covered so it's kind of like a total ownership experience like you know anything that goes wrong with your car\nYou can pull right up into the service Dr ... they're going to fix it or if it's an extended period of time of course they'll give you a loan or car um and when you go in your cars or repaired you know you just take your car up and there's no bill\nSo it's a it's a it's a great program\nOkay and Simone

up this women women and machine there during the event and pulled apart in La Crosse tomorrow and she's going to share a little bit about what she's going to be doing about female mechanics are going to be there to teach you\nObviously who you're competing for that starting job and you knew branded was a class ahead of you in any school of this nature is going to have quality quarterbacks but a lot of people probably think that you kind of fight each other and always are more concerned with who starts than necessarily\nWho wins but I've noticed what a great relationship the two of you had to the point that there was a a a moment on Saturday one of the drives you didn't score on you were on the phone to their coaches booth upstairs and Brandon's right there with you and as soon as you get off you guys were talking can you talk about your relationship with Iran\nI'm running on a really good friends have been since the day um I got here um we both want to win for ... and we both know that\nYou know we're going to trust the coaches and you know they'll make their decision but like you saw on the game we talk after possession we aren't going to school they go to the library were good buddies and um you know both having a good time here and join her college experience and I would just er into one simple bowl games\nYou're already quarterback his team to victory in North Carolina last year obviously came in and relief in quarterback the team to victory in the ... so you had been here before but even with that one of the most remarkable things about what you've done the last two weeks is you have protected the football you haven't turned it over and that's one of the first things coach Kelley is saying\nWhen asked about how you played what have you done as much as you've thrown to make sure the\nSo it's kinda like trees just we can win this game as we when the turnover battle some we talked a weekend and we go out and you know something I got to take pride in something I Do take riding and as the quarterback someone who gets to touch the ball every play it's something that you know I really focus on you know whether that's just\nKnown my reads exactly or you know hugging the ball ... something that you know it starts with me 'cause I get the ball to blame\nSomething that I truly truly trying to focus on everyday replay\nAnd one of the things about this off as you had a lot of options every time and you don't really know who you're gonna throw to until you look up and see who's open would that Seventy three percent completion rate in these two games that you have started this remarkable\nYeah it's got to go to the to the guys stretching the ball 'cause like you said we have so many claim acres that the best thing about this ... and the team that we have this year you know being able to throw it to you know just not one or two guys when there's a bunch of guys out there that can make place just makes everything that much I'm not that much better for the Athens\nEverybody knows the quarterback calls signals in place but they don't know that the center make some calls as well talk about how much they must have herself she\nObviously a great leader um helps them with protections knows how to lead a loves the game of football and you know someone that's taken me under his wing and\nA huge you know having a good relationship with the office of line and something that you know is only going to help and you know to be able to have Sam and you know have a captain in there and it really motivates her off and said I Know every ... office looks up to him\nBefore we get your thoughts in Virginia Tech and one of the reasons you choose to come to Notre Dame and you were heavily recruited you had a lot of options is the academic side you're in the ... there was a College of business you're majoring in marketing how is that going and how do you think down the road that's going to help you or\nIt's going great that is a huge reason I decided to come to school here I'm very challenging a but that's the part about being a student athlete you know and it was going to be challenging but I Know you know we talk about for for forty and you know for years here four years after it's going to pay off and um\nYou know I'm just so blessed to be able to come to the university like this and being the Mendoza program and you know

to be able to hear and ... and I think it's going to be a crazy environment that we're going to enjoy you know be able to play play a game and\nWhen you look at this Virginia Tech when I watch them on film I mean athletes all over the place they average three ... and they're very tough on defense especially against the Ron\nDessert um you know they run a lot of different looks very athletic events like he said uh bring a lot of pressure like descending order ...\nUm you know that we're going to have answers for that and that sort of impact preparing for and you know again I think that's something that makes it fun being able to see some books we haven't seen all year and\nYou know we got to be really you know really on top of our uh on top of our details because you know we got to be in the right place and going to be number right protections in you know that's part of the game though so it's going to be awesome came away\nThank you good luck tonight thank you very much Joe that
