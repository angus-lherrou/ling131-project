A. okay and I stay in that lane\nIs so very and I just want to say that you have three daughters two of them did go to college one doesn't become a teacher without\nGoing to college and she also has a master's in in a special education\nBut um and then my second one doesn't become sous chef at State Farm arena without having gone to college and my third one was she took the road I did and we both had a daughter and a young age so [laughter] um but where were you know she's a real estate agent and she's taking button taken name she's got bigger deal than I Do right now\nThat's a trip so\nProud of all of my girls all of them are doing great was really proud of him\n[noise] well that's that's excellent and uh I I don't know in this day and time females are doing\nExcellent than our sons are in jail and the ... in a\nEither that or they're calling into radio shows trying to change the world one phone call at a time\n[laughter] you know are\nWe doing this for a minute on this out of the phone and then she should India okay I'll leave it there are I mean this is a very touchy subject and it isn't related to real estate\n[laughter] okay our later a mean this is a very touchy subject and it is related to real estate directly so\nLoud that you were a lot of ... of all she shouldn't it ... your ...\nOkay I'm gonna I'm gonna give you a little I'm going to give you a little peek into where\nThis is coming from today for you\nContinue because it comes it's coming from some place it's not just\nYou know you can obviously here in the way we're talking to one another that I'm feeling some kind of way today and and let me tell you where this comes from getting I'm going to have to take a little bit of why you know it's going to give me a minute to get over the situation and\nYou know what you could help by means of readjusting you're thinking in reference to something but you know there's a lotta times getting you don't realize that\nWhen you get on the air I promise you that you open up the tides them of your soul and it just pours out to the entire listening audience and those of us here who are on the radio and we get a real good view of who gets ...\nDid you know hey alright chose ... whenever possible I\nAlways listen to W. A. okay Sunday\nOr maybe Saturday or whatever is Joyce will tell us on and she had a guest and they were talking about\nAbuse says this ring a bell to yeah\nOh absolutely okay with that and then we're also talking about child abuse and females being abused at a young age and incest and things like that\nAnd you called in and I was so disappointed in yeah\n[noise] it was painful to listen to you call in and talked to Joyce enjoy it was painful for us as well and um\nBecause you know why as a black male and someone who\nPuts themselves out and spoke ... person who calls in with all of your influential you know and ... and things like that you think you're influencing people\nThat was really really disappointing for me to hear you say\nThat you feel like women are responsible for the abuse that happens against them because of the way they act the way they dress or they haven't been taught well er that's women the women today you know really really really don't like women we do we get that\nOkay we get it\nTo go as far as to say to blame the victim for their abuse I was hugely disappointed so today's conversation with you\nAnd I'm going to try to get past this because we you know ah we're ten years what Fifteen Years I don't know I Know\nYou know most of the human being that is in the fall you know all about us again or going towards that direction and a lot of time most of the people troubled by the same things or most people are happy about the same thing that is you know dead which is good most a lot of people is happy about that which is ...\nAnd a lot of people have trouble about which is bad\nAnd ah so does does another comment but but the gentleman that that I've got the name of the gentleman that from what was it from St\nLouis Mr tell from where he's from St Louis mystical right\nOkay he a ... a a recall a thing for years ago we use a job that you care and that was a gentleman that got in a car and he's a man thank you for picking me up so I wouldn't even picked up knowledge show\nBut sometimes we care sometime the way we you know might appear we might appear that we might be you know people need to be cautious of all that person like a lot a lot of time you might want to hear that you were younger you are going to be careful\nAnd a lot of times we might give them the pitch your image of usual picture of what to be extremely careful\nYeah okay [laughter] so so it seemed like the leaders seem as though\nIf you're over what to be extremely careful\nYeah oh okay so so soon\nThe leader of shame as though she was you know might be from the media or whatever\nLadies actually right from the media\nRight now are ready to turn back story used in the ... media a lot of time I think Russia may not you know a lot of times we don't get to ... to Dr slaughter the making of the back story a day\nAnd a lot of job we you know like ... years ago and slavery you know we've set ourselves you know they're saying troll that the whole eight hours or\nSo they didn't have no food and then they will go out more than likely not say steal would they go out and check them show so food to survive\nSo a lot of time the outcome miracle people\nSome guys you know mother and I did grow up around here a year and a lot of time to go out and actually we say steal they go out and take them to some to survive for the next day and that guy he might at that time and look like one of those Porsche ...\nAnd ... and ... and I'm not\nListening to the you know it today at the very\nJuncture at my soul is teetering on the edge of\nPositive and negative ads I'd really rather geared towards positive at this point I'm not agreeing with what you're saying I don't believe that just this guy came from work and so you know he looked like someone who could be stealing and then that's why this lady did this I I'm not going down that road I don't even\nWant to give that thought any energy we are we do you if you look at everybody else the way they're dressed they look like garbage and we just we're not we aren't doing\nWell we're not allowed to\nMake assumptions of people by the way they're dressed or the way you know how where they're coming from where we can't make those assumptions and then act upon them you can make you sent learns guess what you can't act upon\nOkay well there's there's maybe there's Martin us maybe that's where I grow because\nUh you know like you do to choosing to be careful and my show you know I'm I'm not trying to bring myself in driving taxi cab but a lot of time you had to make a decision about a person on a split second call the police no no I'm saying before they get into\nWhat I'm saying it's like you can't know\nKnowing what a lot of times what I'm saying a lot of time you weren't allowed to not\nTickled showed person so sometime you put yourself in jeopardy you know your job in jeopardy by not picking up certain political what sometimes you just had to make a discouraging shooting in a minute and wind on someone else can ... you wrote what are called Jews and white guy you you would think\nSo I asked the person ... you're not ... he's a man for full of with the thing is he was in ... and I made a distinction that he was but I didn't I wasn't on these issues it wasn't because she was not all wars or cookies in the decisions\nThat you would have picked up ... gauge demand click I\n... I picked up a Caucasian has for the money up front and the Caucasian got out and share I when you before you lose his life depended\nOn okay but but a lot of time we do did ask person's not not African American and we ask person in the foot of forms of rock\nAnd I were talking about a lady who denied this man access to his own house because she made the assumption\nWe are Persian for the farms are far\nRight we're talking about a lady who denied this man access to his own house because she made the assumption that he did not belong there that should be against the law yet\nAnd she does not have the right to be able to make those assumptions and then deny someone access to their house just because of you know what we may think about our he might be dressed like something or whatever no we don't get to\nDo that let me tell you what make them and give you a real quick story Henry and why we have to work real real hard against that type of thinking I was in Savannah and I needed directions I was in a really not affluent area with a bunch of bunch of guys black guy\nHanging around a car and I said hold on his I'm going to ask these guys which way to get on the highway and they're like no mom don't don't don't ah we we don't don't ask them were scared I said I\nI'm going to ask them so I rode the window down I said hey guys can you tell me how to get back on Ninety five or whatever you know they said um okay well you go up this way no no no hold on I tell you what it's going to be easier if we show you would use follow us\nThere ... they got in their car and took me to the highway it's like we cannot make assumptions of people by the way they can go to the way society has told us to make assumptions about\nWhether the wrong number jumped on where you were ... they don't grow to the number of dirt you off and that and therefore\nThey were kids and I was teaching them this lady should already are you there will be\nCheering on mono I'm sharing the Jupiter jurors people do you love them and grown to their level because we're all just one level that we'll bring you know well\nLet's hope after this situation Henry she learns okay that's how she learns a real good lesson now so that she can take that lesson and teach future generations and why she shouldn't treat people like that but anyway I got other callers and I got to take All right thank you for calling Henry appreciate it when you're a\nFour point eight Ninety to something as there are three last segment ...

my call and say\nOh well thank you so so very much Victoria what do you think about that what do you think about what Herman has has said about this\nWhat I heard him say that he's been forced to go vote in some sort of sounds but not what he wanted to do ... and you know if if anybody's for us to do something that you know that that is the type of violence so I mean if\nI understand of course that the you know pushed to to get people who are eligible to vote to vote 'em but if someone is forced to do something against their will or something they don't want to do and it's you know that is that's a that's problematic\nMy my goodness and you know and and I I I went last Thursday I think it was and I actually voted early ah because I I Do not want to be in any kind of wave in that rush come come November I've already voted but I noticed when I when I did\nSee some seniors there and they've seen that it it seemed that they were this was something\nThey were doing all of their of their own you know everybody was you know perky happy\nEverybody seemed to be very cooperative so I did not get the impression that anyone was there against his or her his or her will but I Will say um why I never thought about have you have you ever encountered anything like that in particular about seniors being um\nYou know ... ... and you know\nKidnapped and and and just heard it into a vehicle and taken to someone may to vote\nI actually have have not heard that um and I've been involved in in voter registration and even mobilization efforts um but you know those and was I've worked with Rob and you know it's it's it's always important to you know you work with people who are willing\nAnd you know I'm I'm Sorry to hear that instance in which in you know especially if he ... his\nDesire to not do that mhm I'm you know that that that he was still you know made to do so so I haven't heard of that though I have not\nBoy I don't I don't know that people are ready to go vote you know an an older and older adults you know oftentimes\nAre are are very excited to exercise their right to vote so um that is a first for me to hear\nThese things to look out for you know um and these are the things that you can put into place sometimes to make sure that their um\nTheir monies properly spin and in addition to that um it helps that they have a third party\nThat works with their doctor other than the person is supposed to be main the main person to take care of\nYou know so let's say hypothetically to have the grandson of granddaughter taking care of them but they're still kind of injured from time to time mhm old people fall down their brittle bones yoga but everything is necessarily as a result of that\nIt helps that if they have a third person a second person rather in addition to the primary person to keep up on their medical their medical records and what's being 'cause it was consistent it was not consistent and this is something you should look for them not to mention this clearly\nIf that primary person takes offense to there being an additional person to keep up with it that's a sign that something might be a cause somebody who's really taking
