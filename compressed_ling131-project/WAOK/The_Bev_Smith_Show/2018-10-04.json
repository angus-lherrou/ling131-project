N. A. eating who we are\n... we look in the mirror is going to determine how we act and how we move that day is going to determine what we don't put all that morning\nHad her hair is working out how to has working at it it determines how we go me when I write moving our relationship that's fine you know\nJust a thought about one day I was in third grade and my mom and dad and um they had to go there was already going to work or whatever and I was leaving walk to school or later new runner and I took a\nRazor blade I think my dad or my mom had left a razor blade on a on the two you know I'm you know in the face border though not to the razor blade and I gave myself what new line [laughter]\n'cause I was trying to get my hair right I have with the murderers and you know what I'm saying limited ball looked like it was like a thousand little ... and I wanted to get that line right in front of so I think ...\nNot just important to to to black women but it's important to black men too but I I was I was a little ... I was feeling a little more shallow than that I didn't know he was going to go all the way into the\nBy listen [laughter] we have to\nGo to our route when we talk about when you asked that question I think many people don't understand that's the reason why we\nDo what we do as it relates to here which will get into the all the money that we spent in our community you know we'll talk about that but that is the reason why\nA woman in some cases will pay part of a light bill and keep the other had to get ahead on\nOh no I'm wonder I'm you know and that's I mean 'cause they only wondering\nYou know okay so you say okay we know the biblical text refers to the woman was there as a ground or the glory okay I got that I'm I'm I'm I'm a work with them I won't be honest though I won't be or not it falls might get mad at me and you know there was no was new\nBut what we'd be doing too it\nSeems\nTo me to\nSuggest that there is a sense of imitation and memory Greek going on\nI said okay you said I said he's out of I I did and I if they had to do I said the\nW. word yet that Doug ... okay I said the WWE ...\nBut you know and I noticed the dog on relationship with two ... and I'm Talking about\nAmerica America America All right ... yeah 'cause\nIt now is now within Africa now is in a all over the African talking to you know the uh obsession\nWith the look like\nCome on let's let's dealing with writing on health so a lot of drama ... people be trying to look white all over the all over the world yeah I'm going to say\nThis not just in the United states but on the continent of Africa on the Asian continent wherever people aren't white they trying to look white that's right okay I said before you can give you Google it right now the most\nAnd then the Asian continent wherever people aren't white they trying to look white that's right okay I said before you can get you can Google it right now the most are the most popular\nSurgery right now in the world is Asian people having their eyes open up so that they won't be slanted ... that's right that's the most that's the that's the most had surgery in the world right now ...\nThe most the most danger was chemical that is released on the world right now which is illegal in many parts of Africa\nIllegal in Europe and if it's on the black market all over Asia and that is hydro couldn't well known\nPeople attempting to lighten their skin that's why I asked her okay that's true and so when we sold the next\nPiece to deal with is okay what's going on with their hair color or finding an era that is where all around the world All right that's what is this is what is this about\nI can do about it was the one [laughter] oh\nOut of the one [laughter] oh well you know who you talk about you know [laughter]\nAnd he would say but you got to understand that we have transition in our society today today that's you know we we went through a period of course coming off of the slave ships and being in the massive house and having our citizens and our brothers some guy straight here 'cause they the masses kids but my daddy\nWas called the ... line and then I Want it to be the best you know the best one and so we did go through a period\nOf ... closest to white people that are like ... they wouldn't want that got the privileges mine so it wasn't something that we just wanted to do with something that we kind of had to do you know for survival and we want it to look like that but if we fast forward to the bank or adapt to shore up some of the underlying\nExactly exactly and so if we fast forward to today I think\nIn this generation we've been there before in the seventies we owed enough when we were our own natural curly curly hair and then we decided to straighten it and then we decided to go back into Jerry girl and then now paying for you know now we're here again with the millennials\nEmbracing their natural curl because they never experienced anything like that before they wanted their natural curls but now we're also seeing that women are going back to straightening their here again\nIt's our mental disabilities because men's tennis are testing is who we are as

who knows what he is six Doug Jones a couple of days ago and I think some of this is skewed in part in eight five five to one to four CBS you'd want to call in and talk hang out here on the show\nPeyton Manning was pretty great pretty early on he do a lot of turnovers that first year in fact I think we played a guessing game the other day Tom and student about how many turnovers there were and if memory serves boys I think I guess twenty five interception Peyton Manning's first year and I think I was woefully under didn't they throw in the thirties\nAnd that opening season he did I think they re guessing like the the high teens and it was while being like thirty thirty eight yeah twenty eight interceptions his first year twenty six touchdown like yeah this moment right\nI mean he was obviously the great Tom Brady the first time he ever play the game was against Peyton Manning by that point manning was as certainly established himself as\nA future all time great QB and Brady was off and run and never look back in the paper just wants to build that year and so in both those cases right very different roads to greatness Peyton Manning number one overall quarterback\nThe son of a great quarterback the brother of a future number one draft a quarterback and then Tom Brady the guy that couldn't even win an outright starting job in Michigan six round pick you know the tale gets a chance to ever looks back but both of those guys are pretty good early on and you knew it right away it doesn't always go that way\nIt doesn't always go that way and a little patience is probably the right prerogative\nI Hope bigger maybe it was the guy I'm not as Sam Donald guy probably gonna be wrong on that but I'm not going to know and probably neither are you a year from now it'd be surprised if we know more often we know someone's an abject failure before we knew if they're going to be great because\nIf a guy so bad he can't keep his job if there's so much failure early on and not enough signs of progress\nThat can become fairly ... self evident in Johnny Manziel did bad example because the guy wasn't highly\nInteresting but not a not an overall top draft pick the late first round draft pick and obviously some demons that that sell them a little bit so these things they depend in large part on the ability to assess them overtime\n... more homes golf once I mean all these guys are still in their assessment phases in some cases gone off once we know they can be I mean even under lock and looks looks great I'd come back from injury we weren't sure\nWe weren't sure this year missed all of us season concerns about that shoulder\nWhat's gonna happen and he's been off\nIt's a really brutal game it's brutal make it it's quarter to prove yourself it's hard to stay
