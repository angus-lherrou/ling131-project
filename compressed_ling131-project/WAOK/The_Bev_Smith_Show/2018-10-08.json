I just go see that ship go down I mean\nThe Democratic party you know that a crime like little baby in really they really helped\nTrump out to get your boy in there with that with that a reality show that they don't they kind of Miami about Lawrence down in Texas cry like a baby and don't do that and I was trying to one so today change their mind set man they're going to be like launch any crime the show\nI think was Tony ... during the last one that's on with why why why cry like a baby you know I'm I'm not into hip hop and whatnot but I've heard it or go to Joseph from Worcester, Massachusetts on line three Joseph\nLittle clip from Boston, Massachusetts how you're doing the study for a well how are you\nAll right I'm pretty good I think it's a great deal of\nA judge a cop and they'll be ... I think Donald Trump to do with the way the president and the Democrats go to the people in the wake up and see the Democrats for our only they really are a lot of the leadership\nUsually willing to go by where the gates may use or white or divide it gets why the user registry quicker to Richard gets Paul did get money from the George so you ... billion dollar there's got to be what Donald Trump stay\nWell thought out of ... you make it seem like Republicans are just so finance so they get money through you know small donations mom and pop for every George Soros Sheldon Adelson\nThere's a you know that Trump was one of the big donors to the Republican yeah Steve Forbes who ran for president twice the billionaire you got Mitt Romney who's a billionaire so what's the difference when they're billionaires these billionaires\nWell like I was afraid that the you know I Love to go to a Donald Trump rowdy\nAlready lost dose of Oregon getting an online forget him where else\nLove to go to a Donald Trump rowdy\nAlready lost dose of are going to get in on the line forget him\nWell shame and embarrassment all across this country for those who talked against is a nominee and\nIt is a shame and embarrassment just like it was for Hillary Clinton\nNow for this a nominee who's in the legacy of Donald Trump like it or not has been written for the Next Fifty years\nAnd those of you talked about which this woman comes out and that would work with and it just didn't stand and just like if you had someone come against you if you had a very powerful position you're about to get to and somebody said when you in high school you touched them in the wrong way\nAnd make credible her story may be evident nine so when you look at this country is built on corruption lying and cheating and you support it either way\nIt goes but the shame is on the females that thought that they had the ability to put Hillary in and had the ability to stop this nominee both wrong both shame and now\nWe're asked what's the next fight what do you see is the next fight that that's going to come out so\nWell I have a few one way or the midterms in a couple of weeks for the control of the Senate um because I even though you don't believe in the power of the women vote and the power to stop this remember this still came down to a basically forty nine forty nine split\n'em and then we had a Democrat close a crossover which allowed comments a crossover also in support him so\nI I don't know if I Would question the power of women to influence politics but please believe emily's list and the me too movement and time's up\nAnd all these other groups are going to come out in full force in November and so Republicans might indeed have a pure victory whether you win but at what cost what what will it cost you down the line in order to get the nomination across we lose two Senate we lose to send it to the point where you lose the city of ... vote majority\nAnd then we met the waterfront those impeachment proceedings in the house you after you have to worry about the prospect of actual removal before twenty twenty what does it do for the gym that you have going forward if you lose both the house and Senate because he wanted to get the Supreme Court nominee across we've got three point seven\nUnemployment right now we put that in jeopardy by losing the or the Senate and state houses the governor's races across the country so I think that's the battle is actually worth it\n[noise] well these are hypothetical and once again what you fail and many people fail to understand is the political infrastructure\nOf the power elite that control the whole process you saw that with the Hillary Hillary Clinton lost you seen that with the a nomination of now a Supreme Court justice Kavanaugh\nYou don't recognize this structure and its power in his influence and infighting between\nAh which I've always said I don't know how many people have hurt me it's a gender what is going on in this country and women are trying to fight against their own self interest in that being the people that have been protecting them all this this these many years it has destruction of the civilization like Raul like Greece\nNow America is the internal structure\nThat's going to destroy what we now see as a power elite\nAnd it's harder on the world\nNear the end 'cause we've got about a minute left do you do you have more ...\nWe nasty as eight hours a week and it's harder\nOn the world know near the end 'cause we've got about a minute left do you do you have more concern about women controlling the country or about white supremacist controlling the country which do you fear more\nThey're both the same no no no\nNo the audience is an either or do you think will be worse to have women control the country or white supremacist control the country\nI think it would be worse for women\nTell the truth because what they've done is the uh the feminist ... of our sons they allow the control of households to be taken away from the man they have in in a fake\nCreated this this uh infighting between mother and father Republican and democratic\nAnd at what the ah quite the premises get an order then what we do is we\nVery seriously and working very hard to get everyone wants to register before the deadline so they'll be\nDuring the election superintendent registrars all set to take that very seriously and working very hard to get everyone wants to register before the deadline so they'll be able to participate on owner before November the ...\nWe appreciate that so much or I wanted to shift gears to education reform this week you announce a hundred million dollar and then she the one teacher pay ... for the people how this will work and how it will help the educational outcomes in Georgia\n[noise] well I was really excited to roll out our education plan or several different parts of it that we've put out the last two or three weeks\nObviously we've got the teacher pay raises that's five thousand dollar across the board pay raises certainly going to be a priority of mind or of the legislative leaders that we're staying with us when we roll that out\nForty four percent of our teachers now leaving the profession within the first five years and that is causing a lot of problems at the county level in local communities with our great teachers that are out there\nSo that's going to help with that so we're very excited about that we've also rolled out some good or a good program on school safety we've got to be able to keep our children's safe in our schools\nThat starts with a couple of different things number one we're going to put a counselor and every single public high school in the state to take some of the burden off the teachers and administrators when it comes to\nProblems and issues that the students and their fears are facing inside the school because a lot of these school shootings that we're seeing\nAre happening from people that are inside the school and they're legally supposed to be there they just got issues whether it's substance abuse problems at home mental health you know suicidal thoughts and things of that nature so I think that's going to help our teachers but it's also been a help our schools but we've also got to make sure that\nWe're keeping the school secure from I'm from the outside perspective keeping people that shouldn't be in the school system\nUm you know from getting in and and\nCreating habit gr hormones are students so we're going to give a one time thirty thousand dollar grant to every school in our state every public school in our state to help them um secure their schools and they can use that however they want it's been a big tree local control so they can use it\nBy putting in technology like cameras or you know a communication system I could put in you know ... automatic locks on the exterior doors you know monitoring\nYou know metal detectors or you know the only one time money but we feel like this will be a good start building ... the legislature did last year putting sixteen million dollars worth of funding in or to try to help that happen sooner rather than later\nAnd then we also talked a lot this week last week about our our early learning and ... you know governor ill in the first lady Sandra deal focused on early learning or getting folks up to grade level reading about a third grade which is a big problem in our state this is\nYou know correlates with statistics on a folks that are not meeting that standard are more likely to be incarcerated or not be able to get a good job or get the education they need\nSo we want to build off that protecting HOPE Scholarship making sure that we have private free cake or programs are available as well as public as a big contrast with my opponent she wants to do ... do away with those tax credits for parents that\nYou know give them school choice to put their kids in a in a private early learning program and in some communities that's the only early learning in pre K programs that are available\nIt's in a in a crowded early learning program and in some communities that's the only early learning in pre K programs that are available in certain communities in certain areas so we're very excited about that as well\nThat is outstanding or to ask your question on criminal justice reform broadening somebody who was personally affected by the criminal justice issues Mr Mr birds with birds and want to go in and say I'm a secondary can't because I'm from a distance before I'm\nAbsolutely I missed a camp and understanding that prisons in a\nJuvenile justice programs and services and other corrections programs make up about five percent state budget or which correlation equals to about fifty six billion dollars worth of outgoing tax money and asked that relates to your plans to cut the amount of taxes and taxpayers are paying in that state it's expending\nDo you plan to evaluate and make ... a torch releasing nine ... first time offenders speak\nEspecially those elderly who I Know are not nor had ever been missing the society do you plan to make any tangible moves to watch their release when ... that the state tax income\nFirst let me let me thanks for that question I certainly am very supportive of what governor the on the legislature's work them regarding criminal justice reform enough ...\nManner or be glad to look at that digital things as we move forward that\nYou know many that have worked on that on that working group it brought forward in the last several years to see if there's more than we that we need to do I've spoken to many people on the campaign trail\nAbout programs whether it's work release or you know different centers that are available in local communities to let those that are actually still incarcerated be able to\nWork during the day a count as a transition type center or what you think would help with employment you know one of the biggest issues we have in our state is workforce development bumped certainly supportive of this is like that those\nThat are incarcerated that want it to end their lives around you know try to help with the recidivism rates I Do think there's more that we could do in that regard\nBut I also think that we have to allow judicial discretion on a on a lot of these folks that are that have been incarcerated many times and and don't seem to be\nWanting to to make change in their lives and stopping the revolving door\nBecause it's affecting our families in our communities with these crimes that may be petty when they start the turning to solve the votes moving in to being recruited backgrounds gangs and other people we do have a\n... a street gang problem in our state it's a travesty when you think about sex trafficking set straight reward was unfortunately one of the top ... states for that and the country I Want to do something about that as well as our opioid epidemic so\nWe got a couple of different fronts that we need to continue to work on a novel I\nCertainly All right I Want to hit directly on your your public safety plan because we took throwing it slightly\nUm but as you said we do we're you know ten years ago George didn't have vice lord we didn't have letting things we didn't have a we had a very small representation of the crypts here are those things that was floated in the last decade what is your plan to ensure public safety and combat the rises in street crime\nWell two of the things that I learned quite honestly the and I'm\nOut on the campaign trail being someone who is had some background having a law enforcement division and the secretary of state's office as well as ... as the public safety and homeland security committee chair when I was in the latest\nIn a law enforcement division and the secretary of state's office as well as ... as the public safety and homeland security committee chair when I was in the legislature\nAnd working with a lot of prosecutors and law enforcement\nOfficials and I've learned that we have a problem Georgia has become and distribution hub for the Mexican drug cartel\nThat is driving a lot of the street gang rather than a treatment that we have a with children believe it or not that are Thirteen fourteen years old and young that is a very scary scenario is very different from when\nYou know I was growing up in in high school and just before that and the late seventies early eighties that's very alarming to me as a father of three teenage daughters\nWe've actually had a high school teacher that was arrested\nUm for three murders in recruiting gang members in the high school you know that shouldn't be happening in our state or in our schools parents should be confident that their kids are not being exposed to that we also have our neighborhoods being shot in the ... many bystanders many of them\nAre children that are being affected or or shot in in that regard and we need to work with ... local prosecutors local law enforcement to do something about that so we can keep our family safe\nNow in in on that and uh we only have a couple of minutes left I wanted to address faith and family with you because you you brought it up a million people in the state field that you know there's been a an attack on Christians\nAre in recent years that uh any outward expression of your your faith of somehow ... me to review in the public square how does your faith inform your public policy positions and will what will you do is government and to ensure the Christians have the right to express their their feet this is any other group\n[noise] well I Am a Christian allied Saddam and then the numbers of Emmanuel

fellowship of Christian athletes and I have been very involved as well and I think our morals values and our family is is more important than ever I Know that certainly is an issue in many communities around our state especially with single parents\nAnd grandparents having to raise our children and then I'm going to be one that's going to support that a support religious freedom I think that as a fundamental rights that our country was founded on I don't think we need to run for that long from now and I think we do have\nPlug in for for a short of asking questions I appreciate that\nAbsolutely

political answer of well you know we want everything to be better for everybody however whenever wherever he went into some details in some meat on the subject\nUm and that's why I tell you folks don't don't make your decision based off of the attack ads these campaigns are paying people tens of thousands of dollars to paint their opponent the most negative light possible so concentrate on

A. okay\nIn turn Thirteen eighty W. A. okay why Sunday afternoon joined the wrong place this is people passion in politics with Robert ... news and talk to the ... century or news and talk Thirteen eighty W. A. okay\n[noise]\nWell one and\n[noise]\nIt was\nGood because [noise] going on man you know\n[noise]\nIn history to\nMe but I didn't mean to be eating in [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nAre welcome back usually Thirteen eighty W. A. okay the voice of the community calling\nFor a for a nine to two siblings or a British so Facebook April says Robert but also the voter purge ... or ... issue both parties have used it to benefit them\nBut you basically gave him the answer is not just political theater for the midterm elections the cross chip program is real I see you while you didn't have a grid or less on today or ever looked at a press conference with Greg palace on Thursday the ... very important for individuals to\nHal is on today or ever as it did a press conference with Greg palace on Thursday and the rainbow plus a press conference everything's very important for individuals to know their status\nBut also I think it's important for us to realize that there are mechanisms to fix it which is if you do believe you have been a incorrectly taken off the voter rolls you have the ability to go to the Georgia secretary of state's website we do ... also in Georgia we have the ability to register online which is not something that we have in every state\nUh so we have to use the resources that we have available to get the word out to make sure that people know their election status\nAnd frankly most of the ... most people who were uh who were taken off the rolls or people who have moved you know my my wife for example she still gets a calls from candidates in New York she hasn't lived in New York in over a decade I'm\nDarn now lives in Atlanta He's the New Yorker they still have wanted to have him on the voter rolls in New York so it's important to clean up these roles because as we saw a well several hundred thousand people moved to Atlanta in the last year\nSo if you don't clean up the roles and make sure you have the correct people on there than it leads to inefficiencies that leads to waste and duplication but there there is a responsibility on citizens to make sure that just as with everything else you know your status and you know exactly\nUm if you're registered in that we have the remedies in place to be able to take care of it so that's I think it's important to give him the opportunity to speak on that instead of simply fear among agree with what often we're going back to the four month we have a cow on line to count\nHey Robert hey though and I love it when you're on it 'cause you you you get the prospect but let me ask you a question why is it that I'm sure it I'm trying to get to the heads of black people why okay Jean Pierre good black farmers good\nUnemployment area wiring and we as a black race even though you know like the man why why are we on the happy still\nWell I I think what we have is the uh the ... between uh the individuals who control national media national politics and the individuals were are actually on the ground so if you listened to big parts of mainstream media\nYou know they'll have you thinking that are no black folks who is out in the streets everyday Marjah we hate Trump we hate Trump but then when you go to the barber shop\nAnd talked to some do as a whole lot more moderate than that\nIf you just have real conversations were real individuals' you'll find it very often that you know what and loan to GDP as good as long as more people are employed as he can push through criminal justice reform while he said it's going to have to admit terms if he can push through the infrastructure project that he is going to push through early next year\nI'm you were going to see a whole lot less of the intensity and hatred out there that the mainstream media what have you think that they have because the people who are angry or the you know those folks at the top who are being interrupted by um by what's being said and done\nBut the folks who all of a sudden like oh I have a job this year I haven't had a job in the last two years they have a whole lot less hatred than uh than those individuals\nOkay ... thanks yeah we'll get reelected\nOh as of right now of course yeah I think that as of right now from when a landslide I was not even close\nI'm a little give me if he wanders into twenty twenty we'll have two to three Supreme Court justices under his belt worked under four percent unemployment wealth or increases the military spending of the cameras through that infrastructure project for a trillion dollars and hammers through a criminal justice reform to start letting folks at a prison yeah he definitely getting reelected\nBut if they're saying and if they're saying you are so low how can you get reelected if it did and those people will say\nIf they're saying\nAnd if they're saying you know there's a solo how can you get reelected if it knows people saying it's not as a solo how can you get reelected\nThose are the same people who said Hillary was going to win ... or\n... or you can't believe what they say they are they all have a certain bias in place that ... ... because they want to report things into existence I I'll give you a perfect example remember back during the Bush years I Know people try to pretend to do or George W. Bush was never president\nBut you know every night I'll watch Keith Olbermann I'll watch Rachel Maddow ... watch you know the all the different they'll progressive cable news outlets and they really made it seemed like Bush was gonna get impeached any day that he was a war criminal he sold out to a national security the Halliburton\nThat he was a you know that he was appointed corrupt people to the bins they had a ... business dealings object hosted in there the whole time like he's going to impeach any day he said get impeached any day the two thousand four came along and he won\nOh howdy howdy he went up up they said on the news is getting impeach then after that he served the full four years nobody permitted missed racing ever got convicted of anything except for Scooter Libby and he commuted his in it and they all went off and have very wonderful successful retirement so he can listen to the yelling and screaming and hyperbole from the media\nOr you can realize that look the facts on the ground are not always what a report it\nOK wrap it up ... ... you\nKnow I think what's going in a\n... this is the this is the point that we have to understand and realize that\nEven if you want something a lot you know member than has said that I Know how it feels to lose how to want something so deeply\nAnd still come up short look that's what happens so either you can put yourself on that partisanship and say the only thing I'm going to do its thing to support the Democrats in but then you realize that I guess what\nThey're not doing the things that support themselves\nThey can't hold together Joe Manchin to make sure that they are ... to put more pressure on the Senate Republicans to pass the Supreme Court nominee they can't hold together their own caucus and you expect them to be the one standing up for you and for your family for your rights and for your needs you really think that's what's gonna happen\nSo as I've said ... is not about whether you're going to be a black Republican or a black Democrat a black conservative or black liberal\nThe conversation has to be is what are you what do you have plans to help you are black family or is it going to be completely ... dictated and dedicated to what the\nOther side says or is it going to be a based upon what you do for yourself and not really caring who the person or party in power as well just say look I got this set of initiatives that want to get done earlier we had missed Burgess on to talk about her mother\nOr so kind of told us how you get down the nitty gritty of criminal defense work and how it affected the uh the outcome for the defendant\nWill uh basically\nWe allowed the filmmakers access to all of our preparations so for example or if we had all of our experts are in the scene looking at the various\nPieces of evidence on and analyzing it or that meeting was filmed and included in the documentary\nOr if we met with our clients about a particularly critical a decision whether it was in whether or not he should take the witness stand\nOr whether it was a you know how this case should be resolved a that was open to the filmmakers they filmed it and included in the documentary\nSo really it really does give you a a an in debt you avoid a criminal defense lawyer actually does as opposed to what may be depicted on a on a show like law and order or or even you know some popular movies um and and I think uh you know Michael certainly was just sort of\nShow people have the sauce is actually made as opposed to uh what popular culture thinks a you know a lot of people\nAre considered a criminal defense lawyers to be less than honorable or is that what we're doing is uh is tricking jurors or are trying to I'm simply get people off on technicalities and I think what the staircase really shows is that what criminal defense lawyers do\nYou get people off on technicalities and I think\nWhat the staircase really feel is that what criminal defense lawyers do is incredibly important to our system of justice and the way we do our jobs are is also a not in any way related to how popular culture has affected that\nI can tell people what the what was the underlying uh takes about ... ... did not giving spoilers right away what kind of what was the case about how you got involved in it\nWell it was about a an outlet for murder or my client Michael Peterson was a very prominent author or and member of the uh community in Durham North Carolina a and his wife was found dead at the bottom of a staircase and there\nAre ten thousand square foot mansion or ...\nOr the police immediately as they often do focused in on a her husband Michael Peterson as a perpetrator even though at that point it wasn't all at all clear and indeed\nWe we certainly maintain throughout that ah it wasn't they murder it was an accident\nOr and so now from the very beginning are they focused in on Michael uh they uh uh adopted or what is often what often happens in these cases they they should have focused in on a single person they had tunnels they can\nThey ignore the evidence that was inconsistent with Michael having anything to do with his wife's death\nAnd inflated the importance of the evidence that they thought was consistent with that uh they also brought into evidence Michael's bisexuality uh which was completely irrelevant to the issue\nAnd they brought into evidence to the fact that a family friend\nWho had died in Germany Eighteen years earlier\nFrom a brain aneurysm uh as as a documented by the German authorities\nOr had been found at the foot of the staircase a it was a you know a bizarre coincidence\nOr but Michael had nothing to do with that woman staff as I said it was a determined to be a natural causes the only as a similarity was that her body was found one morning at the foot of a short staircase in her home in Germany\nAnd that suddenly became the grounds for that evidence being admitted a and being used to argue that in essence Michael Peterson was a serial killer that he killed this other woman who was a family friend Eighteen years earlier\nA and that that was evidence that he in fact killed his wife who was also found at the bottom of the staircase\nA you know in Durham North Carolina\nI you know that's that's one of the things I think a lot of criminal defense attorneys get\nI'm very enraged by now which is kind of be ... be expansion but the the fact that now seem to judges are more likely to bring in completely irrelevant at a brand new speculative evidence um that just generally\nFuels the conspiracy theories a lot of jurors have the a lot of them to think that instead of doing it criminal trial that they really are doing on order where they think oh I'm going to figure this out before the before the season finale and not realizing you really just supposed to be constrained to facts and reality\nOr you have an event coming up in the bucket theater this we don't want people to be able to attend can tell people about that and and kind of what went into a putting that have been together\nAbsolutely well or the event will be a will be moderated by mark when a little I understand\nAbsolutely well or the event will be a will be moderated by mark wins or who understand is one of the more popular the TV ah newscasters are in Atlanta and he gets focused a lot on criminal defense issues of criminal issues\nOr drew ... who is probably Atlanta is the most prominent criminal defense lawyer a is going to be on the panel with me\nUh and uh we will be taking questions from the audience or there'll be a a a an email address where people who are coming to the show or can email questions will also collect questions at the door\nOr it's as you said at the bucket theater on Monday evening or the show begins at eight PM ah it'll go until about nine thirty or and what we're going to try to do is answer questions that people have based on the documentary no votes to pass the facts and the case\nThat the larger issues that are raised by the documentary for example the admission of that kind of evidence uh uh and uh uh in addition to that or just general commentary on the problems of pre trial publicity\nUh which was a huge problem in this case a a completely generated by the prosecution a couple of weeks before a jury selection was to start\nA and the trial went on for five months um uh and uh uh you know we're we're going to try to to answer all the questions that people may have without a things not only that we're in the documentary but things that did not if you're on the documentary\nAlright well before we run out of time talking people get tickets how can they show up at the event and how can they follow you to learn more about criminal defense\nYeah well uh for tickets or if they go to the FEC had you had a website or they're certainly click it's there are available and in addition to that uh if if they just Google\nInside the staircase a bucket theater that should take them to a site for tickets\nAnd my personal website is David as Rudolf argued the O L F a a dot com or and if they go to my personal

[noise] borrow forty nine and six or seven zero three is the number with the bottom of the hour\nIf you're looking at is you know the kind of way you know that's so new I'm just giving you the real\nAnd I always do that I don't put no I don't put no fancy political spin on it what is about is the problem will get in the white supremacy the continuing an impression of black people at full throttle\nBecause white men are in a season or behind the ignorance of forty five\nAnd they are all showing their hind part they don't care about women they don't care if they black or white they don't care about any persons of color is going to be what white me and say unless\nWe vote they stake in hand parts out\nStraight up that's what it is for all forty nine to two seven zero three\nOr so Kavanaugh as the new Supreme Court justice how will black people risk bond to this when we do this reality because it's a reality\nAnd or you can expect the policy is to begin to reflect on what it is\nThat uh he got on his mind I see you Greg would come over there and brother got married got out after more than ... brother Gregory\nYeah very timely topic uh this morning\nAnd I [laughter]\n... part of you know we focused on I got to cast the army and a judge Kavanaugh's testimony at a hearing I think the key to understanding what we saw last week\nThat the other two thousand fixed hey ...
