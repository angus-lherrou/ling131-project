Atlanta [noise] All right [noise] I there was a good morning when he got in a lot of you are doing great\nThanks for having us always good to see a good to see you cast as will make you for having my my pleasure my on your out this is national\nExpungement week that is correct yeah please explain to my listeners ... national monument week is all about and um what's going on what kind of activities\nYes yeah I'm going to like cats take that as soon as he ... that go okay\nNational expungement week um came about tore a kennel Marshall is a young lady from Washington DC she owns a company we baked did say I'm at a company\nMuch rent we um came about Torry um kill Marshall as a young lady from Washington DC she owns that company we baked it's a um edibles company that are of course is legal in Washington DC and she had a dream of\nSeeing her peers who have a records and can't get 'em ... adequate housing employment a voting rights education\nAccess um to have their records expunged of um misdemeanors and convictions and um that time it passed and so she was helping them out herself and she and the system was a little ... was an approach so she wanted to coordinate and effort just in Washington DC and that gave birth at the genius mosaic\nI'm In Washington DC to a larger project idea with Adam bind who owns Kate who started cage free cannabis and there are quite a few organizations involved in the legalization of the movement to legalize cannabis and a lot of us are faced the facing a lot of 'em\nInvolved activists who have small you know\nI'm charges who need their records expunged so\nUm national expungement weekend the week of events across the U.S that we coordinated with all of these organizations because we don't we lack the resources a lot of people want to give money to invest in the cannabis industry but they don't want to look at the social justice and from the justice reform aspects of it right the expungement is very necessary you know do we definitely got together and we said OK\nTruly recalls blurt people absolute or ... more records were you're more records or interested more in our criminal law of war\nWe were having this discussion last night and you know it was yours ahead was absolutely George has ten point six approximately ten point six I'm residents in the state of Georgia two point six residents have convictions on the records\nAnd when you look at the disproportionate number of African Americans who are arrested for possession of cannabis Ninety to Ninety six percent of arrests in Atlanta\nAre of African American descent and and you look at three point seven three percent of African Americans\nAre of arrest in Atlanta are African Americans were more likely three point seven three percent more likely to be arrested then I'm white counterparts for cannabis to the Russian so when you look at those numbers those are incredible numbers when when they factor out and you see how many African Americans might well then\nTo ... where we knows the truth round emotion very looking for nobody\nWell around the nation from Seventy seven million Americans have convictions on their records were seventies I mean you got Seventy seven million people who face everyday housing restrictions restriction access\nTo education to getting a job I mean to getting up every day and understanding that you have very limited resources so\nMuch more exposure than we used ... particularly to or convictions related to cannabis no no\nActually no no actually we were helping out all types of people in Athens as long as it's a misdemeanor or\nYou haven't been convicted every state has different every county has different parameters and that's what was very interesting to us we learned a lot during the clinic and actually in even the county solicitor is very interesting we had a participant in the clinic who had very basic questions what infractions art you know\nCan be expunged he had to bring out the code book himself and read them and read them because he didn't know\nThem I'm really looking at what's the what's the what's the range of failure to be exposed\nNow see I've not enough last night yeah non violent crimes mostly a and\nOf a sexual nature a non violent crimes crimes that um are not drug um don't\nCrimes mostly I'm now in\nFront of a sexual nature non violent crimes crimes that I'm not drug I'm ... don't deal with um just a district\nDistribution of drugs yeah if if it personal they determine personal possession violent mind anything against children\nAnything that having to deal with any type of child violations sexually or any violently or anything like that definitely is on the list and not being listed by Seventy infraction yes like Seventy some French so that you can't\nGet that you can't get it right and then it goes into different colored sections of um it's different references so it's\nOkay what are they saying and what ... what I'm saying to\nMe too I mean you would ... where they tell you\nWhat kind of ... [laughter] exactly I make them to tell you what do y'all come knocking on our door if you got one of these crimes [laughter]\nI'll tell you what do we go back on [laughter]\nThis this conversation is so necessary and why we made it a national expunged why they made it a national expungement week\nIs because there needs to be across the board even if it's just state by state something across the board\nThat clearly states what the regulations stipulations are not having to go to each county district attorney to try to figure these things out because that's what that's what takes a lot of the time and it just figuring out what each county and how each county and state is set up and you've got someone that's just come out of prison who's already been\nBeat up by the system ... and they're facing a lack of knowledge about how to operate in in in ... and go through the system known early\nAnd so um it\nIt becomes a problem for them when they don't know whether you go to the sheriff's office there da da da da da da da da da and their solicitor ... what is the solicitor general\nRight right of blizzards in ... in food to vote you or your your views all over the ... version or they're just destroyed are just as you if you use a\nJust a phenomenal phenomenal mhm amazing person and who is or who works on behalf of all of the people\nAll the people who are you guys who happens to be a African American you know the word you use ... and it's a blessing it is ... is that the way across the state of course no no of course not as much more difficult outsider anywhere outside of food to absolutely and ...\nThat they're going to very aggressive approach to expungement and resort of justice and the county yesterday when we were at Morehouse campus for our candidate is um politics challenges and opportunities panel discussion ah we had mayor pro tem mark Baker um that was my first time meeting him and hear him speak\nUm but ... it's ... he's great because he really feels like south Fulton is like what kind of I'm\nHeather and the mayor down there are trying to their best build their bad beautiful yes no he said it would on times yeah like he was like he's proud of the fact that they have\nA a a a stressful address full of females\nAnd black females but man running and they yeah let a third largest I'm black populated a city in the state where I knew\nMore about them so I'm I'm On the other thing I find that right and I and I can appreciate\nThat there are people um that come from our communities that come from these communities that are ... that come back to their communities and giving back to their communities it's so important\nIs ... I Want to talk about um this was governor's race ... drew inside on the debate and what you saw last night ... um because you know\nYou hear the seriousness it rather travel nearly so that we are an opportunity to make history\nWrite history could actually I'm really really just re can actually be made\nThis this this woman is ... qualified for the ... overqualified\nYou know that's right and has a record of standing with him for the ... when you look at ...
