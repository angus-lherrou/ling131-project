family issues voting is the one that we've had this discussion many many Patrick for is you know I Would never vote for white supremacy or its tenants\nI only have to deal with it\nUnder duress as do the majority of people in this state and in this country\nI but what made me think about this concept was the origin I Try to go to the origins most things in my thought was do you know who invented the voting machine\nGo ahead and tell us get him\nOr his name is the last ... it was invented in Eighteen Ninety eight ah Jacob I'm Sorry a Jacob Myers or he who he was the one who patented that give them ... work and for the organized voting machine [noise]\nAnd and the thing that really made me think about the origin is why is it and you being a young man maybe you can ask you this question why is it that we don't value\nOur ancestors input and involvement in uh the the society in which we live what is it do you believe our people have to do with this process of voting and its origin\nOr I'm confused by your point getting because our ancestors fought and died and got bit by dogs and hoses and all these other things in order to have the boat and I'm like you just you and others who proceed on this course was saying we don't need to vote this honor their legacy\nWell see you're talking about the conformist need grows ... dress white people's as their schools are better their houses are better their way of life is better these are individual stacked the popular media media uh use as a to\nA psychological to to make the rest of us think that uh because these people want it to live with the white man and ... and become a part of his system that they are the heroes and she wrote about community I beg to differ\nThat than many people that have shown that they not only hated the intrusion\nOf this uh the heat and into our communities but real world view were Rick host at his involvement and and and colonization\nOf them and their access like getting\nGiven given your presumption or giving your position let's at all but we'll take your position stop vote him and then they let David do with the new governor they ah let you know a\nLot of John or Williams come to Germany to somebody or or or for us to be the new mayor and then they put you back in ... they put you back in slavery theirs are beating upside the head again and then you'll say well thank God we didn't vote\nBecause now the people who I really hate us have all the power and they don't have to worry about what exactly is you're in game and telling people not to vote\nWell this is the thing that you have failed to realize based on the\nThe power and they don't have to worry about what exactly is you're in game and telling people not to vote\nWell this is the thing that you have failed to realize based on the uh manipulation of your mind through media we're still on slavery was still\nA the ... the last hired first fired what\nThey've done is broken up our family through the political process and they are going to think that they have been marginalized do their historical culture which many of them know nothing about so the endgame for me\nIs to understand my history my heritage my ancestry and\nBeing in this country you have found that you don't even recognize the importance of your name of your the name of your ancestors the legacy of your ancestors and you think the only in game is to join in with the people that hate you is that true or not you\nKnow get a look do you get to a point where it's either get off the pot so if you're saying that you don't be part of the American system would always tell you leave\nBut otherwise either have to be involved you if you're not involved or you can't complain all the things that you're saying if you're not voting you have no say that you have no you have no reason to complain because you're not part of the solution to sit in the corner crying and complaining all you want but if you're not really willing to do anything to fix it\nThen it just is is just a like a chart we'll call it\nYou're just not only are making making random noises pertain doing nothing you're talking about not say anything\nBut that's the best in our lives that they told you the ones who have nothing to say are the ones who vote for the very a system that has a bomb is poisoned corrupted\nInsulated ah molested our people\nOn on a daily basis when you vote for something that means you supported the people who do not support it are the ones who don't vote for who do not\nUh who are systematically project their own ideals versus the ones who support the oligarchy who control the voting system it's all based on money ... capitalists system is run by\nThe corporate entities that control this that the economic engine of this country\nWill get in if you if you dislike capitalism why don't you give me your money\nI mean aren't there socialism isn't it you give me your money I spend with us the appropriate or give you back what you think you have if you don't like a democracy then go to the country listed dictatorship see how well that works out well you'll like it not having any say in what happens politically\nBut this is what you'd never you didn't gain or west of the issue of what I said about how this country compromise is your thought process in thinking that if you vote for it then you somehow have a voice that vote means to you have no voice and vote means that you are going oh\nYou are a whiz what ever does corrupt country comes up with not voting says that you can support your own interest in a fashion that would be antithetical\nTo the oligarchy debt control of this country\nThe little you know getting so let me put it this way let's say that the you don't vote they elected a new mayor and city council who decides to use eminent domain to take your house and turn it into a dog park at that point at how have held has you know voting benefitted you in any way shape or form\nThat let me answer that briefly it is by letting you know our children know our community now in our people know we need to farm in alliance against\nI let him you know our children our community now in our people know we need to farm in alliance can't this corrupt system that would destroy us right now we're under the awesome pressure that if you joined the system that it used to put the ... over\nThe human trafficker this how you got over ... through human trafficking that child molester that somehow you putting a person in the system that they created I eat who invented the voting system itself and the voting machine the people who crashed you will change it is not run exchanges\n... voting started in Africa right no I did not it\nAbsolutely did I was out of the uh uh out of new being came at this the first recorded voting in history the Greeks and the Romans got it from the Persian to get it from Africans you can date it all the way back\nThe European system is older guard is not oligarchy nickel monarch goal they had other ... are either primal janitor to pass down rule\nI mean you know put about running neck and what they are the Democrats are women need to come home\nOh come on back to us come home in less get the family right and then we can Detroit ... ah we settled for crimes and women are doing and why should permits work and they said back laughing as well you know coach\nBut you know if it's interesting just a quick nerdy energetic and there are forcing through Europe the Romans had solidify most of the territory that where they feel about subjugated dramatic tribes to the north the barbarians the Gulf the tribes\nSo what happened is over the course of about two centuries\nThe Romans started to idolize the gothic tribes so the Roman women you know these ... these are like this whole area and white people know tall blond hair blue eyed white women the Roman women wore a Mediterranean so they were dark or darker una brow dark hair\nSo they are there was a huge trade network of Roman women buying blonde weeds by blonde hair from the barbarian women to across the ... river\nAnd the Romans started to integrate the barbarian into their military using a using visit golfing warriors are because of the Romans themselves in that you feel like fighting wars I why am I going to go out here and die as hire somebody to do it\nWhat happens we integrate so and so deeply into your culture to allow somebody in to come destroy your civilization so it ends up happening is under our Rick the ah the barbarian tribes stormed Rome set the city burned it to the ground\nBecause Romans became too dependent on the outside culture to idolizing\nOf that outside culture that's exactly what happened to black folks where we started our allies in these barbarians putting their hair into our head idolizing their business is a culture that civilization and then we ended up losing what made us fundamentally and uniquely ourselves\nAnd you know work and get it from my point is you know you know we see a chit chat in our head and she don't know what's wrong she don't don't realize in other dimensions this is the fleas come up in this dimension Annapolis in our head bucks a my friend ...\nThank you so much I don't think we've ever had interned dimensional bugs come up on the show that\nThe first and I support that but it is important for us to realize that when we were having the discussion on the discussions on um on voting in on our place in political system if we're going to operate within the system we have we have to maximize it\nLike I said it's either you do it or you do there is no in between there is no try\nThose get out here as he let the right people and then hold people accountable for the vote that we

also the contact info for the Georgia or black Republicans counsel\nAs though the actually come Ella France from they are in the wealthy joining us as well and they call it that day of action\nAh say

not one year later Robert for you and got my cell number call me I well thank you thank you All right look I told you are black Republicans and playing with y'all y'all keeps sending back reading those poll numbers see what happens\nY'all gonna be some sitting right there like a not on a log just like in twenty sixteen they are not going back and forth with your heart going across the aisle\nJoining us now from the New Georgia project miss him say just lost it already\nWho fought miss him say who fought joining us right now I Want to thank you so much for um for joining us\nAnd ... and part of the reason I wanted to have a bipartisan conversation on this is my goal is to just get black folks voting just get them out there and get them to the polls make sure\nThat they are motivated to have access to the register and I don't really care which candidate you vote for I'm not the person who I Am not partisan for the most from independent so\nI don't care if you vote for him I don't care if you vote for Abrams on care if you vote with libertarian but I really do want to make sure that we get people out here in motivated to vote so what do you think the um\nThe primary thing that people need to concentrate on in order to make sure that they have the uh there were these people are motivated these people are out here at the polls these people out here ready willing and able to to get anything done on November says\nNo problem\nOr a hold on just I think we're having an issue with your Mike somebody getting ... to fix it so it's just hold on I'm going to go to Todd on the line and then when they come back to you once we figure out what we don't think just 'cause it's like a radio station that anything works in here ... there's nothing is going to be some time\nTo argue their hot it is okay here Todd either I I mean look [laughter]\nTodd you they're\nHarder here taught either I mean look\nWhat look this is what happens on a Sunday won't try and do something positive so friday when we were talking about the the prosecution Reagan Fort valley everything worked we have no issues with nothing\nTo do all the everything with clear everything was fine don't want to talk about get out the vote that also brings ... we got you know high yeah we're in a week or so were were important things\nPeople realize how distant from a TV rescued from the Democrats\nSo wanting to Georgia project is a nonpartisan organization we've registered three hundred thousand people in all one hundred and fifty nine of Georgia's counties\nUm and that African Americans Latinos Asian Americans young white Georgians um and I think what people need to know is that while yes Georgia has a long and a recent history of voter suppression\n... that it is absolutely important that you get out and vote 'em and even the entire ballot um we have never been just about voter registration so since the beginning the idea was to set at create\nInformed confident voters or to close the ratio voter registration gap here in Georgia I\nAnd we're really proud of the work that we're doing and you can see if they're out in the early voting numbers and the turnout numbers were talking about historic rates two hundred percent over the two thousand at fourteen\nUm election so I'm really encouraged and on both sides of the aisle as he earlier point I'm so this is going to be a battle of the bases and it's gonna be a turnout battle um and again despite Brian camps failures as the secretary of state uh\nAnd the vulnerabilities in Georgia's election system uh people are still turning out an historic numbers and what really encouraged by that\nThey know what I Love about the idea of having a bipartisan organization working on these issues is that\n... that this was the best way to fight voter suppression or when we proceed idea of Republicans doing voter suppression is is not a perception or the reality of of them will be reporting pushing voted for the suppression is to\nHave your base to be bipartisan but if three percent black folks were registered as Republicans or or voted Republican than all of a sudden you don't have to worry about them trying to suppress the vote effort now they have a they have a a a rod and the fire now they have a ... to the game on\nThem absolutely um I mean I think it's also important just when we think about power and when we think about agendas and how to move and agenda\nAs an example we had just stop with running for Congress and you know I never Kenya who have less and tore his running for Congress and now we have Charlotte first off of running for Congress to Tennessee and we also have I don't want that name south of that and then we have Tony Campbell running for Senate hearing now\nHundreds or yes I Would say there's also the brother running up in Michigan against stepping off a right we have\nJohn ... says also writing for a Senate and I can't\n... well I just I like both parties being bald opening competition a breeze it's been all fields particularly in the electoral field so I Want to thank you so much for calling in our ... thanks so must be people who are working to\nGet more people register more people out to vote and I've been saying also I don't care who you vote for both want to make sure we get more black folks involved in political process\nAs happy because what people have to realize if we are so large clothing voting bloc no matter how you what side you're on that we need to have a say in our government and we don't have that\nI think you can with Maria fish calling in to encourage people to get up throughout thank you so much thank you All right back to him studio we have our good friends in say I'm from the New Georgia project\nOn the left the logo is a politically independent organization I'm Still working to get more people registered in out the vote so what are the geo TV efforts are gonna be going on between now and election day for you guys\nWere super power so the New Georgia project has um offices in nine cities across the state of Georgia I'm with a goal of pushing and working with a half a million African Americans Latino and Asian Americans to get to the polls are and twenty Eighteen and over the next sixteen days ah we have\nA phone\nThat gets to get to the polls and twenty Eighteen and over the next sixteen

tailgating at all of the H. B. C. U. homecoming and at Georgia State from coming over the next couple of days uh we\nAre working with the\nWith black voters matter uh\nI don't know if many of your listeners have heard about um forty African Americans seniors who were kicked off of a bus and Jefferson County in rural Georgia for attempting to vote they were told by a some random white guy with no authority and\nThey what they were doing was illegal I there's no law that prevents people from giving folks rights to the polls in a lot of ways it's like the backbone of a black political participation um so\nThey will be coming there'll be joining us next Sunday is the last ... early voting we're doing a huge rally we're going to fill up so they kick those people off the bus black voters matter a bus contract was canceled by the bus company and they had to turn the bus and on friday\nUm and so our response to that is we're going to fail twenty two or buses with college students and we're seeing is from across the region taking them to vote\nIn oh I Love the ... I Love the competition cutting edge for others because while New Georgia project is working on this side to get ... votes in voters to get\nMore African American for the poll you had the blessing served as well just start saying we're going to be phone banking knocking on doors I liked the idea of people fighting for the black vote I liked the idea of both parties having to vote and just say\nWell this ... this was who are voting for\nBut rather being able to say well look we're both wanted to go after the black vote him out of the ... okay I I'd I'd like the concept an idea of competition reading that I won't vote forty F really\nCome through fight for the black vote make promises and then make from things happen but we'll be back after the break there was some talk Thirteen eighty W.
