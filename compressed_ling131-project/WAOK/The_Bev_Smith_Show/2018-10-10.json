Serena Williams many issues came forth\nThey don't have this conversation okay in light of the u._s. open controversy with Serino Williams many issues came forth of that for our students found interesting\nStudents looked at the specific issues of sexism and women's equality in sports as soon as quickly go over the event that sparked this discussion what happened to Serino at the U.S open on line\nAt the U.S open signers Serena Williams received in multiple penalties and violations the first one was coaching violation but she argued that had catch what you're trying to get her pumped up and the second one was a racket it'd be a violation because she smashed Iraq on the ground\nAt rush into racket would ruin feelings was hurt really bad you know\n... and that one was a verbal abuse violation for telling the courage to apologize and calling him that seat is telling her point\nRight and she probably could have had even more choice words for him but she was too much of a lady\nFor that or at any weight at any rate that's what happened so we got the groundwork so oh do you think that what she experienced with sexist\nAgain why because sexism is prejudice stereotyping or discrimination based on gender\n... usually when ... when they argue with the umpire or they snatched their racket they\nDon't get penalize like Serena Williams mhm like for instance in two thousand sixteen Gregory damage show's nasty rackets and got out for the warning mhm and the two thousand nine Federer\nHe cursed at an empire and then get penalize\nRight right so those are a couple of examples and that's how you oh that's how you deconstruct their argument their argument was okay she was disrespectful she was out of orders was but really what what we're looking at is she was not perceived to be an equal\nAnd so her behavior was inappropriate to them because she was perceived to be less than\nThem to see how that works yeah and this and that's\nYou know one of the Islam is you know sexism racism classes and all of those work off the same principle one person or group of people assuming or that they have more value than other people in a book to be paid and you are to obey them\nThat's what my mom was used to call on my case on radio anyway um so do you agree with these issues\nWell let me see well let's first first worthless to this this briefly discuss your opinions on women's equality in sports from your research what are some of the issues that are still prevalent in regards to women's equality in sports\nWell there are several um problems and between women and ask for it\nUh one is the wage gap for example\nAn average MBA player makes five million dollars why average WNBA play only make Seventy two thousand dollars right per year per year us or if the U.S has any coverage or though when they make forty percent of white people there when they switch to only ... only um cover\nBetween six eight percent on TV and and then\nYou know they showed a show on the beach volleyball but there's a whole new stores go ahead\n\nMm and then you know the show to show the beach volleyball but there's a whole new story go ahead\n[laughter]\nAll right I'm Sorry [laughter] well that's exciting for I'd like to ask for\nMy goodness what is wrong with Joe y'all y'all are terrible [laughter] you know just not you know I'm not good and bad children that are here [laughter]\nYou got to view the children to get an egg right ah [laughter] your your your response alone you agree with these issues\nI agree that the large gap is an issue and because usually you won't see women's basketball advertise or on TV so I thought that was greatly impact the amount of income that they\nHow was your a little trouble with a ton of oral forty bucks to do some work through anybody to fourteen no no you are about Thirteen Years old I was with a soldier and they just want them to the word\nFor word or two to Seventy ... or ...\nIt's time to get blessed by the
