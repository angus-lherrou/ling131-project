what bothers me even more the same weekend last weekend\nTrump was all over the airwaves talking about how Democrats are bad people and they create chaos and they are a mob and that same weekend the Republican Party in New York does this ...\nNow I think sometimes one and one equals too\nI think they are desperate for the midterms\nThey are trying to fire up their base because they're afraid of the energy in the Democratic party the so called blue wave\nA this the theory that cabin or help them as a lot of uh malarkey\nAh the Kavanaugh steam roller the abuse of Dr Ford only further agitated the Democrats and they're petrified about the midterms and they're just trying to fire up their base to counter\nThe Democratic turnout that isn't habitable and I think this is how they do it I think

and paralleling or the president saying that there was mob rule on the Democratic side\nThat's exactly right revenue knew what was going to happen when you invited this person end this group the Proud Boys they made this has been violence all across the country every time they appeared\nOr you know what was going to happen when you're brought them into Manhattan [noise] uh and you invited them and you're previewed it and there was all sorts of outrage that they would be brought in and the venue was vandalized before and they still brought him and\nThey know what they were doing now uh we would say uh how how counterproductive uh I think if you're a Republican\nMachiavellian you say no this is firing up our base uh this is going to get our people energized\nA because our people are actually a motivated in stimulated by this talk but I don't believe it was a coincidence\nThat the president was saying at the exact same time Democrats or a mob Democrats cause chaos Democrats are bad people\nLook a ... ... they have to generate energy among their base because they know that eventually ah the the bill comes do\nAnd that this president has trampled the rights of women trampled the

V. O. N. sixty Ninety home where the governor cliff Kelly units my friend how you doing today\nWell hello how are you today I watched both your shows it was great thank you you know Reverend Sharpton is disgusting to head Trump say everything is a hoax and the Republicans never correct him they're complicit in his life and it's like having a unruly child if you don't correct\nHim he'll get worse all the time I say enough is enough and I would like to say to the weight up people and less vote and uh that sixty minute a piece was ridiculous yesterday us killing one thing and he cannot\nAnswer a simple no and the press needs to bear down on Trump more he lives on them anyway so all the time and he's ... they are not perfect but our far cry from him\nAt a freedom of the press you know share of the century and they should do their job and forget about what he's doing because he's a bully anyway\nAnd finally revving chapter I think what slate did was a fake because he knew that they wasn't going to have a real investigation so he just came out to make it look like he was doing something and thank you and you\nHave a well thank you I I question from the beginning when they acts were we were to go on covering a week and then when we found out\nThey listed the questions I mean the people that could be questioned uh then I started saying this is more of a rooster and an investigation or let's go to a James in Raleigh North Carolina James\nYes you know you were out of there with a good day\nI I really think the thing that is\nSo very much like the caller raised ...\nThe same as the commission that would guide on on Kagan\nAmong all the the ... the U.S has a child or not I don't think that this present and I think the same the same standard\nWe're going to questions on a limited basis or what they're doing it the same way it was done there I don't think that that's that's the danger that similar nobody asked because no one to act now nobody asked\nI don't think that that could get a danger that sell the oil and nobody asked because no one ... nobody asks\nA count as to what is going to be he's right out in the beginning talked about a hundred and Thirteen million dollar lawyer but we never ask ... nobody no one no one of those countries that country\nNo oil was there any way about the law says that we're going to encourage or listen to that so I think the ... about this thing\nI don't know what we had to do with it all investigations and saying I don't know that song bombers are saying well I I\nThink you raise an excellent point about the Trump a raise in this hundred Thirteen million dollars first of all a someone should challenge should've challenged him saying that if you have certain equipment arms\nAnd a military equipment you can just change overnight anyway where you're buying it it'd be because they have to match and be able to log into the equipment you already have is like give you have\nA one form of a a a cell phone\nAnd you get a a different model you can't say I'm not going to buy a charge you for that new model I'm more use mole charge you because it doesn't fit so I mean is that what he said just doesn't make a logical sense\nAnd it goes back to ... point they let him get away with things that really does not make sense and I think that it is very important uh that uh uh this investigation\nIncludes requiring that the Saudis hand over any and all information\nAnd that the Turkish release would elbow video or audio tapes they have a and the Saudis hand that over it would be hard for me to believe and I've traveled\nInternationally than in an embassy particularly in a country like turkey that has had a lot of uh violence and a lot of\nUprisings and a lot of problems in that region of the world\nThat they didn't have cameras inside the embassy the Saudis I'm Talking about and ah why wouldn't a we have by now if if the United states or the president said talk to the king why wouldn't we have\nMe to

A. okay\nI'm One of the things I've learned and calm not an attorney but one of the things I've learned in doing my reading and research and trying to fight this case is that you know an individual just cannot\nSay anything or call the police on you that have an effect on your character that is that's directly what's happening and if the police are called late come out\nAnd they find someone who said something about two I'm mad as putting them into\nAs slander and they get a civil suit can be filed against the limits or that's what I Would say any if we can get nationally some legal representation that when these types of things happen that you're going to turn it can come in and they may consider to be able to live\nOn our level but that's something that we need to start taking action on because I Believe they will have an impact and and stopping some of these people who just calling\nYou know a ... and and having no basis for you know charge like this the only person I Believe I heard on on\nHim today who was who was a child how to grow some woman yeah you know New York\nAnd and yeah the I think great that you're right I Know that we're having the privacy conference in Washington many of the civil rights groups who joined the\nNavy and then I'm going to propose what you said that we could either collectively a come together and helped to put together that kind of legal team\nTo look at all of these situations large and small like your son's case that can focus on that and they have lawyers just do that 'cause that's what they're doing on the right and because people just don't have the wherewithal the legal assistance they may actually\nAnd we need to be able to provide that I think that would you talk about is necessary that that does not mean they're going to find validity in every case but it does mean that you're right there's no way to go and a lot of cases of valid one of the reasons I ended up going to a lot of places around the country they don't have anywhere\nTo region I'm not a lawyer at the ... go get Lloyd we need to have a structured legal team on it and I would hope that somebody other organizations are buying or above I'm certainly commit national action network to helping to form you know\nThat's one of the rebel now that I mentioned to you regarding Beijing march because I've been pursuing a medical malpractice case against them and I haven't been able to find a journey because most of the states now have they call this medical malpractice cap that limits the amount that an attorney can\nUm or or that a a a victim can't leave the dance a doctor who had committed malpractice and so for example here in Wisconsin It's there's a woman who lost all of her limbs her name\nOh and she lost all of our lives and see what it Fifteen million fighter jets\nUm who lost all of her limbs her name oh and she lost all of her and limbs and see what\nIt Fifteen million by the jury because of this cap they bought the award back to several hundred and fifty thousand dollars that this woman for pain and suffering and the appeals court here and found it unconstitutional but\nThen Wisconsin Supreme Court backed it up and say what is constitutional and you think about you know someone who they are all their lives and the pain and suffering they're going to go through for the rest of their life\nThat seven hundred thousand dollars doesn't he doesn't even approach that animal and when I was my lawyers should bring that to the higher court that that should be unconstitutional\nWell and and and that was the case here locally in Wisconsin that did happen and the Wisconsin Supreme Court said it was constitutional and one of the things I've argued is that you know has has prevented me from being able to even obtaining\nAccount so because of that capital you know I talked to tell you different attorneys myself and they all told me because of this cap named couldn't make enough money to\nTo pursue a case for someone that's helpful in the last minute measure due to medical malpractice on the part of a a tunnel trips admission work and I'm now on my own having those you know here's filed a lawsuit myself and do all of new know do the work in the in the whole process\nOn my own because I could not get an attorney to represent me and I\nAssure you and I and I'm a I Wish we could do it and it's but this is ... sure you were raised as in the in the meeting or a or early next month in DC and come back with something on because\nI heard you and I want you to know why because what you're saying is real and it's not just a Craig in Wisconsin Brownback but it's just a blob on why you're\nUm wherever that no it is a nationwide\nWhere I'm sure many of our people my condition with undiagnosed block coma and I had been having my checked up more on the scene is Dr my family and I know last year\nI get into the court and you know it's just all the legal jargon that an individual who really isn't a lawyer really wouldn't understand so it puts you at a disadvantage\nHere but I mean I Will have to think that across the country many of our people who want to see the doctor who are doing the right\nThings are also encountering medical malpractice and and have no recourse because they can't get an attorney because most of these states stop believing forty seven other states in the United states have missed the medical malpractice kept their limits the amount of a war that can be you know given to a victim in this case it\nSo they can and and as long as to protect the medical institutions and practitioners is not to give fairness and justice to people who could be victimized ... we're on the thank you for your call Craig ... is our ... and let's go let's stand Milwaukee
