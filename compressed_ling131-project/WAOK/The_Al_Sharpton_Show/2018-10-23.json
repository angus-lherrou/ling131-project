meeting and a lead the deliberations on how we began to start seeing it's parity I'm Talking about I Want my pieces but for those of us\nWe got to Florida officer there put his knee in the back of a fourteen year old girl punch in Iran decide\nAll of that we face in the day what are we going to do about how we're going to get through this we've got two weeks coming up and we got an election\nEight seven seven five three to five seven nine seven I'm let you sound off on these issues that start with four to ... one twenty six line five nor you know keeping it real with Reverend Al Sharpton you got revving Charles Williams with\nYeah Robin Williams how you doing this morning\nIs that even doing too good today they're blonde first of all this past Monday I Want to let you do a vote okay\nFirst things seven o'clock in the morning old open up at seven AM in the morning poses seven pm here in Tampa, Florida and it's those started Monday goes on and I've been sober following\nOther Saturday or Sunday before the election so there is no excuse knows he some anyone not boat ... and we're pretty good candidates for the three\nCandidates you guys Sean Shaw running for attorney general you've got the of course that Andrew Gillum running for governor who who ... the uh the Santa and um [noise] you have Bill Nelson run for senator\nA U.S senator down here so people must go out and vote and and those sort of thing but um I just wanted to just kinda like touch base with you that I'm\nA something just just came I was going to talk about immigration but I saw this article that the ... the state in the um the United States Senate in\nWherever and the house of representatives passed legislation overwhelming support what we call a old through your weight or um patients and things to deal with the opioid ... ... foot tall opioid crisis\nI Want people to know man ...\n... we just take a second look at this so called opioid crisis is and who is a fact that and how they were they mentioned being treated how they're perceived versus how we're ... we're we're proceed\nAnd that there are some all full of all\nEvil things that are are strange things that are taking place in terms of monitoring who gets pain control medications and and uh and those sort of things\nUh we're talking about using that well I'm a big people need to be familiar with this word not scores\nBecause just like people have a credit score now everybody to anyone who brings to any type of conform medication into a pharmacy is given an marks for a lot of people don't understand or don't understand what it's for you and I don't even understand what it's for but\nPeople should be aware of how uh they're being monitored every time they get a prescription and also a controlled prescription\nAnd so um [noise] as I go to war detail on that but I think right now we need to be worried about voting\nOr getting people out to the polls getting our issues out there but also they and I'll talk to that by the immigration issue because I Do come from a family of immigrants and I'll talk about that later and how that affected the psyche of my cold dead ...\nYeah All right All right thank you normally ... his one what got me a thank you normally appreciate your call the country is made of immigrants\nSome force\nAppreciate his one look I mean a thank you normally appreciate your call the country is made of immigrants\nSome force\nI think I think I come from folks who I don't think I Know I come from folks there was forced over you\nI'm a tie ins and everybody else they came on over here I mean you know so on one hand sometimes when people start talking about immigration and talking about I don't want them over here now and we don't want them over the I Know you only get into that but the reality is what\nThis this is a country of immigrants right\nSo uh you know that's definitely a very important conversation but it's definitely not a conversation that hinder us\nFrom getting to the polls between now\nOne of the things you said Andrew Gillum when you brought him up you know I think Andrew films great guy but that's what happens when you got good candidates when you got good candidate should give Vogel voter turnout when you don't have good candidates you don't I'm a lead at right there in case some of the Democrats who gonna lose\nA who possibly could lose begin to understand what they got to deal with they need to get better candidates All right New York eggs in one twenty six line one let's talk to Michael Michael Yon keeping it real with Reverend Al Sharpton\n[noise] forever ever William how are you doing All right good you know\nI had to call in because to be found a nonsense to live that Trump was saying in regards to that ... bad coming up and Mexico and to raise awareness to everyone that is listening\nHe says the false he said that the Democrats have something to do with it I think to defer that I Believe it's complications on perhaps him that's something to do it that\nNo one's stopping to think\nThat the number one he violated due process when people came legally to apply for asylum\nAnd then look how a baby was snatched from a woman that was breastfeeding her um that was there to um seek asylum baby was that she was deported back no due process whatsoever we hit at the same I'm\nAt the cruelty was done to even some of our own and pulled the week or so we're only said that they are immigrants when in fact they are American citizens as well\nAnd then looked at how many children have a separate from their parents and the critical question there is a federal court order directing this submitted streets and to me in light of the families\nAnd that Trump is going out playing golf he's going out with the campaign rallies stirring up his base doing one lie after another inciting violence\nNo one's ever asked them to fully comply with that federal court or that and we live in the family's Mike as it's now so now you got to reasons for people to be coming into the U.S to\nGet that due process rights and also perhaps to reclaim they know that some ... by giving a daughter that what do you think\nYou

I think it's a good point to think about what we do as a country at war should our country was used by should be and I just tell you this I think when I think about the migrants that are coming over these folks are leaving\nSomething that we've never seen before you know one of the things I can tell you Michel from traveling the world and being in areas like that I've been to Bogota, Colombia folks and some places in South America is that folks\nTraveling the world and being in areas like that I've been to Bogota, Colombia folks and some places in South America is that folks they don't enjoy the same standard life than we joy even when we talk about the people who we know to live in poverty\nOr the poverty and the the the president he did you see some of the size of the world is nothing compared to what we consider bad here I Know folks they will like make minimum wage and I'm working at McDonald's and another ... hour a Taco Bell or whatever and I'm not doing well but the poverty to dig that\nIs something completely different and so I think personally that as we look at\nHonduras in South America and the caravan of people and we talk about people just walk miles we [laughter] I'm Iran twenty six miles\nOver the weekend at the Detroit Free press marathon and that was a long way I mean four and a half hours it took me to run those twenty six miles these folks been walking for decades\nOr ... I mean walking hundreds of miles right or trying to get to the U.S border that's how desperate they are\nAnd so obviously I wouldn't tell you that I think that our response would be a response of violence and that is just the response that I think anybody should make in the Dr Martin Luther king tradition because Dr King was non violent man and taught us to his life\nThat it is better to break laws that are on right just to follow laws that are of rights and so when we think about the migrants that are walking to the border we think about them think\nAbout where they're coming from think about the miles traveled to get there then we've got to know that is it really must be something that\nThere's no political gamesmanship here's Donald Trump tries to play he's trying to play it off and say oh they're playing political ... this is the Democrats putting some some folks up to the\nTo the border war rather or whatever I got to do if they come in and they don't they don't take us out that's absolutely baloney we got to look at it very clearly and we've got to say look if you really concerned what is the right thing\nReally concerned about that that will this discussion that we're having now and throughout the ah the ah the\nMedia would would do nothing but galvanized his base and others that ... that it might be on the fifth or even Democrats it will it will get up and that is given a this conversation\nAll across the land will galvanize his his uh his stats okay and ... and because it's a it's a tactic and that's not what you know and that that's what my kids are in the world we grow as black people in America\nWe said this is a stolen land right that\nHe says is that correct\n... hello everybody years the immigrant except for the one can you hear me wants to be OK okay listen\nSo ... what we have here is that the stand your the the the Spanish\nSpeaking people walks populated the southern borders of this uh this other ... the west the west during the southern part of this country now what happens when they say that they want their land back and they are silently brother\nIn late in this country without an arms revolution it is a revolution I Want you to understand that it's an ... it's ... it's an armed revolution but it's a revolution\nThat will quietly\nA kid so\nRevolution but it's a revolution that will quietly\nA consume the uh the the graphical new or the graphical location of this country it will it will it will sooner or later over take that's what I mean you go\nOkay at a black man in America being dominated by another culture that come in here we already got the the wife of course you know what we got to because I tell you\nWhy do pressure will be as good as mine is a oppression will be just as brutal if not more brutal than white a blessing because we somewhat a kind of\nI wouldn't say no doubt sales to it it became a a a a regular routine with us accepting it ah it it will be much more brutal than any are pushing that we know because of the simple fact I can watch what they're doing now\n\nWhat we're miserable I tell you this and I got to get ready to get some phone calls and we spend a lot of time here but I appreciate your call I got to make the rules of the good Samaritan I\nTo take the role of the good Samaritan that's just what I got to do I Charles Williams I got to stop and I got to help the man on the side of the room\n[noise] it's the geometry teacher who Mansour ticket window the kid in grade school pain to think ... might before every home game\nIs the accountants salesman and store managers who give up their friday evenings to referee\nTo listen to the championship game on the Internet if parents sales ads his mother program\nIn the cashier at the corner convenience store where school colors on every game day\nTraining equipment managers and ball boy never meant\nWhat makes high school sports here in Georgia so special\nThey do you do meet all down\n\nMessage presented by the Georgia high schools association and the George athletic director of a\nThe all new radio jak combat is available now it's a totally new experience that puts listening at your fingertips we made it easier than ever to access the radio stations you love now will save your favorite stations and\nOthers to you based on your list to get the news and information you rely on even when you are near radio you can take this station when you're on the go\nDownload the all new radio dot com app on your smartphone\nFor anywhere [noise]\nHi this is W.

Oval Office so I wouldn't put anything past time he's already\nRecorded that that are threatening to close the U.S Mexico border which will be a logistical nightmare\nIt's nearly impossible to do we have one point seven billion dollars worth of goods at Crocker that border every single day um they're also thousands of a legal immigrants and us resident across the border every day it also includes um a\nProperty that's owned by private us our residents so that would be a nightmare but he said nice things I mean we know why he said they think because his base\nUh this is a fodder for them they they they pounce on this and and they spread it and they believe these things to be true his latest ally is that there are\nAll of these quote unquote middle Easterners who are are sneaking across the border with the caravan there is no evidence to suggest that the thing and the scary part I'll tell you or whatever and then he had a twenty four hour cable news channel who will echo those lies and he has tens of thousands of followers who look at his Twitter feed and believe it to be the gospel\nSo what we have to do as as communities of color is recognize that these people are all ... people too and it always breaks my heart to hear in a press people\nTalk about a disenfranchising keeping another group of ...\nOh there is recognize that these people are all ... people too and it always breaks my heart you're in a press people\nTalk about a disenfranchising keeping another group of oppressed people down a these are people who have crossed the desert clip put their own lives in peril will put the lives of their children in danger to make it to this country\nThe president has bought and sold a fault and it told his faith and many Republicans across the country that they are doing all of that they're going through all of the things that so they can get to this country and to do what both illegally let me ask you if you were here without documentation\nWhat'd you go into the voting booth and when you know you don't have the right to be on the things that are actually happening but the scary thing is there are so\nMany people who believe that to be true but why in twenty sixteen are a lot of people who voted for Barack Obama and then voted for Donald Trump I Want to dismiss the myth that race if people didn't vote for Barack Obama we you and I both know that to be the truth there are plenty of people who are making exceptions for certain black people that as an excuse them\nFrom being racist that that could lie I Want to expose is that people\nKept saying it was because of economic reasons people thought that Trump or going to deliver jobs well that is not true ...\nOr ... ... it was actually not the economy stupid ... racism there was a report out from UCLA last week that showed the number one defining issues from those swing voters voters who voted for Democrats and then with the Trump wasn't because they had conservative racial attitudes\nSo this is why this president kicked off his campaign by calling Mexicans rapists\nThis is why he made the NFL kneeling players were kneeling to protest\nPeacefully protest police brutality he made that a talking point this is why he's out spreading more lives about the caravan cracking the country now let's say we do have a broken immigration system I completely understand that there are no Democrats calling for open borders that is another light is president has echoed um but we cannot turn our backs I mean we have been\nThe beacon in the globe to be uh the people who say they do give us bringing out you're tired huddled masses\nAnd so we do have to do something about our broken immigration system the answer is not to turn guns on them and the answer is certainly not that close to two thousand mile border between our two countries\nAnd also on the live long joined us use the river in Michael ... which is a consistent our views with his every every once a week\nViews about senior pastor of the first Griffin Baptist church in Harlem and the director of the national average and there were minister division at ... or ... you heard was crossing as you've been here ... have been saying the conversation has been going while people are\nSomewhat concerned about the migrants crashing the borders ... news as ms cross I mean if Donald Trump really going to turn them on these folks I mean is it really there but how we have we gone that far and ... and we really want to valid things so much\nMore of a cross was actually in our state uh because we know that Donald Trump is not only to those those are the same time what is politically expedient whatever can be politically beneficial for him with amused drumming up his\nAnd parents love blinked live feed auction the electric checking from
