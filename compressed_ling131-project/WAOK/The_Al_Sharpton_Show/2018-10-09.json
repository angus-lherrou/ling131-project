A. okay [laughter]\n\n[noise] [laughter]\nJobs and growth\nOf the dot com or go\nTo Vinnie and then [noise] different schools of thought about the Kavanaugh nomination and now confirmation on how it will play in terms of the Democrats and Republicans in the mid term elections\nWhat is what are you hearing and what is your forecast that does point thirty days out so far polls\nQuote unquote liberal judges are on the high court so this is something that is why conservatives were so willing to give this president a bottomless\nBucket of well against time and again this is why the family values party was able to champion someone who was accused of sleeping with corn SARS and sexually assaulting over Fifteen women uh and having a theorists with with playboy bunnies\nAll for for being able to take control of the court um in in addition to a lot of the lower court that he's packed judges have sex with conservative jurists so I'm right now the polling and saying Republicans are celibate story they're United and and they are excited about it\nHowever I caution that the polling doesn't always captured this new electorate who are who are looking at these things with concern and trepidation and now finally seeing how politics and policy will directly impact\nTheir lives just today on the Kavanaugh's birthday they're looking at three cases all around um gun issues for and so I think people are paying attention because honestly I Will give it to the president he has done a multi pronged approach was jamming through his legislation I'm\nEven a putting democracy at peril and so given uh some of the people he's alienated I think there are a lot of college educated white women\nWho are going to hold the line we'll see you know we a lot of people were disappointed in the last election when when white women voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump I think when he gave this rallying cry that this is the time for you to be scared about your sons who can get caught up in this me to lose and I think there were a significant amount of women\nWho saw Dr Ford as as there are a daughter that's this is my daughter could be sexually assaulted by someone um and who was beyond what what are the president has said it is it is something that people should be a cautious of that do work\nWith a a very charismatic charming candidate in Texas and he was leading Ted Cruz and some polls that were neck and neck and now cruises leading him a ... by almost four or five points you also have Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota who was a she's you know North Korea is a very red state she's a democratic senator [noise]\nShe's now falling behind her Republican counterpart on by twelve points and people should not\nUnderestimate some of the voting laws that are happening on the ground that are disenfranchising people in North Dakota is a great example of that it's home to a lot of Native Americans and a justice a court their rules that um they basically they could disenfranchise and Native American community because a lot of Native Americans live on reservations and use the PO box\nAnd a judge there said no that doesn't count you have to have an actual address but that doesn't franchises tens of thousands of of Native Americans there who likely vote Democrat who are fans of Heidi Heitkamp\nUm so I think it's going to be a really a close race or the house I Will say that Democrats will likely takes the house the Senate is going to be a lot more challenging and why that matters because that's where a lot of these um that's where all the confirmation happens when you look at Nikki Haley stepping down\nHer successor will have to be confirmed by the Senate and so if you have Donald Trump's pick someone like John Bolton who this national security adviser who's very hawkish shoes itching for war\nUm if the Republicans control the Senate he will have a very smooth a confirmation process and so I just I don't think a lot of people realize I'm how significant the who controls the house and and the Senate are so I'm calling the house for Democrats the Senate\nI don't know I mean we we could all be surprised because again polling doesn't touch everybody there are a lot of rural black people that are never polled um\nRecent data show that over eighty percent of Latino people have never been contacted by a major statewide campaign\nAll black people that are never poll\nUm recent data show that over eighty percent of Latino people have never been contacted\nBy a major statewide campaign though a lot of these institutions are overlooking the hardcore base I and as long as that keeps happening then you'll keep saying this really close calls I Hope if any candidate third or data especially with our listening reaching out that some of these marginalized communities\nLet's go to a new school to an end to learn of George W key and\nPay 'em I Love a lot of of his knees assessments I Am I kind of disagree with her that um Nikki Haley won't be campaigning for our or much for the Republicans\nAre Nikki Haley will do whatever a Donald Trump tell that to do and um I I uh here in Atlanta there was some talk that she and her husband had sat and I don't know whether somebody else mentioned this I'm kind of relate to the program that she and her husband had gotten into trouble for some very extensive use of airplanes that\nThe prime go over ... years\nOkay okay All right so that and you know that I think might be an end a lot to get one of the underlying reasons for her but she pretty much stand with the wind I I was always impressed with the rural even as I've had some\nAh east Indian students of their skin color in in decision making process for black white\nNikki Haley I'm a native south Carolinians and Nikki Haley um is very fair as complex as compared to the former governor of New Orleans more in Indian looking more Asian looking and when his picture was put up in the new and the Louisiana State house\nHe made them make him quite very distinctly white skin from Nikki Haley isn't quite had that problem she just that perfect blend in east Indians and um so I I think she but she's very accommodating that's that state senator whom you had on early\nI liked his assessment he also had some assessment of Tim Scott Tim Scott went to school right down the block from from my house and he went to a very

wanted to make a comment on the psychological strategy\nThat was behind him at this camp ...\nI'm In I'm confirmation fiasco and also when they end up with a question for you know granted I mean\nSo um I I think I learned the minds of a psychological warfare listening to Trevor Noah I think that's his name on his comments about how he basically said that Trump won us how Trump's successful strategy is offering victimhood to white males\nUm and that's why it cannot be successfully\nAnd that's how Trump's successful strategy is offering victimhood to white males\nUm and that's why it cannot be a success story he claimed he him his status of the victim\nAnd I mean I just got to thinking about that and I was thinking about also on just how they said that this whole fiasco galvanized or or strength that Republicans and ... and ... and all the end of this as far as the ... most successful weaken the trumpet ministries you're\nNot thinking about why why why is it and so then I'm thinking about the reason why I feel like if if if the way that it was found though we all got upset were all listening to this whole situation\nEverybody's watching to see how this scandal and so what basically happened it was ... it was going to be a shoo in front of the ghetto but what happened was this whole thing of ... that started coming in and so now Republicans feel like they got to wear a Democrat it almost feels like the ... and some respect\nAnd sell if I just feel like it's just a whole a psychological thing kind of ... and then just to let us down and my thing is it's just my question to you and Tiffany is\nAh did you feel like that people that have a platform to speak today ... is it wise for them to where you are to engage Trump directly I call him out on the carpet I Try to think of what will the seat that's because there's a lot of the psychological warfare\nAll these things that he's doing a successfully so I just wanted like it's like a direct engagement is going to be successful I mean we talked about this the other day but that's my question\nWell let me say that ... of God but let me say this to me I think that you have illustrated it correctly\nThat uh it is a ... almost a production to a site people up or down and I think that clearly ah I Do not think Donald Trump is a\nPolicy wonk guy do not think he is a and competent president I don't think he is a good businessman\nBut I think he is very savvy and very shrewd on how to promote something even if it's not true and to build a drama for in effect it's and entertainers gear and the build up

remember the big march was about eighty thousand people marched down Fifth Avenue on the side of the march we live in dense started right at your church we started you want to\nA leading ... not the

president now recommending does to Chicago and by inference the rest of the country\nYeah a few things at play it is clear that I'm One who ever presented this idea to the present because I'm not ... it's an idea he may have generated the self up as an aside there\nI don't as he as a president share this I don't think he did any research always given any research on not just the positive that may come and his mind from stop and frisk but the downside of stop and frisk ... thought about\nA issues around cultural sensitivity we saw what happened here in New York City we had to stop and frisk that majority eighty five percent\nI think of the people stop without a black and Latino\nPerson's um although the and tell us a five persons in possession of guns we found is more whites who will stop who actually found with weapons and black and Latino although black ... who wants to stop the most [noise]\nSo I think when he makes that they've been given the the the history of police community relations Chicago given to the ... the racial tensions that exist between the two given which has happened with the comic Donald that case\nI I think it is extremely um foolish to even recommend that which is simply we know red tape and the discord and communities that can also bring more division\nIn a community police relations I mean it's not a good idea wasn't a good idea just to say what I discovered with the president has a tendency to say things one we know without thinking through them and tendency to say things very in a very back handed manner\nUm without any kind of I'm supporting data on understanding bottle which will stop and frisk here with Mayor Bloomberg\nMayor was that his kind of intoxication with metrics and you have persons who get consumed with the metrics the number is what is the data what are the percentage of people who are being arrested without thinking about the social cultural impact\nDo with the metrics the numbers would have to say that what is the percentage of people who are being\nArrested without thinking about the social cultural impact on communities um so you know to hear the president say that I think it was actually kind of reckless and as you say that it's something that\nGets done in Chicago because the present recommended that you open the door the floodgates other communities and now I'm put that practice emotion and it will clearly divide communities that are may already have deep pensions\nAnd that's going on the phone or let's go to Robin in Maryland on serious exam one twenty six\nHello hello how

a rehired on the police force\nA in Bel Air which is right outside of Cleveland in Ohio right now I'm Wondering because the police chief went on a went on air and made a statement in defense of it and and I'm quoting him he says you know it's it's over and done with\nYou know the officer deserves a second chance should not in my thinking I'm saying to myself okay\nHe was fired from his first job as a police officer and the police chief from where he was working\nPut out a statement saying that no amount of training would make him suitable for service in this capacity even get a second job and while I understand that according to the law the land he was acquitted and whatnot and was not charge what makes a police chief who was making decisions on behalf of\nHis police department and the safety of the individual isn't to rethink that each stars and makes them think that he can make a call like that and it not be any other issue appears regardless of whether or not\nPolice department

another you know are you an African American child a young Latino child or young Caucasian or young Asian he's already proven that he cannot be make those types of decisions\nRegardless of whether or not the law says that he broke it or not\nSo my question is what is in the mindset of police chief who's in a position where an internationally known officer who shoots and on a ... a a\nYou know are you can be brought onto your police force and my second question is if I find out that the police men who commits a crime like that in another county in the city and other states shows up in my city county and he is potentially going to be running around you know policing me and my kids like what do I tell you that\nWell I think you are absolutely right Chris or as I said earlier Carolyn

shooting [noise] can exactly even though he was not prosecuted as you said the grieving and police chief said he could never be trained to be an office so\nThe only reason that does a police chief in this little town would hire him is to make cuts arrogant statement of insensitivity and it should not go on checked and it should not go on address\nI don't care what kind of civil suit or anything

priorities in the wrong place\nAnd we allow anger interview and jealousy there take center stage and instead of camaraderie fellowship and really coming together on issues of impact talked me out of the you know you know there was a point where ever raised earlier and talking about the Philadelphia in Philadelphia\nWith the unions and stuff and when I when I Wonder if they always stands out to me is that the caller talked about you know what I asked mark and politicians\nIn Philadelphia with the unions and stuff [noise]\nAnd when I when I Wonder if they always stands out to me is that\nThe caller talked about you know African politicians [noise] you know how you are out of office and I think in both cases we were committed to certain issues we want to get certain issues out to the forefront that impact in our communities but people forget that that person not whether it be black or white like teen doesn't matter for many of them their primary agenda is to get reelected\nYep so the the idea is it doesn't matter who's in some cases who's damaged who's left behind as long as they're\nReelected that's why you know you give credit where credit's due to the woman in North Dakota ...\nYou know he ... her decision was based on her integrity what was right it wasn't about whether it was a Republican no she thought it was wrong she says she was going to vote yes until she saw his race she saw his behavior she size actions [noise] and she didn't know that that's going to damage her she knows that more than likely he won't win\nIn her primary because of this but for her it was about doing what's right are watching this morning I let maybe last night say how her mother was a victim of sexual assault to what you start making decisions based on integrity passion and commitment it transcend is how we make decisions based on what's politically expedient and they're too many people\nIn politics will only make politically expedient decisions not decisions based on was morally right or based on a deeper sense of conscious and integrity is always was politically expedient and that is what's kept knock democracy\nAnd you know a a a person told me when I was very young that\nIs better to lose standing up for what you believe and where you are about than the wind having to be somebody else could you didn't win any way you with somebody else\nAnd you can lose\nA if you remain faithful to you and your ... but you can win if you got to go against that\nAnd again you're calling and your purpose in order to win you having one because you know longer you and I think that uh the the other thing that you touch the bond is that we have too many people that have no purpose\nAnd have no sense of calling and they are not being a position of service elected an unelected\nOr you know already I've had people that are entertaining running for president in twenty twenty\nCome to see me came to our convention in April ... song and the first question I ask you know everybody else they said bill how are you going to win first question I ask you what do you want to be president for what is your ...\nAnd I don't care about your ... to ... if you're paying for the big three does not deal with the thing that I've given my life for\nTheir you do there you go you just said that we that you know when you run for those where you go to Canada endorsement may David things\nThat the first question I asked you know it was your pat how do you see a path to victory well that's not the issue is what is your vision what does the narrative that has grounding you what is what is galvanizing your sense of purpose and tear integrity and character and we don't ask those questions anymore because the person has position\nUm that makes them eligible to run for office no it does not because for president it does not\nI don't care who the person is just because you're a politician one of the Senate or governor does that mean you could easily be qualified for the president what if the narrative the transcendent narrative that you have that can now see the men this warned it nation in a divisive time period\nVan and Milwaukee man you're keeping it real would walk round and shopped\nAs a job yeah ... have you looked at related\nOh we're on his shop is Al Sharpton yeah Benjamin happy ... birthday thank you and happy\n... Jesse Jackson I mean you know I might have you ever in Chicago and everything [noise] mhm and um [noise] I made and everything I like the show I've I've lived with a list of those for a long time she started ... years ago but you know a real problem just like you said is a integrity\nAccountability and character and all that nobody yeah there'll be a way I guess\nYou know it's the same thing but you know I'm going to underground work but some August ...\n... the word doesn't get out and now I'm a I'm trying to figure out a way to just no make this place a better place goes no more get a big place where I guess is one that says over the world what we do all this manufacturing technology our stuff and then um\nWhen they come to a job where you know help with where they got all these Amazon's all that stuff but we have no real uh no\nUh no passes so we'll get to hear because now I guess we have so lazy 'cause it's owned by ... and they have shown to black privilege it just like you know the doping August of drugs you know but some people do like our age and you know you see some and then when I first my first", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Al Sharpton Show", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "09"}
