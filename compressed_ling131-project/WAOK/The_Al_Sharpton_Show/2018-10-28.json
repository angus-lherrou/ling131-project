Thirteen eighty W. A. okay they'll voices community called in for a for a due to seven zero three going to get all my forget him\nYou know a ... and teaching blessings to you John now the there'll be a okay family issue would vote against the one that we had this discussion many many tragic for is you know I Would never vote white supremacy or its tenants\nI only have to deal with it\nUnder duress as do the majority of people in this state and in this country I but what made me think about this concept\nWas the origin I Try to go to the origins most banks and my thought was do\nYou know who invented the voting machine\nGo ahead and tell us getting\n[noise] ah his name is the last ... it was invented in Eighteen Ninety eight ah Jacob I'm Sorry a Jacob Myers or he who he was the one who packed into the ... work\nAnd for the organized voting machine and the thing that really made me think about the origin is why is it and you being a young man maybe you can ask you this question why is it that we don't value\nOur ancestors input and involvement in uh the the society in which we ... what is it do you believe our people have to do with this process of voting and its origin\nOr I'm confused by your point getting because our ancestors fought in God and got bit by dogs and hoses and all this\nAnd it's ... I'm I'm\nConfused by your point getting because our ancestors fought and died and got bit by dogs and hoses and all these other things in order to have the vote and I feel like you just you and others who proceed on this course was saying we don't need to vote this honor their legacy\nWell see you're talking about the conformist need grows ... death white people's as their schools are better their houses are better their way of life is better these are individual is that the popular media media\nUh use as a to a psychological to to make the rest of us think that because these people want it to live with the white man and ... and become a part of his system that they are the heroes and she rolls of our community I beg to differ\nDad than many people that have shown that they not only hated the intrusion of this uh the he's in into our communities but real world view were Rick host\nAt his involvement and and and colonization\nOf them and their access was\nGetting given given your presumption or giving your position let's at all but we'll take your position stop vote him and then they let David Duke could be the new governor they ah let you know a\nLot of John or William ... Sherman to somebody or or or for us to be the new mayor and then they put you back in ... they put you back in slavery theirs are beating upside the head again and then you'll say well thank God we didn't vote\nBecause now the people who really hate us have all the power and they don't have to worry about is what is that who is your in game and telling people not devote\nWell this is the thing that you have failed to realize based on the uh manipulation of your mind through media we're still on slavery we're still\nUh the for the last hired first fired what\nThey've done is broken up our family through the political process and they are going to think that they have been marginalized dude that historical culture which many of them know nothing about so the endgame for me is to understand my history my heritage\nMy ancestry and being in this country you have found that you don't even recognize the\nImportance of your name\nOf your the name of your access to the legacy of your ancestors and you think the only end goal is to join in with the people that hate you is that true or not you\nKnow get a look do you get to a point where it's either get off the ... so if you're saying that you don't be part of the American system what do I always tell you leave\nBut otherwise either have to be involved you know if you're not involved or you can't complain to all the things that you were saying if you're not voting you have no say in it you have no you have no reason to complain because you're not part of the solution you can sit in the corner crying and complaining all you want but if you're not really willing to do anything to fix it\nThen it just there's just a like a chart we'll call it\nYou're just not only are making making random noises pertain to wind up and you're talking about not say anything\nBut that's the best in our lives that they told you the ones who have nothing to say are the ones who vote for a very a system that has bomb poisoned corrupted\nEnslaved or molested our people on on a daily basis when you vote for something that means you supported the people who do not support it are the ones who don't vote for who do not ah who a system\nYou supported the people who do not support it are the ones who don't vote for who do not ... who are systematically\nProject their own ideals versus the ones who support the oligarchy who control the voting system it's all based on money and the ... system is run by the corporate entities that control this that the economic engine of this country\nWill get in if you if you dislike capitalism why don't you give me your money\nI mean aren't that socialism isn't it you give me your money I spend with us the appropriate or give you back what you think he should have if you don't like a democracy then go to a country that's a dictatorship see how well that works out well you'll like it not having any say in what happens politically\nBut this is what you'd never you didn't get to the issue of what I said about how this country compromise is your thought process in thinking that if you vote for it then you somehow have a voice that vote means to you have no voice and vote means that you are going oh\nYou are a whiz what ever does come up country comes up with not voting says that you can support your own interest in a fashion that would be antithetical to the oligarchy debt control of this country\nSo you know getting so let me put it this way let's say that the you don't vote they elected a new mayor and city council who decides to use eminent domain to take your house and turn it into a dog park at that point at how have held has you know voting benefitted you in any way shape or form\nAnd let me answer that briefly is by letting you know our children now our community now in our people know we need to farm in alliance\nAgainst this corrupt system that would destroy us right now we're under the false impression that if you joined assistance than it used to put the ... over\nThe human trafficker this how you got over here through human trafficking that child molester that somehow you putting a person in the system that they created\nI eat who invented the voting system itself and the voting machine the people who are crushed you will change it is not running changes\nYou know you you realize voting started in Africa right\nNo it didn't touch it\nAbsolutely did I was out of the uh a lot of new being timid this the first recorded voting in history\nGreeks and the Romans got it from the Persian to get it from Africans you can date it all the way back\nThe European system is older guard is not older Garfunkel but monarch goal\nThey had other patron or either primal janitor to pass down rule or double con with using the Carol Indian Empire to divide property between the oldest sons of the monarch and that's why they spent\nThough the campaigns always that way they broke or is it like oh my God there's nothing we can do how can we help you but when the white strategist comes down from DC or from New York or the L A media company they said they can cut to the commercial that you need in order to win\nThe pockets open note these campaigns don't mind paying white folks to help them when little uncover so when it comes to pay and black folks who organized the community to really get out there that is when they want you to do the whole thing for free\nYeah and and I think that'd be that'd be nice if they want you to volunteer you know I'm Charlie volunteer and you know I never got paid for the work I really did do so I volunteer for too much and as far as you know the the church is concerned I'm almost eight years I'm somewhat spiritual\nBut er I think that the churches would say a philosophy has done a bit this service but at the same time they are necessary to especially when it comes to politics and apple candidate a politician don't take gas around wanting them buses and he's still got to flip the past a hundred dollars just to get him and okay\nIn my house they knew enough to four hundred dollars that that just ain't gonna happen we're talking about Fifteen hundred the start everyone who's a real DOT when we're talking about when I was trying to make when they had to\nSee how that Robert Blake of going in a rhythm of us on the weekend for the weekend but I mean he could run a of a bust their answer about what like a thirty five dollars a day\nYeah but but the ... the issue is that they aren't doing any of those things often and campaigns they feel that they can just spend all the money on TV and radio ads Internet ads and may put up some signs somewhere instead of actually doing the ground war\nThey feel that they can just spend all the money on TV and radio ads Internet ads and may put an assigned somewhere instead of actually doing the ground war they taste weird groundwork wins campaigns that's what Republicans who won't ... you know what\nI I ran and a couple of campaign\nAnd and that is right and I'm going to tell you this when I was a kid\nThat was the place down the street from where we go to Sam spear died and when that was his pockets you never really did anything for black people but every time he got rid of a lot of the phone is you have a fish that you get a sandwich in a coal mother beer that yeah\nAnd he came to the polls and if they're not willing to do that and they don't need to be complaining after all the way they need to like I don't know\nWhat ... ... you're exactly correct and and so this was the the future of democratic campaigning has to be the path\nBecause that's used to be how you ran campaigns they used to be how you organize and strategize in order to win now since these white folks who come down with their you know they'll show you it never fails they will show up\nAnd you know Dalton, Georgia or somewhere down\nIn a ... an apple electrical or something and they'll send a little white boy down with them a coke bottle glasses robbing a Tesla when our pad and he'll walk into a bar or to a breakfast spot\nAnd everybody there is wearing camouflage or shot guns and then he had these talking points from DC like what we need to talk about the Paris climate accord and we need to talk about the importance of global warming and also the Iran nuclear deal\nAnd they lose because the Democrats feel like they need to tell you what to think\nInstead of listening to what you want in responding to that and then be ended up ... votes out\nIf there were interpreted demographics like if you want to get his that was like an hour and then the innate hunting here you need a truck if you have to wait for the weekend and by pat camouflage on the I mean they just don't know the guy and not by everybody around the coffee\nAnd that's exactly what ... worked on Republican campaigns worked on democratic campaigns\nAnd that's what Republicans are good at doing that we do and they'll go down to the trailer parks and they will go door to door in the trailer park and make sure that every single person who's registered and that they're turning out Democrats on the other hand will not show up in the bluff\nThey will not show up in the swat\nThey will not show up whether voters are at an effort to motivate those voters to turn out with a compelling message they won't have the the buses running round only let you need they need and I'm hoping they changed it for this year and I feel like we tell them maybe they will listen maybe they will see the glory of the lord and realize there need\nTo get out there and talk to the right to vote this thing called ...\nOr you work with if they want to get elected to listen\nAnd I I agree ... will be back after the break news and talk Thirteen eighty W.

for you and got my cell number call me I Will thank you thank you\nAll right look I told your black Republicans and playing with your your keep sending back reading those poll numbers see what happens y'all gonna be some sitting right there like a not on a log just like in twenty sixteen they now going back and forth with your heart going across the aisle\nJoining us now from the New Georgia project miss him say just lost it already who fought miss him say who fought joining us right now I Want to thank you so much for um for joining us and ... and part of the reason I wanted to have a bipartisan\nOn this is my goal is to just get black folks voting just get them out there getting them to the polls make sure that they are motivated to have access to the register and I don't really care which candidate you vote for I'm not the person who I Am not partisan portable form an independent so\nI don't care if you vote for him I don't care if we go for Abrams on care if you vote with libertarian but I really do want to make sure that we get people out here in motivated to vote so what\nYou've overkill on here we've over Abrams on care of you wrote with libertarian but I really do want to make sure that we get people out here in motivated to vote so what do you think the um\nThe primary thing that people need to concentrate on in order to make sure that they have the ah that were these people are motivated these people are out here at the polls people out here ready willing and able to get anything done on November says\nNo problem\nOr a hold on just I think we're having an issue with your Mike someone you're getting ... to fix it so it's his hold on we'll go to Todd on the line and they'll come back to you once we figure out what we don't think just 'cause it's like a radio station that anything works in here are the things that are being from top to argue there\nCan you hear taught either I I mean look\n[laughter] this is what you know look this what happens on a Sunday want to try and do something positive so friday when we were talking about the the prostitution Reagan Fort valley everything worked we have no issues with nothing\nAuto mode where all the [laughter] everything was clear everything was fine so don't want to talk about get out the vote that also brings ... we got you know\nI don't think we also were important\nThings because they realize that when it from a viewer TV lesson from the Democrats\nSo wanting to Georgia project is a nonpartisan organization we've registered three hundred thousand people in all one hundred and fifty nine of Georgia's counties um and that African Americans Latinos Asian Americans young white Georgians\nUm and I think what people need to know is that while yes Georgia has a long and a recent history of voter suppression\nAh that it is absolutely important that you get out and vote 'em and even the entire ballot um we have never been just about voter registration so since the beginning the idea was to say I treat\nInformed confident voters or to close the ratio voter registration gap here in Georgia\nI and we're really proud of the work that we're doing and you can see if they're out in the early voting numbers and the turnout unless we're talking about historic rates two hundred percent over the two thousand at fourteen\nUm election so I'm really encouraged and on both sides of the aisle as he earlier point I'm so this is going to be a battle of the bases and it's gonna be a turnout battle um and again despite Brian camps failures as the secretary of state and\nThe vulnerabilities in Georgia's election system uh people are still turning out an historic numbers and what really encouraged by that\nThey know what I Love about the idea of having a bipartisan organization working on these issues is that\n... that this was the best way to fight voter suppression or ... the ... the idea of Republicans doing voter suppression is is not a perception or Alan ... the reality of of them will be the party pushing voted for the suppression is to\nHave your base to be bipartisan that if there was no black folks were registered as Republicans or or voted Republican than all of a sudden you don't have to worry about and try to suppress the black vote after now they have a they have a a a rod and the fire now they have a ... to the game on\nAnd I mean I think it's also important just when we think about power and when we think about agendas and how to move\nThat way for me to the game on\nThat absolutely um I mean I think it's also important just when we think about power and when we think about agendas and how to move and agenda\nOr less than Georgia is the first state or will be the first state in the deep south with the white minority African Americans and Latinos and in a pie I Georgia's are going to make up the majority of Georgians in just about six years\nSo by twenty twenty four ah people of color will make up the majority of Georgia is what is that George and going to look like\nAnd what does that multiracial multiethnic Georgia what are the leaders going to look like are they going to come from the communities they represent the majority of Georgians are they going to be accountable to those communities when it comes time to make decisions about the the states policies and the and the state's politics\nUm and that's what we care about we care about building power in communities that are underserved an underrepresented\nAll right after the ... Maria Fisher ah also from the from the right side of the aisle to go for the geo TV ever\nHave in say a still with us made her to even go and join us a couple of minutes wherever great broad conversation the goal is getting mold black folks voted and I don't care who you vote for\nUm and so our response to that as we are going to fail twenty or buses with college students and we're seeing from across the region taking them to vote\nIn oh I Love the I Love the competition now as of this because while Georgia project is working on this or to get ... from developing voters to get more African Americans for the poll you have to buy for services will just start saying we're going to be phone banking knocking on doors\nI liked the idea of people fighting for the black vote I liked the idea of both parties having to not just say well this is my basis was who I'm voting for\nBut rather being able to say well look we're both wanted to go after the black vote in I live in a ... we'll talk about after break OK I I'd I'd like the the concept an idea of competition reading that I won't vote for he's a really\nCome through for the black vote mix of promises and then make some things happen but we'll be back after the break there was a ...

I mean we economic development is an umbrella term like what does that actually mean because if you I supporting that charm tax cuts and\n... ... over trillion dollars in tax has with NO PLAN to pay for it um what exactly is your plan for economic development\nWhat part of the economic development ideas you know if you talk to Bruce ... who's a a region for advocate for the small business association\nThere was also Ashley Bell who's the southern region director for the small business association African American from Atlanta no black ... black do who are really in what they're doing is going around educating small businesses on how to become bigger businesses of educating them on\nA finance educating them on how to get access to loan how to connect with other businesses to solidify you supply chain I think those are things that need it and I don't ... and I don't care what part of the labels on it I don't I I ... I think sometimes\nWe see politics in the black community the same way we see football or like mama falcon fan of your thanks fan so everything you do with the St fan is evil\nInstead of just seeing it as was all just a game you can take the logos all and let's just listen to get the ball the cross the line instead of worrying about what team a ...\nYear early appoint the idea that race is a stand and for tribes for ethnicity or as a tribal isn't so why and I am are they shared interests amongst black Americans and what are they\nWell I I think the point of shared interest is there are certain pinpoint certain oppressive points that no matter where you are on the political spectrum\nYou can find out real quick you're black or stop and frisk you stop and frisk say a police lineup police violent police brutality racial profiling or you're not you're not getting the job because you're the only black do who applied\nA college admissions are public schools are and\nHow they affect us so involving housing decisions housing environmental race ... mortgages there are so many points where we can all disagree as black folks these things affect us and nobody asked you know what the cops so put you put a ... who'd you vote for twenty ... well ... ...\nAnd these things affect us and nobody asked you know what the cop so put you put a Billy club all sides you'll hear him say who'd you vote for twenty ... well ... ... I think we can work together and just address those issues and just look to other Republicans\nIf you do this\nI'm here for you come on back I'll be right there were few with my with my ... my head on the Democrats want to or if you want to do this I'll have my I Will hurt T shirt on I'll get out there and and I will knock it out the park for you for that nobody's cover for what the what they're going to have a nominee our own candidate\nAnd I don't care I don't care because these are the points that we are trying to do we we have to get out of this idea of\nWhen you get try ballistic about it and then that means you are you have on dying of genetic limit the genetic attachment to one side of the other versus a rational idea of what are what they used to happen\nI think that um like senators and have become much more sophisticated absolutely high\nAnd so I think that you know they're definitely and space for people to I Can't evaluate candidates\nWho share their values and who will have demonstrated a willingness to be accountable to their base and I think that that goes that extends beyond party labels their tons of people who you know where that your team's Jersey that were you know identify as Democrats\nWho have been hostile and\nSaid black Georgian said black communities um and so I I think as as voters to have more sophisticated as we have more superdelegates\nThan if like people and people of color as more people more women begin to run for office themselves um I think that we will definitely witness that shift\nThis you know this low point though I made um I think Thursday on the show I we're probably going to the care of this over into the uh after the break but do you think that the Democratic emphasis on women and black women running black girl magic and the importance of the black women vote\nWill end up driving a lot of older black males to the other side of the aisle because I I Believe Trump will get thirty percent of the black male vote in twenty twenty\nI can definitely see it happening I can see and I think of the people keep saying the con you a a meeting with Trump was crazy it wasn't crazy at all it wasn't a rant\nHe was making very specific points and when he said the hat makes me feel like a man made me feel like a superhero that I didn't really feel the armed with her a a\n... face and that sort of like men is access no no I'm not saying that they're they're ... or they don't support a woman do nothing they won't\nSupport a woman I I think I I think that the knee jerk reaction of when you listen to them saying you hit them with a a a thing as part of the credit missing it's a mistake when you start\nThrowing out sexism massaging these you know phobia homophobia trans phobia\nOf what they're doing in the right thing to you their opinion or how they feel about things\nYou're automatically minimizing their thoughts and their feelings you're almost viewing them ... to them by saying well you disagree with me the your father and your sexist massaging us and that's why you end up in the shadow proper who will say well I hate number forty five Cheetos stolen and so forth and then they'll go through the whole\nWell how are you man\nFor the good pretty good I like to commend the sister representation of er physician and now I think one of the ... foot four\nWhere the argument that um if you had to her brother was that her response was that you can't afford a party who openly tried to suppress the vote and put obstacles in your past\nAnd I thought it was kind of spring that you didn't ask the rubber Republican rather conservative brother who came on talking about do you address that particular issue in the knocking on doors to the explaining why the part that he represents putting all these obstacles in front of all\nOf black people ability to vote\nYou know what I mean I thought that was kind of you know how the springs to a degree\nAnd also believe that one of the things that you talked about was black leadership and the failure of some black leadership I like to feel your audience that we've been on the white leadership for three hundred you know because we get one two or three black leader who don't live up to their potential\nOr live up to their their fair or what potential as far as we're concerned that we don't give up on black leadership and begin to say any leadership matter reality of it is we've had white leadership for all of these years and we've gotten in the position that we've gotten in\nA because there were some strong black leaders and a few white leaders who came to the support are sort of decency and a lot of black America to participate as far as why we don't see a common interest anymore we come out of a history of a common enemy ever since we came out of the civil rights movement era\nAs far as why we don't see a common interest anymore we come out of a history of a common enemy ever since we came out of the civil rights movement era\nOr the segregation then we got this special group among us the so called conservatives who think that hopefully that such an asinine argument that he's presenting I think he said something about businesses\nAnd are doing this doing that\nThat are going to it so we because what you want to try is that there are no democratic business you\nKnow democratic business owners so if the Democrats if there if you look at like ... what I like about this she says she has three dozen support what's your what's your position you know what you're saying and the reality of it is she's a hundred percent ... percent troll because they are Democrats that own multi big business is\nIs it is the issue that they want to get their money and the Republicans only wants to save the money\nWhy does why does it the Democratic businessman promote positive on the fair tax it but the Republican Democrat Republican man well all the taxes you know what I'm trying to say it doesn't make any sense history dental supported their big businesses on both sides if people don't promote\nA education on both I think I Would say he taught about education as if they don't promote education on the Democratic side and he wants to find a great comfort in that finally the Republicans had enough sense to give him some money to go knock on some level\nThat's a lot of ... ... ... my point is been around\nI don't care what side is doing I'm not taking a partisan position\nOn it I'm not saying go vote for the Republican or Democrat within hours later I Know a sweater\nOr what I hear your questions ... and I hear your professional out at different route us than that I hear you saying that like just like she hear you matter that you said a couple of thousand she's sitting there ready to explode because you can you tell you one thing but if you listen to what you're saying you're clearly without a shadow of a doubt\nPushing toward the conservative over the phone because\nYou're going to jump on it that's the case why would I have both sides of the aisle on the show ...
