A. okay\nRichard you to be real with Jones Austin shop [noise]\nUm yeah I might be a little off the subject but the ah we're talking about the schools and how the schools weren't getting enough money and er here in Kansas City they have spent billions on the inner city schools\nAnd a dad has done nothing except get them a an accredited and I think the problem lies in kid's not going to school\nThey're not getting an education is not that it's not being offered it so that it's not important\nAnd education is the the the most important thing because if you if you look at a you know low education rates you always find high crime and that's that's what no education gets as high crime\nWell first of all I think that part of the key to education is information and your information is wrong or they have not spent billions of dollars in in the city in Kansas City and in fact if you look at the breakdown of public funds\nToward education in Kansas City they have spent more money in the district than in the in the city so I agree with you about education\nAnd I would uh be seeds that you educate yourself to the facts because there's a new billions of dollars have been spent on public education in Kansas City when you check out the\nFacts are true ... well I Know I'm not sure that we have this is not a game called debatable come these facts\nThat they are not here our daughter is a new has their so called an ... year after year after year they have ... billion now you can say they are hidden center that doesn't make a true sir\nThe board of education in Kansas City and not the city has gotten billions that's one but I'm specifically about Kansas City 'cause we don't work there and that is not true\nThere's been studies about the disproportionate amount of our funds were distributed that's just the fact so you can\nTry to how do we all you want or cable not I'll give it to the board\nEnded a board doesn't give it to the school\nYou don't use it to the ... you could give it to the boy now if you want to say that many of the boards I've not done with the shooting could do I would agree with that but less we don't have to distort facts to make a point\nThank you number one it's a let's go to be in Texas on serious exam one twenty six beat\nA correction is Pete Pete Pete All right\n... thank you for taking my call I Want to come in and look I think yes okay I'm a a ... year old Hispanic male or at least in Texas a and I grew up in inner city\nA fifth border actually but uh and I kind of know what kind of what was coming from I think his intentions were good I just like someone said earlier I just think that the wrong person was was set to to do the job or to to take the message or I don't know if you've ever\nI just think that the wrong person was was sent to to do the job\nOr to to take the message or I don't know if you remember a right after Kim Kardashian went and had a and spoke to Trump and had a Magic Johnson are released from prison I called you and I suggested that you go talk to him about the problem in Chicago\nAnd ah if I remember correctly you said that he didn't want to do it because she thought it would be a a just a photo op for a President Trump to have you there [noise]\nAnd uh I still think that you would be the right person to go in and and get something done um you know I think America sees you know like the Democrats\nAre you guys care more about you know kids in cages and uh you know legal immigrants in cages are but no one's shooting at those kids and they're getting fat every day\nUh kids in Chicago or get fed every day and you know they're they're having to go through all of this so I think you know I think something needs to be done and needs to be the right personal set to get it\nDone well and ... uh I don't recall you call them but if you did I said you then I Would go as long as he would meet with me and other heads of national civil rights organizations and in fact when Donald Trump called me and asked me to meet with him after he got elected\nI said to him on the phone and he confirmed that he called me that I Would meet with him if I could bring the president of the New York of the national Urban League in ACP\nI did not want to go and have a photo op I wanted to have a real substantive meat and he said well I don't know about that I Know you I said but this is not about us knowing each other's about getting something done he did not do that\nHe had ... who was working for him at the time come down convention and asks me to meet alone I Would not do that because I think that it would be only used as I think kind da and Jim Brown is being used a day for photo ops\nSomeone needs to ask an intelligent question of missed the west and Mr
