I was called you Reverend Sharpton you're right river Williams um I think this is a message that they're spending but this is the same message that the president has been sending\n'em the past two years ah this is a method that people like Brian ... percent and even um the Santa has in Florida\nI'm In I'm not sure if you've seen the debate or the conversation but Andrew ... acknowledge the fact that hey like I'm I'm black you know like you made this entire let her about that um I think that these are in which they are they're\nOpenly\nIn unapologetically said you know that's the message that they've been sending in people who believe in them\nAnd believe in their message thing you know what they're talking about it but I'm actually going to do something about it um and uh that's what the extremely frightening for me\nAll right let's go to the phone line if they're open up now it's seven seven five three to five seven nine seven let's go to North Carolina ex someone twenty six line to talk to James James you're keeping a room with Reverend Al Sharpton you got married and Charles Williams\nYeah I wanted to comment in regards to the bottom ... I think the whole thing's a hoax set up by the left wing liberal here want you just said one I'm ready to go each person that got those bombs supposedly from a right wing that you don't know you don't still don't have any clue about what it was\nBut none of those people in the mail if he's going to hurt somebody what would you say that George or if it doesn't open mail and also if you look hard film television each one of those packages I showed that was mailed to somebody none of them were canceled while I work at Wal Mart to stamp counseled on ... and also you want to talk about Donald Trump\nOr spread and I uh I think you guys need to go look Hollywood which is run by liberals they spread more ... more fear more about ... anybody I've never used to criticize name so take that wrong with it\nYou know I ... I think he seems to be done um literally I don't know Donald perfect never\nAnything ... has not said or done anything positive he stood before\nI'm the world's in at publicly announced it president it's supposed to be a neutral\nAnd it's supposed to represent all people and said before the world and knowledge the fact that he was a national his and other terms a white nationalist now at the woman of color\nWho is in this country who is a taxpayer who could volunteer or be drafted to serve in in in in this country um I I I signed it since the fact that he does not represent me instead of representing me in all Americans what he's done is\nI I signed it since the fact that he does not represent me instead of representing me in all Americans what he's done is openly than divisive\nI'm against women's rights and women's progression against the progression of people of color I'm against it in an attack on at like I can literally go on and attack and the progression of the middle class and working citizens in this country nothing that he does\nIs positive nothing that he says it's positive everything is divisive and I find that extremely problematic and I think Robin Williams using why some people don't understand is because they hold more privileged and others as you can identify\n'em with Donald Trump then you feel that everything he says is true because he's not saying anything against you but if you are a woman or a person of color and cannot identify with Trump on a racial level as financial level\nWhere do you\nDo in the community\nWere warm

to\nFive seven nine seven once again that number's eight seven seven five three to five seven nine seven we we've been talking about\nIn this hour in the last couple of hours many of its been talking about two things they both tied together\nVoting and bombs how does the voting and bombs tied together will ah many people have seen as you've been watching the television or in the last two days that bombs are starting to show up at people who apologized who are are connected to\nA liberal movement or progressive movements or some of these folks like Maxine Waters a Brock Obama many others who have received these have been a vocal about liberal causes as well as black lives matter and so many other issues\nAnd here we are twelve days from an election\nAnd we know who's been\nOut there sending smoke signals\nTo the crowd of people are who are just downright white supremacist that's just beyond as we don't have to sugar coated or shaded are the folks who they've been trying to get coal and dog whistle to running around with Confederate flags and all that mess\nAnd uh uh now now now it's starting to come back and bite him it happened in Charlottesville and God Forbid anybody actually gets messed up over one of these bombs I mean\nA twelve days away are we going to be able to get rid of him eight seven seven five three to five seven nine seven Jennifer Jones Austin number that you first and then I'll go to the phone lines\nAnd they totally than to break you were helping to um you are outlining many parallels that are present now in connection with bombs and and voting you know looking at where we were\nA in a fifty fifty five sixty years ago and you spoke about civil rights stuck the voting rights\nAnd he took that police brutality and I just wanted to add to that list economic injustice and\nIt's talk of the voting rights I'm used to joke about police brutality and I just wanted to add to that list economic injustice\nAnd the issue of jobs and wages and you know and um and and the and the push for a ... uh affirmative\nAction and the understanding that uh\nPeople of color had been discriminated against for so long in this country dating back to slavery that we did not really have\nA an equal shot at opportunity in the same way that uh Caucasians did\nEven with the civil rights act even with the voting rights act and so you know that is in large part what are the if you will the right wing anger is all about right now that you you know you have to ... percent of the premises you have\nA you know conservative people a right wing people who feel very strongly that they are not getting their share of the pie anymore because the pie is being cut up\nA you know and it's it's having to be spread out among too many people and that you know those who have not you know why people have not gotten the head you know many feel very strongly it's because\nPeople of color have stepped in and have taken their jobs have taken the opportunities that should rightfully be there so we got to just add that parallel to the mix because that was the concern way back when\nHe that's why you to oppose the war 'cause you could go you go economics economics matter of three to five seven nine seven let's go to Virginia\nAbout ... ... someone twenty six and not go to line I talked to Brenda Brenda you know keeping the real world river now and you've got Jennifer Jones Austin and Robin Williams\nRobin Williams and high on his Jones Allison how are you I Love my friend did you get the magazine I just got it\nWonderful wonderful ah it's so good to speak with you all um first you know um I I certainly want to tell the listeners we we've certainly got to get out and vote but um you know but we also have to decide I Will just listen to a lot of the the comics from the listeners but we do have to decide\nUm but either we're going to talk about it\nOr we're going to work and make a change you know I I Do agree on that we must say especially ... and ah with these bombs was we certainly got to stay vigilant\nUm but we also but I also believe that we can do both we can stay vigilant but we have to stay focused\nOn how we can go about making change and you know I hear a lot of people talk about how we need to go about making change you know I I have shared with Robin out um for some time there's been a while now\nAbout a a a situation that I'm I've been working on it say discrimination case harassment in retaliation at Mississippi State university and a white man defended a black man on discrimination and in the white made became a target\nAnd he lost his job\nUh Fifteen Years he was employed with Mississippi State but I'm gonna tell you after months of pushing back um use it was silly and gauge me\nThey because they at first they refused to give us a seat at the table to come in to talk\nBut uh after pushing back was engagement they are now allowed or allowing us to be able to come in because first of all he was Raleigh terminated because there is a federal investigation\nThe age ... they are now allowed or allowing us to be able to come in because first of all he was Raleigh terminated because there is a federal investigation going on with ELC but we will be going in and open the twelve\nI'm On ... and I'm sitting down and speaking but I Want to say and I say all this because this way this is a white man in Mississippi and his family in Mississippi\nThey Donald Trump supporters but they have witnessed firsthand the ugliness it just a bit of a what black people have dealt with and then talking with me and me talking with them they have you that's changed\nTheir views have changed the this is what we do have to do about bringing about change it don't take but war and um and we you know and I want to say to the listeners\nUm you know he's actually going to be with me on the call Nelson show at five o'clock on the white male whale the black male if if you will be called up what he had endured on that ah at Mississippi State and what he had been through\nSo I certainly hope you opportunity in that W O L at fourteen fifty or in in DC but um we we can talk about it all day but we don't work and and make sure that we stick with it and make a change and I'm In Virginia\nThese people in Mississippi and I'm only talking to me on my phone and email thank you\nYeah yeah thank you so much burned a reprise you go you know I I think burned his point is is is well taken Jennifer ... a sitter Sharpton said Mary Pattison\nWe have to translate burning reason why make the translation that these bombs are white supremacy bombs because these bombs being white supremacy bombs these folks who are targeting folks\nThese are white supremacy bombs the reason why make that determination is because he he's directly connected to how we got the right to vote and how we keep the right to vote right and so we had to go food bombs to get the right to bow\nNow we see here in two thousand anytime we seeing
