do you think this run may ranked in the annals of college football\nI've never ... on what happened to them like this where there are just straight thing every body maybe those old or Nebraska and Oklahoma teams in the big age where the rest of the team didn't hold up but\nAlabama's got a track record here we know how good the program as we know teams are playing I'm not one of those\nWho is going to bath schedule because I don't think it's that bad they're not playing it UCF schedule they're playing an essay the schedule so I think it's happening\nTo juggle by law gives them perhaps the best pastor they had during the Nick Saban era he's the best player on the best team but really be a victim of his own success when it comes to the Heisman race\n[noise] yeah no I mean I think he's going like this or he's going to win at the issue is\nHow I Am very pretty damn [laughter] I saw him last week again a Texas and he still may have been the best player on the field even though they lost but nobody's talking about rain asking for that twenty five touchdown passes a lot of people there think still may end up being the best quarterback\nThat highest states ever had and that thing a mouthful uh considering that he's probably going to go out for the draft after this season have having an unbelievable so even if I had and I'm not I'm not a draft expert for the fire the draft today he'd be my number one quarterback taken\nYou've had three great quarterbacks to you know if you said either one I'd say at this point okay I I totally see that between ... the guys you just mentioned and another guy he was kind of creeping into this conversation a little at the wide receiver spot ... of Colorado He's probably a shoo in for the ... the ... award how far off to see in that conversation\nYeah the receivers don't win it much um because they don't touch the ball is often it's some of the other skilled players ... and all they solve outta wouldn't be a undefeated at this point without and he's a great story he put this year alone\n... has played a the wildcat a quarterback flock receiver tight and are lined up as a receiver obviously and and run the ball as well\nAnd you leave the country and catches per game and and yards per game for Colorado teams I mentioned that undefeated he is he is that a factor for them and the fact that Colorado undefeated you know he might be their best chance of staying undefeated\nUndefeated he is he is that a factor for them and the fact that Colorado undefeated you know he might be their best chance of staying undefeated tonight in 'em and you have the\nDog would then is done on CBS Sports dot com or about midway through the season that that turning point a Alabama's clearly the number one team of the nation and the top four pretty settled and then you also have Notre Dame certainly in that conversation as well how far though is the gap between the top four teams and Notre Dame\nI I think there's a gap between a Alabama gap between Alabama Ohio State never the out and I think there's a gap between Alabama and Ohio State actually\nBut for those four teams look I think it it's pretty simple at Notre Dame\nRun the table and goes twelve and ... it's hard to see a scenario\nWhere they don't get in a their schedules representative they don't have the thirteenth at a point but that hasn't mattered and the last couple of seasons to the committee that rewarded Alabama for not even winning it's division last year in one of the national championship in the year before that for higher state\nOr in the year before that with an Oklahoma the late ... when the big twelve feet that team but this is different ah Notre Dame doesn't compete for a championship they don't want to compete for a championship or an independent\nBut I think ever since they put in book in there and extra William that at the tail back they're just a different theme offensively the beacon for the given that can that can stop anybody but the often now as a factor so I I think they've got that chance\nYou know Clemson was thought to be the biggest contender for to Alabama to start the season they had their own world defensive line returning to school they had some problems in the secondary and obviously the changing quarterback a tremor Lawrence and he sent subsequently gets hurt to distort things off\n... you know right now

are still waiting lists\nNorthwestern Wednesday thirty four thirty one and over time\nEvery time you think you can't get worse it does for Nebraska as the corn Oscars remain when Liz Cincinnati is on beaten and six known has this week off as the ... back\nIn the top twenty five and has been a remarkable turnaround under second year head coach Luke fickle and a chance to catch up with them earlier this week and I talk to them about the turnaround from for an aid a year ago to six known now what's\nBeen the key to about coaching no [laughter] it\nProbably has with little to do with coaching them has as much to do with relationships and building some trust and respect and a lot of the things that were doing um our our guys play harder they play faster and it has so much more to do with you know just relationships and\nDon't trust and respect and a lot of the things that were doing um our our guys play harder they play faster and and it has so much more to do with you know just relationships and the buying than it does with fundamentals are technique or scheme 'em or anything specific to coaching to be honest with you\nYour defense gave up thirty one point eight times last year it hasn't happened yet this year in fact you've only allowed eighty two points what's been the difference for that you'd\nStart confidence that they play I mean you would say they play a lot faster I there are a lot of the same guys I'm I'm not sure that if you just timed him you'd say well well yeah you guys upgraded and are a lot faster but they're confident they understand the what's in the wise\nUm that makes them anticipate in look a lot faster as they play\nAnd then I'd say tackling I mean we've done it much much much better job of tracking the football and eliminating those big big place that uh the plight of so much last year\n... you know you never really know what you have in your quarterback until he goes out there and does it did you think Desmond Ritter would be as good and he is he has been coming into the season\nNuts we if we would have we probably would have said he was the start or from the get go but [laughter] you know it it's been a battle and and uh between doesn't have more that they've you know fought it out all through camp all through spring football and really even farther down the first couple of weeks of the season I Know that he didn't get as many\nOpportunities after he started the first game but um you you knew Desmond had some some real gifts and I don't just mean his ability to throw the football I don't just mean his ability to run\nA but some of those other things just the natural confidence uh the way guys kind of tend to flock to him or he has some of those natural leadership qualities\nAnd you and said what you were looking for in a quarterback and someone who can make everyone else better how has he done that so far in Europe and\nKind of what I just talked about his ability um\nYou know they're not always be the ... have to put himself out their first he looks at how do I help others and and then return others are starting to help him uh he just he has a natural gift that ah that charisma little bit with the with the confidence behind him but he doesn't have to be the cocky guy always saying stuff you know he has the ability to do it\nUm you know with his with his actions every bit more than he does with his words and as a young guy especially a freshmen coming in I think that's the only way for guys to truly kind of buy in and believe in what you're doing\nA and he's done an unbelievable job of that\nYou have a freshman quarterback in a sophomore running back and Michael war in the second who was that a lot of calories in part due to injury how happy to have you been with the way he has responded thus far\nWhile he's obviously done a great job I think the unique thing about Mike is his durability um you know we kind of always talk about their ability is more important than ability\nAnd to be a tale backing carry the ball as many times as he has in the in the first six games um maybe and for those games in particular are to be able to keep on trucking I think it's it's just unique you never you never know it's such a unique position that you know whether you're recruiting them every every high school team got a a really good one and\nA lot of them are very similar\nAnd a ... it's hard to kind of determine the difference between who's gonna projected that next level and who has the heart and the will um that a guy like Mike Warren has I mean obviously Mr football in the state of Ohio a and all those things have translated over or just to be the guy that durable tough physical uh can do it every single day even as a sophomore\nDog when Cincinnati head coach ... cats at six in ... already bowling eligible in there by week after all for when the season a year ago in your first year there but as far as this turn around and one of the great stories has been and yet tell me how you been able to do this off instantly when the line that consistent to graduate transfers\nAnd he's sixty or former walk on we'll get more on him in a moment but a former hockey player and somebody who never ...\nThere's a fence on the line that consistent to graduate transfers and he's sixty or former walk on we'll get more on him in a moment but a former hockey player and somebody who never played it down in college football until this year [noise]\n... it's called development and you know that kind of goes back to that believe in in in those guys and\nAh we want to be an office of wind driven program we came in here saying that the thing we got to focus on one of those guys up front and in a lotta times guys coming in not just in our program but college in general a specially a friday it's become so much of a scheme 'em\nGame nowadays that I think sometimes we lose focus on whether it's really about and development of those guys up front of you know blocking in in in moving people in developing the strength uh and and that's where we put all the focus in and\nNot that it's us doing it but it's there by an and belief\nOf putting those guys and positions it\nIt took a little while um but I think we're starting to see some of those some of those things really pay off and those guys as we thought we see better than way here they do too and if they see some success and and I mean success from wins but even success from you know having the ability to move the football have in the ... to move the line of scrimmage\nYou get that by and it really really helps\nAnd I walk on that I mentioned Gary Campbell out for the season or out at least with a broken leg brains that are real considerable time you know he's not playing how has he been able to make an impact\nYeah don't count him out exactly as he is he is bound and determined to be back in the minds of most powerful\nThing we all possess and if there's anybody that can do it and anybody that can can help this thing here with his with the right mind as as Garrett but um you know he his presence felt every single day yesterday a practice run by week\nYou know and I'm trying to pushing pushing pushing there's Garrett up there in the stadium I'm sitting up top because he couldn't get back all the way down with the with the scooter but watching the practice attentively I'm watching his guys and you know doesn't take much to be able to point up there and say hey guys", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Al Sharpton Show", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "13"}
