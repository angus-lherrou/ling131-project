and they can not in the unit\nRepublican get out the vote effort no\nAnd I found other people do and they cannot and you ... you know why because the more people who show up\nThey favor Democrats the fewer people who vote Republicans tend to win and so people of color predominantly a vote democratic and so that's why you see across the country um all of that Tom Foolery about shutting down I'm\nPolling fights purging voters from the polls you see that with um a Brian Kemp enjoyed it a secretary of state who's running against Stacey Abrams you see that in North Dakota that it went all

A. okay\n[noise]\nOkay rely on your home when I was shocked I didn't really grow grown here kind of talking about sort of let me ask about another restored a congressman in large income and Marilyn ... released\nA report on the potential impact of the Trump administration's refusal to defend federal protections for for a pre existing conditions explain that\nFor it was one that literally made it and I was really surprised that it didn't get a lot of coverage um when you see the number is ah how many people will be impacted by the Trump administration's or use a band aid on a national level of protection for pre existing conditions it\nBeyond belief so don't find the most interesting about this story and I'm sure you talked about it on your show ran I certainly talk about it on the air the Republicans who did everything they say ... story Obamacare\nWhy now are riding on Obama's here and they are I mean back they lie demonstrable alive\nToday that they will protect people with preexisting conditions they they'll do everything they can\nThey fly I mean it's demonstrable alive\nI'm saying that they will protect people with preexisting conditions they they'll do everything they can while actively promoting the opposite\nEnd so congressman allies are coming\nUm who will become chair of the oversight committee if the Democrats take the house he\nWanted to show how many people will be impacted and and highlight some of the contract and what is and what Republicans are bad and so he said to report someone on a national level and one on the state level so you can look they by state and see\nHow many people will be affected in Fifteen point six million people in the market will rude protection\nI'm against a rubber ... basically\nBecause they have pre existing conditions they face discrimination and there'll be nothing people can do about it on time million Fifteen\nOver Fifteen million Fifteen point six million people\nUm there are as many as ten million people I'm In the market place right now who have\nUm I'm pleased with the health conditions and they will lose those protections I'm In those four point eight million with the beer pre existing health condition so they will be able to be denied health coverage altogether\nOlder Americans could charge more than ten times the amount younger people pay for their insurance either of these are real life issues that will impact\nPeople every day um if if if if this is allowed if Republicans are loud and and the scary part is they are literally saying the opposite end and planning to do the opposite of what they're saying there purporting to protect\n'em pretty good thing or those with preexisting condition while the party is actively doing everything they can\nTo overturn the Affordable CARE Act so this is so dangerous it is so dangerous and I know you know if you don't have health issues and no one in your family has health issues it's really easy so look at the fight over Obamacare\nAnd it gets monotonous it's long it's been going on so I don't know how long\nThis is President Obama but his signature domestic policy and so it becomes background noise after a while if you're not actively dealing with it but how does not last forever and you have to think about\nI'm not only are brighter and in this country who are ill but your own your own ... and and how it was like well I'm impact you in the coming years this is a huge deal\nAnd this is a very comprehensive report\n'em ... again it has gotten a lot of coverage or people who go to the BBC dot com\nThe view or the congressmen support I mean it is very comprehensive and very scary and part of the reason why I was so taken aback by report it's just the sheer numbers on the other reason I was so taken aback is the lack of coverage that his report has gotten\n'em because people are busy chasing the latest tweet in the latest ridiculous things that the president had said but I mean there are many issues\nHappening when the breaking news banner dominates all three major cable news network there are many other stories happening that we follow and try to cover and this is one that people have to

A. O. K. E. vet\nAfternoon after now is probably the pleasure to listen to it on top of all I Know that last Saturday I'm I'm In those counties ... all all it was really encouraging to see so many people are voting\nI I was in line for I have a call now and a half and I would say at least Ninety eight percent of the people in line with African American so where are you going to encourage him very well my question is not question is maybe it was\nAnd Reverend Al ... people in Georgia where only thirty percent of the uh ... you know people that are eligible to vote here thirty percent\nSo you know even as a space to all those polls emirate black votes you possibly can pull the boss of the Caucasian race or other ... she's still going to lose Huckleberry Finn is fantastic she's smart she's intelligent\nMy question is like a ...\nSure will cost so that the polls that we need something on that in order for her to wall\nIt just made up is that it has to be somebody else into us\nI think you're right and I think that is why it is important that we raise the issues\nThat and explain the issues in a way to benefit everybody when we talk about preserving a pre existing conditions in health care\nDoes not for blacks on day when we talk about protecting people in the criminal justice system that's not just for blacks only when we talk about dealing with the question of public education\nThat's not just for blacks only and I think that a lot of times we must engage in political discussions I say there's all the time they deal with self ventures politics is about self interest is protecting your interests and when people understand\nThat what Donald Trump is doing and what does that are with them are proposing is not only banned for blacks is bad for everybody that tax law that he passed\nIs going to come back and haunt white middle class folks 'cause they got a bump one year that is going to be reduced as you go to\nBillionaires and Z in there has got a whole percentage cut from thirty seven percent down to twenty three twenty four percent but the middle class got out pick up a little Boehner's and then that's it you are still left in the same kind of income bracket\nHugh on you're not going to benefit they're not going to benefit from a state tax reduction because many of them on the same economic conditions\nThat everybody else is so those things is what has to be addressed to get white voters to understand that Stacy or Gillum or whoever addressing broader economic issues that are in their interest and when we had raised that\nI eat a bronco bomber I see A Douglas while do one for governor of Virginia a black eye E. others that have won statewide offices and Obama nationwide\nAnother white came oval would blacks voting in big numbers and they won\nSo we must have an expanded as we do expanded platform but at the same time we've got to come in maximum numbers because even white candidates\nOn the Democratic side have not won the majority of the white vote it's just been enough Bill Clinton and get the majority of ... of white voters broad one and I think that you cannot say\nWell how are we going to get all the whites you probably won't but you will get enough if you are speaking to the edges of telling the truth but you have to have maximum blacks otherwise you've got a formula for disaster that is why there ...\nBut you have to have maximum blacks otherwise you've got a formula for disaster that is why they're playing these last few years plane he being Trump he is playing his own base as if they are idiots\nCost to tell them he good by executive order changed the fourteenth amendment of the constitution he doesn't even respect their mentality 'cause that's just factually wrong\nTo give a tax bill that gives his buddy billionaire as a break and give them a thousand dollar tip or whatever or the amount is and then it slides back down into where they are while others can make zillions is just wrong to tell them that are more limited preexisting conditions\nThat's not really exist in addition for breast that's their mama too", "show_name": "The Al Sharpton Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "30"}
