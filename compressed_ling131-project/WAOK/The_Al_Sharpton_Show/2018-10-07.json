different ways I'm Democrat Party dead easy new leadership new blood thank God no no more um\nWe work too hard to get crime so are we going to keep all riding at I think we are because our women feel that that's a Democrat Party today they salvation so into we re thinking you know and get on the bandwagon like you know\nLearn how to remove renew over either I just go see that ship go down I mean\nThe Democratic party you know that\nA crime like little baby and really they really helped Trump out to get your boy in there with that\nWith that a reality show today done they kinda mommy about Lawrence down to Texas cry like a baby and don't do nothing always trying to one so until they change their mind set man they going to be like Lawrence and crime up\nOur things was Tony a dart at least one that's on was why why why cry like a baby you know I'm I'm not in the hip hop and whatnot but I've heard it or go to Joseph from Worcester, Massachusetts on line three Joseph\nFrom Boston Massacre how you're doing that started ... uh well how are you All right I'm\nPretty good I think the great Dane America a judge a cup when they'll be go bomb I think Donald Trump is the way the president and the Democrats go to the people in the wake up and see the Democrats are only there really are a lot of leadership use a woman to divide\n... user whites or divide black ... why do you use a rich portrait of Richard gets Paul they'd get money from the George souls you Polk ... billion dollar factory what Donald Trump stay\nOut of ... magazine why Republicans are just so finance so they get money through you know small donations mom and pop for every George Soros is Sheldon Adelson\nThere's a you know that Trump was one of the big donors Republicans you know Steve Forbes who ran for president twice as a billionaire you got to Mitt Romney who's a billionaire so what's the difference when they're billionaires and these billionaires\nWell like I was afraid I'd say you know I Love to go to a Donald Trump rowdy\nAlready lost dose of or go to getting an online forget him\nWell shame and embarrassment all across this country for those who talked against this a nominee and\nIt is shame and embarrassment just like it was for Hillary Clinton\nNow for this a nominee who's in the legacy of Donald Trump like it or not has been written for the Next Fifty years and those have you talked about what this woman comes out of the woodwork where\nAnd it just didn't stand and just like if you had someone come against you if you had a very powerful position you're about to get you in ... when you were in high school you touch them in the wrong way and make credible ...\nYeah double her story may be evident nine so when you look at this country is built on corruption lying and cheating\nAnd you support it either way it goes but the shame is on the females that thought that they had the ability to put Hillary in and had the ability to stop this nominee both wrong both shame\nAnd now ... what's the next fight what do you see is the next fight that that's going to come up so\nWell we got a few one way or the midterms and a couple of weeks for the control of the Senate um because I even though you don't believe in the power of the women vote and the power to stop this remember this still came down to a basically forty nine forty nine split\n'em and then we had a democratic close a crossover with the loud Collins the crossover also and support them so\nI I don't know if I Would question the power of women to influence politics but please believe emily's list and the me too movement and time's up\nAnd all these other groups are going to come out in full force\nIn November and so the Republicans ... ... and do you have a pure victory whether you win but at what cost what what will it cost you down the line in order to get the nomination across we lose to Senate we'll lose to send it to the point where you lose a ... a ... vote majority\nAnd then we met the water sprinkler those impeachment proceedings in the house you after you have to worry about the prospect of add to remove will before twenty twenty what does it do for the gym that you have going forward if you lose both the house and Senate because you want to get the Supreme Court nominee across we've got three point seven\nUnemployment right now when you put that in jeopardy by losing the or the Senate and state houses the governor's races across the country so I think that's the battle is this actually worth it\n[noise] well these are hypothetical and once again what you fail and many people fail to understand is the political infrastructure of the power elite that control the whole process\nYou saw that with the Hillary Hillary Clinton lost you seen that with the a nomination of now a Supreme Court justice Kavanaugh\nYou don't recognize\nThis structure and its power in his influence\nAnd infighting between\nI which I always said I don't know how many people have hurt me it's a gender ward is going on in this country and women are trying to fight against their own self interest in that being the people that have been protecting them all this this these many years it has destruction of the civilization like Raul like Greece\nNow America is the internal structure\nThat's going to destroy what we now see as a power elite\nAnd it's harder on the world\nNot guilty and cause we've got about a minute left do you do you have more concern about women controlling the country or about white supremacist controlling the country which do you fear more\nThey're both the same no no no no I ... is an either or do you think it will be worse to have women control the country or white supremacist control the country\nI think it will be worse with women tell the truth because what they've done is allow the a C feminist ... of our sons they allow the control of the household to be taken away from the man they have in ... and the fate\nThat starts with a couple of different things number one we're going to put a counselor in every single public high school in the state to take some of the burden off the teachers and administrators when it comes to\nProblems and issues that that students and their fears are facing inside the school because a lot of the school students that we're seeing are happening from people that are inside the school and they're legally supposed to be there they just got issues whether it's substance abuse problems at home mental health you know suicidal\nThoughts and things of that nature so I think that's going to help our teachers but it's also been a help our schools but we've also got to make sure that we're keeping the school's secure from I'm from the outside perspective keeping people that shouldn't be in the school system um\nYou know from getting in and and\nCreating habits are hormones are students so we're going to give a one time thirty thousand dollar grant to every school in our state every public school in our state to help them um secure their schools and they can use that however they want it's been a big tree local control so they can use it\nBy putting in technology like cameras or you know a communication system I could put in you know law automatic locks on the exterior doors you know monitoring\nYou know metal detectors or you know the only one ton of money but we feel like this\nBut we feel like this will be a good start building off the legislature did last year put sixteen million dollars with the funding in or to try to help that happen sooner rather than later\nAnd then we also talked a lot this week and last week about our our early learning and ... you know governor ill and the first lady Sandra Dale focused on early learning\nOr getting fucked up to grade level reading about a third grade which is a big problem in our state this is you know correlates with statistics on a folks that are not meeting that standard are more likely to be incarcerated or not be able to get a good job or get education like Nate\nSo we want to build off that protecting the hub scholarship making sure that we have private free cake or programs are viable as well as public as a big contrast with my opponent she wants to do ... do away with those tax credits for parents that\nYou know give them school choice to put their kids in a in a private early learning program and in some communities that's the only early learning in pre K programs that are available in certain communities in certain areas so we're very excited about that as well\nAnd that is outstanding or to ask your question on criminal justice reform brought in somebody who's personally affected by the criminal justice issues ms ... birds with Britain wanted to go in and say I'm a secondary camp your question will just to perform\nAbsolutely a mystic camp and understanding that prisons in a juvenile justice programs and services and other corrections programs to make up\nFive percent state budget or which correlation equals to about fifty six billion dollars worth of outgoing tax money and asked that relates to your plans to cut the amount of taxes and taxpayers are paying in that state and extending\nDo you plan to evaluate and make ... a torch releasing nine ... first time offenders sort of sneak\nEspecially those elderly who I Know are not nor had ever been menacing to society do you plan to make any tangible mood to watch their release women ate at the state tax income\nLet me let me thanks for that question was certainly and very supportive of what governor deal in the legislature's work them regarding criminal justice reform enough ... manner or be glad to look at the national things as we move forward that\nYou know many that have worked on that on that working group it brought forward in the last several years to see if there's more than we that we need to do I've spoken to many people on the campaign trail\nAbout programs whether it's work release or you know different centers that are available in local we select those that are actually still incarcerated be able to\nWork during the day a count of as a transition type center which I think would help with employment you know one of the biggest issues we have in our state is workforce development bumped certainly supportive of this is like that for those\nThat are incarcerated that won't it during their lives around you know try to help with recidivism writes I Do think there's more that we can do in that regard\nBut I also think that we have to allow judicial discretion on a on a lot of the ... you know folks that are that have been incarcerated many times and and don't seem to be\nWanting to to make change in their lives and stopping the revolving door\nBecause it's affecting our families in our communities with these crimes that may be petty when they start to turn him to solve the folks moving in to being recruited backgrounds gangs and other people we do have a ... a street gang problem in our state it's a it's a travesty when you think about sex trafficking\nLike about sex trafficking set straight were one with the unfortunately one of the top ... states for that in the country I Want to do something about that as well as our opioid epidemic so we've got a couple of different fronts that we need to continue to work on a monthly\nCertainly All right I Want to hit directly on your your public safety plan because we took throwing it slightly\nUm but as you said we do we you know ... years ago George you didn't have vice lord we didn't have wedding kings we didn't have a we had a very small representation of the crypts here are but those things that was floated in the last decade what is your plan to ensure public safety and combat the rises in street crime\nWell two of the things that I learned quite honestly the and I'm\nOut on the campaign trail being someone who is had some background well having a law enforcement division and the secretary of state's office as well as ... as the public safety and homeland security committee chair when I was in the legislature\nIn working with a lot of prosecutors and law enforcement\nOfficials and I've learned that we have a problem Georgia has become a distribution hub for the Mexican drug cartel\nThat is driving a lot of the street gang rather than a treatment that we have a with children believe it or not that are Thirteen fourteen years old and young that is a very scary scenarios very different from when\nYou know I was growing up in in high school and just before that and the late seventies early eighties that's very alarmed me as a father of three teenage daughters\nWe've actually had a high school teacher that was arrested\nUm for three murders in recruiting gang members in the high school you know that shouldn't be happening in our state or in our schools parents should be confident that their kids are not being exposed to that we also have our neighborhoods being shot in the ... many bystanders many of them\nAre children that are being affected or or shot in in that regard and we need to work with ... local prosecutors local law enforcement\nTo do something about that so we can keep our family life\nOr in in all that no we only have a couple of minutes left I wanted to address faith and family with you because you you brought it up\nA million people in the state field that you know there's been a an attack on Christians are in recent years that\nAre any outward expression of your your faith of somehow ... me too for review in the public square how does your faith informed your public policy positions and will what will you do as governor and to ensure that Christians have the right to express their their feed this as any other group\n[noise] well I Am a Christian allied Saddam then up numbers of Emmanuel ... church here in Athens for for many years I've been there for that church for over fifty years we've raised our motors and that sort of save all in all the human life wildlife\nIn the fellowship of Christian athletes and I have been very involved as well and I think our morals values and our family is is more important than ever I Know that certainly an issue in many communities around our state especially with single parents and\nThen a grand parents having to raise our children and and I'm going to be one that's going to support that I support religious freedom I think that as a fundamental rights that our country was founded on I don't think we need to run for that runs from that I think we do have\nTo be respectful of all all religions\nAre and I'll be a governor that will do that and make sure that that all lead by example in that regard I pray a\nOften for first first drink than for knowledge is or wisdom on the lower\nDoes the on the lord has got a plan and I'm just living it out every day to the best of my ability that'll that'll help man that govern\nI wanted to know you were in a long time when I think he wants to join you know great you were able to speak with him as birds as her mother I was in a troop county with them to Twenty one years in prison\nFor first time nonviolent non drug related
