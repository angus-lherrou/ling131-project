action network that meant to get more information about the south east regional national action network conference let's go to ... mostly right there in Georgia go to Georgia in line\nFor and talked to Ron Ron you're on keeping it real was driven Al Sharpton you got a river Williams are with you [noise] Hi this is Pam calling from Chicago hello oh okay yeah you do okay I'm calling from Chicago yes Harold\nI'm well how are you oh you did put a lot of our lives on the table mhm uh as I said I'm calling from Chicago but I Want to make a statement about the national election as for the polls\nI'm not sure if I'd trust those I really wish we had a a I guess a black owned poster ... and perhaps we do that um that and if that company where to operate on a national level as well as low also\nI don't think Democrats are being cocky um I think there was talk about the blue wave but what I hear when I see our democratic candidates working really really hard to get boats and turning up excuse me turnout up and it it's really\nA confusing and a little bit disturbing considering that what we have on the opposing side which is Trump\nIt should not be that difficult to motivate people to vote even though it's a mid term election so for me right now the Republican Party it's a political hate group and he broke and it's under the control of Donald Trump\nDonald Trump is a racist a sexual predator and not only that he also operates like a crime family in the White House and his Supreme Court\nOf Kavanaugh a is one of the many reasons I did want to have a Republican in control of the White House it seems to me that Republicans like being led by ignorant\nIdiots racist people and you can go down the line of the president's whoever led that political party it's a non starter a deal breaker for me I can do nothing but the Republicans so let me bring it locally here in Chicago um we have our gubernatorial race\nAs well as ah the other state uh positions treasure and as secretary of state and attorney general are those are are all a heads up Democratic Party a black candidates and then what\nSecretary of state and attorney general are those are are all a heads up Democratic Party a black candidates and then we also have ... in the far I'm twenty nine teams February the mayor's race so you know\nAnd your audience knows that we have a kind of ... tally of how great Trump is\nAnd um how wonderful he is but what I find really just is concerned about the entire things that we seem to be okay with a racist in\nThe White House and that's most troubling to me right now\nThe Republicans are operating on us or beer system a voter suppression be serious about this and they don't they're not even being cold worried about it if only worked and so our response has to come from the church the civil rights organization Reverend Sharpton\nReverend Jackson a prominent leaders the N. double ACP the Urban League we all have to fight against is voter suppression I Can't do anything with the Republican Party and and that's a discussion that's happening here in Chicago\nBecause you have some a political people or I say there's not a difference there is no difference between the Democratic party and Republican Party and I understand where that\nCome from where that sentiment comes from because we have a a Democratic Party here which was led by Rahm Emanuel our mayor we've just been devastating to our community and we have many of our\nOlder man in the black community but I'm call them out in the white community that has not stood up for the basic white and decency of black people\nI'm a poor people working class families union\nSo right now we need us at a sea change in the worst way and we need to work harder than ever because having Trump and these cowardly Republicans his cow town to his every whim I mean the site of Mitch McConnell disgusts me\nAnd so right now they're on up there on a a a a game of voter suppression racism or let's make you hate the immigrants I mean just pitting poor\nPoor people against each other ethnic groups against each other and we have to fight back against that and last let me say this I understand that there is a real concern with the Democratic party I Know it will\nBut when we look at the action and we've seen what they want to do we sing with Donald Trump wants to do and we still continue to go along or stay silent or not boat they wouldn't have to look at ourselves and our children and ask what what next let now Donald Trump had an\nHour do we do what ... what do we do we do and we're we're we're ... I Want to give you some uh that's the reason why I appreciate just gone through all of\nThese calls ... three to five seven and I said I Want you to be able to get in on this because she says something that's very important and I think you ought to make all of us think we ought to be\nA trying to figure out what are we doing okay so you're the polls are saying that African Americans black and brown people first time voters young voters\nThe don't look ... if that's what the polls are saying well what are we doing what are we doing to make sure that we do know lifted another phone call in North Carolina line five or stop to Dorothy Dorothy drone keeping the room with ... with\nA harder donor fast third third thanks okay on this side so far so good we got a [noise] we got from people on the side that\nOh how you doing a path everything's okay on this that so far so good we got a we got some people on this that that is not going to vote at all from the last time we elect but some people\nAre for the help us out around here they steal ain't doing nothing but I myself I'm voting I'm always going to exercise my right to vote as a couple of good people long to a ballot ethics amen let's not one that two for six\nBut um that's locally in North Carolina Elizabeth said it but on the national level\nThis is what disgusts me why do Republicans keep trying to cheat on an election and then they they do all this uh shenanigans they do all of this stuff about up to a top people off the poll Georgia Texas\nBringing new sports whether\nGoing to be a newsroom amusing dog Thirteen hating you a\nHappy Friday sixty three degrees in Atlanta at one fifty eight I'm Julian virgin a\nBig decision maybe made next week over the proposed\nOne fifty eight I'm Julian version a big decision maybe may next week over the proposed Gulch development deal in downtown Atlanta mayor Kesha Lance bottoms has pushed for a vote to go ahead on the public financing proposal on the project at a special called meeting Wednesday\nAnd the best part about it is outside that if they print it helps a little bit need on affordable housing in the city of Atlanta\nAnd other city the Atlanta city council rather reportedly has not received updated details on that proposal early specks on the many city project estimated it'll cost one point seven five billion dollars in public financing a Griffith mother accused of dumping her baby in water had her first court appearance yesterday\nI had those details next on W A L K news tonight's mega millions jackpot is now worth a staggering one billion dollars winters can take the cat's options which would now be five hundred and sixty five million or an ... an annuity with one initial payment an annual installments over twenty nine years\nNow if you don't win the mega millions there's always the Powerball Saturdays Powerball drawing is worth four hundred and thirty million dollars\nIn sports the hawks based the Memphis Grizzlies tonight in Memphis Atlanta lost his home opener rather one twenty six one o seven on Wednesday to the New York Knicks opening tip for tonight's God says is at eight o'clock\nWeather wise right now sixty three degrees was overcast guys in the metro area you should expect mostly cloudy afternoon with the high near sixty nine degrees I'm Julian version for news and talk Thirteen eighty W A L K\nWe're keeping it real with Al Sharpton or news and talk Thirteen eighty W.

seven nine seven also real quick are the three front runners are Kamala Harris Elizabeth Warren\nAnd Kirsten Gillibrand all three of these are women for the Democrats what does that mean is one of these\nYour candidate I'd like to hear about it like to hear what you're thinking about those three front runners that are out there now stumping and campaigning for president and twenty twenty [noise] All right let's get back to the phone lines those go to North Carolina and to line eight and topped the Coleman Coleman you're on keeping the real with Reverend Al Sharpton you got Robin Williams with you\nKnow you were really do that but the the the\n...\nYou a lot of young people are voting is our fault because we're not to send them the importance so let me preface by saying I didn't vote the show I was what forty four I Believe one President Obama ... started running\nAnd actually 'cause I was never told about it so now I'm In the process of starting to program to teach use from around seven to eight\nAll those years that you weren't voting from Eighteen I'm forty four what did you miss what what what connection where do you not making and what we're finally connected to make you say you know what this election I'm getting out to vote\n[laughter] I'm Glad you asked that first\nOf all I wasn't taught as a young person about politics how important it is a it was to vote and second of all I'd never seen any body that really inspired me\nOn to President Obama and at this point right now we're talking with young people that was a poll I'm sure you heard of a Cornell Belcher\nHe just did a poll I'll get ... among African Americans the most important things to them right now is racism and discrimination\nSecond is corruption third is health care for these jobs we have to talk to our young people about those things that they are concerned about\nWow well thank you call them and I appreciate that meant that may now and I don't get no clear to that I appreciate that call let's go to second O W O W e line one let's talk to Mark Mark you don't keeping it real ... sharp and you got revving Charles Williams with you\nMore youngest Marcello Sunday a matter of fact now Michigan\nUh no I I talked\nYeah I thought would rather now a couple of weeks ago and I'm way to the same question\nUm I Know we we got candidates that they are running for office and I'm trying to find out who gets into these who got a mouthpiece who who talks to these candidates because apparently they are not listening to the constituents they're not listening to the voters\nBecause a rebel now he was kind of complex about a little bit too so what I'm saying here and I'm not going to take up time what what are the Democrats offered what what ... what is thought for what what are they saying\nTo me to Democrats on than I think that but we got to get Trump out of office we got to do this it's a Trump political off or are they I mean I I did vote and if that was Eighteen years old it is to me it's a law against not voting considerably but my point is there\nI don't hear the Democrats and the thing I don't mean to tell me I I heard I think his name was brother ever that can't think of his first name was ... when Al Sharpton a couple of weeks ago on the radio and his brother laid down some stuff that that you should be out there I I look at MSNBC\nWhy the Democrats only topping on MSNBC everybody watches MSNBC those people are going to vote Democrat wow\nWe out there and doing rallies why are we in the church is why we on the street quit or the politician want us to vote for them what are you offering what are you where are you saying to us I I don't I don't like Donald Trump we do none of us liked it so why he keeps\nTelling me we've got a good Donald Trump out we've got to do this we've got the ... the Republicans\nThat are okay we get them out of office what are you going to do\nWith why don't you tell well to tell them the young people what are you offering them why don't you tell the millennium what are you off and then why don't you tell the senior citizen who what are you all what are you as a Democrat bringing to the table other than get Donald Trump out that's not a good enough message\nThat's why people are not into that they should be about coming out and vote you're not telling them that and\nSo that's my point so I Would look I Know I I listen to people on the radio station here and you got some people coming out with some piles of stuff with some good stuff but wow wow into the candidates talking about it\nOn the radio station here and you got some people coming out with some piles of stuff with some good stuff but wow well candidate talking about it tell me what the Democrats saying that to get rid of Donald Trump get rid of the Republican so what are you will also we get rid of all what do you have to all\nWell thank you Mara we and we reached that does help and they they talk and so what do we do ... what are the Democrats talking about that I'm Talking about the candidate right well\nNo I don't think we're I think that you I I think you're right on target I think you're right on target and I certainly appreciate you guys think you're right on target right on tests and that's why\nThat's the reason why I Love keeping it real that's why I like keeping a real Reverend Al Sharpton\nI like it I Love this show because these shows listen to buy all kinds of folks you got congressional representative you got folks who make decisions policy decisions you've heard this show many of you have her all types of policy people have been on the show all types of\nPresidential candidates presidents have been on this show that's the reason I like the show\nBecause you get the opportunity to call in and you run the risk for somebody who's in a powerful position to hear what's going on and to get a pulse and to understand that the reason why I'm asking this question today\nBecause people need to hear what is going to turn that back\nAnd change the direction of these polls that are coming up we got polls are right now I I Am Sam polls are\nAre are a a\nWritten in stone but they got polls that say the black vote the brown vote the youth vote and the first time vote and coming out that's what these polls are saying and so with these polls\nWe need to hear from you eight seven seven five three to five seven nine seven we need to hear from you what do you think need to be said what do people need to you what do the people who make the decisions the folks who are in power what do they need to hear\nFrom us to make sure that we get what Chicago I Want to know what do you need to hew to give folks what do you need to be done to give folks in your community
