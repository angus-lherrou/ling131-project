they've always done\nEven after slavery you know with the thirteenth amendment they were able to continue in slave in us I just read a book recently about best somewhere Alabama\nWhere a during certain times of the year back in the early Nineteen hundreds you couldn't find a black person walking in the street\nAnd ... because everybody was in jail working for best some steel and that's basically what they're coming back with now with these this jailing incarceration and you just spoke to um\nA miscount any about the um the bail throwing out kids in jail without fail with bail it doesn't make any difference so it it's so and then they are doing this other thing about the census where he started this early when he first got in\nLetting the numbers go down by attrition so we don't have enough people to count and we're always on the county and anyway\nSo they're looking at other things other than straight out there looking at things underneath the radar and I'm very much afraid that we don't get out and vote\nAnd get and I hate to say this because I normally wouldn't say that I don't want a Republican to win that's all bad when I hear people say they're okay and this guy's okay call her and all but say go when they vote the same way\nThey vote for everything that Trump watch they talk about him they talk against them but they go ahead and vote when it comes time them other than McCain I don't see anybody I'm In the late McCain\nThat doesn't see anybody on the Republican side who stands up and says you know what this is racist that discriminate areas sexist I'm not going to vote for and that includes the women Republicans they just will no one stands up\nJob that the bank you've where you go I think he raises an interesting point because a lot of people were more in ball and ties into personality candidates\nOr even a the\nQuestion of charisma and not dealing with interest and then there have been some that raised the point that a lot of people who we heard a lot of noise from during the election don't you go with Jill Stein\nThat raises the point that a lot of people who we heard a lot of noise from during the election don't go well Jill Stein another third party candidate or that those votes could have saved us from Donald Trump we've not heard from them since the election\nYou know we've not heard from them and when we do hear from them uh it's very difficult sometimes near impossible for them to really paint a picture of what\nThat that alternative universe could look like what that that type of landscape could look like when everyone is turning out to vote and people are voting based on priorities\nYou know you're based on a based on agendas based on strategy you know we have to be very strategic and how we vote or how we make these choices are the ... elections we can't based on a on you know who looks\nWhat makes high school sports here in Georgia so special\nLay do you do it all again\n\nEvery can do\nWe all do\nMust be presented by the Georgia, Georgia buddies around for\nDoctor Sicilia Burlington if you're among the forty percent of Americans ages Fifteen older we're still not getting tested for

Act okay you can type in and um you can go on your own cell phone or make the request or your computer and they have to provide to with the information and if they fail to do\nSo they will give you a right to sue\nSubpoena the um people that to name Nikki Haley should be a listed as one because she is totally aware of the information\nThat this was a legal dismiss\nFilled by Brett Kavanaugh regarding that case and it was so all you should request all the other um government um and businesses and corporations that have violated\nThe human rights act and these other countries you know this is why she's leaving you know everybody that's under I'm President Trump nails\nThey will rather resigned then to disclose the air for me to\nBecause they know that they would have to provide the correct information regarding a any requests you know unless I'm Brett Kavanaugh is is a threat to homeland security or are are a\nGovernment um homeland security\nThen he should not be on the bed and they cannot ... um disclose failed to disclose the information concerning him and the cases so\nPlease people do not give up on the invest in a sense because it's not normal for any public officials to have six\nFederal background checks and one supplemental you know I I work for the state for forty five years and I only had one federal background check and that was the background check before I started my employment so I I just\nWant to have a lot of ... you know just to you know and of course a a child there's no doubt about\nIt does make some great points and you know definitely shouldn't wrap up or finish or worse\nThat is you know Mary make some great points and you know definitely shouldn't a wrap up or finish a worst or whole that investigation of cap and all of you know there is that open and you know particularly if Democrats are able to take back not just the house but the Senate because you know there has been some discussion about\nA potentially impeaching Brett Kavanaugh well you know impeachment is one thing but you know if you really want to fully remove him from the court\nUh then you have to contribute to Democrats we take in the Senate\nAnd getting Democrats into a position where they have the sixty seven votes in the Senate to go ahead and get rid of or convict\nA Brett Kavanaugh of for for those are for those misdeeds for those crimes that that ms Mary outlined you know I feel that you know during that conversation and it was a very essential conversation now you know about\nA Brett Kavanaugh's pass as far as sexual misconduct sexual assault sexual abuse um but it it over shadow of those those other very important conversations about uh about his where he is in terms of jurors prudence\nOr do you know ... ... what ... what is his positions on very important issues like affirmative action voting\nRights labeling where I've ever met and also\nWhich is why ... runs Brad opposed to be for all we ever heard of a duck to be before\nI and I think a lot of people miss that many of those most of the civil rights groups who voting rights groups have come out strongly against the war and before we ever had a baby boy\nThat's right that's right before before that even before any of those allegations ever came out and no one was really paying attention to that you know as\nThe conversation was dominated are primarily by by white women's agenda you know [laughter] you know what was it was concerns over roe v Wade\nOr which were concerned that black women were highlighting back in the two thousand sixteen election or was concerned about those sexual assault allegations and you know another thing to ms Murray's point real quick it overshadowed\nAll these issues regarding whether or not Brett Kavanaugh perjured himself you know so we've got a judge on the Supreme Court who actively perjured himself in front of a Senate committee\nAnd all these other controversies surrounding him since he was an operative I mean this is a this is a political hack\nFrom the Bush to administration that is now sitting on the on the high court is extremely hyper partisan so those are those are issues that that should continue to be considered and that should escalate depending on what the political climate on Capitol Hill is like after November six\nMinutes going around in Chicago W. B. O. Enron\n[noise] [noise] hey how you doing today Reverend Al ...\nStarted going out right I you know forever now I just wanted to say one thing you know about some of the strategies that I think Democrats hate to use in order to try and you know flip the house and the Senate you know one of the things that you know their status and she ended up in the Grio\nIs that even though right now they say they're\nA race on whether or not you know we want Democrats Republicans in the house it's more or less of ideology\nYou know and white supremacy seems to be at the top the agenda for the Republican Party and what's sad\nIs white supremacy is used as the basis for you know the inclusion of so many white people on that side that they are not even you know really focusing on the fact that just because they both know somebody\nWho makes them feel they're being white is right they are both against their own financial interest interest they own educational interest for the kids and you know just\nThey don't feel that you know white is right they are voting against their own financial interest interest they own educational interest for the kids and you know just they own interests as Americans in general and I think that you know as long as we as Democrats continue to\nYou know try and you know campaign with you know a cold and everybody and everybody's issues without focusing on just the idea that we're fighting against you see that allows for them to change the narrative\nWhen it comes down to the debates and things of that nature you know like one thing about Donald Trump is either very ignorant and Eric in person with his ignorance you know and to exploit that you know and to exploit the fact that anybody that's supporting him you know\nWould be pretty much you know riding on that same trainer that same bus with him you know would I think would be beneficial and and as far as engage in you know\nYounger black people went to campaign until the actual voting\nYou know I think that the Democratic party needs to spend\nMore money and focused like the ad campaign ads in a different kind of way you know like when you fire spending money to run campaign ads you know I I've noticed that like I'll watch them eat MSNBC a lot I noticed that a lot of the\nAds that they run on there is pretty much preaching to the choir you know if you watch MSNBC it's a good chance you a Democrat and it's a good chance you already agree\nWith the ideology and philosophy that are being discussed on that particular news station so to run campaign at at the campaign ad on the spot where you already know that you can pretty much have your voter base slit a fat is like you know in my opinion not the best way to spend the money\nThat they spent on ads like put ads on BET during the you know one of six in park or you know put put ads on MTV you know like when you know like MTV Jams for example a BP jams now\nYou know is is if you're trying to specifically target a certain group of voters go to where they are you know active socially to push an agenda but then once you do run those campaign ads you know they'll run on you know that's gonna be like\nNot eat fish you know non productive you know speak like how um somebody earlier in a in a a drop to a\nYou know one of the callers earlier says something about you know a ... black people you know like the young black how are you going to get them to vote you know you got to speak on what they do at school and not you know like you know what what what's going to happen if you don't vote you know what if you don't vote is a good chance\n\nMust be presented by the George Iceland association and the Georgia by direct\nWe're losing one oh one C. three already done come to talk of being able to\nDo in the ... voice in the community\nFor use for whether\nThe newsroom on Thursday Afternoon Atlanta\nIt's eighty one degrees in downtown where your local time is to fifty eight pm on a magical here's what's happening the old saying you do the crime you do the time seems to be the case but camera ...

keeping it real without shopped\nHey how ya doing wherever they are how you doing good\nThank you all over the outside to have a brief conversation with the surge the couple of topics first one as I'm sure you've heard about Michael Bloomberg he's been given a lot of money to the Democratic party\nIs now registered as a Democrat and a lot of rumors are that he may be running for president what do you think of that because I Know you've fought with him or with a Giuliani you fought with them in the past but what do you think of that\nWell I think uh I vote a Ford would a Bloomberg on stop and frisk\nAnd I've worked with him on education so it's been a mixed a kind of relationship I think that he is competent uh I think that he is certainly a more capable than Donald Trump\nBut I disagree with him on certain social issues like stop and frisk\nA but overall I think he's better than Donald Trump if he were to be the nominee uh he he he may not be my first choice but if I had to choose between Trump and he ah I Would say rather than Trump\nYes sir Yes sir and with regards to Democrats Reverend out two more things with the Democrats with a myth terms do you really think they're going to take the Senate 'cause everyone fan though it's not going to happen because you see these poll numbers closing it and\nYou know and some of these races you know some of these red states are closing them but do you really think they still have a chance to take back the Senate\nI think is all going to come down to turn out who can bring out there are supporters\nAre I think that uh the polls\nIf they're right and I'm not a great ball really will say this tightening up and that it does not look good for the Democrats would the Senate but it turned out is a a we have the numbers where they could lose the Senate the question is whether we come out\nYes sir and lasting as he mentioned cognac earlier I'm sure you've heard Taylor Swift is making her far into politics by a indoor thing Phil Bredesen\nAnd Tennessee and you know Reverend Al Taylor Swift right now we're starting to look like the one maybe we should pay attention to as opposed to ... who with all due respect continues to say while outlandish things\nHere and the thing that impressed me about tell us when I was a endorsement and again I don't think entertained as as much as others but it does normal lives\nAnd give comfort to people to go and support a certain candidate a but she added my eyes and stayed in why she was supporting him over uh the\nAnd uh but she added my eyes and pay the why she was\nSupporting them over a ... and I think that that is is interesting because she didn't just said my man and and he is a good guy down and she said that you know I Am disgusted by a his opponents or\nA raise dealing with say a sexism and racism\nAnd xenophobia and I think that uh uh it was interesting that she itemize exactly why she was taking the position\nAnd it seems there's voter registration went up a a very a very it's a very former does it really in a twenty four hours after that the question now is getting those people to come out and vote we see people I I just saw a news show\nA ... day before yesterday where they interviewed some students at a college campus and they said do this Newton's are you registered to vote said yes\nAnd while you're voting no I don't have anything to vote for so first step is registering them second you got to get him out thank you for your call Tom let's go let's stay in Atlanta to Taylor Taylor WMA okay you're keeping it real without shopped\nA feather ...

that brother make some profound state at the gate he he did something that you don't hear a lot of a top top democratic politician doing\nShe hit issues and that was another caller you had came in and do the same thing but see I think I Will be wrong but I my opinion I think that this is what we need to be talking to our black voters democratic voters\nThis what is it that they are really doing well and see what we see on the media is one thing\nBut what do they do Republicans are doing it is under the cover you know you look at the food stamp issues and I'm not on food stamps welfare Internet but you've got to look at all those issues too and he points that what it touches people lives\nAnd I think that the Democrats doing that and then to this is my final question because I Want to tell but\nWhen you when you I mean I Know you at you're doing it ... who had the ear of our democratic people or a politician because if they hear the people like on your radio show and other\nWhy are they doing what they hear why aren't they doing this is like Donald Trump is rolling over them and they just quiet they expect and people going to come out and vote because they don't like Donald Trump we got what is it that we got to tell them something that they should like they will like ... ... who they listen to they're not listening to you and\nPeople like on your show who are they listening to\nHere is a good question because uh it would seem to me that uh it is not that people every day all day I'm not saying\nWhat you're saying that they are not speaking to the issues they're not connected did not on the ground and if they're not listening to people in the community then added age but the people in the community to respond to them how big your right mark and and\nWith

off the Van Dyke I'm\nCutting the action is a great thing um and and just fish but now a I've talked about retaliation for law enforcement and lo and behold we get this conviction and now you have Trump and sessions\nTalking about stop and frisk right so bad it's just the beginning but I you and many others tried to warn people about Trump and so now we're having to deal with that\nOr wherever and Sharpton I Want to deal with the Democratic messaging and then also a question Donald Trump uh implemented this presidential alert correct\nThere's ... and so for us to get the correct answer you have to ask the correct question so here's my question what\nKind of catastrophe as Donald Trump going\nTo create that is going to require a presidential alert from FEMA and I think that's just the same as just an excuse to have it down or or either the homeland security so once again we need to think what kind of catastrophe is he going to create\nAnd I think that's going to be a problem that we always have to think what he's doing and uh for me we can call them die and construct we can call him sexual predator\nHe's put to sexual I mean excuse me to put a sexual predator on the Supreme Court so I don't have any respect for Trump and I and I'm not going to I don't care who am I having dialogue with\nAs for the Democratic messaging if they're not going to deal with the issue of racism\nThat is going to be problematic Reverend Sharpton because you know that is what Donald is going to push and he's going to push heart yeah and\nIn addition to that the farmers now you have the farmers that are hurting because of the terrorists and I think the Democratic party should also deal with that ... and last year and they go democratic versus Republican\nI said I Can't do anything with the Republican Party um now if you want to create an independent party or take over the Democratic party stance\nI said I Can't do anything with the Republican Party um now if you want to create
