that the first African American president that we got this first when you present day okay huh but this this president and here he came that McCain McCain said he didn't want any of that is really run never heard is that in my life\nSo that we're pretty far you've got the Kurds well taken\nThat is really beyond the royal so what I Want to get that right now for me\nTo vote early May of blue way we also are green wave\nWe economics right without economic Democrats the Democratic Clinton put money there wasn't enough credit privacy because western how is representing the Democrats when they're formulated\nOkay so we actually need we need to come together and create our own our own what breaks\n'cause we don't have nowhere to go but we need to start a business you know the big corporations

our boats is organizing this to the degree thank you for your call ... let me say this river Williams 'cause I Want people to understand my position clearly I think there is a lot wrong\nWith the Democrats and I've challenged that but I think that the argument that we should not go with uh some of the Democrats and go\nThe challenge that but I think that the argument that we should not go with the some of the Democrats and go to Republicans is a very uh empty argument because we have been able to afford the Democrats to do something\nWe've not gain anything on the Republicans so when people want to call the Democrats accountable\nI Am the first on that list\nAnd I said even when I ran for president we will go to Democrats will go that don't get as far as the takers but tell me to go on\nA dare not ride the donkey as far as I can go but the lead an elephant sit on me and hold me down is crazy and that's why I challenged people when they come on and say about a Democrat fine\nBut then when they say we should then try to Republican and explained to me why\nBecause when the Republicans when they get in fighting U.S Open the Democrats don't do as much for us as I Would want but at least we been able to extract mounted them voting rights act\nOf civil rights that open housing at and we elected people all the way from Adam ... proud shed a or the education and labor committee all the way to people like Maxine Waters show me what we got out of the Republicans\nSo if you want to say I want to go independent you ain't got no argument but then we want to go Republican when you got to explain that to me\nAnd most importantly room and I'm Glad you put it like that 'cause I that's one of the things that keeps me focus when you talked about running a donkey you have to participate you can check out and then complain\nYou know it's like a folks in a church and they'll they'll go to the church and not like the pastor and keep going or at least they participate\nI mean at the end of the ... you have to participate\nAnd you have to hold them accountable you can't\nBe mad and you know I must say this one less thing here if you want to complain about organization how do you complain about organizer how do you even hold anybody accountable in organization and you ain't even in the organization right at least get involved in the organization and the side\nI'm gone
