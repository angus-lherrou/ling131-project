I've had to argue points civil law with this man it non stop me from going to\nThe library and getting a constitutional law books case law reading up on this so I Can't articulate my point of view of the people\nThere from what we were taught in the seventies wherever there\nWe were taught this I was taught this\nAbout there's no doubt about that\nGoing to do the last year the black ... says one when we had it in Gary there was no gathering a ... there was no black girl 'cause there was only three or four blocks in a Congress\nA big we need a support does gathering and those gatherings and grew knows\nMe to bring everybody men so we can have these conversations we don't need to have a structured new gathering because then you're going to get into who's ... who's in charge who's funding a big lead me do really just start talking at all these gatherings\nBecause we're all at risk I big yo you're absolutely right and sometimes you or your father ... Jones junior you just see\nSometimes we'd come forward and brazen each other\nSometimes we back in the job because of the enemy is an adversary of chasing of\nWhere we are going to come together then will force that and I think that's where we are now\nIf we see them stack the Supreme Court and continue recording police shooting people are not dealing rarely we have no choice but to come together and we can't just do it with the outbursts we got to do it with a strategy that preparing for the outburst\nWould not stand for the strategic long term struggle\nI I agree I think one of the things that you've been able to do with the national Action Network a very well is bring\nOther uh other organizations together under the umbrella of the national Action Network so you engage he worked very closely with mark morale of the national Urban League and you were with hazel boots and others at the end up ... and that that has proven effective in many many instances when you\nMove that go into a room to talk with a corporate giant about an issue that you don't just go along very well could you bring others along with you and that helped to bring you know the the the fuller body one of the things that are you know that I found the years\nThat is very disturbing is that there are the select few who put the\nThe the weight of carrying the load\nOn um organizations like national action network on you and what we often miss out on is a you know the the voice of the ah African American corporate leaders who could you know support these efforts and and help further you know galvanize and rally the troops I\nCan't tell you how many times I get emails and text messages you know well why isn't the national Action Network doing this wind at it and that and it's like well why aren't you doing it you're not as though you can do everything under the sun as though Al Sharpton can do everything by and so yes you are a leader and you do a great deal\nBut you know other people need to help shoulders some of the burden and so sometimes I think about you know the work that you did work that you do with my dad and Dr Martin Luther king junior and others back in the sixties and seventies\nAnd what I appreciate is that that was a time limit on many people of color blacks you know work ... socioeconomic status that like they all had a stake in the issues and what we've seen over the course of the last ten to Fifteen to Twenty years as as some African Americans got ahead they felt like\nThe issues around the equality and good education and fair housing\nOr not their issues because they were doing well those are the issues of the\nUm the lower income African Americans while I think we're at a time now where we can appreciate that these are all of our issues you know as this administration the federal government this administration seeks to undo ... or if I shouldn't say I do but to do further damage to public education\nThat's not just a lower income or lower and lower middle class is\nUm or lower and lower middle class issue that's everybody's issue as they seek\nTo uh you know like I Do a lot of the reforms in policing and criminal justice that President Obama put in place or you know bullets don't know any difference between the poor and rich when it comes to black children and black men and women so that's an that's now that's an everybody

rights or how they deal with the woman's right to choose right now\nThis is as serious as it gets\nAnd I think one of the things that's important for people to appreciate is you may not see like an outright reversal wrote and wait a immediately but what you begin to see is the Supreme Court allowing cases on reproductive rights to make their way through the state court\nAnd all the way up to the Supreme Court and you may begin to see things like the Supreme Court saying well the state has a right to restrict\nI'm you know a woman a right to choose or you know a state has a right to decide a you know who and who may be able to receive a access to birth control or\nA you know right here to board a stake in limited powers he would have happened in the past is that once the Supreme Court ruled on these bogus its weight it was like considered the law of the land and so this group court was hesitant\nThe court was hesitant to either to do anything that seemed to take away the power but what the Supreme Court might begin to do is to let the states have more power which then it would allow to be a rose in without an outright reversal ago wait\nAnd see the new roads you know rural ...

saying is yeah we shouldn't have a affirmative action so they support that they support that opinion of the those students if it makes its way to the Supreme Court\nThen you'll see a affirmative action further to the way he talked about voting rights they've already recently Google on cases where they're allowing\nCertain a certain change with the latest state level that restrict people's on
