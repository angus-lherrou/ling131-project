that are hurt your conversation before the break\nOr about how history is important here our contacts as important or you know and that the the lack of history and the lack of how we uh you know let our our future let our children know\nAbout you know history history going back to the sixty years back four hundred year um will\nWill always a it is is a detriment to us because then we don't understand like how the these are extended struggles for what we've gone through over the centuries but you know tragically it it is an extension of what we're going through as a nation this this very violent\nStrain of white supremacy of white nationalism\nThe the president just talking about how proud a national if he is recently at a political rally right you know you see him you know basically create using all of this dog whistle language\nBecause he's tried to uh galvanize the Republican base during these congressional it turns\nAnd the only way that he knows how to do that is the ... century make that base very violent or to have a very violent reflex to target is political enemies that's the sort of messaging the kind of coding and signaling that he was using that's what this is all about because he's not using any sort of coding or signaling\nTelling his base or telling his supporters to target Republican\nTelling his base or telling his supporters to target Republican members of\nCongress or ... or or conservative luminaries or even himself you know or the office of the president's you\nKnow he's he's talking more specifically about political detractors detractors in the media a specific Democrats he's using the perfect blend dog with when you're a coating\nThat's now uh now bubbled up into actual action that we're saying so this is this was a very this is not only a very consequential and it's stored midterm bribery it's a very dangerous one\nNow I said earlier in the show\nThat you can't sever the climate that this president as hell dude sent from what

Montana\nSupporting the man who a body slammed a reporter\nSiblings my kind of guy I mean this whole climate there we and has certainly impact on some of the things that's happening I cannot say is direct but you certainly can't say who not operating in a bottle of dry climate that the president has played it and to\nWrite you know he's played into it he he can't help themselves\nAnd so you know everything that he's doing is self interest that is ... it's about maintaining position and status for himself maintaining electoral a political and policy making status for himself and so the only thing he knows how to do in order to win\nA is to create that kind of\nA very a hazardous a very dangerous very volatile environment or or climate that we're you know the climate was already polarized\nYou know you already had a you know a few will know lying about or gas line about on the roadway you know he's just basically taken a match now as president of United States because as we've always said wherever the president of the United states sets the tone he sets the theme\nOf the moral standard for the country and so this is that in moral standard that we're saying now and he's ... he's he's taken a match and he's he's ...\nHe's let that gas that you'll that's been in the roadway for quite some time now in this very polarized political climate and if that were in and he shows no sign of calming down on that he actually shows more side of doubling down on it or not just domestically but geopolitically as well\nGo to Rebecca in Chicago W Rio in sixty nine the home of

after this election I Am hoping that you're going to ask one simple question what is your excuse now and how dumb can you be I Love you guys\nI Love you child we on your we talked about it earlier but I Want you to go in the president saying he is a nationalist\nI Love you child we uh we talked about it earlier but I Want your take on the president saying he has a nationalist [noise]\nYou know so ... saying that he's a nationalist than as sort of touching or with the caller just said a it's sort of like as as sort of like back when you know the Klan which show up on your front yard and burn a cause\nI mean that's really what that is about you know and and his saying that he's a national it he's trying to hit on the surface he's trying to convince everyone well this is the language that I have to use to get my base galvanized\n'em to warn people that uh this election is about me\nBut the more Democrats you vote for is the more likely that they'll kick me out of office you know he's been very\nSuccessful up to this point I'm making this election about him a and if we consider this election being a referendum about him than he is going to use very loaded term like nationalism or national it's and it's very much also like you know once again going back to that\nComment I made before the break about coordination there that just seems very coordinated that seems very coordinated either well beyond that the U.S presidents I mean there's a lot of talk about nationalism there has been for some time for for a over a decade now in Europe for example that's what's been\nUh been taking Europe a part of taking the European part is the this is just open I mean and they're open and brazen about it ... you know I mean they're just they're they're basically holding it like hey we're national as we want more of that and and see for students of history\nStill Fisher would be real nervous about this and we'll hysteria and understandably historical about it because this is the kind of language that type of posturing that we saw in moments of history like right before World War two\nYou know and and I I mean unless I'm In a less people don't know about World War two or less there are people out there who do know about World War two I don't want another world war two you know but you know based on what's happening domestically and how things are lining up on the foreign policy front\nIt's just like your caller said is very dangerous times people should not sleep or what's happening right now\nNow the other point of that or is that when you are dealing\nEvery day more and more with the global economy global technology a and global list by advocating how we bring up the standards of\nClimate change are being dealt with say you are nationalist now when you are represent the most powerful country in the world rival learning China would signal are you sending to the global village\nRight right just you're saying that you don't want to be a leader on those issues so we have we have something going one that's much more severe than than what it's called the phrase that climate change you know it's the climate crisis that type of\nClimatic beat her allowed me to Raj changes that were going through and black people need to stop thinking that this is just the white people's issue because black folks on the front lines of these climatic disasters one day happened whether they're hurricanes tornadoes or flooding um so the\nThe basically the president and say hey I Want to be a nationalist\nI'm ... I Want us to step away\nFrom our role as a as a global or a planetary leader on these very real issues you know so instead of talking about being a leader on climate crisis she's talking about trying to create a space for us\nOn these very real issues you know so instead of talking about being a leader on climate crisis she's talking about trying to create a space for it you know or talking about being a nationalist or talking about you know a beating up journalists you know that's that's what she's thinking about him you know once again\nIt's it's the narcissism at this particular president were all he's thinking about is what some of them and how he can win the day and the day after that\nAnd then all the way into the twenty twenty election\nNow let's go to the phones ...
