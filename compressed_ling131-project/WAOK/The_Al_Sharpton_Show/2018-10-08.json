younger than a doctor Lowery and Reverend Jackson uh so uh uh we got some catching up to do so we gotta stay healthy\nYes and by the way Reverend Al happy birthday to you to\nGo and thank you uh let me start by you wrote a column that I'm sure wrote raised some eyebrows\nThat ah I wanted to get you to discuss for we'd go to the phones and you say title is what if Kavanaugh is not the Supreme Court judge everyone assumes he will be ... what do you mean by that\nWherever that I'll be almost a dyed in the wool assumption almost an article of faith that a judge Kavanaugh will be belong dream the fifth vote that ultra conservatives said she'll be and\nUh everybody on the right once the Supreme Court will be the one that will roll back almost everything that are of social political economic educational you name it all the games with the twentieth century but he's a he's basically bad news a disaster for progressives\nAnd anybody that really believes in all the games that this country has made civil rights civil liberties\nA women's uh women's issues women's rights I mean we can go on and on economic justice\nNow that may be true that they will be true that is one of the reasons why\nAre you I and other organizations fought tooth and nail against his confirmation and we\nWe certainly make no apologies for that uh but on the other hand I Am mindful river now that are sometimes things don't always pan out\nThe way some that scheme and manipulate in this case a GOP think they will we know that uh or from ... court justices from World war and all the way through David Souter\nSometimes presidents supplement them\nTheir concern they get on the court and sometimes they actually do things that go counter to the political philosophy of the party and the president that put them in there we also know to that in the case of Kevin now he's going to be the most watched Supreme Court justice in us history almost certainly\nThere are a number of issues that are going to come before the court that so he's already taken positions on on the appeals court in his writings and speeches\nThere'll be demands that he recused himself he probably will but nonetheless it's going to be there the other thing a ribbon al we'll be mindful of on women's issues there's a number of of of cases it will be certainly wind is way up to the court eventually involving a number of things involving gender issues\nI think even there he's going to be very carefully watched and every step of the way he's going to be challenge too so I think\nAgain he may well be that died in the wool ultra conservative reactionary that we all you know Glenn in terror from but at the same time he may not be but the point of the matter is rev and now he's going to be watched and he should be watched\nAnd now the\nFact is that we're all of the fear to\nDonald Trump is redoing the the whole judicial history in this country\nUh he's appointed a now two members of the Supreme Court die in the years that two of the uh for a point many of the nine that sit there now or done by a\nGeorge Bush who lost the popular vote by five hundred thousand votes to Al Gore and now a by Donald Trump who lost by two point eight million so\nFar the nine justices were nominated a by two men that lost the popular vote in this country that in itself is interesting and then you have one more that the a conservative giving a five four majority if they vote conservative\nAs expected but uh you have a the the appointments by Trump or two in the Supreme Court and he's only been there less than two years\nTwenty six and a federal court of appeals he's appointed twenty six judges and forty one judges in district courts\nSo what all of the DNA and all of the tweets into drama\nA lot of people are missing that he is planning judges on the bench at the top levels of the courts that I'm In line with his thinking and many feel the federalist society thinking who are the ones that provide a lot of

I thank you letter from from the Reverend Jackson who's who I Would say is that you know stop what for our people for so such a long time but I truly appreciate that and I want to wish a happy birthday but we are so quick to step on the next of our own people\nAnd ... other people mercy or would they do just a little is the smallest things for us and I'm Glad that you were eloquent um and then kind of feel straight and those people out there and are you know I think wall criticism\nOf Robert Jackson and and the second point I Want to make as far as the clock McDonald is a\nYou know it it concerns me that our military you know when we when they go to combat have rules of engagement that ah that protect enemy combatants\nMore so than we have for the people of the United states to actually citizens are police\n... allowed to go out there and mold down and just by Philip threatened and you can't do that uh when you're in the United states military you have to have some kind of restraint and there's a loser the gadgets and how you have to engage the enemy all I think we need to put a little stricter rules for our citizens it it it\nIs absolutely mind boggling badly or that you know an enemy combatants and we go over to Iraq and Afghanistan if you put that bomb in the wrong place and you kill a bunch of innocent civilians are they going to court martial will put you in jail\nOr but here we can uh you know we've got a woman walked into the wrong apartment killing someone and we got to think about what charges were going to file a gas or I just found out that in ... and my last point um is\nVoting you know several people have touched upon that today we can do a lot of things as people but at the the report to us like voting\nAnd ensuring that we see we we we we protect our rights that we protect what our forefathers pick people that have more it's like you have done for us it's insane\nWent up ... for hurricane can can go stand in line and and and and then by here for the hair or get their nails done but if you talk about going to vote and signed up your kid Eighteen years old\nThat's not a priority is wrong we'll wrongheaded in our coach and how we're doing things in our own community we need to get our priorities straight\nThings on the other thing for ourselves I\nShouldn't have properly registered to vote or learning how to do those type of things we're doing that to ourselves and I just want to thank you for your time but I Want to just\nKind of regime and you know thank you so much in three ... and and you know one one of the things I'm\nRiver jak who's really learned a grown up in a dark vision is ... see a lot from the oldest staff member\n\nLowery room and you're young and others and I learned from ... and bill Jones and those are older than me when I came in the ...\nAnd one thing that I learned from them is that if you're going to take this journey of fighting for social justice and\nFairness you not going to be a lot of appreciation even from the food you play pool\nAnd our parents that on all the time to young leaders that are coming over national action network if you knew you were even more appreciation you will be disappointed because people will criticize you for coming when there is a problem even though\nIt was a problem even though families may I ask you to come out as I say what the four who come jobs are looking for listening on radio and TV show I don't leave a blizzard here but that's what they'll say\nAnd if you don't come why didn't become uh-huh a big enough for you all get that and at some point you got to make up your mind there you go do what is right and all that you can do and not worry about\nThe rest and uh I think er and is is right and that's why I corrected that\nTo take them with the\nRibs Jackson there's been struggling for sixty years keeping payroll for a ...\nA a a a much smaller staff I think we're\nGetting for ways to just be critical of each other in non mindful of the large contributions and I'm not saying that\nAll of us don't make mistakes and then and and don't fall short but we are at least try to weigh the good as opposed to give ... ... ...\n...\nI have to do and Ninety nine percent of folks didn't do it all most folks never leave home and do anything to anybody but themselves never put them on their family at risk so I think that they ought to\nBe some appreciation that's why I always recognize people like wherever Lauer his birthday and from Jackson and they're on a par Hutchinson at all because\nThey did things they did not have to do and we benefitted from they had the talent\nThat oratorical skills they go to just been big liver preaches they could have done in in some\nThing they did and I think that do is show appreciation\nOne front

have not everyone in Milwaukee feels like the previous caller I think\nPresident Obama did an excellent job as president he said he rescued this economy after Bush put that to the recession is so not everyone feels I can I just wanted to say that but my question today the rare now and maybe I'm wrong but\nI was so disappointed with Joe Manchin of West Virginia voting to install capping off\nFor the Supreme Court and you know the fact that he waited to see what I'm Still a college is going to do\nBut I did a Twitter war ... really because I said that he was wrong to do that and and people are trying to plan out to me that keep up with the Democrats thirty nine percent of the time so we should be happy for that little little bit that we get from him thirty nine percent as opposed to sixty one percent that he's starting with the kids\nTo start Kavanaugh and start Gorsuch and everything that they want pretty much the boats what's up I'm wrong if I'm thinking that he really is a Democrat I Would like you to play it out 'cause I Can't imagine\nAll arguments you Carol is they call him an honorary member of the Republican caucuses but does out much you can debate even though you and your every now and one of the things that when when they talk about ...\nVotes thirty nine percent of the time Democrat but he voted called garbage even after the hill Garland out from the Supreme Court he voted to confirm Gorsuch he voted now that confirms\nOh bless we just went to West Virginia campaigning against meant he would do as a junior\nWhen did a rally for ... opponent\nI don't even understand why he thought even some of the ... and right wing Democrats in West Virginia who are unable understood him going where Trump Trump came in his state and campaigned against any voting thing you ever know candidate anyway\nOkay Robert I Love Heidi Heitkamp for standing up to ... what was right and I want to say that and I love your every now and I'm going to make sure I watch the new

happy Seventy seven birthday and I want to congratulate you as well for the new times for your show and I apologize because I Want to let you know that I'm a freshman in high school now\nTo my my hours have changed I haven't been able to call in as frequently and I normally would be in school right now I don't get out until four o'clock\nBut today is we had a student holiday and but I also

get it but we're now\nI Want us well before I get to my subject well more thing I Want to say is I also have the local TV show here though we started in Richmond, Virginia and it's called youthful voices and what we do on the show is coasting it with another boy he was about\nTen years old and what we're doing his money educate young people in adults about issues that affect us because\nI'm fourteen years old and I realize the high price that was paid for us to be where we are today there was a high price for our ancestors who came before us right now our ancestors who fought for our voters right at the day we have to realize that they were active so that\nUs TV shows and radio stations like this to come to fruition because for over one hundred years\nOur ancestors were legally disenfranchised by Jim Crow laws literacy tests property ownership of climate poll taxes and many other forms of legalized racism\nAnd with the Trump Administration and Kavanaugh now being set it on to the Supreme Court we as a people better start caring about whether or not\nWe will have a right to vote anymore we better start caring about whether or not we will have the right to attend a College of our choice we better start caring about whether or not we will have any hope of a fair justice system and I want to challenge adults to start doing a better job\nOf educating themselves on voting rights on sex\nOn voting rights on sexual abuse and sexual assault on domestic violence on criminal justice on three branches of our own government weapon now because we have to realize that we are currently a very very sad time\nWherever you know they're the old saying about the babies and you fourteen years old I use the Jews but ten\nAnd or your wisdom is beyond your age your on it and
