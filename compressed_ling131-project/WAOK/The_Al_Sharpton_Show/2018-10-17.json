war for quite some time in places like Syria\nUm that's where you see like a Iranian backed the Iranians funded forces\nBattling against Saudi backed\nAnd funded forces the same thing is going on in Yemen I Know a lot of your listeners have heard about the the humanitarian crisis that's happening there in Yemen and Saudi Arabia's invasion and Saudi Arabia is actually engaged in a war with US military back and you actually have US military tankers that are fueling Saudi fighter jets\nUm as their rating indiscriminately get many cities and villages so that you had that cushy relationship so it from the president's perspective it puts them between a rock and a hard place because he's like well\nI don't want to go against Saudi Arabia because I have this relationship with them based on also\nThis arms agreement it's a multi your arms agreement that the United states has with Saudi Arabia right now a it's a it's a near a billion dollar arms ... arrangement of which the Saudis will be purchasing all sorts of high tech\nUs weaponry so there's that and also continuing to lean on Saudi or the Saudis are the Saudi king them as a hedge against geopolitical levels like Iran so that's really what this was all about\nI mean it's it's essentially about the president protecting his interests with Saudi Arabia you know he's trying to also maintain some kind of relationship with turkey\nBecause turkey is a great buffer uh as far as that Syrian conflict and also as far as Russian influence in the middle east um so you know he led Turkish investigators league that the details of that investigation out as a way to sort of\nCurry a little bit or placate or the Turkish government but his priority right now is the Saudis and last thought is that this is really dangerous in terms of geo political of foreign policy norms that people are thinking well\nWhat's this have to do with me the disappearance and the killing the murder of tomorrow 'cause showed you well now we're in an era where we have a presidency\nAh that is allowing these types of ... or dictatorial regimes to do whatever they want\n'em and that's the kind of message that the Trump Administration has been sending you know obviously the Obama administration didn't send that kind of message so people would think twice people like the Saudi kingdom would think twice before doing something as flagrant is that\nCutting up a journalist ended up pieces while he's alive and screaming in a consulate\nOn foreign soil you know something out of a bond movie that that basically we're hearing the reports that

massive refugee crisis that the U.S is is playing no sort of leadership role on\nYou know these are things\nThat you know these are issues where there is aid of a global standard is maintained a global convention on things like refugees or chemical weapons or nuclear weapons eve you're even you know you have a situation now where we're a nuclear arm nations are actually upgrading their nuclear weapons\nAre right remember rubber Robert I mean President Obama was all about hey we need to start dramatically reducing our nuclear are exactly ... ... this these are really a precarious times we're living in\nIt's all about hey we need to start dramatically reducing our nuclear are exactly right that this these are really ah like precarious times were living there right now\nLet's go

and ... okay they knew back in ... before at some point in the future blacks Latinos Asians the voter right the voters are going out number\nA particularly you know all my fault in as far as the voting booth\nSo if we know that\nThat's the case why don't we have a plan B that's what I Can't understand that young lady said why ... why is the Democratic leadership not putting forth bills or something the kind of add what they do I really believe that this is Kevin Oh\nA appointment was up ... or half say they don't care about abortion they don't care about gay rights or ... what they care about is using the Supreme Court\nTo maintain power by suppressing their votes what they did up in North Dakota right now it's legal to inform if I'm not mistaken too\nConservative justices bowed it that that was legal for them to be able to use that surgery to deny\nA Lisa Murkowski Senate seat that are really the jury mad at the Senate so that\nThey're going to be in control of the Senate aim of question about no wind blowing them do work in in all ... states like it didn't work last two years though unless you've been working to turn the lights just what are we going to do\nWell I'm going to let a child of an infant but first of all I think that clearly a the federal bench is being backed a wood federal judges lifetime appointments by\nPresident Trump as he did capture not on the Supreme Court level one of the reasons that you need to set that is you don't have the numbers could not come from them if you don't put people in there that has the majority where they can we stop there's one\nSecondly I think that what we have to do is not a concern ourselves with and I agree with you on this Curtis of what they're doing the question is what is the opposition doing and what is the strategy and the on the ground playing that is why\nReally above all over the country\nAs I said I was in Indianapolis or yesterday\nAnd that's why ... all over the country\nAs I said I was in Indianapolis yesterday\nI'm In Illinois a late tomorrow night I think that uh if we just sit by wringing our hands on what they're doing and not to have a cow to move an account of movies too\nAs as Greg and Greg palace was on\nEverything from law suits to a questioning them at the polls to bringing out numbers that they can stop because just like a big current as was right\nAnd I think current as was called a ... they did to thousands sixteen let us not to get in two thousand eight and twelve we elected in we elected a black president CERN bad not invincible\nJust that we got to say where did we do to win to get past the obstacles in the answers are then we came out and numbers they could not a deal with\nAnd we challenge them and I think a lot of buzz got lazy or use side excuses that we didn't get turned on by Hillary and then they were able to maneuver the electoral college and snatched the White House\n[noise] absolutely right wherever and and uh we we all have to be on the same page a first you know we have to establish some consensus around how high stakes this environment is right now you know once we established that\nThat consensus that mindset a then you're absolutely right we have to I end the call is right I mean we have to identify alternative strategies outside of what\nExact Democrats are doing right now I mean yeah Democrats are actually in terms of fundraising are are are out pacing\nOverwhelmingly Republicans I mean they they they're doing about double the fundraising pace of versus Republicans\nAre and they could they could easily use some of that money uh to to engage in aggressive law suits and places where voter suppression has taken place like in Georgia and Florida for example right or wherever they identified\nBut they're not going to do that so what we're doing what what's the other way cp legal Defense Fund doing what's what's the national bar association during that sixty five thousand members black lawyers black judges black prosecutors\nBlack law students what are they doing you know what I mean let's ask ourselves what what what our organizations what tools we have at our disposal how are we utilizing votes\nUm are we partnering up I mean I heard an announcement a couple of weeks ago I'm I'm sure you've probably heard about it we're live um and I was quite impressed by where I\nLive here hey and these key states\nYou know you got about thirty six governor's race was going on about sixteen of them look like they're going to flip the Democrat\nYou know and and so you know were lifted saying hey we'll get free rides to folks who want to get rise to the polls if you're in a state like Georgia and Florida and North Carolina where they're shutting down polling precincts so you know I ... well surprise about I'm like I'm not seeing anybody getting real excited about this are reaching out to live\nAnd saying hey let's let's let's put the word outlets as many\nAs many black folks who cash\nOr or who take a ride share or were live and we don't know about that so it's it's we have we have mechanisms we have tools at our disposal that we did not have\nFifty sixty years ago we are not completely powerless in that situation\nAbsolutely not let's go to David in Washington DC on W O L David\nHow you doing I'm fine how can you hear me yes\nWhile I'm listening to you right I'm thinking of seeing that I can get a question that I got for you without being offensive and my thing was on counter\nWhile I'm sitting and listening to you right I'm thinking that thing that I can get a question that I got for you without being offensive\nAnd my thing was on counter and then in your last statement you use the word so it's funny you know just out of work of black people think like I think\nWell this is my question for you know just like to use this word counter how can the Democrats counter what they're doing with the voting and stuff like that and then you can even apply that that have gone to like how do we call today and I I like to emphasize 'cause I heard him say also about it's about good and evil we have to remember God always counted say life\nEven as a second to the the man with the word and God came back with the words the thing that a life and even even call it a little bit in the fight will be ... ... on the coup a thick skin act he counted him all the different ... I mean look we can get the same thing he counts to go with non violence and and the ... the weapon of shame\nYou know we'll see some so my question you get to see what you think about adults with in my view on that a separate to counter what they're doing all of the Democrats represents a Republican represents the people that they're going into effect that job for their people without vote for them to protect them their attack of\nOur vote is the ... ... ... my opinion on the glue that I think the Democrats you the same factors I think with the public will they go through I pay for what look what look like in well we go through their animals that way if somebody's people than I Do and we get away with it you said you can't stand on him\nThere might be ... into like somebody in the pool and say okay we've got to stop the political or what do you think about that\nWell I think uh uh that the danger of that thank you for your call is that you will create a legitimacy for them going due to a rose\nOr suppressing the vote that there is no evidence or we should not be using bad tactics data on warranted and that are not justifiable against them\nBecause ah as as Greg palace in and I've been saying this for years since they started the voter id and voted purging\nThere is no proven voter fraud and then when the Justice Department study did they came up with zero point zero zero zero three percent voter fraud so our gone through the books is not going to repay any more voter fraud then they're going to do to books we need to let people understand\nBlink cameras systems are back in stock and right now they're Fifteen Percent off that's right Fifteen Percent off all security cameras\nVisit blink protected dot com slash radio for offer details that's blink project dot com slash radio like as an Amazon company limited time offered terms and conditions applied\nHonoring the choice to some of the relationship that we can be done to maybe go in the ... voice of the community or whether it\nWas wrong on\nThat afternoon Atlanta is Seventy one degrees downtown where your local time as two fifty nine PM animated Cooper and here's what's happening\nWhat county police are looking for a thirty four year old man accused of robbing\nA restaurant earlier this month according to investigators Zachary Miller walked into a subway restaurant I met last bridge road ordered a sandwich and do the men did cash from the registered police say that he left the store but then returned back because he forgot a sandwich\nWhen it county police department is asking anyone with information about his whereabouts to call nine one one\nIt was within his rights he was conducting a legal investigation and the young man was trying to be horribly combative\nThat Scott county police she might register responding to an incident involving one of his officers a twelve year old boy and his aunt at Cumberland Mall have our video shows a cop county officer arresting the child after he was caught selling CDs inside of the mall\nNot only is the Cobb County police department facing criticism\nThat she says that the officer has received numerous death threats if you're looking for a seasonal sign hustle well UPS it's hiring the company announced that they will be hosting a seasonal hiring jobs here this Friday calling it brown friday\nThe ... will be held from seven thirty AM to three PM and you can visit UPS jobs dot com for a location information and to apply online\nIn sports neither Georgia or Georgia Tech will be playing football this weekend the six rink bulldogs return to the field a week from Saturday against Florida in Jacksonville\nStarting off with some big time delays on the highway area of the cab county if you're traveling north of north hills shut down in both directions right now due to a huge apartment fire\nOr your alternate this afternoon movie to take either ah interstate eighty five or Peachtree but we are seeing delays now and eighty five south on coming into downtown earlier crash quickly cleared off to the side just north of seventeenth street and we're seeing delays on the south part of the time this afternoon on Seventy five\nNorth than we had an earlier tractor trailer accident near exit two Eighteen I'm Will Guerra ... duck Thirteen eighty W.
