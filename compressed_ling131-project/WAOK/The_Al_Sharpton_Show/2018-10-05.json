Kelly thank you for coming on attorney you going to tell us what's going on at this point would be banned I throw\nYes good afternoon and thank you for having me\nI Am at the late in criminal courthouse in Chicago we are awaiting the jury deliberations they got the case yesterday they've been deliberating and they were sequestered last night so they couldn't leave\nAnd I will say this to alternatives were released because they have a total of five the judge felt comfortable releasing to alternate those alternate when questioned by the press said that they would have both gone with a murder conviction for Jason Van Dyke\nOne other thing that happened yesterday river now you know usually it's very rare for someone who is charged with first degree murder should be allowed to have free freedom to come and go from the core me how she became you to make the bond with Jason Van Dyke since the beginning has been able to not only work a job\nA chick four hundred days just to arrest him in the first place [noise] she's been able to come and go and be pleased but yesterday they wanted him to stay in the building so that while the jury deliberate in case they want to ask questions or anything like that he will be available well she left and he did not get back\nWhen the judge needed to be back so she was threatened with having his bond\nResults today the judge patch for him to come forward and and explain why he left he said that his daughter was threatened but he really didn't have a credible claim but ultimately the judge did not\nGo ahead and provoked his mind he said just not going to go for this anymore but it just shows you know ... they're giving a lot of difference to him because he is a police officer um we're just waiting on there are rumors that there may be a verdict\nThey are unsubstantiated because also other people are saying there is not effort jet I Will say this the jury had a question you know he is charged with first degree murder\nShe also they also could come back with a finding of second degree murder but he's also charged with sixteen counts of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon with with the fire are the jury asked a question they say the question this morning asking should they look at those sixteen charges of aggravated battery as\nAccording to the way the wounds were presented on the body you know he was shot sixteen cats medical examiner said that you all sixteen shots and should they look at it that way or should they just look at it\nAs like he got kids sixteen times period and the judge ruled that they need it to look at it is just that he got hit sixteen times so\nThe defense wants that you're one of the jury to have an instruction saying that if they found Jason Van Dyke not guilty for even one of those shots\nThey had to find him not guilty for aggravated battery for all of them the judge overruled that the judge not given instructions to the jury he said look at all sixteen shots I Hope that makes that kind of hard to explain a little bit but we're just waiting we're all waiting of the reason\nWhy so to me he can be ...\nKing shots I Hope that makes that kind of hard to explain a little bit but we're just waiting we're all waiting\nIn line so that means he can be convicted a for a ... a he could even if they feel that some of the shots were not\nA guilty that any of those shots could be guilty you exactly exactly he could be done now he'll do not guilty of all sixteen shots\nWhat happens\nIf you ask me what how you recorded they'd have to say he was acquitted of all sixteen shots independently\nCorrectly that is correct and and and the judge has given them actual jury sheets and he read them into court he had to read all thirty chew each she'd has either he's guilty of shot one or not guilty of shot more than she did that for each of the sixteen shots they are going to have to sign off on all of those\n... wow a ... a big if they do come ready today are they to question what do we get\nThe judge has the option of having them sequestered throughout the entire case usually he will make that\nTurned that determination you know as it as needed so today if they don't finish she'll say we're keeping you over the weekend and you know that's not strange for a judge to have a trial on the weekend and you know we have Columbus Day on the other thing wherever now that people have they're saying we're hosting the Chicago Marathon\nOn Sunday so we've got the least we've got people from all from every corner of the world's here so there have been some discussion of protest\nI don't know how credible they are you know if the if the verdict does not come down on the way they some people would want on either side so this is definitely something that bears watching all weekend if\nWhether this jury comes back today or even if they don't\nAll right we're we're going to stay in touch with you we are watching a very a close the ah ... attorney Kimberly ever ever

I mean do you find out what I'm saying but right now\nIn the mid it'd be misled the court to get on the court of appeals in D.C where you're now you're right that alone should be enough\nTo not only stop him from advancing do the Supreme Court would he shouldn't have been bill would be removed from that could be do\nThey they they did they did in April charges remember who wants to present it at that time\nAnother feat there'll be that George W.

forever or like a brief discuss love with you about this uh Kavanaugh situation will probably be confirmed [noise] so how do we get through that I mean what do you think the results will be for the midterm do you think it's going to ultimately get young people to come out and vote\nI think it should and I think that uh it was certainly give them an incentive but I think we've got to go out if he's confirmed and explained to them why\nThe vote matters because what we don't want is this bad that said and and as oh Trump won again and they give up\nThey need to know that there is a change in the ... uh in in the Senate that a lot of things that Trump would want to come from\nAnd a lot of things that he wants to put through can be stopped if the opposition parties and the majority because the balance of power as this country is set up\nIs this in parties and the majority because the balance of power as this country is set up is executive which is the president's legislative which is the Congress judicial which is the courts\nIf he has control of all three he can do whatever you want the least we can do they're going to decide in the Senate about the judicial\nBut the least we can do is decide the legislative we must balanced is and young people need to understand that they're going to have to live under this long good than those of us that are older\nAnd the decisions made will affect them the rest of their lives I think that yes it can bring a lot of young people out the millennial generation y and all but they have to understand why it means something to them\nWhat does it mean to their jobs what does it mean to their schools what does it mean to student loans what does it mean to policing we've got to break it down where they understand it a lot of times and

things quick things are going to offer Andrew Gillum Stacey Abrams it'll work we see these polls are now starting to close in or out these all races I mean do you think though that they can still win because of the right way to their credit they are very very motivated\nWell I think that we've got to motivate our size I think they can when you write the polls tightened up but the polls still have them both in a dead heat\nAnd when you're in a dead heat that means you work harder you run faster we've never had the odds stacked our way we can win if we come out the numbers are down\nIn Georgia

where the topic completely unloaded his weapon into the body of that young man he did a press conference are almost certainly a couple of months afterwards I only heard it yesterday\nAnd he said something very very uh interesting he said uh when asked why he shot\nAnd continue to shoot while he was down the officer said well I was so worried about you know him holding what he perceived to be alive\nNow I'm a former military members\nWe were taught to shoot set for mass and enemy combatants are holding bigger than not so and my mind I'm thinking how is the policemen gotta sit here and science justify shooting that got mad as as many times as he did but when he's on the ground he's worried about a night\nBecause as far as I can start he shot over the fence lot\nSo nice you got to be at arm's length plus four to six inches for it to be any type of the back of your ... your feet away from him shooting him pull a lead and more than that\nI'm looking at it from the point of well a policeman up a job is to protect concert even if it's something that had a job of policing that if the boring in or someone who broke the law and if you have to shoot your weapon the whole concept is to take a pass the date\nNot kill because a policeman if not the end of the justices\nThat needs to be brought before a judge if he tried by a jury of a series then he's guilty of why these beliefs that they could they could be just right excuse at all at once\nAnd that is the point and we're just a few moments away from the verdict being read on the ... trial and and what you saw was probably

to um that the Democratic candidates that are coming up\nI'm In November and and does that might run against Trump and just just in general for democratic candidates are running against Trump Trump Trump him directly or that trial based people that use the same\nType of our strategy that he is a shot I noticed that he was successful partially\nBecause of course we have things such as extended way and think of as such as the electoral college and things like that I ever but I think what I see that successful is he destroys the character of whoever they're put on it is and makes accusations and then also there's a mindset that he's perpetuate as far as as long as the economy is good to ... and slash\nThat you know we we we want to vote Republican that could actually hurt someone said that recently vote Republican doesn't the attack says oh he said that it can set as well oh actually slashed the taxes the economy is good so what what is your advice a Democrat\nI think that a big it's a good question uh uh to me first of all\nThey have got to stand up and give the facts\nAnd give the facts in a way that reaches the public I think that part of the problem that the Democrats had and have is they are not talking to the people and they're not continuing the doubled down\nOne of the things Donald Trump is is a promoter he he's like P. T. Barnum he\nOver cells bad product but if he here and it you start believing you\nAnd the Democrats have to have facts and our message than me jump to the people and go with over and over and over again\nBecause you can assume everybody understands and you can assume if you said once or twice\nEverybody hears it I think one of the mistakes of NATO Mrs Clinton is during the campaign is that when you act as though you're already there when you take it for granted then you end up giving room to your opponent you got to fight\nOthers do based on your news and information you're relying on even when you are near radio you can take distinction when you're on the go\nDownload the all new radio dot job app on your smartphone\nAnywhere [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nKnow the community\nFor weather\nFor the\nAfternoon it's Ninety degrees in downtown Atlanta where your local time has two fifty nine pm on a major Cooper\nAnd here's what's happening a lot of police is saying that a recent string of carjacking that an apartment complex near the ... center is not related this month to Morehouse students work hard jak within days of each other and earlier this week a live driver said he was held at gunpoint\nThey rolled up on me\nInvestigators believe all of the crimes were committed by different individuals\nIf you're looking for a seasonal part time or fulltime side hustle Kroger is looking to fill hundreds of positions for the holidays all Georgia stores will hold a job fair this Saturday and applicants are encouraged to stop by any Kroger between eleven AM and four pm to apply\nLast week it was Bill Cosby and this week it shut night yesterday judge Ronald coincidence the former rap mobile to twenty eight years in jail\nFor hit and run back at twenty Fifteen\nAfter the sentencing judge directly addressed the victim's family\nFeud and you can enjoy my social night\nWill stay close to three decades in prison\nHer address Bette Midler is apologizing for saying the N word will have the full story coming up in the next hour in sports Georgia Tech football is inaction tonight what George replace Georgia Bulldogs played tomorrow the yellow jackets are on the road at Lewis veal and the second rate bulldog post Vanderbilt\nOh it's a deal and the second rate bulldogs host Vanderbilt it's scattered clowns and light waves outside over and Clarkson cans are stone you study at eighty nine underneath the coupon is they talked Thirteen eight W A L K now must check your right\nAlso very busy started this Friday afternoon already seeing a jam packed ride north and south on on a connector between broke what an interstate twenty if you're heading out on the Southside Seventy five north and south very slow moving through Clayton and Henry county and in the cab I twenty east and west just that normal heavy friday afternoon volume between two eighty five and putting all the road\nI mow Guerra under isn't talked Thirteen any W A L K\nFor keeping it real with Al Sharpton or news and talk Thirteen eighty W.
