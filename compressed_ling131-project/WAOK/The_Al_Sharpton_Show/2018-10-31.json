aggressive has been in double ACP people ask going down would a civil rights groups doing have not seen more activism on the ground in the trench work\nThen were there in double ACP and others have done in a long time like I've seen in this season and is in no small measure to their presidents and CEOs nationally Derrick Johnson and he's on our live lion how you doing Johnson\nHow you doing ... thank you for having me\nThank you for being on and being on ... nation and we are working together and you're doing a lot and then a cp tell us what in a sea be doing on the ground and what you're finding out to be the uh challenges that we face\nAs well as you know the uh the people the opposition I've treated many many barriers to a voters from accessing about it or we just had a victory in Shelby County Tennessee where we filed the lawsuit Chevy counties were Memphis is held\nA against the election commissioners because they didn't want to process voter registration applications\nVery similar lawsuit that we filed in Georgia along with Christian Clark and the the Lord's committee or we are seeing fear like we've never seen before\nFrom individuals who refuse to give up power is the goal of N. double ACP a worker with a national action network and many others to turn out infrequent voters and that is going to be the key and we have the power\nNow and we see infrequent voters are being tapped cause that's going to be the power there is a lot at stake or because we're not just telling people uh to vote for a third person were telling them to vote to exercise their right and to protect their right in the doors\nAre being opened on doing that have been opened continued to be security over\nWell you know went to other people to vote for our future you know what I'm thinking about this election is about my Nineteen year old son and whether or not he's going to live in a world of Jim Crow or whether or not he was on a live in a world\nWhere he have a you will have opportunities I'm thinking about a friend of mine who has a little bit and whether or not she will be able to live our life with dignity because she's\nAble to afford enough tame health insurance or whether or not she's going to have to live on a life of this conflict because she can't afford the medication to control her lupus\nOr is it is about whether or not we're going to allow the current landscape of intolerance and racial hatred to fester whether I'm going to put a check on the White House\nTo make sure their levels of accountability we don't have\nMassacres in Pittsburgh or potential massacres Lewis fail Kentucky but for the church doors spend a lot a democracy at stake for African Americans we know all too well what the future could be because we live the reality of a of a history\nOf racial hatred and we got to stop it now and it's in the power of our vote\nNow running things you mentioned Pittsburgh one of the things also the civil rights groups have United around is encouraged them to turn to general sessions hands on that a lab arrayed on that\nWell you know we recognize the problem with ratio hate groups and there's a Justice Department have refused to aggressively addressed to ration\nOh the ratio hate groups and there's a Justice Department have refused to aggressively\nAddressed the ratio hate groups as they currently are situated shame will try to position the movement for black labs if it's a racial hey group and completely ignore individuals who were would have demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia\nAnd killed a white woman says because she was protested against uh hey we need this just department to be aggressive be vigilant and identify\nIndividuals who will commit racial hate crimes are we also waiting for them to label the little village shooter\nOr as a shooting as a racial a crap right individual who went to a black church on Wednesday night and we all do does Bible study and I\nAnd only because the doors are locked to the church uh that's the only thing that say Seventy people's lives who was in that church and because he couldn't get into the door you went to a Kroger\nAnd intentionally sought out and killed African American or we need this just department to have a higher standard to protect American citizens\nAnd and and and prosecute with all of all of its authority those who commit racially crafts\nAnd I think that in in the same God and we see the big green Shelby County that a tendency that the in the CBD\nYou are also dealing a in Texas you chapter there would pray view yuan would one of the students on a bomb to nation with the U.S on Sunday\nAnd uh there has been any number of attempts by Brian Kemp ... who's running on the Republican line for governor in Georgia so the ... all over in many states this is a multi faceted bad\nBut you know we have the power and and when you see this level of resistance is a signal that not only are we winning that opposition are in fear\nBut the only way we we will win if we turn out and vote see African Americans we put ... Obama in office in two thousand eight we help get him elected in twenty twelve when\nRomney didn't even have a concession speech because they just knew he was going to win but we've turned out in record numbers we must turn out a record numbers doing this midterm election so that we could put a check and put some accountability for our future this White House\nThis that and the Republican Party they have run a stray with what they're doing in terms of public policy racial intolerance and just the overall quality of life and when you think about it they control the White House they control the house\nThe Senate and now the Supreme Court has ruled that this may term election is our check me we need to bring some accountability into government so people can see themselves as owners of government and not be victims of government\nThe founding fathers though they didn't have votes in mind build a system of checks and balances and there are there are no checks and balances you just outlined because they are in control of all three branches of government right now\nBut you know we are the check and balance this mid term election would allow us to be the check and balance is African Americans turn out the vote\nAnd presidential level turnout we will be the check mate to stop what we're seeing right now this current political landscape in this midterm election is important not just because of who gets elected and now it's important because individuals who get elected to state legislative body\nAnd not just because of who intellect and now it's important because individuals get elected to state legislative body that eighty eight us all about a lot of Ninety seven they will control ... district and a twenty twenty they will could determine whether or not they're under the couch for the census cops\nAnd they will control the public policy that governors every day but typically education policy criminal justice policy\nThis mid term election they're so much at stake and it was the fine democracy for the next Fifteen plus years\nWhen we are faced with going to the polls and if someone is said that they are not there on the books they been purged or they can't find their name what are we instructing people to do\nYou vote any way you never leave the all without voting you actually provisional bad a ballot or the affidavit batter depending on your state law and your cash or bad in any way no matter what you do go to the polls and vote and if your neighbors are on Apollo ... book\nOn the night life and not you will hear him apologized for ... it's easy for me to love last season because what I have ... who I Am they may be why busy since every afternoon\nThe town hall style meetings with neighbors in Marietta indicator\nObama will be at a rally for Abrams at Morehouse College on friday well happy Halloween and if you're not into trick or treating well there's an alternative open were Christian ministries out in the urban is holding its annual harvest fast and pastor great Keller says that the theme is a night out with superheroes\nNight with the heroes is going to start at six o'clock this evening to eight o'clock open for all of the kids in his free black panther is going to be their wonder woman's going to be there are a lot of superheroes going to be there are plenty of food to eat for the kids play the candy game strange is going to be a wonderful time\nThe annual harvest says his tonight at the church in the address is sixty two thirty highway Ninety two out with everyone or you can call seven seven zero nine six for three three seven nine for more information\nIn sports the hawks losing streak is now at three after a one thirty six one fourteenth set back to the Cavaliers in Cleveland tray young score twenty four points to lead Atlanta and says that they just wasn't able to execute\nOrder certain areas are still getting some good offices are fish I'm just wasn't able to kiss\nThe hawks are back home to host the kings tomorrow night you're a W A L K weather forecast shows sunny skies would light wins out Decatur words Seventy three degrees later tonight expected to be partly cloudy with a low around fifty nine animated Cooper on using top Thirteen eighty W.

political strategist\nAnd the contributing editor to the roots dot com as well as the host\nOf reality check and he's a cause all sorts of executive producer reality check on Wu or the house of brilliant in Philadelphia to one and only Charles Allison how you doing jobs\nArgued or wherever I go to be with you there\nI'm good uh I'm I'm Glad to be with you we just spoke with Angela rise in she's working on in the Florida State of Florida with the the Gillum campaign\nAnd uh we talked with a of course Derrick Johnson who are in a few ... and there were a good working together around voter suppression and of course and they see the the law suits on this where do you see the midterms at this point\nWhen I was you know I definitely see a turnout rate that's going to be somewhat higher than than what it's been over the past forty years so we're looking at a turnout rate of journal overall mid term election turnout rate Reverend since Nineteen Seventy of under forty\nWe've been looking at a turnout rate a general overall mid term election turnout rate Reverend since Nineteen Seventy of under forty five percent on average a so like the last time we saw a mid term that was above\nForty five percent it was a Nineteen Seventy cents than the average has been about forty percent I predict that turnout overall turnout nationwide in this midterm election next by next week we'll be about fifty two percent you know and that's because there's just\nA increased awareness surrounding the mid term that's a that means that the majority are very slim majority of eligible voters will cast some sort of ballot in the mid term election but there are other factors that we have to take into consideration it's it's hard to tell us still a little foggy\nAs to you know whether or not Democrats will indeed dominate the house so the consensus is right now the Democrats were retake the majority in the house of representatives but don't be surprised\nIf Republicans hold onto that majority by very slim two or three seat margin because then you start looking at one these these these individual congressional districts and saying a lot of tight races\nAre in places where you you were expecting them not to be so tight because they're all this talk about a blue wave a you look at um also Donald Trump's approval numbers his approval numbers right now\nKind of like you know when you look at it by by break 'em down by demographic by demographic they kind of slightly match\nUm the exit polling\nNumbers or at the various demographics that he won or did fairly well within two thousand sixteen\nYou know so that may be some concern to Democrats as well and then we have to look at the uh you know also how voter suppression or is impacting these races and voter suppression as a wide range of strategies from gerrymandering you know they're still the impact of redistricting and gerrymandering games that Republicans have played over the years\nI'm to the closing of polling precincts or voter id um or people playing all sorts of games\nIn early voting you know like what we're seeing in Georgia\nAnd the games are they going to play on Tuesday so there's a I I Do see a turnout increasing\nBut then I'm not sure exactly where you know who's ... who is that going to favor\nNext Tuesday you know we we may also see a situation here and you know Democrats have a narrow opening for the Senate um but they may not retake the majority in the Senate I Do believe that Democrats have a real good chance capturing a majority of governor seats\nOr this particular cycle than they've had in previous cycles\nSo I and that's one of the reasons why I like uh uh when do you uh coast because you give them real and and so will view\nUs saying that just because we are feeling turned out that does not necessarily mean ten is all a blue wave that could be a mixed bag that could be in some areas a red wave oil rig drowning\nOr so when we got to be clear on what we're doing\nWhat we have to be very clear on what we're doing we have to reset expectations here we can't be lulled into a and into any sort of a complacency a between now and next Tuesday we all our energies and all our\nUh all our you know every everything that we're we're now kind of focused on at this point has to be on turnout turning out as many\nAll our you know every everything that we're we're now kind of focused on at this point has to be on turnout turning out as many numbers you know particularly black and brown voters so you know you've got about a over half\nOf the the states where you have large black population shares for example are states where you have crucial battleground races going or whether they're\nA governor's races or whether they're Senate races you know places like\nMississippi Georgia Florida Pennsylvania these are places where you have high\nBlack and brown population shares or even other places like Nevada Arizona so that also has to be factored in as well uh but you know another thing that that that's a concern\nTo myself in a lot of other people as a lot of this early voting that's happening we're seeing an increase in early voting and one would assume that that's an advantage for Democrats but based on the ballots that are being counted in certain key states\nOr in places like Georgia for example and even Pennsylvania we have Republican voters actually having somewhat of a of a slight edge\nIn early voting returns at this moment or an absentee ballot returns\nAnd in places like Pennsylvania are you seeing an increase in the early voting which we think historically that would benefit Democrats but right now at this stage you know we have encountered all those ballots ballots are still being counted is still streaming in for right now Republicans have a ... just a slight edge that\nLet's go to the phones let's go to Chicago W.

another eighth grade it Denise ... social studies report on it so that was back in the Reagan Administration and heard a little bit about on the radio and I remembered that I look back on the facts here with the\nWind Kim art was born in the United states and San Francisco his parents were Chinese Nationalist they did business in the United states and California and they had a permanent residents here okay at some point his parents went back to China\nAnd won ... went to go visit his parents when he came back they wouldn't let him in the country okay to make a long story short it ended up going all the way to the Supreme Court where he won the case six to to based on the fourteenth amendment and Eighteen Ninety eight\nTo dissent and judges were um Melville Fuller who was the chief justice and not nominated by Grover Cleveland and John ... who was nominated by Rutherford behaved don't confused as Harlan with his grandson who was also a Supreme Court justice nominated by Eisenhower much much later [noise]\nThe thing that stands out to me and connection to this is one it's already been decisions already been made on how this is supposed to go in to and this is the reason why I bought the justices names that weren't they went against the decision it was a six to to\nLook at how they look at how these guys handled their cases separate from this one consider who appointed them which is why I gave the names of who appointed them\nAnd then go back and look at the case again if a twelve or Thirteen year old can can delivered his case and an eighth grade social

that\nYes he he was he was born in this country and but his parents with illegal immigrants and they want to disrupt the fourteenth amendment based on the legal immigrants bringing their kids here said bringing them coming here so that the children to be born and become citizens it still comes down to the same thing\nThe agreement made to the public when something one ... one of the law goes

comes up later that disrupts the value to the common good the value to the common good is not being disrupted\nSo there's a report and broadcast everything I say it was recorded I don't need to repeat it again take a look into it the Eighteen Ninety eight Ron come arc versus\nThe uh I I Am familiar with the gays and thank you for your call to see I think that we got to look at\nWhen something

about here Donald Trump is many things but he knows he can't by executive order overturned a constitutional amendment but he wants to gel up his base\nRight like he's got them big and some migrants\nThat are marching from Honduras\nIs approaching the border near thousand miles away they started\nAnd they had they wanted to Seventy five hundred people they downed about forty five hundred people and in the next thousand miles it may be down to nothing but is to get everybody all hyped up why because he wants you to forget about\nPittsburgh you want you to forget about other things that

the base and and to a certain degree I mean up until this past weekend where suddenly the Americans I guys the American a discourse had to deal with Pittsburgh and had to unpack those fourteen male

that after that whole migrant caravan story dropped\nAnd so you know and it was happening you could see who will trends sort of searches based on a each state so key states like Pennsylvania for example the the previous week you're most folks most voters in Pennsylvania we're searching for trying to get information on that we're focused on\nIssues like health care and Social Security or medicate which gave an indication that\nAh Democrats highlighting the fact that Senate majority Mitch McConnell had talked about cutting\nSocial safety net programs that resonated with a lot of voters they're like no they can't take that away but then suddenly incomes the migrant quite a ... story and then suddenly immigration popped up to the number one Google Trends search\nA just a week after everyone was focused on health care so you absolutely right Reverend it's it's a great distraction tool or technique that the president is using uh to to vary a serious effect\nAnd and it's also
