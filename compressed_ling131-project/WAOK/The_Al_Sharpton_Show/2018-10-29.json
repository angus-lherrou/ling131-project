I remember all the bishop Parma North Carolina came out and said that America\nHas a heart problem because individuals' it'd be gone down and in in the fashion if these people are being gone down but yet it one way or we could find somebody or sending out pipe bombs but we can't find these individuals' right here in the community and they had not gone across state lines\nYeah rubbing I think you have a real real heart problems when you stop and you look at a couple of issues that are plaguing this entire country unemployment\nHealth care and and it affects all different creeds and colors of individuals and yet when it comes time for the most of the court and objectivity that his place in the United states of America\nYou have got to come on a radio station and bag and played individuals' to vote\nAnd you keep asking an individual what is your excuse what we do have that allows you to act like that this country is not ran on basic principles at one is the power of your boat I Would simply like the close with my heartfelt condolences\nTo every individual has lost loved ones to this madness in this country and we still will not come out as a country and ask a question what is they do oh what a salt style weapon period\nAnd I simply end with this because this is the best on the ball you ask what that leadership made and got out of out of their meeting with the president they got lifetime all expense paid tuition to dummy university and that's what I say you ought to subscribe to W.

issue in the coal emerges you're using\nIt well I think that that's a good question thank you for your call the danger of the federalist society is that their lives and their recommendation on judges that will be seated on the bench\nWith Senate confirmation which is why voting is important for a lifetime\nThey are the ones making the recommendation\n[noise]\nCame in keeping it real I'm your home [noise] Reverend Al Sharpton and\nWe're back one age seven seven five three to five seven nine seven and let's go back to the phones hot button Monday dimitrius dimitrius you keeping it real on Al Sharpton without shopped\nHey how you do a real shock and how good\nA health care and I just wanted to comment a I Believe the bombings the attempted bombing last week and also the shootings it's sort of like this was a conspiracy you know for them to occur back to back like it was and they'd always say to be a whoever's saying to speak out\nOr anything or to disagree with Donald Trump you feel like there's some type of organization that we don't know about attempting suicide is still individuals\nEven though the Catholic Church you know they have a a lawsuit against them you know for what the police have been for the Catholic Church also have been real liberal and some of their policies around the country and it's kind of a for the Catholic Church to really be attack doing on a K campaign season\nSo I Believe we are really live behind the same that just look at it down a troubled by the sound terrible organizational syndicate it put it in certain parts into a fate would call this Sunday events advance to take place\nAnd I also I Believe uh because of the virus is taking place or because of the groups that we have to be aware of surrounding you know because a lot of people work out of the suburbs we're not too many uh other people like the sale so we have to really be aware of where we go to work if it's a majority Caucasian neighborhood\nOr even um I'm just traveling visiting people and and the other states\nUm that are basically my comment and I like the only response and also well more than ... percent kind you're with them and brown\nA we have to look at uh where did you see any type of money for the organization Jim Brown does run organizations you might get some type of benefit economy which is where not just the publicity okay a\nLeg you for your call a\nUh I Do not know that there is a correlation between uh the pipe bomb all\nAnd uh they shoot in Pittsburgh I I don't think there's any evidence of that other than they are both full of hate and then them and the connection could be a the a\nKind of rhetoric and climate does out here are like a a\nI think that that when you look at they had that they revealed this new social media\nOr a ... engine golf I Believe is gab or\nSomething and I never heard of so there's all kinds of stuff going on that there is a threat in terms of communication I don't know if they're direct conspiracy then they may not be a be the need to do that\nIf they are in operating in a climate like this let's go to a Steve in North Carolina who series exam on twenty six\nOr seven hour it's always great to talk to you thank you I've I've called before and I'm a raise this criticism about uh\nTo you argue I've I've called\nBefore and I'm a raise this criticism about a new senator from Alabama or Doug Jones who does a debt of gratitude\nA large part to a record turnout among black women and blacks in Alabama in general ... um\nYou know given the current climate with a synagogue being bombed\nA a a an attack\nOn the ticket attacks on churches in Kentucky or you know of course the manual non um wouldn't it be great if we had a senator who could stand up\nAnd uh and that had experienced prosecuting these type of people in a region I mean why why is Doug Jones not being more vocal\nOn a or a ... in on taking on this this this whole climate right now in general I'm not saying that there's the responsibility of Soviet here but he has a a tremendous opportunity to raise the profile nationally\nHere on this issue and you can also weigh in and as I said this before he can also weigh in on the voter suppression is happening right next door or in Georgia\nWow why is he why is he trying to placate Alabama people in hopes that they're going to vote for him again in two years you know you've got to see to see you going to be up sooner or later never full term you only have the right time that it should have had that\nA Y Z try why is he trying to straddle the states here instead of a a you know showing some some some gratitude to the people that helped put him over the top to get that seat and given the fact that he has a somewhat of a record\nOr you know in terms of prosecuting ah the the bombers of uh the the sixteenth or a street Baptist term here\nRight in fact in Birmingham why is he not mix it up a little bit more in in this current climate\nWhy I think that is an excellent question Steve and I think that\nUh not only is it a appropriate for Doug Jones but all of these senators ought to be out there are more vocal or be\nProud of that that I Would raise the question then and you have ah raised ... joins me for that\nComes to mind when you were making a statement given the record number of black women had voted here Doug Jones will be campaigning over all over Georgia or for the candidate the Democratic candidates Stacey Abrams\nIn neighboring Georgia because these are all brought a state\nUh and I think that's a realistic thing and and I would say not only do it to repay black women and black man 'cause black men voted over Ninety percent as well for him I\nWould do it because it's the right thing I think we've got to start putting people in our foods that just does was right not what is politically expedient\nBecause the way to make politics we come right is by having people that don't do as expedient and that will correct this kind of playing to a certain crowd and that's what a lot of them are doing thank you for your call\nIn and and you see ... come out again today\nA jump run the migrant march there\nFor your call in and and you see ... come out again today a jump run the migrant march there thousand miles from the Mexican border it's a scare tactic is broken man then he says he's going to visit a Pittsburgh tomorrow\nDespite the fact that some of the rabbis another the vaccine that become he's going to mar because Trump knows that he has got to appeal\nTo a certain element to get his base out and they'll have some then that will welcome\nAnd do that acts and not to come they will try and marginalized theirs is a serious serious engagement were involved in just a go back to the phones let's go to Frank
