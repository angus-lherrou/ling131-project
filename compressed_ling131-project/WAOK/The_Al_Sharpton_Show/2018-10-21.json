some sitting right there like a not on a log just like in twenty sixteen they are not going back and forth with your heart going across the aisle\nJoining us now from the New Georgia project miss him say just lost it already who fought miss him say who fought joining us right now I Want to thank you so much for um for joining us and ... and part of the reason I I Want\nTo have a bipartisan conversation on this is\nMy goal is to just get black folks voting just get them out there getting them to the polls make sure that they are motivated to have access to the register and I don't really care which candidate you vote for I'm not the person who I Am not partisan for the most part but independent so\nI don't care if you vote for him I don't care if you vote for Abrams I don't care if you vote libertarian but I really do want to make sure that we get people out here in motivated to vote so what do you think the um\nThe primary thing that people need to concentrate on in order to make sure that they have the uh there were these people are motivated these people are out here at the polls these people out here ready willing and able to to get anything done on November says\nNo problem\nOr a hold on just I think we're having an issue with your Mike somebody getting nailed I'm gonna get ... to fix it so it's his hold on I'm going to go to Todd on the line and they'll come back to you once we figure out what we don't think just because it's like a radio station that anything works in here ... this is nothing is going to be some time to argue their\nHot it is okay here taught either I I mean look\n[laughter] this this is what you look this is what happens on a Sunday won't try and do something positive so friday when we were talking about the the prostitution ring at Fort valley everything worked we have no issues with nothing\n... all the calls everything was clear everything was fine so don't want to talk about get out the vote that ... and things were so let's see we got you know\nHigh yeah we go and say we got to also worry important\nThings to realize that when the show's freeze a viewer TV message from the Democrats\nOne New Georgia project is a nonpartisan organization we've registered three hundred thousand people in all one hundred and fifty nine of Georgia's counties\nAnd and that African Americans Latinos Asian Americans young white Georgians and and I think what people need to know is that while yes Georgia has a long and ...\nAmericans young white Georgians um and I think what people need to know is that while yes Georgia has a long and a recent history of voter suppression\nA that it is absolutely important that you get out and vote 'em and even the entire ballot um we have never been just about voter registration so since the beginning the idea was to set at create\nInformed confident voters or to close the ratio voter registration gap here in Georgia\nI and we're really proud of the work that we're doing and you can see it there out in the early voting numbers and the turnout and I was talking about historic rates two hundred percent over the two thousand at fourteen\nUm election so I'm really encouraged and on both sides of the aisle as he earlier point I'm so this is going to be a battle of the bases and it's going to be a turnout battle um and again despite Brian camps failures as a secretary of state and\nThe vulnerabilities in Georgia's election system uh people are still turning out an historic numbers and what really encouraged by that\nNo I won't go back to the top Thirteen editor W A L K which can be calling for for ... to ... donors miss Maria fish Maria how're you\nGuys how are you doing I'm doing great you know we were talking about these conservative ah or these black\nConservative get up the vote effort going on around the country does what you guys are working to help get more voters out a ... before the midterm elections\nWhat the blackout federation without me holding a day of action on Saturday October twenty seven throughout the country and our goal is to get out and we'll door now selling sank dying way for conservative candidate in various

are or they get connected with you guys and the things you guys are working on\nHow well they go to our website we have a website faced the ass conservative dot com and it can also send an email and so as they see as conservative dot com\nOr in into the U.S has to be interesting because I've been railing the entire show\nAbout the fact that too often the Democratic party is just trying to take the black vote for granted they just assume the black folks are going to turn out ... and they just they turn up they're going to vote democratic\nBut it's interesting to me the big push the conservatives are doing to really bring in black voters and really show that they are interested in their issues why do you think is different this year versus previous election year\nWell age because we do have and they do have an impact of that and I'm now the rhetoric on both sides of getting highly highly contagious but you also add to that he's got a lot of high level black\nConservative candidates running for office at that example we had just died this running for Congress to hang on to entertain you have less tore his running for Congress and now we have Charlotte ... lantern also running for Congress to Tennessee\nWe also have I don't want that for that and then we have Tony Campbell running for Senate hearing\nUnder do yes I was still there is also the brother running up in Michigan against stepping off a right we have\nJohn ... is also running for Senate in\n... well I just I like both parties being balding competition a breeze in all fields particularly in the electoral field so I Want to thank you so much for calling in a way to think so must be people who are working to\nGet more people register more people out to vote and I've been saying also I don't care who you vote for ... going to make sure we get more black folks involved in political process\nAs happy because what people have to realize if we are so large clothing voting bloc no matter how

I Love the competition is with others because wild New Georgia project is working on this side to get ... from developing voters to get more African American football\nYou got the buzz conservatives will just start saying we're going to be phone banking knocking on doors I liked the idea of people fighting for the but those are like the idea of both parties having the right to say well this month basis was who are voting for\nThe weather being able to say well look we're both wanted to go after the black vote in a ... we'll talk with us the right okay I I'd I'd like to see the concept an idea of competition reading that I won't vote for his death really\nCome through fight for the black vote make promises and then make from things happen but we'll be back after the break there was some talk Thirteen eighty W ...
