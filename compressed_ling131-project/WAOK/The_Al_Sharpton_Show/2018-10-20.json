well good I mean I'm just gonna throughout most of them are ... or ... during the ... or ... house we have a closet like in the middle but not quite low in the middle of the house and they said you got to open it up or just got used to that so or ...\nYeah I like an open house though I really love you know and I knew now let's lighting you can have movement you know [noise]\nRight I I Do

you that you are going to call it\nYeah I mean you sound as though I've noticed something really bad or\nWell I Know what you're going to say so I'm not looking forward to that question but go ahead\nOh oh you think I'm Still going to talk about Mr toes yes that's what my producer said\nOh no I I was thinking you ignore ... because of that potential but I I didn't\nI don't know why wasn't it during you know for two minutes how can I hear ya\n[laughter] okay anyway no this time but I hate cold really anyway um no I I don't if that's the subject I obviously missed I think I've heard that vaguely that you want mostly real estate questions and I certainly has\nA loaded with um can I ask what really wow\nOkay um this man was just\nTalking to you so you've got to check the trends in housing I years ago I was noticing that people were tearing down solidly built old brick houses all concrete block houses and that I Would just grown and then there was some little strange shallow thing and it's that\nIt's such so I mean I just what is the eyeballs and consider that maybe the city or some initial ... should require that you leave the old brick solidly built houses standing I mean is that plausible I mean what they feel they they tear down old brick houses\nAnd put these little flimsy things\n... is there any reason why that's why these wives builders will do that and is it that the cost of renovating or or or what did they call them gouging the house is just too much I think there's nothing better than a ... a solidly bills\nOld brick house or concrete built and my wall about that one of the negatives why are they deliberately demolishing these old solidly built\nBrick wall concrete block houses I I just get very upset when they can\nBut I'm going to help you not get upset anymore\nGreat thank you okay\nWell we used to think you hear [laughter] by and he hears oh you're gonna hang up you want to live no I'm a widow and here's the thing are you open to having your thinking readjusted on this\nHere's oh you're going to hang up you want to live no I'm a widow and here's the thing are you open to having your thinking readjusted on this\nI mean it's not so much rejects that I\nAlways want to be right adjusted\nIt's just it was a kid I but I just signed understand that it okay legally hopefully after I tell you this then you're going to have a different understanding so that it is\nProbably if someone said to me Mary here's a lot with an old brick house on it and we could tear it down and build a newer home or lead this old brick house on there what would you want to take care down the accounts and let me tell you why [noise] first of all you don't know if it's solidly built an because a lot of these older homes did not have\nConcrete foundation did you know that I'm\nA lot of them were built on brick foundations that are crumbling\nYeah the ones I've seen that in that category but\nYeah and and then secondly they're\n... they're called functionally obsolete a hold on one second it just right now they're calling in right now in in ... okay All right I'm Sorry I had to talk to Sean about something so\nAnd we spoke with Jane browse even always say black I'm proud we spoke with James Brown not as black brother number one but\nSoul brother number one so in that says you know when you when you speak of a health is so you know we hear that expression and if we hear that expression also coming from yourself\nAnd and it it it is and we've not flat is not flattery\nBut we're just saying stay to try to keep all help his soul and and and and and uh and I heard you talking to get a young and same as what you were saying what some of the things you heard him say in the past trouble the soul\nAnd a lot of time you do you find out that\nYou know most of the human being that is in the fall you know all about us being or going towards that direction and a lot of time most of the people troubled by the same things or most people are happy about the same thing that is you know dead which is good most a lot of people is happy about that which is ...\nAnd a lot of trouble about that which is bad\nAnd uh so does does another comment but but the gentleman that that I've got the name of the gentleman that from what was it from St\nLouis misty tell from where he is in St Louis Mr tell right\nOkay he a ... a a recall a\nDay four years ago we use the drought tracked you care and that was a gentleman that got in a car and he said man thank you for picking me up so I wouldn't even picked up now show\nBut sometime we care sometimes the way we you know might appear we might appear that we might be\nYou know ... people need to be cautious of of that person like a lot a lot of time you might want to hear that you're young you're going to be careful and a lot of times we might give them the pitch your image\nOld visual picture of what to be extremely careful\nYeah it'll ... okay [laughter] so so it seems like the lady seem as though he was you know might be from the media um where they were ... rank and media\nRight but now a deterrent backstory use in the ... media a lot of time I think Russia may metric you know a lot of times we don't get the facts do you need a doctor slaughter the making of the back story a thing\nAnd a lot of times we you know like ... years ago and slavery you know we've set ourselves to eat out there saying trial that the whole eight out\nSo they didn't have no food then they will go out more than likely not say steal but they go out and shake themselves from food to survive\nSo a lot of time out for a miracle people\nSome guys you know modern are grown up around me daddy got help and you know a lot of time they go out and actually we say steal they go out and take them steal some to survive for the next day\nAnd a lot of time to go out and search through research do you owe to go out and tricked I'm sure some of them to do and the guy he murdered the John look like one of those ... ...\nWhat Henry I'm not going on and on and on and I'm not\nListen to the you know it today at the very juncture I my soul is teetering on the edge of\nPositive and negative I'd really rather geared towards positive at this point I'm not agreeing with what you're saying I don't believe that just this guy came from work and so you know he looked like someone who could be stealing and then that's why this lady did this I I'm not going down that road I don't even\nWant to give that bought any energy we are you if you look at everybody else the way their dress they looked like garbage and we just we're not we aren't do\nWe're we're not allowed to\nMake assumptions of people by the way they're dressed or the way you know how where they're coming from or what have we can't make those assumptions and then act upon them you can make it sound lives guess what you can't act upon\nOkay where there's there's maybe those martyrs as well to grow recalls\nA you know like you dirty chooses the Joe ... show no I'm I'm not drawn to bring myself to build a drop in church or a ... to make a decision about pushing on us to shove you call the police\nNo no I'm sharing

of us we are Persian and to be for the farms are fought\nAll right we're really talking about a lady who denied this man access to his own house because she made the assumption that he did not belong there that should be against the law\nYet and she does not have the right to be able to make those assumptions and deny someone access to the house just because of you know what we may think about or he might be dress like something or whatever no\nDon't get to do that let me tell you will eat them and give you a real quick story Henry and why we have to work real real hard against that type of thinking I was in Savannah and I needed directions I was in a really not affluent\nArea with a bunch a bunch of guys black guy\nHanging around a car and I said hold on his I'm going to ask these guys which way to get on the highway and they're like no mom don't don't don't ah we we don't don't ask them were scared I said I I'm going to ask them so I rode the window down I said hey guys can you

highway\nIt's like we cannot make assumptions of people by the way they can go to the weight society has told us to make ends about\nWhy the wrong number jumped you jump on where you were ... they

C. use is a little girl in January two thousand Eighteen got accepted into Fort Valley State a young lady from Greenville in she\nWas looking for me so I could take a picture with her with the flag or from Fort Valley State or looked like they give them when they get accepted\nUm I just hope it won't stop all the great work or threatened all the great work that they're doing with students who couldn't many of whom could not otherwise do the college\nA will for ballot did in South Carolina was to spend their out of state tuition so that students who oh could not afford to pay now in state tuition would be able to go at the same rate the Georgia resident would that's extraordinary\nAnd it means there's a real commitment as a real dollars per hand are getting these young people to college and that sport that with state that's what I Know\nWhat I don't know is about these allegations\nI Hope they're not true but you know we have to wait and see so that's my speech\nYeah that's a tough story yes a real tough story and I hate it for ... a\nIt's a tough story for them their national a president has um you know\nRequested the investigation they conduct an investigation as far back as April of this year April and May of two thousand Eighteen I don't know what the outcome was I don't know what their findings were but it's just bad for 'em\nFor our culture's bad ...
