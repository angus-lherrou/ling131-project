I've always push business and economic development is that even when we were sharecroppers back in Louisiana I could hear my father sent a guy who got to work out what else is on\nAnd and in doing that we had a sense of pride we took that pride I took it pride my brothers um all got athletic scholarships my sister's got academic scholarship so my dad didn't have to write out any checks but he would have and we wouldn't have gone on any place for free\nBut my my position is that economic development usually comes with conservatism and by that I mean um it's it's not magic I mean everybody I grew up with what conservative black and white they went to church on Sundays they wish that the lord\nThey worked hard summer which had two and three jobs a they're a little divorce um in in brown edition and in Monroe, Louisiana I think there were five families we call the father and his five\nIt was that rare so economic development comes with a from within you want to build something you want to provide an environment of respect a retirement of authority which your children in your home so when they go out into the world than they were how that respect for a\nOf respect a retirement of authority which your children in your home so when they go out into the world than they were how that respect for age and authority Mm So taken away the social programs if not needed that is a good thing\nSocial programs are meant for folks that need it and everybody at some point in your hand up\nBut no one should always ... except the hand out and that's just the way you look at the world I I think\nPart of it also goes into the were from the urban rural split earlier that in early urban environments it's harder\nTo kind of Ford's your own destiny because there isn't land around there isn't property that you can just simply work and often the cities have so many regulations in place the only people who can deal with them are folks who already have money ... kind of talk about the need to break down regulations to help people will be able to\nAh to start their own entrepreneurship\nLet me give you an idea of what I Would do as the next Congress men from the fourth congressional district\nOne of the first things I Would do would come and talk to the base about coming in making loans available in in in some of these communities because they're not made any I'm Alone is available in black neighborhoods for for entrepreneur\nAnd for small business people the second thing I Would do is talk to the insurance companies and\nTalk to the homeowners' associations that talked to a each community about lowering the crime rate\nWe lower the crime rate the insurance companies will lower their race the companies will come in and we're going to train our kids to be prepared for those jobs when they come so I Want to make a friendly environment for business and I also want to talk to parents and I'm a parent you know I got seven kids\nAnd a busy well I got stuff for natural kids and three adopt orders or I Would have done sleep [laughter] I Would adopt more of a good [laughter] but the thing that I I Try to promote an everybody's kid is that I Want to\nA better environment for your kid then you had and that's what I Would like to see so as a result of that I Want to be able to really work for the people when I go to Washington\nOr getting getting directly into a to a couple of things on this economic development side one thing is that owned the problems we have is urban for urban blight and are in our communities boarded up empty buildings completely fine buildings but people in the ... community can't afford don't have the capitalization requirements needed in order to satisfy you know as the a ... a the\nLoan or a small business loan or even often you have these absentee landowners who still have these ridiculously high rent on them they don't believe in the state you know as a corporate entity um you know in New York somewhere who owns the property you can't afford the rent it out what can we do to uh to\nHelp people the rate on the regulations break down some of these corporate monopolies on property and get the hands of the people who can actually get these businesses into the hands of people can actually do something with them\nWell first of all what I Would I Would do is uh that in that regard to to help\nDevelop local communities ... and the buildings that are boarded up the first thing I Would do with talk to those land laws about re investing in those communities in our communities because in the president's tax bill that's a provision reinvestment act so if they reinvest\nIn certain communities they'll get a tax or breaking a credit I Want to be able to ask sit down with those companies\nAnd a local community leaders about how can we are form a relationship that will eliminate the fear of companies coming in the fear of crime\nArt form a relationship that will eliminate the fear of companies coming in the fear of crime but people living in our communities\nOnce we get together and start discussing those items and things start to happen because everything in this world is is is uh I'm sending around money mhm the people that have those buildings in other states got 'em border up they don't want that because no no income coming in\nSo I Would show them how to turn those into incoming a properties and then I Will show the people that live in our community is how they can start running these businesses themselves and not have all the folks coming in from other countries to run these uh facilities in the neighborhoods in which we live\nOur rent on time what do you think it's important to have a business person as an elected official as opposed to a a career elect or career will probably ambition career politicians\nWere first of all the system was not designed for career politicians it was designed for business people to start a business run that business make payroll get a feel of what it takes to run a business\nWhen we see these big hurricanes we get a little taste\nOf what their grandparents' experience in the great depression or great grandparents experiencing a great question which was the breakdown of our systems so suddenly\nThey were they had to take personal responsibility for caring for their families\nAnd when we experience some of these big hurricanes Harvey er Florence um or now Michael I'm In little pockets of the country we wake up and realized oh my gosh I you know at the end of the day I Am responsible for my own families um safety and for\nOur food and to have something to clean to drink that won't make us sick and that are inevitably leads to I'm a huge shock\nAnd the store shelves renting empty and people panicking because the idea of taking personal responsibility has become kind of alien to us now\nYou know it's interesting because every time there's a any event in Atlanta you know we we will be closed down the city over the threat of snow like one and we'll sit down and everything but I see people run into the store and they buy eggs milk she and bread\nAnd in my mind I'm like why are you buying perishable items when you refrigeration might go out in a couple of hours what what do people stock up on just for the most basic bug out hit most basic being able to take care of yourself in case of emergency\n[noise] well if if if there's a a a strong chance that you'll have to leave you you should be thinking about weight and the the the lightest food you can get his course freeze dried but these rights also really expensive\nEven if what you had was um a fact stock of processed foods um liked canned goods they they last for a long time I'm a ... as basics like\nA dry run and um and and then water water is really the biggest problem we require\nEven without doing washer bathing we required about one gallon of water polo family member per day\nAnd if you start running the math on that let's say a hurricane is getting hit you got a family of four you're going to be gone for eight days you're going to be living um you're going to be living at the back of your car maybe because of the massive exodus from that area\nAnd you're if you figure eight days at a gallon says that thirty two gallons that's um you're working on a fifty five gallon drum with water just to survive that period of time in fifty five gallon drum is way bigger even put in your car\nYour if you start by flats of water it takes a lot a lot more flat water discovered down on one gallon for family members per day some really job number one isn't food even though it's going to become important job no one has actually water clean water\nAnd and so forth since you're saying we can't care if it's about fifty five gallon rumble water around we can't I'm necessarily a hope to find clean water supplies water people's will to do to purify water they might find er during emergency situation\nUm well there's certainly believe would definitely start out\nWith bottles of water so if you have five gallon bought a five gallon jugs or even one gallon jugs from your old milk that you've cleaned really carefully and filled with water and maybe put a tiny amount of chlorine are costs\nThen one gallon jugs from your old milk that you've cleaned really carefully and filled with water and maybe put a tiny amount of chlorine or Clorox I'm In it\nSo that it it it so that it remains to replace it every year then you've got water you can actually loaded into the back of your car sort of level one is you start with actually clean water and then you can buy\nFlats of bottled water but that's just a really expensive way to go I'm so just having a having that amount of water in\nIn containers that you can laugh so probably maximum of five gallons that's where you began so you'd say maybe have a week's worth to two weeks' worth\nUm that you can put in your car and drive away with\nNext step with them to be carrying a water purification and you can have a fancy solution which would be a um water purifier on such as the ... plus water purifier\nAnd a few like camping you'd probably want to own one anyway um that you could take virtually any water alongside the road runner treat apply to us and end up with clean water but you don't even have to spend\n\nI think we broke up for a for a second uh on that one will see we can get Jason back on the on the line um so what about things important that we talk about these issues of prepping and of\nUm making sure that we are ready in case of emergency because as Jason was saying before uh before the call broke up\nIt's very difficult for us to just as bad for all these things to be in place and all these things to be available to us than we got Jason backed Jason you still there yeah All right All right before you were talking about the importance of water a before we we run out of time water just kind of a checklist of things people need to have in their house\nI'm just in case the storms come in they don't have the chance to uh to escape or to get away with other things have you know you're going to be going through or for a long power outage for a long a lack of access to basic necessities\nWell I'm and we're very reliant on electricity um so to just basically charge your cell phone which is where you get most of your\nUm information and as well be you're able to coordinate with family so some form of an ability to either charge your cell phone for a week\nUm either with a battery or with a solar panels so called zero makes us a solar panel that you can put it outside of that going to help your whole lot of rain struggled fix forever to charge your phone\nBut some sort of a battery backup that you can charge your cell phone you have to assume that you're going to probably lose any of the goods as you were mentioning before your your refrigerator that you're going to have to eat those right away or you know there's some um\nBut bottom line I Would say power is important electrical power out east at very least keep your cellphone charged\nAlso flashlights um they're the obvious\nUm and then the next step I start looking at your ability to cook your food so um some sort of a small cooking appliance like a jet boil stove\nSo you can heat up water boil water if you want to clarify by boiling and you know make a comment or to reconstitute dry food\nAll right well I'm so before we go cells really quick about black autumn in how people can get in contact with you and find out more about your your writings and defining publishing\nGreat will blackout and it's just a it's a fiction books you get to experience what would life be like if we've lost um you can uh if we lost these systems and what\nI think about the beauty of fiction as you get to\nWe've lost um you can if we lost these systems and what should I\nThink about the beauty of such as you get a little bit um while you're reading and and again I really bottom line understanding of this is what my family would require and it's black autumn you can pick it up at um a an Amazon or go to black autumn dot com\nOr write things as well Jason Roth Rome let all the dot com but who's calling Jason thank you so much heart will be back after the break Newman Polk Thirteen eighty W.

I wanted you to tell us about how you guys got into making the Youtube videos and also where people can find them out find them at the in case they have kids that they want to learn what the hell is one of their own age group talk to them\nWell if you want to make you laugh find more um about their survival sisters you can go on Facebook and look up the survival singers and we have like a whole bunch of videos um\nYeah we have our first video and a video that me recently that that we recently a city like yesterday mhm\nAnd um so having guy in the u._k. and things like um so it was actually like my dad's idea\nAh me me that he went into getting this\nThing on Facebook because I'm making any ... like um\nWe want to start a YouTube channel and then that and then dad had this idea that we could start it you can count on survivor since the things we do with him are like nice seeing and survive ... about hunting and survivor\nLike most people do hum\nCan do with him are like nice seeing and survive ... about hunting and survivor\nLike most people do um ... most people knew like flying videos and stuff and like ... we knew um I have not and people do not Gail I'm reading survival and keeps people about survival\nAnd stuff like that so again you can find it on Facebook I'm In the guys\nUp on survivor or is or the Kennedy\nSomething that's always been finding theory is that we would always have these great stories to tell and we would always go to the park and will be ... climb trees and go on the monkey bars and we would all have these funny story to tell like\nLike oh we went to beaver dance and stuff like that and and then like we would go to the park and we'd be able to do the monkey bars instantly and the and the boys will still be trying to make it so funny to me because\nPeople doubt girl sometime in the end like we can actually be really strong\nSenator you give them a little older now to the boys who come in an approach you do you explain to them to train them that you have into not at the [noise]\nUm so the training I had um I just want to let you know if you guys do something that I might not all light or something that might trigger me or my dad I just want you to know that I have had\nThat experience cells coming for you okay okay\n[laughter] oh this is what are the [laughter] so for for there to those who may want to learn about these things or do you guys offer any training for adults maybe their food in a home right now I'm thinking oh will be to be able to protect myself to do for myself how can they learn those things from you were\nWell we we do um I don't I don't I don't try and right now but\nThe um ... we have we have people that we associate with their ... their on Facebook you reach out to him an email and they may do a lot they do a lot of planning to do a lot of fighting and you can you can email and you can just put more going on you know ... ... s a F o ...\nAnd ... and like I said you know they do they do a good job of training you can go in there and they have they have a lot of videos we've been doing a lot of videos of them\nFor a long time but my kid wants to separate and apart for them um you know for for us for for for me what I Want to do with this ah survives the video is\nYou know like I say that's prepping prepping is about is not just about hoarding beans and ... and stuff like that is also about in Indian in everyday life so we use the mouse has been turned into a ... on the news business to help them go ahead and nobody knows those\nGet all those things out learn learn how to navigate learn how to accept being learn how to to the status cash flows in St Louis so that way why the younger like sitting head of spears and so when they get to school\nAll right thank you so much getting an end to the point of the entire economy conversation is don't let the media dictate how you view people\nIf you simply say that while the media told me they're crazy so they must be crazy the media also told you the Burger King was good to eat every day\nAlso tells you to pop up fried chicken as part of part of the food pyramid you got to understand they're not going to promote to use the things that are good for you want to demonize that which is good and promote that which is bad\nEvery movie that you see is it about a healthy healthy happy black family relationship\nGoing once they get they make movies out over the world with drama the one to hidden secret store one where you know there's a a big lie or a cover up of someone's getting beaten or something along those lines they're not going to push him promote to do things that are positive for you so much so that we have folks me I'm looking in the the Facebook group now\nAnd people say look at Robert telling black folks they issue again\nWhen all is said was we have a cultural narrative that makes Carlton a nerd on the first part to Belair\nWhich what does that come into ... ever do wrong in the entire run of the show for him to be either the butt of jokes are to be a some kind some way demonized Hillary she's supposed to be rich airhead she's being punished and demonize for being rich\nBut somehow coming from the streets of Philly makes you more real more authentic than somebody who grew up in Beverly Hills are Belair will so to say going back to the fall and we have duly online to do\nAuthentic than somebody who grew up in Beverly Hills or Belair will so to say going back to the phone lines we have duly on line to delete\n[noise] how to [noise] um well how are you\nAre right you know are are they happening very important in this week was that that Saudi guy went to the Turkish embassy and never came out and saying hey\nThat plane came out a that so many people had him and they seem to me I\nTraded back a generous for the richer and the reason why I wanted to get the picture for granted that evangelical\nAnd uh another thing happened was a man who shot at the uh young I think Thirteen fourteen year old kid ... fire they found him guilty and they found the police guilty of ah what sort of climate down\nYou know the ... and for once we actually got a second degree murder convict a conviction on one of these shootings which is absolutely progress compared to what we usually get which is either not guilty or never even charged\nBut to me it's kinda scary because it seems like
