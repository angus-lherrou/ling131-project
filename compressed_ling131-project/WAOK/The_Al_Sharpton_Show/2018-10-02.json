ago and you play this tape or the queen of soul Saturday Night and you own your district Burke they're kind of cuts you off guard\n... record that man I I've been playing that over and over ... that that they are a threat because\nWomen are alive so well I\nMet up put check this out chip in the okay I just two guys that Brett Kavanaugh should account so we're\nAll mixed up what a what a way the first person who should have thought through with President Bush Rocco bubble you remember back in two thousand they were up ... with Mr Obama first announced he will do run for president\nOne of the very first things he did\nWas say when he was a young man some of the things that he did it because he knew that because he knew what they would go dig and they will go find out he doesn't do stay so he was a guy that act the way that ... when he was a young man ... second then you should have thought there was a judge to say\nAll his show every day he'd say life was well by that too and he told he\nTalked about the stuff that he did on the streets of Michigan what he wrote what the president but he promised to bomb he was going to change his wife all all hooked up\nThat you went to school now he he was the best judge it she still come over to the U.S grid metals dancer up wind so my point is if Kavanaugh would it just said\nWhat what Mr Obama in a judge Mathis did when I was a young man I made some terrible mistakes but that's not the person\nI Am that day all of this would be oh hey rather now have a happy birthday\nTo date you have on your car and I'm sure to many things you for saying beautiful\nWhite man that I had an ...\nHe said the beautiful beautiful Tiffany and by the way oh man happy birthday to you know when I got that but do you call again but anyway uh I think he raises a point I was alluding\nTo that I think that what Bob ... many and we'll see if it bothers enough in the Senate is misleading because uh I and I got into this discussion yesterday in Dallas with some people\nIt is not just one he may or may not have done it was a salt that's criminal\nBut it was fine if you did something you've said that\nHow can we jump trust your judgment\nOn the Supreme Court if you are now misleading people then you will continue to I mean all of us may have done things that we are certainly all of us have done things that we as we got older I Would not want to ah ah ah said we\nWill correct do would would do differently if we could redo it\nBut I Am glad you are is pure Boy Scout and then we hear all these allegations from different songs at different times in your youth then you gotta wonder why are you covering this up and are you still covering things up\n[laughter] that's what it shows that they can he be trusted I think we have enough evidence now I Know that he at at minimum misrepresented his hat\nI think that's what his testimony showed that again he'd be trusted I think we have enough evidence now to know that he at at minimum misrepresented\nOr his past and that's been cooperative by numerous people who went to high school and college with him uh we've learned more about some of these circles and cliques that he was a part of\nUm that I'm too embarrassed to talk about in front of Reverend Sharpton so I won't even get into it but they were highly sexual in nature for 'em and so it has its personality we we thought was very a duplicitous\nWe honestly wherever we can take away um the sexual assault let's just some tax that for a minute we can just look at his positions on race issue I mean that's enough to to to raise questions have\nBeen a unapologetically against affirmative action he's made racist jokes um involving Asian uh uh uh women um that we're both racist and sexist and derogatory or on he put his partisanship on display when he accused sitting senators of\nUm being upset that that Donald Trump one and twenty sixteen and and really only raising all these issues out as a part of their events for the Clintons all of those things are red flag so you add on top of that\nAnd and in addition on world those sooner rather than can be prosecuted for yeah and and I mean I suppose ... before the disease you which has been lost and a lot of this summit is you just raised ... headed not believe that ...\nThat many of us would have went along were given a million votes were adamantly opposed them based on his judicial record and his racial ball\nRight and then that that was my point why not with all of these challenges around this nominee why not get somebody else that you you raise the rent is because he is the only person on that list from the federal society of twenty five judges who said if they didn't president cannot be indicted I just want to let the viewers now\nThat there are multiple um ethics complaints filed against him right now in the DC circuit and read the you know who's going to review those ethics complaint none other than Merrick Garland the shined\nJustice Supreme Court justice nominee that President Obama put forward\nA in two thousand ... who could not get or two thousand Fifteen who could not even get a meeting or hearing or anything with any of that senator and so now that you have all these people who've made ethics complaint\nWell this is the court that Merrick Garland happens to sit on and so he will be the person is fighting the legitimacy of these ethics complaint against a a Brett Kavanaugh\nNowhere to me you know ...\nYou mean oh the ... the ... ... ... ... ... even a hearing even meet the right if you could mean that Mitch McConnell who just that a week long enough to look at things\nYou could mean he was part of the two months ... gone gone and you\nCould you he was and the ads wise Senator Lindsey Graham who has been outrage that what he called the most ridiculous\nThe costs sham and those words that both of these being a member of the Senate folk have come back\nTo eat them when people play the sound bites over and over again when Senator Lindsey Graham said if if Democrats want to pick judges you ought to win some election for the problem was Democrats did win elections they did pick judges and Merrick Garland cannot even get a hearing so karma is that it it's something else rabbits\nThough we're we're seeing them lay out we were just so in church with understood blooms [laughter] mark ... says mark\nStood

S. N. B. C. I'm joined as I Am every Tuesday by the senior pastor of the first currency Corinthian Baptist church in Harlem and member of the national board of national action network\nA Reverend Michael Wall Ron how're you doing rather than [noise] pretty good wherever they're\nEverything's good let me get your view on a ... a ... a process when the second or third day of the week\nOr that remain the cut off date of this investigation and some of the callers as well as my self has said\nThat this is more about character and transparency because I've had Kevin or come in and I'm sure you've had this experience or the many parishioners you past\nHave Kevin are coming in and said that I may have drank too much or said or done some inappropriate things not assault which is criminal\nBut done some things in my youth but I've grown mature for the way that in my as a youthful discretion\nHe would have been judged a lot differently than he is in complete denial and ask a question of honesty and his transparency to sit on the bench\nAbsolutely whether or not he has no judicial temperament um because what we saw on display last week\nUm did not should not have met anyone feel comfortable whether the public and all Democrats to think that a person does temperament could be so rattled and there's a person is going to get an appointment for life and the Supreme Court that could not make you feel good they made me feel good at all\nIt'd be so rattled and this person is going to get an appointment for life and the Supreme Court that could not make you feel good they make me feel good at all on some moments he looked like a ... it seems very adolescent\nAnd other moments his arrogance was in full display on never moments you saw a unbelievable manifestation of white male privilege I mean it was amazing\nAnd and now as you said ... I think there's going to be a question not just the cost of character I'm connected the character honesty truthfulness because if it becomes warmer revealed that he lied under oath about certain things\nOn the he categorically denied it wasn't I don't remember it was like he just categorically denied Ryan mostly everything\nThink it's going to be hard and I think the way it is going to happen\nMaybe every day you're going to see one or two revelations come out between now and friday that's going to call and the question again his integrity um and it's going to be difficult for people to support him\nAnd in it that happens it puts you know the Republicans a bad position because they don't get the votes\nNow they have to wait at the MIT parents when they put somebody for which that's a fear the point of getting cabinet didn't wasn't that just that he was a conservative and clearly a partisan judge but it was that if he doesn't get through they have to wait till the midterms in his right building that they won't have the numbers\nYou know if if if you get a ... a changing or so to speak in terms of Democrats or Republicans so this is very interesting time but I think this is what they didn't want this time of a further investigation for more to come out\nYeah and and two points on that one I think it is very important what you said that about here's a partisan Leming because many of us including myself was opposed the Kevin I'll be forty accusations based on his imbalance to be a judge\nBut secondly you know are you run for office I run for office you do what it's called opposition research and opposition strategy if I were strategizing on their side I Would have said that I had I Would advise\nOr I Would have advised that yes I might have had some you've indiscretions which makes me more sensitive than a turban and the lord of the people they're not as he could have made that a positive but when you try to act purer than Caesar's wife I think is the term\nUh and and as you said\nAnd like you remember every day and all of that and that could have been I think he painted himself into a corner now whether or not they vote for him or not is going to be another question\n[noise] yeah I mean that's the issue is like you said before this came up part of the reason why he was so attractive to the right\nAnd many conservatives was because of his clearly partisan decision that was on full display last week by saying that this was a left wing conspiracy is a hit job by the Clintons\nYou can't here's someone make those statements and didn't think it is coming to balance in their decisions on the Supreme Court I there's no way you can think that right oh I I I I just think it was it was ... to say that you can ... even as much as this rare\nWhen he pulled out the calendar with at that point I don't know I'm more of the Democrats in jail but they're not as pounce on that because there are many things that are not going to be on that character I don't know on the calendar I don't know anyone who's going to put them to count the Oh yes on this day I sexual assault with a woman like I'll put that on the calendar\nSo ... when he pulls up a counter to verify his action in the show is access that within real I mean it it was just an amazing display of arrogance\nThere of his actions and the show is access that within real I mean it it was just an amazing display of arrogance I pay I don't like you said we've run for office and when you run for office you have people on your team you have to solve this who helped talk you through things whether bait press the parents is\nClearly I don't know if anyone thought that this man before he came back um because they clearly either gave him a horrific\nUm advice or he just did what he wanted to do because that was not to display you needed to be on the Supreme Court I don't know of any ... any one of anyone help them that was not a display that could help anyone feel comfortable by putting this man on the Supreme Court\nAnd and as you said the temperament\nThe president came out today saying the man is fighting for his reputation\nAnd family which is understandable under normal circumstances but you are trying to assume was so ... feet on the Supreme Court so people have the right to expect you to be able to handle that in a much more mature\nAnd balanced way we're not talking about somebody that's just out there are in a normal way of earning a living and I think that when you're trying to act like well anyone would defend themselves and be a angry\nBut anyone not talking about sitting on the Supreme Court making light time decisions or decisions that will last for decades if not generations\nLook anyone on the Supreme Court who displays evidence\nAnd demonstrate that they can become emotionally on him and cannot be on the Supreme Court right I mean I mean they was ... he was clearly unwrap all\nOthers to you based on you're listening

little sluggish just nuts\nI'll shirt and our news and talk Thirteen eighty W. A. okay\nFor the hope you have many more birthdays I have a couple of things I wanted to say\nI wanted to say that um first of all I think that the FBI should include in their questioning to um\nTo um ... what he meant by what goes around comes around when he was having his way I Am talking about the Clintons and all of that kind of stuff none of the senators questioned him on what does he mean by what goes around comes around because it showed that he has\nA very vindictive spirit in my opinion but I didn't I I I didn't understand what that meant it do you know what that meant\nWhen an idea I Know I Do ...\nDo you do you remember him saying that yeah uh-huh\nAnd our memory you referred to the current situation as as this was part revenge for the ... because he was on the Clinton investigation\nRight and what goes around comes around basically like I'm a ... or something like that that that's how I took that\nBut you know I just didn't I didn't understand like what does that mean and he should have some of the Senate Senator should've asked him what did he mean by that statement he also perjured himself when he said that moved me Mitt flatulence\nWhen it actually means in assertion anal insertion of alcohol and drugs\nThat's what both to me that he wrote in his ear book though he wasn't very truthful on that when he just said it means ... for me it was a very defiant when he was um explaining what you know to the Senate or that asked him what does that mean you know\nBurned and why don't you know go ahead Jim\nOh no oh in the last thing I wanted to say is that I was watching TV and I saw him along the ...\nYeah I'm over in Africa and\nShe would happier than a mouse in ah how ...\nI mean she is just picking up the children I mean she was very different when she's a wave from you know her husband and Washington I could see it it just it just come through and you could just see it she just she just seems so much happier you know\nHe or she later and gun are going to several countries are in our area that and thank you for your call Tommy di ended at ... is that she's gone they're gone dressed in him call him and some of those same nations and soul of countries\nAnd uh you know you always hear the stories is she doing things to defy him or help you know and uh it it is interesting but to the point of uh of Kavanaugh there we are questioning him on what he meant\nHow big gambling raises an interesting question that I'm not clear on I'm not clear if the FBI is going to interview Kavanaugh\nBecause I think that would be very interesting because you can commit a crime lying to the FBI\nYeah that's that's something we then has been on my mind as well you know whether it is point of clarification or ask him questions seeking for him to either a farmer contests statements made by by the blues before that\nI think that would be very interesting again we don't fully know the scope of ... so we we're not sure but that will be very interesting and not just to add a scam what he meant the deeper question is will that avail ... yeah I mean so it again if you have someone who the nominee\nMan the deeper question is was that a veiled threat yeah I mean so it again if you have someone who the nominee for Supreme Court\nMaking a veiled threat to what he deems a conspiracy those who are um conspiratorial that that is I mean again temperament integrity those issues\nYou know and it's interesting I disagree a word or Justice Clarence Thomas on just about all of his votes or that he's done and uh I had a meeting with him once and it was probably the worst experiences in my life\nBut Clarence Thomas did not get as out of control under the Anita Hill hearing is this guy you\nKnow and if Clarence Thomas with us and then come out of that out of control he might have been removed the chamber's I kid you not I I really you can't convince me and you know I Know we have a tendency in conversations around the country racialized certain issues but you can't convince me no matter whether he'd be a nominate not that\nAn African American male could have become so in ... an explosive and challenging and that wouldn't have been his downfall\nNow if you had an African American males and and they just say we racialized at all they want if you had an African American mayor even want to do the far right as Clarence Thomas said to send her a glove which ah did you ever blackout drink and that would have been you\nKnow there that'll be the rat rather than a rat you know\nAnd and and and the issues with the band temperament character he's angry black man yeah I don't fit\nEven unfit he's indignant ... it would have been a a an a cascade of as you describe him and justify why he shouldn't be in the Supreme Court but as if we accept this kind of behavior and again it is it is it is not as you hear about\nYou know the north of the nation as a white privilege is also a white male privilege which you see on display as well um so ... it's just a ... and ... and here's the real kick a rare\nYou know to listen on Fox News and to hear the president make statements like this\nI I laugh but it was also sad and I don't know what\nYour reaction was these statements are\nNow you know our democracy is going down hill country is going down because ... how is it now that you're guilty until proven innocent I said man that has been the reality of regular country\nThe time we came here we all ... and now they're offended but I did it you have to you're guilty before the end it's in this country but that's the way out and we know\nWhere you quoting Donald Trump the president exactly and that wouldn't be the same Donald Trump called for the deaf remembered him X. two and a half five young men did he had a little guilty that ended up not being guilty of a rate and attack them for ... ... absolutely\nAnd to say and have the same needle you know that there's a segment of our population\nWhose oblivious the realities of urban America and the interaction of urban America with police authorities when you have state that come from him that says well if they were innocent why did they can affect what that means you're oblivious to the history of policing in America\nAnd the corps you know confession especially among young minority chip so that that I mean you're just living for that\nAnd and and the DNA clear them

ran on may be able to understand that um [noise] I honestly think one of the critical people that most of the interview is mark judge I think he's the one of the keys to this\nAnd you know to as a judge in terms of Kavanaugh will say well he sent a letter assign half a David he knows that's not enough in a in a in a situation this critical that it is worth an interview as you said a two FBI agents to lie and to be found out the lives of cry\nSo I I think if if they're serious about investigation\nCourse I Would interview just Kavanaugh to the challenge some of the things that maybe Dr Ford said even reimburse you talked about before but definitely more just because he's the other person named in the rural yeah so I I I think his interview to me becomes one of the critical of moments of this investigation if it happened\nLet's go to Greenland derby ER you my friend judge daisy judge daisy\nAnd thank you so much for everything that you do\nAnd uh someone called in earlier to ask about the phone number for calling the senators and congressmen right uh you you can reach all of the United states senators and all of the United states' congressional persons\nAd and I'm I'll I'll read this number twice a and I use that often so I Know that it works it's too old to two to four three one two one\nYou know that's the number are you you're right yeah so everybody please write that down again it's\nTwo zero two two to four three one two one\nIf the operator answers you just tell them the name of the either the senator or the congressional person you want to speak to\nIf

and of course a if you put in the ... code or that of course it will guide to to the\nCenter to us for that particular state\nSo again that's two zero two\nTwo to four three one two one and I asked everyone please please please call both the senators for your state\nAnd tell them how you want them to vote on the confirmation for a judge Brett Kavanaugh even if you think your senator is not going to vote the way that you want to\nYou need to let them know what you want them to do you do not want them to be able to\nTo you need to let them know what you want them to do you do not want them to be able to say that no one told them to vote against the confirmation of judge Brett Kavanaugh\nI Am a retired federal administrative law judge that that's why I refer to myself as judge daisy I have had experience\nAnd assessing the credibility of witnesses based upon what I have seen I've watched a part of judges a judge Kavanaugh's\nAh the the hearing after a judge or excuse me after Dr Ford testify and I had seen him earlier based upon his demeanor\nAnd the information that I have heard on the television\nI are determined and my own mind that he has absolutely no credibility\nHe himself has indicated inconsistencies and what he is said and most telling leave when Senator Leahy was costing him about uh what had happened when he had gotten those emails some years ago\nAnd a judge or I

reasons why I started doing this show twelve years ago things to cap you use an out for Libyans\nIs we had we been inundated\nBy right wing talk radio Sean Hannity does television and radio lump all around\nAnd we had no quote brand name that would do black grits\nAnd name that will do black radio and from a news perspective and then of course gather you offered me to do it and I've done it twelve years and then\nCarrying hundreds came in and and um started urban started to escalate the urban listen to ship was serious but you can't organize anything if you cannot get your message out\nSo uh would that is why I'm literally on radio seven days a week and on television\nOr with my TV show on Sundays and about to go back more days because you need a balance in the public marketplace or like even our Saturday rallies of acts gnashing their where we may have two hundred people there\nBut you talk in the tens of thousands that listen on Sunday a Saturday morning we got to be able to talk to\nThe uh the public to even get a balanced public discussion and they drowned us out\nAnd of the few of us they can need to really fight back and I think that when you look at everything from the bread the movement to the Tea Party all the way to the election of Trump revving a wall wrong\nIt was because they maintain some serious public uh of forums in a big microphone from Fox News\nTo the right wing talk radio\nAnd for those forms they were able to shape narratives determined narratives and control narratives and which you realize wherever we know this is that many people\nUm when it comes to politics don't do the kind of investigative work\nTo get any in information whether it is about ... or the issues and so what many people on the radio the most is what people tend to believe and when\nConservative talk show host dominate the radio waves and those who on the liberal side democratic a side on not hurt as much then people will be here is truth in fact right to challenge so shows like this and others that talk about\nIssues that impact urban America and also just think the issues differently to get information out there becomes extremely critical now it's one thing for people to get information but then with that information we must be intentional about how we respond to the information that act on the information\nBecause just as we we says brother said that we are appreciative outreach therefore radio shows like this and after you've given me to be on the show but at the same time I've seen where the F ... information out there channel is people that we think some of these things and people didn't act on it so\nSo that's the other issue that when we put information out there instead of make when you hear people say oh well wherever our race baiting a race ... these are issues that are out there and let's say it again ... the one issue I think and we bring it up until twenty twenty\nThe one issue we try to make clear\nAnd plenty Fifteen and twenty sixteen was that the president the next president would have the opportunity possibly to a point to for Supreme Court justices right that this election is it was about the Supreme Court\nNot about who you like or didn't like oh well there's no difference between Republican and Democrat they may not be in terms of uh whether you make it a class issue or a political issue but when you talk about who their point to the bench there\nIs a big difference between Republican appointees and democratic appointees\nShot at it and and and brought it up throughout the election and people did not hear it\nAppointees and democratic appointees no doubt about it and and and brought it up\nThroughout the election and people did not hear it\nAnd you know got to keep bringing it up best why you phrase map and and let me say this would ever happens we're having a Trump is going to put a very conservative person on the bench and we're going to have to deal with the outcome of that for a long time\nLet's go to be a gallon North Carolina derby a U G big el\nValle do show up there about the door I'm doing well that's good that's good birthday I'm I'm from a lot when I was watching it\nBut it don't make that choice for all the Access Hollywood Bush he kept saying what he like I like this I like this were to do\nAnd why would it was kind of kept saying I like beer I Would just wonder if they want games similar Bogle Booker and say okay well I Would say I like the old saying\nThat as well you know I mean you know she was looking at what you call it gosh although although there's something about what what I'm saying if you will get all the time he doesn't say I would like Louis are so blessed in that\nSame thing you see I think we're ever going wall Ron a framed is right the question is do we want to maintain\nThe a criminal justice laws that we had began turning around in terms of three strikes you're out in terms of is the constitution\nA labor rights or the whole question of Affordable Care act voting rights that's what you're dealing with Kevin I think that one of the fallacy of American culture probably western civilization\nIs we're personality based\nMy opposition the Kavanaugh was not cabin not a person is that he represents and is being put there\nTo reverse everything from Thurgood Marshall coming forward you got to deal with the intent and I think that was your point grabbing wall run during the sixteen election it was not allowed to Hillary it was about our interests\nThat absolutely it was an interest in the future this country and we saw what was done to roll back some accomplishments that achievements before Kavanaugh when you get a heavy leaning conservative bent a court\nThis is what's gonna happen it's not going to get better and I don't care how many rallies how many protests it's not going to get by on that level if you have such a heavily favored conservative court\nAnd and let's say as you said whether it's Kavanaugh who else that is is nominated if he doesn't get it is going to be a conservative and and I said it's a two thousand sixteen the day after the ... the Sunday after the elections I said we need to stop praying\nFor some of the more liberal leaning justice is right now that they can last year for years I'm forty eight years because that look five for there's a possibility because of
