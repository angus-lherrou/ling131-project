life [noise]\nThe only good life I've ever known\nAlcoholics Anonymous\nCheck your phone book newspaper or a dot org\nWe're keeping it real with Al Sharpton or news and talk Thirteen eighty W. A. O. casually twenty\nTwenty elections and the candidates who could uh really bring the fight to the Republicans\nAnd uh I uh as as saying the messenger should come from the message but there's been a poll recently released that says that the top\nA prospective none of these every mouse perspective a democratic candidate would be Joe Biden I think he came in at mhm thirty three percent then next in line at a nine\nPercent was Bernie Sanders than eight percent was Camelot Harris\nOf California then right behind that assemble sensors really of the three of tag is Elizabeth Warren in five percent Cory Booker and then that the uh and I really was a\nA missing somebody a but it is interesting that they had Julian Castro in there no Julian Castro just announced that he's likely to run and Frank and we'll have more politics nation this weekend\nAnd uh but it was interesting that in the one that uh they projected Biden was like more than twice the population and he's been very vocal and saying he doesn't want to get down in the mud with the Republicans but in for him but I Will write\nYou know I think that um I'm not surprised by that poll for a number of reasons primarily because\nAfter we go through well like when we had the experience all that we will experience with President Trump you know there is a tendency sometimes that you just you wants to build ... and you want to go with a known quantity\nAnd people are probably looking at a vice president Joe Biden saying he's been tested we saw him as a senator we didn't saw him as a vice president he knows the workings of this nation he he knows the workings of the oval office and\nThat we saw him as a senator we didn't saw him as a vice president he knows the workings of this nation he knows the workings of the oval office and\nTrump will have done by that time so much damage you know it's just we can't even begin to put\nA number a dollar figure an impact figure yet on the un estimate the damage that he will have done and so there's a good likelihood that people want to see that stability I think the other interesting things when you appreciate that you got ... a Bernie Sanders is a\nNumber two and a Biden as the number one it does for me raise the question about uh where we are as a nation in terms of what we wanted to see and what we defined and measured stability and this and then when you see the camel Harris was it the morning then Cory Booker are three four and five\nWhat is it saying about where we are as a nation with respect to\nUm our our evolution and our progression do we believe that America doesn't want to see again anytime soon a person of color or a woman of color is it that uh people feel more comfortable with you know the status what what has been in play before because they feel it brings stability\nOr does represent a real mindset about who they believe should be leading America I'm so that'll be interesting the other thing you know I just ask you about Julian Castro and you mentioned that he has just share that he is actively exploring\nUh you know the the twenty twenty a\nBid for the nomination for president for the Democrat Party\nThe interesting thing there is that he would be if a if you know if he came forward and if he got to the point and place them being nominated he would be the first a person of Hispanic descent Latino or now we say let the next uh who would be up and running and that may be attractive\nTo a lot of people because you know we haven't been down that road before and we do as the Trump Administration uh is well aware of to all the policies that they're putting in place we do have\nAs the caller an earlier caller talked about the browning of America and we have more people [noise] uh I'm of a lead and who are Latino next or of Hispanic descent in addition to other people of color\nThat are increasingly representing more of the nation than fewer and so now that he's putting his name out there it will be interesting to see or the next little\nWhile later when the re actually yeah let's go to James Byrd George W E okay to Vincent Vincent\nLearns really eerie yeah I hear you know\nA a a ... a man or a family film I won't get

completely agree with you that what the president has done is wholly inappropriate I mean it is it's ugly it's demeaning um it it it needs it you know we would love to be called up I think the challenge that we're having right now\nIs that um there's a real concern that the Republicans are many Republicans\nHave are are are\nAre ready to come out and vote because they are a bothered about how Kavanaugh was treated and so I think maybe what I've seen a little bit not at our\nAh Fort was treated and\nAnd but what I'm saying to you is that I think probably what is happening is because he was ultimately confirmed\nUm I think the Democrats are probably thinking let's sees on some other issues because\nIf you want to galvanize the Democrat base by bringing up Dr Ford the concern is probably that in so doing you're going to reinforce the negative\nSentiment about um Democrats by the Republicans who got behind Cavanaugh I I'm not saying that that is what should or should not be done or what I'm just saying is that that's probably in terms of strategy\nPart of the concern the more you talk about Dr Ford and Kavanaugh the more you galvanized the Republican base to come out those people who really\nThe concern the more you talk about Dr Ford and Kavanaugh the more you galvanized the Republican base to come out those people\nWho sit at a bank and thank you again for your call I think\nThat uh uh that\nWe also must remember and I I certainly think the caller is right about uh\nHow Dr Ford was treating I'm not at all debating or question than every but I think that we have to deal with the reason that Kavanaugh has energized a lot of the Republican and right wing base is they want to use the Supreme Court right\nTo repeal everything from voting right that's to affirmative action look at the affirmative action case at Harvard going on now are you learning the Asians\nAre in a way or that or we saw with the ... that's exactly right and they want to use it to a repeal roe versus Wade and others\nSo they're not a galvanized with Kavanaugh\nBecause of what the accusations that tight they said that the caller's right out and ruined Kavanaugh but

that that that still would be great but I I think um\n... well one of the greatest uh adverse effects to that not been may not be the case anymore because you have a lot of these uh\nPastors preachers they'd just focus more on more of of how much money they can get an an an entertaining to you know because let's be honest most of the churches are filled with mostly\nWomen and they they they know they tend to give you know ...\nAnd ... and they then that's a large part that's because the the the the uh passes and stuff they they know how to appeal to the women and charm we know where they're entertaining you've all manner of of how they\nConvey the message to the words and all that stuff and and and they feed off each other\nAnd then a lot of times these are passes the stuff that they're not they're not focused on\nWas a more rounded up in terms of the dangers it can be dangerous to that humanity so like it as a neutral party goes to the church and and you know it starts to compensate

of a prominent men is one of the things 'cause I've done a lot of thinking about it one of the things that I think has happened mhm and then it's been a whole cultural shift are we allowed to happen\nAnd that is that\nWho ever decided the model of breaking down ... community they knew they had to break down the church\nAnd they knew they had to break down out entertainment entity ... uh there was a time and entertainment that five or six disc jockeys so brand new Jones in Chicago and\nFrankie cried in New York and would decide what was the hit or not they wiped all that out now and the music industry is controlled by corporations and they decided to start as most of whom we have nothing to\nThey wiped all that out now and the whole music industry is controlled by corporations and they decided to start as most of them we have nothing to do with our culture are coming in the same as happened in the church Rogers right when I was growing up\nRides the heroes and the role models in the church or a garden the Taylor river William Jones Sam ... black men as\nRole models for the generation of minutes discovered behind me a mega churches Joel own steam that I [noise] so we no longer have and the template people that we control all connected to right and that is what has shifted\nWhere we are now because the difference between us when I was a kid he has some blacks or supported or Richard Nixon\nBut they had to run back home and get it straight like Jane ... light vitamins and what can you can do what he wants is that\nThe record industry is controlled by people like that now and there's no penalty because there are no life big giant disk jockey they can take all their 'cause we don't have that kind of power you know and now we're in raising kids where their connection\nLegislate is no longer a model black preachers\nAnd and and black churches that they control and the mega churches about filled up\nTen thousand veins so you don't want to spend no body by talking about just as a talking about Medicaid so you just get everybody uh Indian has a spiritual eyes rather than also dealing with life\nAnd have the sermons you determine repeat after you anywhere you a bridge you tell them and then we'll just say what I say have those breaks down the institutional infrastructure that we had in our community so we can build a secular institutions go they've absorbed that including hit bottom yeah\nAnd they break down the church so it is no longer become the base\nAnd the traditional churches look down on because we now to a lot of kids just call it the old school and dismissive and even an activism and it's All right well that's grandma's movement that's tradition you know who's going to do an organic ... can't support families and\nHe can't support ongoing battles or the organic movement because again it by nature is good but it can't left right and these fights have to be long fight for this to shoot\nAnd I'm telling you I may never be able to prove it but I Believe all of this was a plan because it happened to perfectly to deserve at\nYou you said to me several years ago I came to you and I asked you to help me understand what was happening in our churches across the nation\nAnd I remember so well you said to me um it's essentially a debate between a spiritual social justice ministry and prosperity ministry\nAnd you talked about how the heroes the leaders of the church uh in years past with those who engaged in ... suggested ... said to me a for many of our leaders including like Adam Clayton Powell junior as an example\nThe community was the pope right and the issues of the community issues of poverty issues of police misconduct and we can go on and on those are the issues that the church grappled with and the the greatest ah leaders in the community where the church leaders who were taking up those issues\nAnd then you went on to help me to appreciate that we're now in this era of prosperity ministry\nIn the community where the church leaders who were taking up those issues and then you went on to help me to appreciate that we're now in this era of prosperity ministry\nThe mega churches that thrive on positivity and not really helping you to embrace reality and figure out how to deal with the reality and get to where you need to be what we were talking about during the last segment but the other thing is when you talk about and I appreciate and I agree with you when you talk about\nThat this is this is intentional deliberate we can go back to the years when um the the the the government begin infusing large sums of money into the faith based organizations ... for ... faith based initiatives and the theory was that oh we're going to help you take care of the community\nBut as you and I both know and as your dad taught the two of us you know what daddy second member of they spun something along the lines of eating the kings ... you cannot sit and watch it take on the king and sit at the table and eat the kings meat and then take him on\nWhen our community churches and these mega churches to grow mega churches you know borrowing loans large sums of money for the government uh you know getting deals on you know low interest\nUh you know like purchases of land to build their mega churches and then they started developing programs inside of their churches and taking grant money from the government since he what they do were doing was they were handcuffed themselves", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Al Sharpton Show", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "18"}
