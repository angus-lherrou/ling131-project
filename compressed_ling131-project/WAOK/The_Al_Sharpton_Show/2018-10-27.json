when you ... what does this mean\nFire it should've been said in a should've said zero if it was a not a ... it should have more than that but now there's a question mark\n[noise] so how can I Do about um resolve and if we don't want to move and there's no legal reason for them to I mean we've abided by the time to the lease\nBut there's no there's no legal reason for him\nTo allow you to stay on that I Am severely I say\nIt's just unclear it's pretty clear with the exception of those blanks and I want everybody who can hear this make sure every leaf every contract you have does not have a blank in it\nAnd there's just it's just lazy it's sloppy it and it leads to future problems so I'm the truth is I Would go back to the guy and say hey listen why are you terminating again and then to see if there's something that you can work out it in a nice way you can't find them on this\nJust put in Maryland okay All right I'm Sorry are right and the lowest thank you so I'm a okay thank you for calling\nIn a nice way you can't find them on it was just ... okay All right I'm Sorry All right and I learned thank you so I'm a okay thank you [laughter] [noise]\nOh goodness [noise]\n[noise] ... how are you today\nDoing well Mary I was actually listening to your folks I listen to every every Saturday and I just want to say that you have the patience of job [laughter] I really appreciate what you do to try to help our people I just wish\nPeople would really pay attention and all this and you constantly tell them before they enter\nInto these contracts for purchasing a home to get themselves a realtor and may fail continuously repeat that performance and doing any weight and then they call you up after the fact that when they are in crisis because they didn't listen and follow through\nAnd what you see them and it it's just really sad and\nIt's really frustrating it's really painful for me to watch because I take everything like personally on on me but I was in a subdivision this past Thursday on a builder meeting with some kinds of my ... in a high end subdivision not really good price right night ... beautiful homes\nAnd I was sitting there in the office and I saw these two people walking and they didn't have an agent and they just started talking to them onsite agent asking questions and she went and show them and I thought no well why are when are we ever gonna learn we're never ever ever going to learn the problem is is\nThat everybody knows that so you're sitting duck for ...\nSo true and not only that I listen to one of your your callers was making a gel statement about that's why he doesn't vote and I am I'm just really it frustrates me to hear our people say\nThat they don't know if it's like you don't care about what happens to you or anyone else you're leaving your future in the hands of other people why would you do that when you live ancestors and died for you to have the right to it makes no sense at all and just because you know you're due diligence\nTo maintain your home and you lost it because you can do all of that theory that that's not that's not the fault of the ancestors you need to hold anyway [laughter]\nSo here's the thing there's a there's a thought process out there and this is it I I promise you sometimes I think we need to take a step back and look at things a little clearer now there's a technique\nThere's so many technique that we don't know about that get you on a and people in the general population but here's a technique that they use this with your children this'll work and this is what they doing government because this work they say to your children\nIf you want your children to do with specific thing you give them the power of choice\nBut I have two choices that you're a good way\nYou know what I'm saying it's like it's like you like the king king wants you\nKnow to where this crazy thing and you say no you can pick from these two things and these are good so he feels empowered with a choice but he's actually pick what you wanted him to pay and that's\nAnd that's how politics and [laughter]\nThanks Scotty thank you appreciate your call\n\nCharlie how are you [noise] Hi how are you good what's going on so we're getting run by\nCharlie how are you how how are you good what's going on\nSo we're getting ready to buy a house and we had a moment's back here and we have concerns about the role or is that you did not have a lot or is he did it with but not you learn\nA lot of engineers they actually were able to get up on the go a little bit from the back there and and and they saw\nThe sun we pointed out to a factor but you know like how do we what we addressed that like you know like I Would we really would feel more comfortable than specter had got up there and walk that and you know looked at a black and you know the whole nine\nAll right so he didn't so here we are right now how much time do you have left on your due diligence\nI'm probably about another hot eighty\nFive days okay good take this number and then you can call this gentleman he'll come into a group inspection for your\nFor [noise] oh okay I got a\nHe's my dad my amazing my most wonderful on may ... great roofer he actually just I hit a closing and that it was an afterwards the storm came and my client had a roof leak afterwards so I sent him and he picks a root for free\nAnd you know I Try to live a simplified life but if I didn't have those what about water\nHow many people don't have clean water house in food you can go to the refrigerator and pick up what you want drive the public's get that sub you can do so many things other people can't do your children are happy they're healthy\nI mean these are things that we're thankful for and um we need to like God know that we're thankful for them\nHowever you Keith Hey Mary I'm fine thank you for taking my call them hey oh that was very inspirational what you\nJust said I mean there's some yeah it really makes you feel stuck and Frank ... herbicide for [noise]\nHey but um I I just had a question you had mentioned in one of your previous callers all you had given them the name of the number of the gentleman of does roofing and moved from a period where I miss I got his name I think it's all it's the element of ... I Believe it is\nOften lemon\nAwesome revoking Austin's Lynn says on the little kids yeah she's really good really good and so the I have read where after the rain I I Know there was some sort of see six seven eight six seven eight for six two\nFour six two five eight four one climate for okay yeah\nHe's great Tommy Battle anything else I certainly appreciate if they could run among some oriental thank okay thank you right on\nOkay so [noise] yes\nA caller came to me and she said listen I'm a trouble I'm being harassed by the lender I've got the second house I'm remarried and moved out\nYears ago and I have a tendency in it you heard this on a previous show I said All right\nBefore you get foreclosed on don't worry we're going to try to fix this let's put it on the market to sell\nThat I currently have a buyer who will\n... let's just say\n\nGive me really nothing for it and I said no no no no no no no no no no no we're going to put it on we're going to make you some money try to make some money off of this\nSo as I told you before we got for offers and we chose them based upon certain criteria and this is what your real estate\nAgent needs to do they need to sit down and tell you why one or the other is better and then you need to choose from those\nTypically caches of course so we went with the cash ones that was a tenant in there who we'd like to we love to was a friend so we kicked out the other one we were down to two that said the tenant could stay and we pick one which\nUltimately ended up closing although I regret it a little bit because the agent was very very very very\nDifficult to deal with [noise] even other agents ... difficult to deal with I mean people think I'm difficult just because I expect have high expectations that you're supposed to do what you're supposed to do so when I call you on that\nTo deal with I mean people think I'm difficult just because I expect have high expectations that you're supposed to do what you're supposed to do so when I call you on that then they get mad and say I'm difficult I'm not difficult just want you to do what you're supposed to do well this one was difficult crazy difficult\nThough I ended up you know having to put her tell her you know back it up\nYou're not in a position to demand anything we've done everything we needed to do so backup because she was coming for us for some reason [laughter]\nSometimes I think they just just like to do that [noise] so anyway we ended up closing and here's the strategy\nAgents really really listen to this I've developed a strategy recently\nAnd it's working like a charm if you represent a seller\nThere is absolutely no reason for that cellar to sit across from your buyer\nLet's get let's let's go back over that you have a\nA seller who you're representing you have a contract your closing is scheduled why would you have your sellers sit with that fire you know what you're doing your opening up the opportunity for that prior to ask all\nKinds of questions about that you're also increasing the chances of that how that ... that house not selling the closing not taking place because now these people are talking\nNot only could they ask a ton of questions\nBut also you don't please don't underestimate the impact of an attitude okay because the one or the other has an addict now you've really increase the chances of that not causing\nSo I have an attitude my son didn't have an attitude because I didn't let her know all the\nNegative drama that was going on I had an attitude because this lady took us places we didn't need to go so I said you know what\nWe're going to have you go in and find a day before closing was scheduled for friday my sellers went in and find their documents which amounted to about five or six pieces if it was a seller\nFor gave them the wiring instructions on Thursday signed\nPhone they were gone closing was scheduled for friday friday the buyer came in we were nowhere to be found I was doing something else the buyer came in find his socks gave his wire\nAnd never sat down together [noise] why so necessary unnecessary drama avoided [noise]\nNext thing you know two o'clock I'm making a phone call did it close yeah your check at the desk come and get it to the Y. or go to my seller yes she got a\nGreat thank you very much [noise] easy easy right [noise] avoid the drama [noise] All right well\nFor a nine to ... and we would come back we'll tell you about a few things happening my girl just told me about the\n[noise] news is our search\nThe navy definitely okay back in the middle

said earlier it is messing up his news cycle so disrespectful that's so crazy\nBut um our hearts go out to all those families to that Senate gone the rabbi all of Pittsburgh and all of this country because this is about the election in a room and I hate to make everything about the election but it really is a when people start shooting\nPeople because and sending bombs to people because of their political beliefs\nBecause they want us to get out and vote and vote our conscience is and vote in Congress and ultimately vote in the president that will represent our interests we have to face death and bomb threats because of that it just made\nMe sick to think that there are some people who are even considering not voting am I going to phone\nNo I don't think so um and I think it goes beyond vote I think you have to always do you cook will apply pressure to your um\nWhat was the on voting well thank you off to always to local local local time apply pressure\nTo your um representatives and\nTo your community as well um and by applied pressure on me things like you out and protest or we can never discount the importance of a protest\nOh get out and canvas talk to people global Vance and do those things always being engaged some wife on the same people who vote might not be the same before going gauge they should be but they might not necessarily be\nBought 'em we always need apply\nThat pressure and just see like hey you know we can't get numb to these things because\nThen that would make is now ...\nThere's so much um my school shootings you know shooting um domestic terrorism is enough to fight and anybody out of doing anything and um you can't you can't get to that point you can't think like that because\nWe always have to be striving for better version of America that are a version of ourselves to fight for better version of America\nWell that's exactly what rabbi Myers was saying in his July blonde rabbi ... he's the head rabbi of the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nWhere these terrible massacre has occurred this morning well hey we have a the distinct honor Pam and Mr job easily international civil and human rights advocate on the line didn't know he was going to come and I'm so glad that he did [noise] hey Mr job essentially\nHow are you how you go alone there is always a\nPleasure to listen to you and\nJanice or you're just right on point what I wanted to comment on a and I'm sure your grandfather was going on in Israel and\nGaza Strip and as you know a Mr Netanyahu as a mother mad man has to you know who I Believe\nThat happen in Pittsburgh is directly tied to what's going on in Israel uh I think that we're living in a low global village and uh what impact one has\nAn impact on the situation so I just wanted to make good observation\nWill tell you the only person that would call us and put that in focus was thank you for doing that it had not cross my mind that this was not just the United states should but it's a global you should just give us a little you uniquely positioned to give it to give us just a little synopsis\nOf what Netanyahu\nHe is and who he is and what he's doing in Israel\n[noise] well I think that you know this whole question about Israel in ... in my opinion forty eight right after the second World War and the Jews are most ... then across the earth and uh they\nGo to get guilt trip on the part of the world they wanted to find a place for the Jewish people\nAnd of course her problem was when they decided to give them a Palestine there were people in Palestine and so are people that are almost ... late it a command and pick out what people's homes and stuff ... which are\nReal a poetic ah I\nI won't say justice I Am justice but it's something that is very\nVolatile tile and I think it has a whole world\nIt's just an injustice but it's something that is very volatile\nTile and I think it has the whole world a at a drink or not just returned from a\nAlthough Congo last week and so that's another discussion of some of the things that's going on in the ... is director of course tied to Belgium\n... and a\nShow things are playing out and you know those truism that if you are so to the ... and I believe your fans who have shown to the wind is bound to report\nWith Joe I Would say the exact same thing about the United states I was thinking that this morning when I heard about the synagogue shooting and also about the bombs but is it to try to say that then Yahoo is Israel's trial\nAbsolutely absolutely and of course for them to move the U.S embassy and to Jerusalem which is a you know somebody is prohibited a\nBut just for spite a Trump are goaded over that and uh so all of it is still being played out\nThere and do we ever get to go back from globalism 'cause there's no doubt that this is a global conflict that we in a global society can you go back to nationalism from a global society\nI think it's impossible to advances in technology and so forth and uh you know we're going to even solve the language barrier that they use cell phones and things can translate\nSo uh we're on a global world in a as a you know Dr King and uh observed a you know that they're ... or ... for all this fat taught gesture shot I think those of us to\nWant to try to do the right saying a treat everybody the way we would like to be treated or it's really something I relate to stay the course on nothing will be vindicated in the end\nWell I Hope so Joe uh I'll take it from your mouth because you certainly in a position to see and know a lot about this do we promise to come back and talk to us when we can just spend some time and talk about some of these global issues\nI Love to do it loved to have chosen till ... former place\nCertainly when she's

surprise and we need that education because I just think it's crazy to think\nLock her up um it's just amazing to me that people can be so stupid and so gullible and it's also amazing to me reach and I want to hear your opinion on that people can talk about not voting\nOr I don't know what to say about that I have ... ... they're not going to order a tractor trailer with crazy where they don't listen to a lot of young folks I Know not voting either\nSo are you close enough to any of 'em for them to tell you whether he is a keeps him from Boehner primary or have any of them told you what it is is keeps them from voting I Know many readers Hoover\nThings I'm not going to change back on and make a difference to most of\nWhat a crazy attitude now um but rock Obama didn't do everything I wanted him to do I didn't agree with all his promises but I don't know how people can be so quick to forget that we elected the first African American bras\n... says but I don't know how people can be so quick to forget that we elected the first African American president just a few years ago\nMhm yeah but our our ... veteran now right here in the lower here locally I think that I think I think this election getting ready to be\nGoing out so well Brian Kemp do you think so they're not going to be done about it it certainly is a threat and motion already\nWell he said it in motion before he even announced his run when they personal six hundred thousand voters from the bone in this you know he's in charge of those boating list\nBut I Believe that people will get out and vote enough people will go out and vote and he likes Stacey Abrams I just believe it or whatever\nYou don't read offered orders corrupt cricket cricket victory over to cook\nWell that's absolutely true and I tell you if he's reelected they won't be any investigation into what he did while he was in office and the secretary of state's office you can get about sharing their grandchildren because they will control it again\nIf the shoe was on the other foot and that was a Democrat or doing all those during the other hand things to get elected to set the elections so they could not lose\nOr Republicans will lose they have a lot of the man\nWho who don't want to play with ... ... and it took about ... election being ... thinks they brush and getting ready to do some would admit term that's what ... saying that the two Confederate\nWell ... yeah they never stopped right when I was home where I was\nNot well not not what you mentioned about here in the process of doing it again after\nWell day in that process the intelligence committee has told his day in the process of a interfere with the election but it's the same as the rich and\nThe Republicans saying controlled in control of the house and the Senate and they're not going to investigate it and if there's an investigation that comes across their their desk they're going to ignore they're not going to do anything about it because\nThe Republicans are favored other relativistic\nBecause he doesn't if they don't get control of the house none of these investigations that should be taken place with not going to happen\nYou have the right yes a room\nAnd we're also in the new ... new Cold War um it's a digital version but here um\nLet's see who can hack each other all the most we can get the most information from one another and um use that to whoever advantage so and Trump is already in bed with the Russians is already in cahoots with them\nSo it behooves him for the Russians have his information that's why he won't switch to a more secure phone system from his personal iPhone\nYeah well it's been ...\nPersonal email address because it doesn't seem to have to let them know that from ancient but the Russians have been our allies almost ever idle\nSince World War two they have not been able to expand on that Trump using his own personal cell phone\n[laughter] yeah he won't refused to give up his individual iPhones um and for the average consumer an iPhone is fine you don't worry about security but if you're the\nPresident of United States you need a more secure system to communicate and he refuses to I'm adapted to and
