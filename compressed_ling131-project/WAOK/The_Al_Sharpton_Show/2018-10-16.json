that's going on left and right every time you turn around there's always something\nUh every time you also turn around there's always some white woman accusing a black person of rapid and bottom moody or not being in the right place where there's supposed to be even though they lived in a place\nUh these robbers continues to plague us like I said twenty three years since the million Man March was rolling still going through this drama\nThings have not changed that much housing or have they you know eight Seventy seven find three to find someone that someone's going to line seven is BJ in Indianapolis ... sitting in\nTheir line okay just fine go ahead Man March yeah I\nWould say I'm not a black man I'm a black woman but I never in a in that in March and now I sadly to say well you did not come back and do\nWhat you said as a after that like it did at that time that the younger generation they hear eliminate that left and right oh we've had no democratic nomination for President Obama\nThey came back and make ... an honorary black rather I don't even know what that was about a three strikes you're out\nYeah how you doing ... you know like\nHow can I comment to send the million Man March anniversary I Believe they were successful unified black man but I think it should emphasize more of an economic plan agenda and also as a black man that's like people are weaker unify\nAnd I'm going out and I'm pulled out of business together and and by law got sales\nSo we went being predicted are dependent on on a on the other races to hire as for a job and also we should um have\nTies with other nations specially made such an after because a lot of European countries or is it going to Africa now from a different nations because Africa is rich and resources\nSo we we would have been a step ahead of the European countries and they would have because economically today and I also I Believe I'm a a march to the center for the day as a way of we need another one because of the black man is under attack\nThat when you look at the um the shootings about his safety forces and also through the media certain parts of the media and I I'm whenever there's a black man who was at assertive that but I usually is to do with being out of control\nYou know I Am societies for like the black man showed up I Would be submissive so we had to let them know that we deserve to be respected him the other raised will have to come to the table\nYou know with a here is that we've come to the table here so like any other ways to be respected as man I mean that that would lead to the accusation you spoke earlier about the young border too so a person that white woman you know I'm going to go back to it and the two that's how he got killed and falsely accused\nIf his state's the return of going on for this\nBut since we since we've been here some I'm white people feel that we use them so much and the white man for like a ... one is such a broad rather when\nDid that up everybody does that somebody gets papers are they all women just as much as any other race of women we got some beautiful black women\nSo we don't go out a way you know to a if a black man's mind is Ryan's depend woman's mind is the right to think of another race was better than ours and now it's their mind is where I Believe in themselves can um\nThat's basically what they're doing their brothers those are good points an excellent point see you're absolutely right and that uh every time you turn around\nThere was a story how can you hear about you know and now you're a

can visit our website or the dots a W. W. dot to beat D. C. dot com and uh you have a lot of things you want to talk about what we are beginning of the show\nA this is the twenty third anniversary of the million Man March\nToward the believe twenty three years ago and of course we put up to the full says are we better off just a march\nOf people as look folks and um has and want to change for us\nSince the million Man March a course a million women's march game right after that but what are your thoughts on how how strange\nBecause it I think things have changed at the time we had the million Man March it with the nineties I don't think most of us thought we would ever be a black president there\nWere some people who are calling Bill Clinton at the time the first black president and a lot of black people took offense to that not everybody\nA run into that that joke um or or that number I'm I think we've seen the election of Rocco bombing and I think the idea of his presidency change the trajectory of how black\nPeople black men the themselves on their own desires we've had a lot more legislative represent the uh the than we did in the nineties or not that that the federal level obviously the Congressional Black caucus has grown but you've also being a more people of color running for office across the country since then we've also seen some gains um\nEconomically briefly unfortunately during the recession a lot over Ninety percent of black welcome to wipe\nOut a yet again so it's kind of that thing that the pendulum swing one way and that it always link back\nSo there has been some growth but there's also been a lot of that a lot of the progress that we saw um come come in during the Clinton Administration we saw some things I go away under that George Bush administration I Know nowadays a lot of people particularly younger people don't remember the presidency and that George\nBush President you know look so bad in comparison to the Trump presidency but there are a lot of talented guy that was very kind of mandatory minimum that devastated black community rock Obama and some of those policies now that you have to jump in office he's doing them again so in many ways a bad thing it's kind of a wrinkle in time a lot of the issues that black people were facing a\nTwenty three years ago they're still facing now what I Would say though\nI'm the biggest change has been\nGiven access to information\nAnd now I at that time it was so people were reading dailies there wasn't um you know competition over to twenty four hour\nAn echo chambers that got the cable news networks people do not have information at their fingertips everybody wasn't glued to their smartphones and and had a lot of screen addiction at that time and so now people do now you can find out with an easy access\nInformation if at your finger at about who is your representative I'm about issues that impact you directly in your community if you're registered to vote or not\nSo I think some of the challenges that we're that we're a face by black people in in the nineties uh twenty three years ago I think now some of those sounds may still exists but perhaps we can say that black people have more control over it or they just have to accept and tap into the information and take the control that that that that the\nRight to do but ... none of the things that we know about oh I'm going to be popping up\nA world where women are choosing a black man that was fighting a nine year old to Brooklyn I'm willing to back that going back he just passed the woman and she when she was sexually assaulted\nOn nine one one Kenny also from St Louis room block ma'am what boneless aren't the largest black man in his own apartment\nA novel called nine one one you don't move you know you'll you'll live here and so we have these incidents popping up all over the place you know what's going on\nI think this is another example as ah the more things change the more things they say none of these incidents are new and and you know that Bob I mean people have been putting up with that kind of thing since the beginning of time\nI worked in we were kidnapping and brought to this country I could say\nSo um again these things are new what is what is new and the access to the information now people are able to capture some of these I'm rethinking with adults or on our safety on their cell phones on it and people are being called out there is a public shaming I ... that is the one thing that I Would say that I'm happy for the windy things happened\nPeople are not campaigning that people who were really the aggressors and blaming black people for things that they didn't do different living in this thing out of people are claiming the people who um attack them which I think it's a welcome\nA change and you know the thing that really struck me about about the little boy this this incident and ended\nIt could have been a lot worse fly that file is going to carry that incident with him for ever I mean this could be very well in his first encounter with law enforcement and so when you hear people complain and because it's not their experience\nAnd you hear people complain about NFL players kneeling these are the incidence doesn't the burden of black\nSkin and the privilege of white tents that far too many people don't understand and when you sat back and look at it if you can step outside of your own privileged and look at the situation you kind of have to ask\nYourself who that'd be a tie these people to be a the the judge and jury of any given incident when you think about the woman who called the police I'm a little girl for selling water and she didn't have a permit when you think about the woman denies that men injury to his own place I mean some of these incidents in in that\nYou know so I I'm always thankful that people didn't die but people shouldn't be able to go about and live their own life without having that type of harassment sadly there are still too many people um who have been emboldened by um the current administration and feel like I'm like they can\nBe the oh the law enforcement their own self appointed law enforcement and the irony of it as you hear the president now\nThan it now calling people on the black and angry mob of people and I every time I hear that I Wish that the cable news networks will go cause footage of people at his rallies threatening violence calling journalist enemy of the people um and and just see some of the footage that that black people really deal with on an everyday basis it's really ironic that Republicans\nLove talking about Chicago and love to talk about the violence in Chicago but not the violence that they create and fight a lot of people going about minding their own business and then someone else comes along\nAnd then the aggressor and bothers them so and again you know it strikes me that it's twenty three years since the million Man March\nI again I think there have been some game but certainly there's always room for improvement I think we're decades away it ever from reaching some sort of a Nirvana or utopia in this country um but and then you know it it takes time and I wonder though I thought to remind people\nBlack people have were slaves longer than we've been free and if any of us can look back into our own lineage and hear stories of our great grandparents who worth Les um and who was ... and you know different things and and migrated to the north um the fact\nTime when the services have you ever inquired about your entitlement\nDisability benefits from the VA but we'll as though he\nTitled so much more even

days I'll tell you that much or as we've been talking about the twenty third anniversary of the million Man March which is a ... day Twenty years ago and they of course and we put on our way better off\nThe since the march as a people are\nProbably just didn't get the message and we've got lost and\nAnd uh\nWhat has changed for us since March twenty three years ago your thoughts\n[noise] well I think one was one of the perspective on on the accomplishments\nThe accomplishments of the million Man March is always relative I think depending on one's social contacts they're going to\nDetermine how they perceive it and so I think many people probably have different views on that whether the million Man March was successful at what has happened since then are we any better I think at that time in the early nineties or it was a tremendous thing to see so many African American man to gather\n'em if for no other reason to show unity across\nReligions across socio economic backgrounds it was a great gathering\nI think in our culture we often see these moments um then we use them as signify as a possibility um the possibility of something better hacked and can we move the country forward have thing can this event or change the country and I went to their mind people that\nEvents don't necessarily change the country is sustained engagement with issues that helped to push us forward and so I think one thing we've learned from not only a million Man March but you go back over history to march on Washington I mean you could call the role of different events we've had that have\nFormed traction towards social change [noise] there's always been sustained engaged with particular issues that people galvanize around and I think it's no different now now with regard to how we progress I think again it depends on what you said I think there's some people can say African Americans as a\nAs a whole have moved forward but\nI think again that many people not community who still battle issues around getting equitable access to education and resources who still battle with affordable housing still battle with access to health care who are still battle with\nTrying to find the basic needs for sustenance or they could be as many people who those are the daily fines they will say progress has not taken place\nWhereas in other quarters of our community where people have been able to be upwardly mobile and who have benefited from opportunity and access they\nMay say things and move forward but I think again it depends on where social location is your\nView about what you have it for many they will say we're better emphasis on with that many will say things have not changed\nYou know and that but we're still dealing with violence against each other so I learned my goodness Everytime you turn on the television you see on beating each other shooting each other it's just and and as I\nCan handle it here's what I Would say about the one thing that many people\nHave to be you know someone will have to make that comment Bob and we'll dead critique you and say oh brother while you talk about the issues within the black community does about white people and about the races not country and I have to remind people that we can do we we are\nGifted creative talented intelligent we can do multiple things at the same time if nothing else African Americans history in this country tells you that we can multitask that means we can also critique the system a little pressure in an institutional racism while the same time be critical the behavior the impacts are community by people in our community\n... comment on some what you said and of course this twenty third anniversary of the million Man March is going to lie to Donald in North Carolina Donald ...

the organizing group filled that me and man much so I think that if we can kind of connect the dots a little better\nAnd assessment will see that there was a lot of outcomes ha monitor\nBut clearly a you know I mean that we don't continue to try to build on what we were able to establish but the ... were fruitful\nThey were miserable results that came out it however the minimum mandatory isn't on them as crime bill that was signed by Clinton on demand a lot at work and the only one of those those who work with a roots that are involved in conflict around the world anytime warring factions put their arms down there was a peace\nDividend there's something to do they done by you know nation states too infused capital job training things of that nature so soldiers put the guns down in our case it with the guns and drugs and it was no peace the dance\nAnd in fact there was an attack from many law enforcement although the elderly those steppers throughout the United states so I think we need to reconsider that in that context and I hope that radio state I Know there's a brother named\nMark Thompson that was the emcee when we were there for me the ... the million Man March activities yeah I'm sure it gets a share to light on some of that but we were welcome\nOur I mean there's a ... it's called the national council for the international council for urban piece just sending in ... it it

industrial complex is loaded with us and uh we don't we don't seem to have have benefited from was simply a twenty three years ago at least learned a lesson from it [noise]\nWell I I think\nYou know it's not just the twenty three years ago again I said earlier you can go back to the march on Washington that fans that had been accomplished the things that we have done but I think many people have to want to realize is above just outlined the million Man March madness appear to be a moment but what led up to it was a movement\nAnd I think ... bought one of the things you have to realize that this ... this culture right now that we're in that is highly sensationalize culture as infatuated with celebrity and attention and sometimes the people who want to replicate moments but don't want to bill movements\nAnd building movements on the say again is based on sustained engagement with issues that matter to\nPeople in our community that means that we don't just stop because we didn't get the response we wanted we didn't get the attention we wanted we stayed with the issue until the as some winnable outcomes that we've created in as fast as as markers of achievement along the way and so I think whether you when you look at issues around mass incarceration\nOf for example as you lifted that has to do with policy there has to do with how do we change policy and I know Bob for many people we hear vote whereas the vote\nI think for some somebody to we've heard so much it doesn't have the same power but I Try to remind people that if you are fighting an opponent you don't necessarily study the opponents weakness you study their strength and when you attack an opponent you attack the opponent at their strength and what some people need to understand is that if they are people who are trying to create sophisticated\nAnd nuance mechanisms to stop us from voting to shrink the voting pool those who are doing it are telling you that that is our strength we need to
