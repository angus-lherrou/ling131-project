wrong with that ... much room today\nHarry's inspection it made me feel a lot better and pulled me off the ledge quite a bit even though they had a big issue that day they came and then the inspection but I'm the builder object to their credit\nTime because isn't it multiple times in the middle part the request they respond immediately the next day and\nThey are overly overly were spots him so that makes me feel a little better but at the same time it's new construction I should not have the issues that I have been happy [laughter]\nNo you shouldn't have and so let's back up until the listening audience rigid that you did have an inspection somebody we had to try to pull I had no experience with this person I had no previous\nKnowledge and the gentleman came in he did not do a thorough inspection and not only that he broke something is\nGoing up until the attic and apparently I had to go to work because I just started a new job right when I found this property so I as my father if he could come by and I'm so glad that she was able to go buy for the inspection and he said you know he stepped into probably ... creek\nEven at the ... outside her to quit I'm like what [laughter]\nAnd he ended up breaking the matter to the attic and the poor project manager when he saw the report he's like that could not have been broken\nBecause I Would not have passed cold for that how in the world that that happened and then as my father told us that well\nIt kind of credit when it went up there were like oh well that's it\nInterestingly enough the stairs to have a limit of pounds and what is that I mean ... ... was about two hundred and fifty pounds and this guy was way more than two hundred and fifty pounds um\nYes my father said easily close to four hundred I was like oh well that doesn't help [laughter]\n\nYou got it right All right let's fast forward to Harry so I I it you're calling me with all of these nightmare story of my head was reeling\nAnd then you say then I said I just got the message from Harry that he's back I mentioned that I said too bad we didn't have him Bridget said get him I don't\nCare what because it is and hairy you will be hearing from me Monday they did a phase one follow up to your report yesterday and then they're going to come back out to deal with the flashing\nUh allegedly to say depending on the weather and even my neighbors I've given up all your cart [laughter] they're like oh my God I Need to have them come back out us so I needed to bring more part\nThat is nice but it's really really really I Need you didn't we need you to convey to the listening audience bridging that some of these issues and here we found after the other inspection and after the county inspections yeah we're we're coed items were he to delete your auction items\nRight cooking I mean they did not coke outside the window as I've been in that town\nI'm home and some builders Harry explain to me he spent several hours there it took time to go through everything for another thirty forty five minutes with me\nAnd it's like yeah some builders consider call came to the cosmetic well inside if you're talking about a quarter of all the bathroom but not outside it keeps out water and bugs and lo and behold ... hour after Harry we had a quick minute now poor\nI come back home and there was a bottle of water on the other one was like oh my God what if they're not slick picture that than to Harry and he and then they called like yep\nThat talking as last year and that was that's what that prevent from happening so it is to get not any it's very very\nSerious I'm Serious but thank you Bridget exactly and we'll followed follow up on that long about well up about your approach is that once they do address these things you just text me earlier and said I'm going to get Harry to come back out again and check\nAgain yes and he let me come back and three more months I think I'm going to have you come into quarterly inspections up until my twelve month because\nI don't know how to do that stuff so I don't know if they're doing it white or not say clearly didn't take care of it the first time so\nI'm not even going by what they say are trusting what they do and my neighbors all the conversations we've been having they were completely the same way they're like no you have this information I Need to go ahead and call him now yes you should call him now right [laughter]\nAnd I want everybody to know who's listening in that this is a Smyrna brand new town home a three story town home and is that brick and

anything without inspection thanks absolute thinks British thank you thank you are going to be just don't want to hit would I Do regret we did our age was ... by what you\nJust talk let's let's start to talk about the um\nYou didn't get hurt pre drywall otherwise none of this would really be happening [noise]\nMust be some of it OK large a lotta stuff was or ... or ... structure and things like that but the issues with us on the exterior greatly influenced the interior for example like the um the water you turn\nAround her windows she had four of these little quad windows mhm and what you describe the sudden wrongful started looking cheated water ruining on her or when they were really high the river ... right right ...\nI Can't tell you how many times based upon your inspection we have had pieces of framing changed because they've been compromised they cracked\nThis right or like a these engineered roof systems is a trust mhm it's not uncommon to find those are damaged when they were off loaded or their damaged when they drag 'em up and install them on top of the walls\nOr or other trades damage them and so the builders engineer when he goes through if he's in a hurry he might miss some of those and so you know I ... I climbed through the trust is to look for damage with things is not right if it's not Bryce properly to resist wind load\n'em make sure they're tied down to the wall so that when it can't pick the system up\nAnd they change code regularly every three years so sometimes they'll say framing has to be so far apart and then they'll change it right and sometimes builders don't change that they not come up to the change in the ...\nWe find that very common\nThat ah they're kind of behind\nWhat a Georgia's DCA puts into law the building code is going to be applied life for this year twenty Eighteen\nAnd twenty Nineteen January there'll be a few little modifications where they make adjustments to the current building code to sit Georgia or certain areas of Georgia because we have different climates and so forth\nOkay we're going to talk to a caller Franklin how are you today\nOutstanding unable to you'll give out that lady eagles no pressure\nCardinal principle ... gotten the is but they're no one told me about deep fried drywall inspection\nAnd the oldest ... when I did a walk through the builders representative\nAnd he told me to one of a fun oh they will All right though and come back in about a week or two and then see if it's been done\nThen I can close but as far as it an official list of the problems from the builder out he it shouldn't feel laying\nWouldn't leave on the upper received the list\nOf violated yields cardinal proof [laughter]\nOh I'm Sorry I'm learning so\nHere's the thing had you had an agent and then I say I have to qualify that further had you had an agent who really knows what to do and cares they would have and this is what I this is the process that I have\nAdopted over the years when Harry or any other inspector if if in fact I have done fortunate occurrence use anybody out but I get from Harry what's called an overview of what he's found on that pre drywall inspection then when we do that walk through when we do the pre drywall meeting\nI can give it to the builder and I incorporate those things into our walk through item\nIs it too late to have an inspection well with us close on the house\nIt's not too late because Bridget if you heard earlier she had inspection act he's since been in there for five months closed after and she had another inspection from here he founded four pages of things and now she's going back to the builder because you're still in the subdivision\nAnd she's asking them to fix those things and they're good builders so they're going to address them and they're not mad about addressing them their day they say okay this was found were going to do it\nAgain please you Mr Harris up my phone number and everything that you have to do\nIt goes up to your uh your program is so educational especially this one or two they\nDidn't do this and I should have had a pre ...\nBut you know what you know now when you know better you do better it's okay we did not going to look behind and we're not gonna say well you know should have what it could it now we know going forward we're going to do better\nOkay I appreciate your program and stupid will be a did not take\nYou'll know know limited\nPrograms that are listening to O W e okay involving real estate one zero one and actually I'm Ninety five percent to bleed [laughter]\nIt's okay we are to blame for our own mistakes okay thank you for taking my call and I will I'll give you my phone numbers early will surprise no much Bye bye Bye bye\nOkay hey who am I speaking with\nNew okay got\nNobody there All right So Harry I'm what I Would like to do is let's talk about prior to the pre drywall inspection\nBuilders require certain certification in order for you to inspect their product\nTell me what those are and it's important for agents to know now we have to get them to the new construction um builder and onsite agent prior to Harry going into doing that inspection because they have to be a approved\nThat's correct you know they just want to make sure that whoever rooms other most critical or their their property they're more than half credentials\nThose are the support that so for that reason a lot of times the last year my member of the George association of home inspectors\nThis home inspector group requires all certified inspectors to be building code certified so this up in the twenty five years and I have to renew that his they stay up to date with building codes every three years\nThat's the important thing you have to renew it in order for this certification you have to have continuing education exactly\nAnd so through that organization I can get building code credits that I can use to renew my international\nUm\nCongress the rights to building codes for really the whole United States and so a mile so I have a my dinner for vacation with a from a C.

A. okay\n\n\n\n\nYou know he's\nThe ball\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nOh my\nBe um [noise]\nBut back\nWhen I married young doctors often inspections\nDa da and all and Austin inspection\nAustin inspections in the studio with me today you can Google him he'll come up because he's well known\nI'm not the only one that uses Sam [laughter] I didn't represent the eyes Lee brother\nHarry did that aged call you for that\nJust oh why oh why\nBut I didn't get to meet him that was the sad part really no I wanted to meet him\nAnd his brother lousy ... brothers that are buying [laughter] um but I Do ... that's the sad part\nThat's a that's amazing All right so what did we cover now on the um pre closing inspection because I I Will say that you go ahead and say your part because then you'll tell me you pass it over to me and then once I get that overview again I'll tell everybody what I Do with that\nOkay so basically we looked at everything this there we'd like the ideal time is say the day before you do your walk through with the builder uh all the plots should be there should be a hundred percent complete utilities on so that we can\nTest and operate everything to send the home we can look at the exterior look at everything on the tour checked the doors for plumbing electrical heating and air and then you know we write up a summer reporters up\nSo that you can do it in that timeframe that way American give my report and send it over to the builder and doing what he does a walk through were basically marry in uh the client do a cosmetic walk through bicycling\nAnd associate you make up a list actually and then you get both lose to the builder them that way he assumes everybody through one time rather than dragons us out over a period of a week or two he can to a job and just a matter of few days so your closing has not held up\nNot an an addition to that why it's important to get it prior to that schedule to walk through is because at that walk through just like you heard earlier you do a list you find that list that this is what we've found the builder then fixes that list if\nYou find something after ...\nWell now I mean fortunately prejudice is with a builder that is going to address or issues but the truth is is that a lot of builders will not address them after the fact and I incorporate them into the walk through a list\nRight a lot of times I defer to the after so warranty department ... you know which is going to address anything you find for the for the year but they're not on site\nYou know and so you you end up having a scheduling problem now because who's going to be at home to let them in you know going to be there to watch them\nYou have to take off work this right I ... and this unfortunately again was in that little\nPeriod of time when you weren't available I I had a new construction and Smyrna\nAnd so the things we found after closing had been referred to the warranty company you know that this man was so that he was an executive and so busy that I said I'm going to come over and sit and wait for the warranty people and I sat while the warranty people did the work but\nAnyway All right so a resale inspection is hugely important for those types of reasons now\nI Love buying a resale I probably would not see myself buying a new construction because I prefer a resell it's been sitting there for four or five years seven years ten years I see and know what I'm getting with your inspection\nThis right we have history so we're even the walls and things are covered up by the home having age we can look to see if there's been any settlement is it unusual settlement this causing cracks like over doors and windows or ... and the Brits and you're on the outside\nOr things like the\nUm the just occur either naturally or something has occurred to that home to to force those types of movement\nDepending upon the age of the home typically dependent upon what you will find in the home like you said to the caller earlier Seventy five and older Nineteen Seventy five an older you will more than likely have specified in your house you'll have led based paint in your house\nUm and then new we're newer homes from\nNinety to Ninety One Ninety two up to about Ninety seven you have your lp siding and you'd probably be Italy plumbing\nIs right near a class action lawsuits are also something has happened in the last two years as roofing oh this one particular brand of roof and by that list that la Shirley I'm\nAs a thirty thirty year warranty they're failing and five to ten years would blisters cracks really and the manufacturers not trying to replace the roof they're very hesitant to replace your roof because it's warranted playing some manufacturing deferred\nAnd so there's a number of ... lawsuits are beginning\nOfficers are beginning because of that the future this was a beautiful roof is very beautiful it looks like an architectural single but it's really a three to and so but it hit a thirty year warranty well it's not less than Thirty years\nAnd so if you have wind damage for example we had these recent storms right you can't patch the roof\nBecause there's nothing that will match a group has to be totally replaced\nAnd that's an insurance claim if the insurance will allow you to do it\nIf they will allow you're right that's right so you know that's just something that's come up recently but like the the late eighties and early nineties you you had the notorious ... piping mhm oh those are the electrical things too there was a square to broker that was being counterfeited\nAbout the same time and so a few of those pop up here in there and I\nFound her fit breaker\nCounterfeit us right looks just like a square do broker but it was telling us that\nThat is the craziest thing okay so now do you\nGo into a resale any different than you would to like an existing new construction or it's pretty much the same you're looking for things I mean I guess you're looking for other things based upon age because you know what materials may be in there but what tell us the idea of a resale\nWhat we're looking at everything again we want to see uh the city would arrive would decay I was home to maintain a dependent on the edge has renovation to remodeling occur how will do they do that you know did they bring things up to code for example when the water heaters replaced a\n... but we look at everything the the grading around the home to mature water does run under the home or looking at your pain roof siding brick worker stone work decks\nBush or resell ducks have summation of them can be you know problematic and unsafe at times\nUm so we look it up to see if the book is sand or does it needs some major repairs to it or\nI've seen some so bad they really need to be torn down I put some safety type around a duck to keep people offer because it was in such bad shape allow that crazy yeah in this home was it was a foreclosed home but it was probably ten years\nOf age ten years but the duck was shot by is coming apart\nWas probably garbage when it went on\nThe other way mhm right so that's one side of George has come up with this duck prescriptive ... because they don't want to see people get hurt when ducks collapse wow\nThat's crazy so that just like in New construction here well then do an overview and he has a no but that's what I like about you and ... and the way you do it but maybe just because I'm used to it and ... whenever I get something that somebody else has done I Can't even decipher what they're doing but anyway so he gives us a little um\nFind her three ring binder and in it it's separated according to the various different things in the house\nThat's what I Love about it and then on the front on the top for you agents us agents he will do an overview which is everything that he's found that important and in order of importance and he bowed things that are safety issues are code violations and things like that so\nAs easy as if this agents\nBuyers for your agent what I Do then on to resell during the due diligence period I say everything that is attached according to the overview of documents faction blah blah blah\nAnd then they get I don't have to go and\nGo and in a outlined ate things or nine or ten things I incorporate all of it and then we start working backwards in importance from that point right\nAnd also your breakdown that summer report by the different systems in the home then we also do a consecutive number so that way when you're when you're discussing\nBut with a cloud over the phone you can say well what about uh item number three number four number five runs the electrical item number Thirteen a gypsy I that was not working so I Try to make it where it's simple and easy to follow 'em\nAnd everything is not a death sentence right there's this huge hugely important things and then there's maintenance things had deferred maintenance things right here\nThat's right so you're just about everything can be fixed\nBut some but not very much cost at all mhm you know what when it comes to electrical some things are not that expensive to replace your bed reset the goals or switches or even some ... that are become defective\nI don't have time to take this before the break do I lacy and I don't have a name okay for for it not to think that that there are three we have only one break left with here if you have any questions give us a call ... holding up the shortly real estate one oh one back in a minute [noise]\nReal estate
