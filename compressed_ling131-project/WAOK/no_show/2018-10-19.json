quarter so let's talk about the NBA's global reach a expanding ah he won silver to make it the number one sport in the world do you believe that\nNo well it depends on how you define it if it's a number one sport as far as revenue the NFL is still there because it's an American sport as far as international globalization soccer is the number one sport I wouldn't mind basketball being number two but still reaching three hundred million\nPeople who play in China you know that's a that's twenty five million less than the entire country the U.S\nA and they don't need a big market share and China they just need to have some interest which is why they're dealing with China they've got games going on in in in London a they're dealing with a lot of the international stuff in the NBA is doing it right\nSo the ... real uh the Lakers now they're just loving life would this guy or they become the head story in the ... and I dare playing at the motor center in Portland about the boss and here we go with LeBron\nYeah for twenty seven percent year over year increase in in price resale tickets you know you don't have to worry about the Lakers selling out because they've already got all

and they're saying don't count Vancouver that didn't count because he didn't give us any players\nSo we need a second team in Canada and the NBA probably looks at Seattle first in Kansas City maybe

E. L. C. those are nonpartisan organization but what if you are a member of the Democratic party do you then make those nonpartisan organization partisan of course not that's not how this works\nFor zero for now too to seven zero three and a response back the government Jefferson County did admit that the rule there's no actual statute\nThere's no law there is no policy there is no protocol they say\nIs an unwritten rule you know unwritten rule means it means you made it up that's what it means no Julian\nI personally feel awful for the senior citizens because how often do they get an opportunity to leave yeah the facility\nAnd I'm sure that's why they were so excited\nJust because they had done was the real excitement this there was a\nGroup setting people were dancing is an opportunity to fellowship beyond the walls of their living environment and they were doing something that they believed in\nDefinitely and I mean that that's unfortunate I feel bad for the senior citizens that are in that aspect my question to you as being that\nTheir bus said black voters matter do you think that is just an analogy for their democratic voters because you know now in days most black people they sway towards the Democratic party what do you think\nI think it doesn't matter remember\nEven if you're saying black voters Latino voters however you want to contextualize that that is not in nature partisan none of that is part of it now we do understand that Ninety plus percent of black folks will likely vote democratic we understand that right so we understand that\nBut when we're talking about rules and procedures from government Julian\nIt should be very clear here's what a violation is here's what a violation is not when you encourage black folks to vote that is not partisan there was nothing about that part of it\nFinal question who made the phone call\nA nationally initially the phone call according to the report from CBS forty six the phone call to the county government came from a person driving by the bus and they saw all of these seniors boarding\nAnd so a citizen of Jefferson County called the board of commission the board of commission got in touch with the county clerk and the county clerk called the senior center and said shut it\nDown so that seemed like a ... a lot of effort to place in order to get this nation right All right for zero point

[noise] ah sorry about that so I'm All right you okay yeah I guess [laughter]\nNot that they are doing some are off and research you know on some of these right wing station and a ... it's crazy or you know it's obvious\nThe Republican Party the Republican ashes you know they're sending their obviously sitting and talking points to all these talk show host\nUm and then the colors to call in the\nThe obvious or lack of information of the the believes in conspiracy theories\nOr\nThe lack of ability to connect the dots it ... and you hear it when you hit the party will call man I mean it's it's really scary I mean if you think about\nThere's millions of these people they get all their information from Sean Hannity from Fox News from Breitbart read it a right wing radio they can't see through the fog you know you do you do a C. programming\nWhere do you say it I feel like a walking by like a wounded animal you know you almost feel sorry for them or what do you think we should there needs to be like a hotline to for the programming for these\n[laughter] you don't want to know one of the things you learn about\nYou think we should there needs to be like a hotline sit for the programming for these\nFolks [laughter] you know one one of the things you learn about deep programming an ID program gang members\nIs that there has to be some level of\nHonesty about their position in the indoctrination process\nIf they're not able to be honest at least somewhat that there are some\nInconsistencies at least or hypocrisy at best then it's very difficult\nFor you to the program anybody from a set belief pattern but if you can help\nShowed them the areas that do not add up it makes the process much more easier and so how does that happen it depends on who the person using the level of indoctrination so it can't be a one size fits all\nEven continue with the process okay but we are there to educate them on what is a crime as you say rats yeah Chinese will be there also just so the listeners now um it's just to help them fill out the information\nGreen card once you have that and you've been in the country five years or more and you are married to a citizen of the United\nStates do have you have a green card yeah and in the country for five years you got you a little salt sums up the right yes that's American yes you can qualify for us it is yes even under not let me tell you the pushback yes even under this current administration\nWell that's where the attorneys come in because okay I can get quite sticky has you know a lot has changed on the disembodied ... and things that we've taken for granted\nWe are now having to be cautious and this is where the council comes in I Will say this when I was a student at a criminal or injured in New York City John Jay College of criminal justice\nI remember telling my mother that I couldn't get grants because I was what not a citizen while I was a permanent residents educated my mom on becoming a citizen and of course I got grants I've got a college work study program I benefited\nFrom knowing that my mother had qualified I had qualified but we were just going our daily lives pain into a system not realizing that we should ... recoup those benefits\nWe have a number of students at ... university who are a legal residents yes some of them are on student visas and more to learn my first semester as a professor Beck and twenty sixteen\nIs that none of them can qualify for financial aid and all of them were paying gotta ...\nIsn't that amazing yeah because of the things I'm just around reiterate in the audience so I think this is also and so you know this continues on it's not just tomorrow they can reach out to me and I will get them in contact with council because we do have some some situations that um you know we didn't really pay attention to\nOf course this administration is it's kind of having a lot of things to make us wonder um and scare many of us and I think we need not to be scared um we still have a hopefully a democracy that protects us hopefully\nWhen we got from real attorneys will at some ... right yes and that you're about what they're doing I met some of these lawyers before what should people bring well\nIt's a it's a ... ton of information obviously the green card taxes passports Social Security card because here's well here's the Mets were shot people believe because you're a permanent resident you don't have these things you do have your Social Security and your\nKids you're paying taxes and that's\nThe that's the one thing that I think is the misconception of this process and of course I'm there's and you must have noticed things on here but they can call me here's the other thing\nBecause they received public assistance they seem to think\nOh we won't get qualify you wouldn't be qualified but guess what it is one of the requirements you hearing that while the tire you okay you see all of this is what accessing information and
