political vote itself\nUm will you see a playing a game no excuses the ballot too small hill you blow it up and put it on line so we can read it and do we get to do because it's just a no time to make noise skew does ... early voted\nA woods day Wednesday Monday and so I Will make sure that day I have my car ready to take whoever we want to go vote be available up until the time I come in

it down those two up those websites oh and because we want people to go and I want to come out to these events ... that's one thing to be registered to vote\nThat's something else to be informed on what you voting for death and so what the delta is doing is telling you what's on the ballot and who's on the ballot and they're very non partisan way 'til the vote one over ... over the other\nThey're simply providing the information for you to receive it and so if people listening and uh they need to know the website for your chapter give it again really slowly\nOh it's um just go

better record in the regular season and it may may make sense to me that they try something\nNorth of that the if they can uh\nMaybe change the equation in some fundamental way that makes them a little better than they would otherwise be on paper\nWhat is the philosophy behind that not using a starting pitcher deep into game like say what we got from Clinton cursed shock or even getting review in the first series for the Dodgers not having a quality star instead piecing together a few innings here in a few innings there\nWell the the the essential explanation is that with the

the Astros or the Dodgers are um\n[noise] you're starting pitcher typically isn't going to be as good in the fourth or fifth inning as an average relief pitcher would be so and that's it's taking a long time\nObviously weren't trying to compete financially um the season and their fans who gave up on them or at least in the short term I Do think that\nYou can have a four percent drop year after

with him in person right below bride and never even spoken to us while they're in person\nBut the Texans desperately needed a quarterback and so they offered him a boat load more money than what the Denver Broncos did\nAnd and to me I'm Sorry but said to me four or five million dollars is actually a boatload more money and so here's off while they're still kicking around in the NFL he's gone from Houston to Cleveland back\nTo Denver now he's in Miami the main feel earning a paycheck I I Will compare him to a cockroach but so far you can't come you can't kill his NFL career\nAnd that was going to start again after I intend to heal there has to be some concern according to gaze anything that has to do with pocket movement fought for things like that\nHe can do and I quote he just can't

coaches in the past Nobel checking the patriots come to mind\nOf course teams and coaches want to keep their injuries to themselves as long as possible but the NFL mandates that they are honest and open at specific points during the week about the guys who were injured and about what the injuries are this is not\nHockey where you can say upper body or lower body and I suspect that it has a lot to do with the betting lines but I mean what do I do\nMaybe it's about the competitive playing field either way there isn't a ton of information about Ryan tannahill and it might just see because

game was bottom of the fifth inning\nThere was a runner on third base Chris Taylor\nAnd it looks like\nThere's this point the Dodgers were trailing one to nothing\nAnd it looks like if they couldn't\nGet that run across they were going to pinch hit for Clinton gr Shaw understanding time is up the essence here we have to get to try and run even if it means pulling our pitcher who was in a group\n\nThough right before ... shots at bat\nAustin bar and had a seeing eye single hit the mound it kinda bounded up the middle\nAnd Taylor scores game is tied and crochet then goes in bats for himself and not only does he pitch in the sex but he pitches in the seventh\nAnd he allows just one run on three hits and a couple of walks but he has nine strike out in the seven innings soul qualities sharper Clayton and exactly what the Dodgers needed after Thirteen\nWalks but he has nine strike outs in the seven innings soul qualities sharper Clayton and exactly what the Dodgers needed after Thirteen getting a fair in which they use every last one of their relievers the night before\nAnd that that victory for Clinton curse shock put the Dodgers within one game of now returning to the fall classic where to still seeking redemption\nWasn't as easy maybe it was last year to get to this point and I'm really real some work to do to turn it off your back but I'm sure she would have

me so I could check it out\nBut strangely enough it'll be the same starter for the brewers in game sex as it was in game\nFive weighed Miley barely had a chance to stretch out he throws five pitches he walks one batter and then he gets pulled now\nI think he was probably pulled both for credit counseling tended because there were backed by them but they were the pitching change with no runs no [laughter]\nAnd one batter down that's it went down by down I just mean one one a be into the game\nSo he was probably pulled earlier than he was going to be but Craig council says I mean we're always planning to have him go back to back\nSo we're going to do all along the way it is going to pitch getting sick [noise] you know we we as soon as we went down three one we were considering haven't

becomes a it's always some drama you know in fact checker when black folks you know white folks don't get treated like they're not only white folks don't get treated like that\nBut it's just crazy man yeah things are so divided and your name and I look at the age or doctors louder and I think a scale\nThat one day your caller called in about Trayvon Martin yeah when we start losing people everyday set up a change of voters and they you know they terrorists to vote but not only that they kill us before we can even get a chance to vote\nYes those are both left and right because people don't take it seriously you know get out the vote\nAnd\nYou know kind of some I think God for having a Harry Truman I thank God had an uncle or Martin Luther king yeah I think God the habit of color Malcolm X. you know so ... agenda a truce\nSay they've been getting rare man to fish but you know doing this crap on purpose and guess what are we going to fight you got to stand up and fight it felt right governmental anything that they understand\nWhat I hear you saying is is that we got to move out of the defensive posture and become offensive in ... and you know and actually\nThe let's let's let's just stay with that that whole idea and look at what would those senior citizens were doing in response to black votes matter they were doing something they were they were being offensive\nAnd [laughter] they ... fin did the powers that be in Jefferson County and so would they be was on a leash\nOr the the power ...\nFear and intimidation and introduced that into the into the into the situation and so uh and of course you know it triggered it triggered thoughts and memories in the minds of the seniors who were who were tempted by boat\nOr read it it's it's all it's it's a psychological warfare psychological yeah it's like a lot of warfare all get out to vote you know let's get hurt\nRight here on the line Bob ... for Enron and down on the ... and that that's I hate man but it's true yeah I just wanted to tell you why for me bothering you know I ... and white folks\nWho don't like it would they need to do is start practicing justice and stuff and stop colluding with those who practice injustice and then we wouldn't have to speak in generalities but as long as ... as long as the one group of them is doing evil in other sit back and watch and then everybody\nA deserves indicting and I think if I recall yeah\nMhm for for a night\nWhen we do with the ... oval sit back and watching the everybody deserves indicting bronco ... yeah ... ... for the man to consume zero three minute we're supposed to\nBe some blasts look to your doctor block same black to\nYes and I tell you desperate times call for desperate measures\n... ... where we're at ... ... yeah man\nI'm not only attacking refrigerators attacking out elderly for voting they're attacking our women our children I'm thinking about the twelve year old that got arrested in ... county\n... ... you know that is why we have one or two reactions with blacks out here\nMan we've internalized all this struggle\nThat we see even whites I'm a white woman it made it to me yesterday she say you know campus trying to take away black people's votes like we don't know that it's been in the\nNational spotlight right he was\nTrying to get my attention and let me know that she's a Democrat and she's voting a certain way\nAnd so you know when you tell\nWould you do a little bit of a mood I'll be like you hear about a new national national story is\nOn CNN and MSNBC all the\nNetworks are talking about it mhm\nSo anyway we as black out a notice to reaction when it comes down to this either like yourself and myself when it happened we get angry and it makes us want to vote even more\nAnd they don't realize that they're stirring up the bees nest\n... when they do that but\nOther blacks I noticed they they go in words and become reclusive and so I'm not going to participate in this stuff I'm scared I don't want to pick up the good white folks as you say it\nYou know uncle Robert whoever\nSo psychological warfare is definitely at hand today is in our faces light pass and we need to do something about it you know Jefferson\nCounty is not the only place in rural Georgia I mean remember Randolph county where they try to close the majority of the voting places\nDown here that just happened the other day you're ... ...\nYeah so we need to just like Alabama and the black women got together and rallied I said I'm getting out there to the polls\nWe gotta keep it up and I think I could also black people I Believe is working because they shut down the the voting machines on Monday it was such long lines already\nMhm and even my reading glasses you read a prescription bottle you

E. L. C. those are nonpartisan organization but what if you are a member of the Democratic party do you then make those nonpartisan organization part of of course not that's not how this works\nFor zero for it not to to seven zero three and a response back\nThe government Jefferson County data admit that the rule there is no actual statute there's no law there is no policy there is no protocol they say it's an unwritten rule you know unwritten rule means it means you made it up that's what it means they'll Julian\nI personally feel awful for the senior citizens because how often do they get an opportunity to leave yeah the facility\nAnd I'm sure that's why they were so excited just because they had that one was the real excitement how does this there was a group\nSetting people were dancing it's an opportunity to fellowship beyond the walls of their living environment and they were doing something that they believed in\nDefinitely and I mean that that's unfortunate I feel bad for the senior citizens that are in that aspect my question to you as being that\nTheir bus said black voters matter do you think that is just an analogy for their democratic voters because you know nowadays most black people they sway towards the Democratic party what do you think\nI think it doesn't matter remember\nEven if you're saying black voters Latino voters however you want to conceptualize that that is not in nature partisan none of that is part of it now we do understand that Ninety plus percent of black folks will likely vote democratic we understand that right so we understand that\nBut when we're talking about rules and procedures from government Julian\nIt should be very clear here's what a violation is here's what a violation is not when you encourage black folks the vote that is not partisan there was nothing about that part of it\nFinal question who made the phone call a nationally initially the phone call according to the report from CBS forty six the phone call to the county government came from a person driving by the bus\nThey saw all of the seniors boarding and so a citizen of Jefferson County called the board of commission the board of commission got in touch with the county clerk and the county clerk called the senior center and said shut it down\nSo that seemed like a a a a lot of effort to place in order to get this thing right All right for zero point not to to seven zero three oh let's go to Barnes rolling out magazine rolling out dot com mo what ...\nWhat up after Richard you know um are ... there were two things I Want to talk about what you're just first talked about the situation with the children and I sit through a video from the community of Robert Harris gotta go gotta go [laughter] so but with the situation yesterday\nOh shoot ... on Monday we're seeing this epidemic of white people calling service which is usually ... or some other organization with the hopes of getting you fired in a sense I mean this case when they call nine one one\nWhich is usually ... or some other organization with the hopes of getting you fired in that sense I mean this case when they call nine one one on black folks hope of getting you kill 'em and you know we're seeing is for a while the south throughout the country that actually makes no sense\nThe fact that someone can call and originally when I wrote on this story also uh when I when it came out and everything I'm ... originally Jefferson County a commission said no one I called their office but now they're saying that someone did call her office and\nThey did but you know speak to the senior citizen have been a ... a living ... it's called ... and I'm issue that so there's this complicity that's going on this just Georgia to step in and we have to decide whether or not we want to dance\nWith this right now the Republican Party is fighting at twelve different states\nI'm over voter issues and everything else\nAnd we have to look at the whole arc of this and why this is being done now\nIt's being done now because there's a conservative majority on the Supreme Court capital is on the court\nAnd I guarantee you dollars ... that's an old term\nThat we're going to see the ... election\nThe results wind up with the Supreme Court with a conservative court deciding on what is legal and not legal in the state of Georgia and regards to this particular election because last week\nI'm an Asian American advocate group is a file the lawsuit against Harvard University based on her decision to limit Asians coming into the school\nUm and because of that is a direct challenge to affirmative action so now once again we have capital on a court where affirmative action is coming up so we see affirmative action voting rights\nAnd next thing you know on they're already talking about ... wait so we're seeing a serious shipped 'em and a possible overturning of millennials you know who have had the benefit\nOf the struggles of people in the legal challenges are the only through have no idea what's getting ready to happen because the illusion that they are still equal under the law but as you just said an unwritten law\nThese people here in Georgia are making these unwritten laws that are going to have to be decided eventually by the Supreme Court\nIt's a very scary situation to me\nReally interesting Ron that procedure called and your perspective something to think about that you can I say one more yeah go ahead you\nOwe your child molestation issues you know we have the issue with Justin Crawford uh the Atlanta Falcons reject caught molesting\nA family member be additional charges incest was pop on him\nA with that and then we have the Mississippi grandmother who big her top you know who raped her granddaughter in the opposite you know we have issues with our community regarding our children our smallest ones that can't beat the fed and um what do you do women situate it it it we we kind of block it out of her mind\nNo it can't be happening you can't be yes I'm not going to click on that story but it's happening with in our community throughout the nation and it has to be addressed\nWell saying thank you brought up resent you call your

protected under the constitution of the state of Georgia\nI bet you really gotta ask yourself that question and that's the reason why I don't I don't think it is as strategic I think he's flying by the seat of his pants I think they're reactionary I think he is feeding off the energy and I do believe just as he has said I Do believe he enjoys\nConflict he likes conflict and that is okay because brother the part\nThat makes ... great too was is also the part that makes crime they questionable to us as well\nYeah that's true so you think it's a ...\nWhen we know that I'd be that's [laughter] everybody debatable yeah of course he's not ...\nYeah yeah I I just thought it was a ... who my job and and all these other brothers and GI coming out I understand they have their stance to you know at the end of the day is an entertainer man it's entertaining\nBut he's an employer season influence there and you got to say something even if you figure out a way to separate the person from the worse the person they're saying if that's fine but remember you're offering this up to the public you argue influences and somebody's going to say something\nThat's true yeah they started to your piece on your brother thank you for your call it for\nZero for eight nine to two seven zero three let's go to Todd calling from his mother's a base a base Mitt\nYeah we're going to make an attempt to talk to these one of the senior citizens it got pulled off the bus\nYou know we already have that happen to CBS forty six ... pick our political reporter he's the one who broke the story and I remember talking to her\nYou know we already have that happen again CBS ... bonded your pick our political reporter he's the one who broke this story and I remember talking to her while she was in Germany the town of Jefferson County is is it an area\nI laughed because I've been to Jefferson County before where there's no cell phone reception in a in a large part of the town and so when she did the story she actually had to leave Jefferson County just to transmit the signal back to the\nAtlanta news station but she already has a few of the individuals are on record directly so I'm I'm a piggy back on that but this is this was her story\nAnd uh she's going to come out with more information as we\nWere in the event that you choose not to talk to one of the senior citizens it will be interesting if you can bring it on the air one of the county officials that were involved and having them\nThey didn't want to talk of the day off I I'm convinced they will not say anything other than the written statement they released\nHook up just putting it out there is a possibility for good broadcast in reference to the the guy that killed him so I\nI'm not against people killing themselves in general that's the whole body if you're ... you should be able to make decisions on what to do with it but as it applies to this particular case it would have been better if he left the audio video recording explained to those kids prior before he\nYou know before he made his decision to kill himself a course which is the only time he could have done it and explain to them you know how wrong it was what he did so that they don't have to wrestle with his much guilt as they may end up wrestling with the kids who have experienced that sometimes do\nYeah it is really saying that some of these kids may feel guilty right that he's dead now because of what he did to them\nRight and we had the technology of audio and video now it would be better than a letter and I I Hope and wish that he had done that for him if he truly express remorse whatever money it was talking about dividing he may she was already gotten to them prior to his death\nSo that there's no discrepancy about who when and how much separate\nI work because he brought it up about um this is it occurred to me that you guys are still working on the restaurant how long how far along are you which restaurant\nYou know I had to abandon that location and let me tell you why the location on metropolitan fits right in front of a waterway\nThat waterway looks deal if you just go to the back of the property you say wow there's a little water back here but the water's actually classify by the state of Georgia as running water even though you don't see anything running\nAll running water is regulated by the state of Georgia which means there's a different level of environmental protection and Burr rock receipt and also money needed in order to build demolish do whatever you need to do\nAnd because of that the cost to do that level of renovation\nAnd that level of environmental renovation was just cost prohibitive for me and so we're looking at another spot near the east Atlanta area and I make sure you stay updated on it\nYou gotta you gotta opening day that you kind of looking at having done have it all done by\nI Would feel more comfortable telling you once I get some other things on but we're looking at a
