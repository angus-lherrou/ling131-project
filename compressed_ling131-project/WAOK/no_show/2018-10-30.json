fact he was on the third play so he might have sat for the for the day he may not have started the game which means they didn't play the first play\nBut it's been pretty darned quickly or he hasn't

in New directions ... is the new direction that quarterback gonna work for them for a while with all the changes they've had their sometimes that's almost as much fun is on the field stopped it's never\nAs much wider at least not for me but some people get just as motivated by crazed fired into it\nAh I think there are a lot of people out there that believe they could manage a baseball team coach or a football team be a general manager and the NBA or the NHL or they know vote well they're not going to go out and score forty goals or put up a fourteen threes\nAnd or hit four hundred but I Will be a man you're going to be generous so people there are some people actually prefer to talk about and language over the court stuff\nWe will do a mixture of both tonight\nUh because the baseball season is done it's finished the world series champions aren't once again the Boston Red Sox therefore\nThis millennium which is pretty damn impressive it all of the teams have been different the red Sox won the world series in two thousand for two thousand seven a bunch of players who are on both teams but there was a difference between those two teams as well\nTwo thousand Thirteen six years between World Series championships there are and then and now another one here in two thousand eighty five years between this one so there were four separate teams\nThey weren't back to back teams they weren't teams that were winning a ... that had a ton of players that were on ONE Championship team and came back and won that again that tells you a little about the organizational strength that they have\nOne guy who I Do know was there for four World Series was just the past and the other which is McDonald's senior uh my father joined the red Sox as a scout in two thousand and for the first World Series that they want in Ninety plus years ah\nAnd has been working for them ever since so he's got his two thousand seven World Series ring and his two thousand Thirteen World Series rang and he'll be getting his fourth\nThe red Sox fixed overall World Series championship Rick congratulations to the old man a joke senior um but they are just\nAnd here's the thing that uh uh uh in addition to above and beyond a in a different light the reason why I was rooting for the red Sox the main reason was yet when my old man see him getting all the championship ring I got some Red Sox buddies and I was rooting for them to\nUm but I think the red Sox maybe more than any other team in baseball exemplify the merging of old school new school and when I say old school new school I'm Talking about scout derived\nAs compared to analytics or baseball is incorporating analytics\nSchool I'm Talking about scout derived as compared to analytics\nA baseball is incorporating analytics absolutely everywhere they crunched numbers they use that to decide how good a player is what direction to go with certain players and handle player differently you know like\nA and there are some that I think cab missed out on the fact that nothing nothing served as well as being able to see a play or play you can check spreadsheets you can see spray charts you can do all that ... watching a player play with a trained I\nStill is for me the best way to our value ate a player information is good\nThose who turn their nose up at analytics are missing the point you couldn't figure things out and then that gives you an advantage as to what to look for when you're watching the player\nBut they should go hand in hand\nIt should be melting and it's one of these topics I button topics a lightning rod topics that you either have to be new school or old school you have to choose never the too shall meet\nThat you have to look at it one way or the other I don't I think there is a compromised position and the Boston Red Sox show you this year but that's the best way to do it\nNot for holding to data sheets and analytics but not be praying them either and saying we're just going to do this I was

that theme [noise]\nGive us some inside on the NFL trade deadline is a guy who dealt with them for years and is executive capacities any NFL he's not sharing wisdom with all on the NFL Network and you're going to share a little bit with us over the next couple of minutes here on CBS Sports radio we try to catch ... for joining us\nJohnny Mack here in New York have you been a good evening how're you doing good ... your coming on board or your days as an NFL exact\nThe trade deadline was a little earlier in New York shoot go you go back to September when he didn't even ever feel yet for what your team was in the NFL is wisely pushed it back\nOr who was the guy who put the impetus to pushing it back and pushing them back and actually making it a more reasonable a spot in the NFL calendar for teams to actually be aggressive and try and do something\nWell it happened after I had left early uh so I couldn't tell you the person I can tell you what happened when I was in the league um it was after the six weeks it was in October um I made a proposal to move it to a December\nUm December first or milk similar to a baseball has um I'm not completely sure of the baseball rules but I Know they do have a trade deadline yup that um that's later than ours and get three votes for it that was it [laughter] that making was they didn't and I disagree with they didn't want change\nThat um that's later than ours and we've got three votes for it and that was it [laughter] that making was they didn't and I disagree with they didn't want teams are taking it\nA you know dumping players are in trays or they felt that you know it might take advantage of other teams wise is first of all you're not given credit for intelligence okay you have a team that's a a sitting there on the edge and going for the playoffs and they can pick up a player that can put them in the play offs\nAlert fans are going to be excited about that the team that gets rid of the players play the team's going to be happy because they just dumps them salary maybe for the future and or maybe they get something for a team that you know they're totally out of it in December okay they have no chance to win so\nTo me uh I took that approach to the thing is couldn't get any support for it the big thing is worrying about teams\nTanking it um that's been the prevailing\nOpinion of why not to do it I didn't agree with that\nAnd that's what it is a fine line there because I see where those who felt that way do you don't want to be packing but you also want to give the teams that chance they don't ... to get a grandson and make a move I think they falling into a pretty good spot habit basically midway through the season where it is right now\nIt's better now than it was I think it even be better if you buy print later\nUsed here by December ... that John I might go December for some things that clearly defined your ... in it or you're not in it at that point in time\nUnderstand ah I'd so tomorrow is the deadline gotta get done by four pm eastern we've had a couple of deals over the last couple of weeks a and brought nothing really major basically since ...\nMac or there are a whole bunch of teams if you look at the standings they can make the argument for being in it there's only a handful that are stone cold buried and or even a team like the rams were nine you know supposedly are looking to continue to upgrade do you think we're gonna have a busy day them all\nThat it's hard to say I ah you know obviously there's been some guys are pointed out there for example the American um is with the\nUh the area is a mess with the Broncos uh the Broncos and so you might have somebody that you know goes after him as a last minute I I think you you get at the end and you might get half a season adamant but you know the ... a rare is declining at this point in time so it's always hard to say how much action you're going to get\nA fair enough what is the toughest thing about getting a guy quote unquote up to speed if he's joining a team in the middle of the season\nA kind of depends on the position if you look over the past Russia or you can get them on the field right away a on a ...\nA from that and you should be able to you don't there's something wrong with you that you're talking about a receiver depends on the system I'm you know the lime it depends on the system so um you just have to scale it back to what he can handle on the reps you put them in their fourth\nAnd then I add that I Know that's kind of a big question but that's really the answer so it's going to depend on the player in the scheme or as to how much he can play but you have to keep that in mind when you bring them in a immediate impact sometimes don't happen\nOnce the top of his position to try and had someone in season to get them up to speed in time to be able to help you make a plan to push\n... quarterback now there's been people have played in a week uh I Know that's happened uh but you they'll usually very smart play is um keep it simple or maybe with a good team\nOr they'll make them look good because they can make plays with the ball\nUm despite the in the simplicity of the office but good quarterback would have to be that the toughest one\nIt easier to plug in just\nMake plays with the ball um despite the in the simplicity of the office but good quarterback would have to be that the toughest one\nIs it easier to plug in just a comparing these two and I know again my position would change I could just send about a pass rush or just ... years back and go but comparing off in the defense which do you think it's and when you are as an executive making trade trying to contemplate how quickly you can get 'em in there which\nDo you think it was just easier to get an authentic guy up to speed or defensive guy\nI I Would think it would be a defensive guy um because the office of guy you know the line that can be very complicated depending upon what you're doing the receivers that can be complicated we talked about quarterback\nA running back depends on blitz protections um whereas in defense of you know you're reacting to things are in a sense but you're also being aggressive to 'em for example if you're playing a corner and its manned man\nI'm you know the basically man the man is going to be man the man I'm oversimplifying it um\nBut it's a little bit maybe a simpler than if you're running a receiver and you're trying to put the whole out free and he's got to be coverages reacted just Roche\nI Would tend to agree little easier on the defensive side I get your reaction to the biggest trade last week and it played the cowboys favorite that they were sitting on nearby wheat\nGives them almost to four weeks to get a Mari Cooper up to speed\nA high draft pick from just a couple of years ago is it working with the raiders they change out their coach they decided to go in another direction I still think he's a very talented players got a ton of 'em upside a first round pick has a pretty good price to pay though uh who got the better of that trade the cowboys and the raiders in your mind\nWell first of all I like him I Would have done the deal\nOK I'm kind of a mystery to me why the production is falling off I think part of it was the office a year ago I think part of it could be the often this year\nOr could be that there are car has struggled early in the air replays best game of the year probably yesterday [laughter] me coming off the by and maybe they changed things to help them with that I'm\nSo right now I like what Dallas has affected gives Dallas a\nPotentially a shot and you want to get them a going towards the playoffs\nOr Oakland has to do something with the pet\n'em and you know time will tell if they can do that are now I Know people will say well is not a simple answer shortage um anybody could give that answer but I like ooh that's number one number two I Would have done the deal number three group has got to prove we can pick layers he has been proven it yet\nAnd let me ask you about that and uh you mentioned car had one of his better getting maybe best game deer yesterday still not good enough for the raiders to find a way to when they're struggling struggling mightily and little time to come back after a decade away or is he has the game pass John ... by wire the raiders as bad as they are\nWell we'll know more next year when Joe Gibbs came back after being out the illusion record is for ship 'em because I made a lot of changes in the off season um after that first year I went to the playoffs in the second is so\nWe'll see how grew to adjust at the one as far as making personnel decisions schemes et cetera um rodents history has been to be a guy that show up a can be consistent and you

touched on yesterday on CBS portrayed on my Sunday get together or the Los Angeles rams are eight no\nAll apology to Kansas City chiefs fans out there patriot fans are are puffing their chest out after Darrow win over buffalo right now the St plant dynamite football they got major revenge against the Vikings yesterday going into a Minnesota and beating them after losing the way they did\nIn the NFL NFC division of playoffs last year um\n... have been the best team in football if you want to debate it with me get on my phone's a five to one to four to seven they are the only undefeated team and they beat a a Packer team came into their House yesterday\nTook the lead and the fourth quarter got to feel that they needed to get the lead then forced to turn over on the kickoff there after they get the ball out I'm Aaron Rodgers hands because you had the feeling that Rogers\nCould go down a field and beat them given the chance with a a minute and change the play or so for me the rams have been the best team in football bar none numeral oh no\nBut in watching the first half of the game before I had to come in here and do the show a would act on CBS Sports radio I'm listening to the broadcast\nSounded like a pack a home and get it really did so I check a couple of people on Twitter that I Know we had a stringer at the game when I was they would act do an eye on football and the the broadcasting confirmed yeah about fifty to sixty percent of the fans in the stadium Packer fans\nNow it's not a drive from Green Bay okay you got to get on a plane\nFrom Green Bay to go out to LA ah now LA's not a bad place to go if you're going to take a road trip to go watch team play might as well go to Hollywood getting some good weather out there in sunny Southern California so I don't blame the Packer fans\nMourn blaming the LA football fans\nYou go to decades without any football the NFL gives you not one team but two teams you don't even have to you know forced to pick what you got a choice of two and in LA right now they don't support either the rams or the chargers now they both have funky\nStadiums that building a brand new said was going to be open at a couple of years but he said a yard they'll share it with the chargers um the charges are playing in a soccer stadium that only holds thirty thousand it doesn't really have a football field to at\nThe coliseum as where the rams are playing and the coliseum was better days are in their rearview mirror but the U.S the fans don't seem to have a problem packing out of house and screaming and yelling and getting craze\nFor the Trojans but the rams fans do I need to get to the bottom of why the football fan in Los Angeles has not adopted either they're two teams and the one that I think is worse is the rams cause\nThe football fan in Los Angeles has not adopted either they're two teams and the one that I think is worse is the rams 'cause oh by the way the rams advance team and only\nCharge pretty damn good it right on came city seals out there and he AMC west\nI thought they were little overrated coming into the season they build up their end of the bargain will see on the second half goes but season ends today they're a playoff team and the rams that surely a playoff team\nYet neither one of them is get the backing of the LA fan I Want to get to the bottom of it so I asked a my producers mafia and ... and a car with kid to see if they had a good LA guy\nThat covers the national football league ... Los Angeles talk about both to talk about the fans and like and they said Joe curly who covers the rams any NFL for the Ventura County star is real good for us out of mind before I don't know I've ever talked to a job before we're going to punch him up and talk football in LA\nWhat's the deal out their folks why on the rams getting traction I don't know what more are you going to ask them to do their undefeated all they do is when I got some of the most exciting players in the national book boy I'm ... and the bands and yet ... teams walk in and take over their building\nAnd have more than half the house and you can't tell you the home team is we'll get to the bottom of it next hour choke currently have you on TALK LA football now we can hit me up telephone lines open the rest of this hour eight five five to one to four to seven might from Orlando wants taught football but on the collegiate level oh Mike\nHow you doing Joe you\nI'm doing just fine hey I Want it to really talk about uh the Florida State Seminoles on an earlier program there was a discussion is which team is underperforming more whether it was Nebraska or or Florida State and uh so besides being aggravated about the giants the jets the next\nUh now I can get aggravated about the Seminoles as well so I'm really bad really bad season so far you know new head coach\nTrying to rebuild but they have exactly the same problems as the giants do terrible offensive line short of no no heart a lot of penalties I mean they got a crane by Clemson here on on Saturday matching the the worse loss and\nActually worse on lost and Florida State history but matching a point loss as as being the worst than there are ... in their history I don't know if you have any opinions on\nOn the Seminoles of what they can do to try to turn it around or I Would certainly like to\nYeah you ... the first things first\nYes I think they're even more under achieving Nebraska because granted or you're getting across to come in you that the success that he had a central Florida a great story line and homeboy going home you're rooting for 'em and you've thought maybe ah they could a ... a strike Bali\nIron was hide don't take time that's been proven and wild Nebraska is probably going to have a lesser record at the end of the season I didn't expect him to go in there and compete for a conference title in your number one\nOh I expect we'll tag or to go in there and a half Florida State in the mix for the ACC title I didn't think they were going to beat clients and uh but I truly believe that they could be competitive and they're not\nSo ... it it all comes down to what your pre season expectations were and then you decide which is the bigger disappointment I'm with you if you say Florida State and tiger has not fit bear I even know Nebraska's struggled mightily I'm they're going to give frost a ton of time\nFlorida State and tiger has not fit there are even though Nebraska struggles mightily I'm they're going to get frost a ton of time there and I guess they have to give tag or at a ton of time 'cause they gave him a mega contract\nThey'd have to eat a big chunk of change to blow am out but if there's ever been to see them that I go around Florida State or I say wow this coach has got to be on a hot seat it's this season and Willie ... if not for the size and length of his contract\nI think we'd be seriously talking about him not making it through the season\n[noise] no I totally agree and and quite frankly I think part of the problem with college football is if you don't perform you can't recruit\nWrite their name and former accomplishments only go so far and Florida State certainly got a great historical resume\nBut that doesn't always south to a Seventeen year old kid you're trying to get a a high school superstar athlete to come in here all he's going to do is go on CBS Sports dichotomy of while they're buried in the AC how bad where they last year\nThey don't go play for this team win if he's got other recruiting choices top flight programs that are making place for them they're going to have better ... seasons than\nFlorida State tiger is going to have to make his bones here in your number one ah in between your one year to and really go out and recruit the heck out of it and you're right he's recruiting upstream\nBecause of how tough a season the Seminoles bad I don't have any problem if you're going to say that the most under achieving team in college football this year\nOf an oath today not available in North Dakota\nProtecting data across modern

well the Packer fans travel certainly their national team a lot of people talking about how LA is kind of a um a tourist destination you can take your trip got out of the cold but really I mean\nThis is this is you know I'm you know the chickens coming home to roost with the NFL leaving this market for for Twenty years the rams specifically\nI mean you have a whole generation of fans who continued even though the NFL left them they did not leave the NFL be continued to the NFL fans I Know a lot of people around this neighborhood who have grown up you know Packer fans those those were you know Wisconsin\nThat the NFL fans I Know a lot of people around this neighborhood who have grown up ... you know Packer fans those those weren't you know Wisconsin born and bred people those weren't you know people you know traveling in um you know flying in those were Angelenos and that's kind of what the rams you know this is going to be a a long term thing\nUm you know kind of winning the hearts and minds of a a football fans in Los Angeles Bert ... when you look at the national teams there's tons of Steeler fan tons of the eagles fans patriots fans I mean that's what Los\nAngeles is you got you know twenty three million people in Southern California and um you know so many of them have a team and and you know the the rams have to go out and and when those people over the generations\nOther than going hey no which they don't know what more can the rams do to get those people turned right away your rights going to take time and yes there might be some with a chip on their shoulder in the NFL allow them to move to another ruining it drains without a team in that town for so long\nWhat ... what more can rammed and or the charges do\nWhy didn't the rams have done exactly what they can do which is to put a not just a winning product on the field but an entertaining\nProduct on the field I mean every time you go to the coliseum there's a a celebrity out the first game back against that see a couple of years ago they had LeBron James there and you know on a sign of things to come um you know they had you know there's a lot of uh you know entertainment people that\nYou know are part of the situation there that are coming back time and again becoming rams fans and um and really you know they they they have this um you know star studded roster that they've gone out and paid and they spent the money and they're winning games and really I I don't think there's much more you can ask them\nOther than you know it's going to take some time or you know for this younger generation to latch onto the rams and and you know I Believe me you see you're out at the grocery stores and you see the big kids pointing to their um [noise]\nYou know to their parents you know by me this tiger early Jersey by this Jared ... after the ... it it it starting already it's just going to take time to have an effect on the stadium\nI Hope that's the case I before I moved to Georgia one last ramp watching NFL pray deadline tomorrow for I Am eastern one o'clock out there for you guys on the west coast rams going to do anything\n[noise] uh well uh ... um today and this is a post game press or as as weekly presser\nUm you know was asked about the trade on line and you mentioned that there in the market for a a pass Russia um a lot of it that you know it will depend on you know how much they believe in a lot of these young kids they went out\nUh both neither drafted them or brought him and his EDS face some of them have been pretty productive and you know but they really do need depth that the position it's it's been really the position on defense of you know from the from the the summer that you know since they got rid of a rubber\nQuinn and counter bar when you know that that was the position where they they have needed\nA depth and um he was honesty said that may be a position that we're certainly position we're looking at um you know I think it's going to come down to the deal um and uh you know that that would be um you know the number one physician maybe that and\nA little bit of depth and beat up secondary would be a you know the main targets for ah for tomorrow for business\nJoe currently from the Ventura County start talking NFL with us here on pro on the bench we're on CBS Sports radio\nI uh if the rams are at least trying to make any inroads generic swimming and a pill a battle here\nIt's even worse for the chargers I guess the joined just like well we'll get some people would come up the highway and continue to be charger fan I take it they're not taking the northern commute for charger games\nSome people would come up the highway and continue to recharge your fans I take it they're not taking the northern commute for charger games\n[noise] yeah I think you know everything's gone about as well as it can you know could have gone for the rams you know maybe the flip side is is the chargers who you know I've said repeatedly you know since they came up here\nYou know they move just far enough away to kind of make everyone mad you know to to to upset their fan base and you know it's not like they move to a new market that didn't have a football team there it's not like they\nYou know I'm you know move somewhere that was you know thirsty for the chargers they they move just enough away you know kind of straddling the LA market straddling you know and and the San Diego market trying to get people to still\nI'm kind of hang on and and that has been kind of rough obviously but the the thing about the chargers that's similar to the rams as it's a competitive female and no one of the more talented teams\nAre in the NFL so certainly there's a lot for them to sell their it's just that I think their situation is just so much tougher you know I think it's under rated that the the rams did have this\nParts by five courts have album photosynthetic high managing the filter\nYou over ten

going to have to do some research and a good call appreciate your checking in or they played a bunch of games in Mexico over the years has the NFL gunned down in Mexico played there a bunch of times to try and globalized their game and it just so happens that the cheers game in Mexico\nIs chief in ramps and the rams may well be undefeated still at that point the chiefs of only lost one game it could be one of the games that here in the national football league\nBall to the teams have explosives ...\nSorry patriot fans the best stuff into the AFC is Kansas City now at the patriots the beat them fair and square out scored them earlier this year in Fox borrow but I think the ... more prolific than the Patriot act which\nBecame CD defense is not good uh they they have ... teams the rams can win games\nTwenty one Seventeen are not often but they will win games or without going a ton of points Kansas city's gonna give up twenty five twenty six twenty seven twenty eight points a game no matter what are their defense just isn't good enough so if you're a ramp fan it's worried about your defense hey you could be Kansas City the under over on that\nGame may get to sixty\nThe NFL never gets to sixty college football gets the sex the all the time but the NFL almost never gets to fix the un and under over\nI gotta believe Kansas City in LA are going to be above sixty on the under over when those two teams play now a Mexico's field is an a grade for both of them not artificial term I'm\nSo I'll I'll do some historic research and see what the scores of like been like in Mexico if they said that number to buy a may I may lean toward the under\nBut as of right now I think the numbers are going to be in it's going to be over sixty and the way these two teams play off and so I think it's probably going to be an over\nMatt from Cleveland's up on CBS portrayed Matty\nHow's it going good you good yeah\nI wanted to call a little bit in regards to the guy from Toronto is saying

[noise]\nIt was a stunning moment from we gain a nationally televised game I very competitive game between the rams and the Packers in Los Angeles I couldn't believe that China Montgomery take the ball out of the end zone as if to try to return it\nAnd get a field instead of taking a knee in the end zone\nLike he was supposed to we already know that we've been told that that would be instruction for the return or in this case Montgomery everything the and don't take any give the ball the Aaron Rodgers it impossible for Aaron Rodgers to lead\nAny type of a game winning drives\nHe doesn't have the ball so now\nRogers to lead to\nAny type of a game winning Dr\nHe doesn't have the football [laughter] so now on Monday there were all kinds of rumors about why time of gum or a brought that ball out of the end zone\nIs after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio thanks so much her tuning in a toys alert Tuesday Morning we're asking your reaction to this\nRevolving door of the coaches in Cleveland with tie Lou getting fired and then twenty four hours later both Jackson and taught Haley getting their walking papers\nOr by the brown and so you can find us on Twitter a law radio or on our Facebook page after hours with Amy Lawrence before I go into the report that have been out there and also let you hear from tie himself\nIt's absolutely in rages me that his family time and gum or his family is receiving threats over a freaking football game that's ridiculous\nAnd it makes me ashamed that I was so excited to be there in Green Bay and to participate in a preseason game and all the festivities and I praise the fans for their excitement there enthusiasm their energy in limbo for a preview even affair\nTonight and gum or he does a radio show in Monday Night and he told his wife and son they shouldn't throw a big show up excuse me they shouldn't show up because of threats that his family's receiving are you kidding me because he had a phone mistaken a football game\nYou know Aaron Rodgers makes mistakes too right Aaron Rodgers throws interceptions now and then he gets act he's ... he's been hurt\nYeah time I've done resembled he messed up he shouldn't have been bringing out ... out of the end zone it's still just football get a grip and get yourself\nIt's every ... every time this happens it blows me away 'cause I Can't believe that people\nHonestly treat their football like kids life or death it's not it's a game\nIt was after hours here on CBS Sports radio yeah he got the ball from going back to Aaron Rodgers but to be rated with insults and death threats\n\nTo another issue another major problem with social media is that people will do and say anything when they can be anonymous with no accountability\n\nFunny because none of those people who are sending him death threats has lived a perfect life but I guess your mistakes don't matter right only time a gum or a zoo because it's your ...\nNow the report that interested me is that he brought\nThe ball out of the end zone because he was upset at the Packers\nFor not using him on the most recent offensive drive\n\nSo Ty obviously is being asked over and over about why did you bring the ball out what happened what was the situation there were you upset about something\nAre you going to have to answer these questions for a while um but he swears that it's really easy to explain\nTo me though [laughter]\nI mean those those are the most [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[laughter] it was a little more [laughter]\nI get the return of all we're [noise] that that was [noise] so I don't know if I'm not going to\nDo a lot of that or [noise]\nFortunately for\nAll the services for the phone with us\nSo there's time a gum right and he says hey we wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't ... nobody be worried about the fact that I didn't take the knee in the end zone although if he defied a direct order then of course internally they would be upset about the fact that he did run the ball out when he was supposed to take me\nNow he says he wasn't sure where that ball is going to land\nThat instead of seeing Greg's or align kicked that ball out of the ... like he always does their line had just returned from the growing injury but this one looks shorter to him and\nSo I wasn't going to take me on the goal line he didn't think the ball was deep enough as it turned out it was what roughly two yards into the end zone and so he thought actually this might not even reached the end zone or it's going to be on the goal line and I'm going to have some room to run\nSo that to his perspective time a gum or explaining his decision the problem is several Packers players and assistant coaches have confirmed two different\nMembers of the media members of the the media to cover the Green Bay Packers that time was explicitly told not to run the ball out of the end zone\nBefore the kick off he was sent on the field that he was told you take any you do not run the ball at the end zone and you know Mike mccarthy he Hamdan heart a little bit remember after the game he said well he probably thought he could make a play you know we we'd like came to take the knee but he probably thought he could make a play\nHe even tried to cover for him maybe didn't understand the situation\nBut if you consider\nThat time was reportedly disgruntled before he went out there to catch the ball that he was upset about being pulled off the field\nDuring the Packers previous drive\nChristmas the salvation army is fighting to ensure that every child in

white man was in her family\nExactly this is well\nDr saw I didn't know you go get the\nThe deep deep\nAnd a little vacation or this ... this problem and I'm just waiting to hear how you go really break it down\n... oh dear this problem and I'm just waiting to hear how you go really breaking down\nAll right so appreciate your man appreciate your call because the man oh I mean my expertise is in the area of psychology clinical psychology pastoral care pastoral counseling and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\nUh and\nThey're in in the in the DSM which I did look at I didn't find or anything that correspond to directly to what this\nYounger sister is experiencing as I said the closest thing that I could find was is this thing a body body are just more fake disorder or ... and that's where one's body\nOr what part of one's body body is perceived to be flawed\nOr in this case is appears to have a younger sister her name is Trisha are perceived or skiing to be logged\nClosest like so for for a night to to some zero three me I mean ... is hope would counseling and therapy and are just coming to an education you know\nEducation and and intense therapy or what I call a deep country ... she needs to on learn some things and really learn some stuff that makes sense\nIn my view yeah but again it's going to require therapeutic individual just go back to the last I see oh brother jihad come on\nA regular flower hey brother John how you feel\nGood I don't know man holding on in their mind today\nYou know I did you see a picture of this young lady I did beautiful blue line on assisted musical system\nI mean a ... game what what is she could be considered dark skinned about about a conflict for maybe [laughter] maybe a little ... around between me and your complex right around entire well let\nLet me say this because I I haven't spent so that's what I needed to know mhm so she she talked about her skin and her looks being pretty\nYes right yes\nEven though her skin and her looks looked like me and you\nYes sir yes\nThey all died as Florida some people we just need to write off or just let them have sixteen years old and America TV alter that schools\n... another [noise]\nOh it's a story that's out about this morning row [noise] go forty five said he'd go you're going to sign an executive order\nEnding birthright citizenship for babies of knowing citizens\nOr quote you'll legal immigrants born\nOf course you know that's an action that will spark a constitutional battle because that's because the future provides for persons were born\nIn the U.S to be United States citizens so do is uh is just beginning\nWhat is ... and the rest of the Republicans he can't you know they will send the executive order and nobody will try to block it\nWow\nThey turning up the rhetoric that not only the rhetoric that turned up the action\nThey turned into the uh the and the ... will be ... you know phobic policies are um in full effect at this moment in the history of this country\nI think it's a poor man for us to pay attention to the slippery slope that we are already precariously walking upon\nThis is not good not this is you know we'll just go back to the conversation that we are really involved in the situation\nLittle sister by the name of treasure pretty little girl beautiful African American system um and she is suffering from some type of\nPsychological disorder that causes her to be caught up in the delusion that she\nIs white and I'm trying to wonder and figure out how that happens or is this year that her stepfather who died was white man\nAnd that he partially raised her along with her mother her mother is a black woman she seemed to be a a stable oh black woman but obviously will she married a white man\nBut that doesn't mean that she's unstable that just means that she that's the choice to see me\nUh but the impact that that had on her daughter is quite evident I think\nOh and I even think that there has to be some kind of trauma in their young ladies life besides the trauma that she described of a moving from one neighbor who was she described as white and and healthy and or to another neighborhood that was black and\nUh and for her a incompatible match for forty nine\nTo two seven zero three is the number let's go to the lions and talk about how it is that this young sister comfortable either she is ... wife she's otherwise healthy but psychologically\nA man who know the issue\nLet's go to the knives ICU rather Lucas won't answer you know\nAnd it could monitor the movement family in the morning so is my understanding is that this young lady the sixteen year though Yes sir would it be fair to say that she's in the amber either stay up to ... minutes cause racism is concerned you\nKnow I don't think that would be fair I think that she's passed the embryonic stage oh she should have a grasp on reality uh\nWhere she occupies where she takes of space you ought to know how that system works where she is at age sixty\nOkay one would think that some idealistic stand caught but she's not alone and the way that she sang\nNow how about you know that's that's clear that's true I Would imagine but or does it still doesn't mean that it is an element thinking\nCan we examine the totality of reality reality at least making the ... the white girl she won't get a shot in a while to get a shot in a little you know\nWhy are they you know I Want to give up being white though [laughter] she don't want to give up being white do rather\nShe don't want to get she don't want to give up the white but she was laying to hand she will go out in the sun when the sun tanning how it could turn up like\n... associate you all the galaxies and why are you going to want to be white and they won't everything except the burden of being black\nWell the next day [laughter] and that can just see land I saw you feel that they don't want to be black they'll come up by the rest of the results that must be but let me let me go safe now white man [noise]\nIt was open but let me let me go safe you know a white man that you know to the refrigerator I'm just going to tell you just let it is he is no new rules

I'm great how are you\nUh I I Am good you know there were two points um that I wanted to talk to you about a I guess I'll go with this whole thing with Trump you know I loved her and quite a will distraction knowing that it's not going to happen after our system of checks and balances but he kept talking\nAnd I'll Wait a minute let me push back on that I don't completely and wholeheartedly disagree with you\nOr the is obscene the debate about two very reasonable Harvard educator lawyers on CNN or into political pundits that always go head to head the students and the teacher okay I've seen them argue both sides of this that through executive order\nYou could actually interpret what what birth right citizenship is through\nSee them argue both sides of this that through executive order you can actually interpret what what bird right citizenship is through executive action one argued for another argued against the point is is an arguable debate\nIt is an arguable debate that will wind up in front of a conservative Supreme Court\nWhich will do the sided issue once again about checks and balances can the U.S president go ahead and and change something um you know an amendment without a constitutional convention or an act of Congress to change that particular amendment it will succeed at offering another distraction as this goes on\nBut it's not going to say but why do you say you simply offering and now the distraction\nI mean I think it's serious when the U.S president said and believes it and scholars will support him as well as his appointed Supreme Court when he says he ... in birthright citizenship I think that's real\nOkay and when we say he's going to end birthright citizenship immediately in our mind it comes to what your population what demographic it doesn't matter\nOh well I agree it doesn't matter but he doesn't talk about ending the maternity hotels but be you know department of homeland security are rated this year that was a Chinese wonder who pay up to eighty thousand dollars to come to this country a few weeks before there were deliver\nWell hey maybe they listen to\nThe bottom the bottom ... here's here's the ... simple reality the only reason why the five hundred and fifty plus thousand people were purged is because the U.S Supreme Court decided to rule\nThat we no longer needed a key provision of the voting rights act which was pretty clear that Bill Cosby eliminated the ... a a\nA division of that clause now we have a scenario where nine states now Republican states can change the voting rules without going through the department of justice\nI think you know it's easy to have all the states or none of the state had to go to ... I don't know why like California\nAnd the reason why the reason why a few of the states had to go through pre clearance is because they were the ones who had a history of violating the rights of black voters\n... when the Democrats no matter what the reason why these states had to go through pre clearance it's because of these states the was exhibiting actual act of discrimination against minority voters warmer pet\nFriends are hard to appreciate your calling Matt are you disappointed me I appreciate your point zero for that to to seven zero three during reel to reel is man a radio news to talk to their teenager W.

I wanted to go to do things real quick maybe three of the top ...\nQuote real fast they give them the conservative brother the politics so in the beginning you know what I mean\nI'm a\nAnd the one that is that's they talked about getting government out of this like\nA regulation regulation up there for a reason you know they always throw out getting rid of regulation\nYeah they are therefore protections typically\nThere for protection Ninety percent of the time yeah because somebody wanted to do something wrong and all expense just for the benefit of making money\nLet me in certain things and now let you get back to your point to not go ahead go ahead if there was no such thing as regulation of the job market yeah we would see more people dead yet we will see more people injured and we will see a three dollar minimum wage that's that's the reality of an unregulated market\nThat's correct so and then the founding fathers or so the so called founding fathers what brilliant in the sense that they understood that we needed to audit though because there's never been up to my knowledge of time and it's great when Republicans rules for Thirty years or forty years\nThough because there's never been out of out of my knowledge of time and it's great when Republicans rules for Thirty years or forty years and the Democrats root for thirty or forty year so the two party system allow for one particular takes us off course\nAnd another party normally come back in and bring us back alive and then something go get some people get to satisfy and decide to go off for the weekend then the other party comes back then that brings back a lot yourself and that's how that's how\nThe system basically works in America now as far as the government is concerned we are citizens of the United states of America where only read the dance of the state of George\nWill not citizens of the state of Georgia that's why the government seems to have more control over more influence on the lookout for its citizens here regardless of what the state to state for an hour the states have proven that they will do that power\nAnd and and and or hurt the medicine that belong to the government you understand what I'm saying yes so\nThat's how the system basically a a is broken out now you're there you go there on TV Now talking about\nThe Internet they want to put traps on the Internet now tell me the difference between somebody on the Internet than a racist statement and forty five Santa racist statement want as long I\nWant to live at was recording what's the difference if they're hitting that can influence you out can be not forty five say and what do you say influence you they'll fill word you understand what I'm saying correct so people are totally gross\nBut you know it's really hypocritical and I brought this out to ... to conservative yesterday we had a brief conversation and this conservative wanted to talk about the influence of rap music\nAnd I made a similar point did you just made I said if you believe rap music is so influential that it causes people to kill each other why do you not believe the president of the United states can ... rhetoric that will cost to say you go\nSay plain and simple plain and simple a right to the point yeah let's get another caller\nAnd your brother appreciated you call a Boise for not due to seven zero three getting real the real is man on radio news and talk Thirteen A.
