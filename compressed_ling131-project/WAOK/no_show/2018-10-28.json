P. over a hundred yards and the touchdown that means not a lot left for Chris Thompson and that would be just fine for Washington because they don't want him to get hurt any further than he already is\nAnd they will also the giants will also be without their top linebacker alec Ogletree so even more good news for Adrian Peterson the Sean McCoy do you think he's going to play\nSo he's been limited in practice for most of the week but he's still in the concussion protocol he needs to be cleared out of it before he can play\nThat game is Monday not tomorrow\nSo you just need to keep tabs on on his situation maybe we'll learn before kickoff tomorrow whether or not all players the other problem he's playing the patriots so it's not exactly a great day I'd have a great run defense I think they do I think they're on defense is a little bit better than than than you might think I Know that Jordan Howard scored on the last week\nBut he was held to a terrible rushing average to recall and had to do a lot of his damage catching passes out of the backfield and maybe it was from a court can do that but McCoy I don't think he's got a game this year with over ten fancy points so I'm not excited to start him I think he's a flex if he's healthy on Monday Night against knowing\nWhat are you excited about ... does not look like math rate is going to play yes I Am excited about him because\nAnd maintenance these kept increasing and we just didn't want to deal with it anymore it was not anything like what they showed us when we bought the timeshare\nTime shares are today it's like they're all cats you know really unless you talked to resort release we didn't release you from that time share legally and permanently painless rated by the BBC be a one hundred percent money back guarantee that our clients five star reviews tell the story you get this and\nFor the entire through thing was never anything hidden absolutely wonderful\nYou're the one that got away before twenty Nineteen maintenance fees or do call now for a free consultation\n... a thrill waves fifty nine fifty five eight eight eight thrill eight fifty nine fifty five four resort and released dot com they catch we release resort released eight eight eight three oh eight fifty nine fifty five eight eighty three oh eight fifty nine fifty five or resorting released dot com call now\nThe salvation army is on the ground across the state of Florida and the Gulf Coast serving those impacted by hurricane Michael with generous\nPublic support the salvation army can provide immediate relief with things like food hydration shelter hygiene kits and emotional and spiritual care\nTo contribute to the salvation army hurricane disaster relief effort visit Salvation Army dot listening give dot org one hundred percent of the designated gifts will be used in support of those affected by hurricane Michael\nAll authors page publishing is looking for authors have you\nOne hundred percent of the designated gifts will be used in support of those affected by hurricane Michael\nAttention all authors page publishing is looking for authors have you read a book and want to get it published page publishing we'll get your book into bookstores and for sale on line at Amazon apple I do in other outlets they handle all aspects\nOf the publishing process for you bringing ... publicity copyright an editing go eat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine now for your free author so they should get that seat hundred vines zero one thirty six eighty nine for your free author certainly should get\nAgain eight hundred bonds or one thirty six eighty nine\nOr you or someone you love one of the nearly one million Americans living with Parkinson's disease there is no known cure\nThat you have the power to help the teams that\nParticipating in a clinical trial the Michael J.

J. Howard\nBut he continues to get decent guarded and he can find the hands on and you know Jim is when some like Selena on his tight end\nAnd Jared Cook I think it's going to be the biggest benefactor\nOf the uh Oakland Raiders with a mark Cooper no longer on the team Cooper's gone targets are going to get spread out to everybody but I think jerk cook will see a lot more and it's not a bad match against Indianapolis they're starting safety's or banged up\nAll right and listen to people if you listen to our podcast you know I've already said this we've already set astronomer Allison

oh okay I'm In\nThat that ... ah was when my child Jordan track okay so my question is I have a a for a number to running back and see if people fight PR league and uh I have a yelled in Carson or a chart\nIf you don't like any of those options I could take a um either Aaron Joe or or um more or whatever is in\nMost are ready most or all I don't know if you have to start 'em but you drive your job yelled in for Aaron Jones right now\nPercent what I was about to say the jails and it's going to be limited to a passing downs role and that's not bad for the PR league like here's Greg\nBut I think Aaron Jones has more upside rest of the season and that's what you're looking for and ask you this week I think the best running back that you should go with is actually Chris Carson he doesn't catch the ball out but I like the matchup against Detroit even if snacks Harris in place that the run the offense is not going to suddenly turned into a shutdown unit and the sea hawks effects\nAnd I like the matchup against Detroit even if snacks Harrison plays the the run defense is not going to suddenly turned into a shutdown unit and the sea hawks have actually done a nice job running football

predicts shouldn't third cousin stopped five\nYeah I I think you're going to be I think you're going to be off on that one I think at the saints defense is going to play a little bit better I think the addition of Eli Apple won't change them\nInto a great unit but I think it will make them just a little bit better I'm the one thing that we didn't really talk about on the podcast is with us apple is being reunited with ... and von bell they were all teammates at Ohio State I think that'll help them get comfortable quicker in that defense and cousins just hasn't been able to bring the

Adam I went from tickets to the world series game for clenching game to falling asleep at my grandmother's condo after moving my family for for safety reasons a giant or\nWas weird in South Florida we

my ... but I ... through the following Goodwin Sanders like a a coal rich than a calm the through of of\nWell made all Sanders is going to be the one for sure that you're going to go with um [noise] cob for me you think so families just started out there since you were thinking about it it's easier to go Scott and good when NPR but a non ...\nGoodwin has been terrible and he's got it yet and amazing match up last week and he did nothing and now he is a tough matchup and I'm throwing good went out there\nAnd and so and said you're going to go with Randall ... yeah I mean back from injury double made it into Braves games he's made one great for thirty points in the game the\nPackers I agree with you it's ugly so you know good one yeah All right Sanders for sure and and James go with good when a as your number to Josh in Massachusetts what's up Josh or an eye on fantasy football\n... going to a I have a running back question I Am dealing with the er Melvin Gordon by week and I'm looking at either jail enriched chard um Isaiah Colwell or Chris Thompson\nScoring please yes a ... year\nYes well if it's ... the way to go\nI think the fact that he's caught six balls and three of his last war games means something and I think you'll see a couple of added targets with mark Cooper it out there and maybe a couple of carries with Martian Lynch not there I came across yes like a very strange well because I I was in my ring Josh has voice\nAdam oh a Adam in Pittsburgh what's up at um you're an eye on fantasy football\nGuys hey how are you so I mean a a PBR league and I got to start to two running backs a ... pretty much a lock I'm going to start him um so I have a ... and in Jordan Howard for the other spot and I'm not really sure um if I can trust Howard or carry on right now\nDo you do to do well to your carry on my way or it's them come eyes wasn't going to sing it will set you up\nTo sing to carry I don't you go to Karen Johnson I Am\nGoing to say carry on jobs and I think his workload will be the largest of the three I think his match up is probably second best of the three but because we don't know how many carries Jordan Howard we'll get nor how effective he'll be with them I think Johnson makes a lot of sense to be your number two running backs\nEight five five to one to four to seven days in Cleveland what's up\nDave ... on a hey Dave hey Dave they

digest it [noise]\nWe uh we just wanted to make sure we we were able to get it out there now and it's behind um so we have good conversations the whole time um and it was very open and transparent and like I said dishing up in the sports you know we got the well\nThis is going to be um the final regular season game with you can't believe the season is coming to an end here and everything is on like

I don't know in the last couple of three games six or seven got you know you have the two goals and then the last couple of games where like six or seven opportunities they seemed like he had five in the last game\nWhere you just do something weird thing happened you know going out his arm up just in time or something or is there any frustration there is he just like you gotta be kidding me that I Can't get the ball into the net right now\n[laughter] yeah and I think he definitely would would prefer to score but he's doing so much else are so many other things for us right now are you know he's he's comeback holding up the players you know he's fighting on ... and and the air he actually has been doing an excellent job\nOn the defensive corner kicks making sure he's a big presence back there hadn't balls away so [noise] um even though he's not scoring and you know fortunately he scored thirty times worse already this year so uh the keepers that made a couple of good saves in you know things have ...\nA but here's what we do know\nA fifty cent you know juggle spent some time in the ... for um what did he do a tax evasion a and he he got out now and he was do you do some concerts\nFifty cents spent three thousand dollars on two hundred and ... roasted or a tickets so that they were empty for his performance\nThat is the ultimate troll job I I mean I Am all about being part of the team petty I'm absolutely ... to to do that I [laughter] I Love being petty that take you to hold another level but if you do the math the tickets were Fifteen dollars apiece\nAnd how much of that is is Ticketmaster getting so what was the making like a dollar fifty off of those tickets\nI mean that to me is the bigger story yes it's great that fifty went through and make sure that there was nobody in the front row and I think that's great that's literally level four thousand of petty\nBut is job ruled that bad that uh the his tickets\nFor Fifteen bucks a piece I think his his career guy ended a sadly as for the adelies so he never recovered\nYeah he never recovered it 'cause he should've kept ... daughter out of his mouth [laughter] that's basically what ended it by the way did you hear you want to hear how stupid he is you don't remember the original fast and furious where he played that he had like three ... yeah we didn't want you you know what role he actually turned down\nLudicrous is correct he turned it down how much money that he forfeit off of that he would have never had to worry about the decent by and his tickets again dope\nHe turned it down how much money that he forfeit off of that he would have never had to worry about the dissent by his tickets again nope you would not have he would have been a while also able to pass these are not go to

from the studios I'm Corey James on your own for the falcons hawks at Atlanta United sports radio Ninety tonight the game\n[noise]\n\n[noise] many do you mind the game here we go\nOur focus is usually everywhere [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nWhat about the sports radio on the games that Benedict tore James ... double duty and I do not pay some well he's producing this train wreck we appreciate him um [noise] coming up in in twenty minutes you're one forty question the night as this\nWhat's the best cold weather food you can enter stuff on Twitter at night during the games all the ads have been one nine eight zero\nOr you can call us in twenty minutes and again if you're going to tell us it's super chili which\nI Would tend to agree with what kind [noise] 'cause there's a zillion types of chili\nThere's a billion types of soup which ones for the rest of the list so ah well we'll get to that come up in twenty minutes before we get that that would just say the NFL true false crafting some really good questions the nights website ... you're busy you got you got some more time\nFor me were good yeah always got tired I appreciate that not only do some talking through false some good\nSounds great what'd you got All right so now you know last season that the talks were ... the author that because the defense was clicking now is ... finally clear based off what Matt has done this season\nAnd\nBased on what he did a year prior to him now if he finally basically clear the Austin ... is is ... off the hot seat basically say\nI'm going to say true right ... and here's what I'll say about stark he started to find a little bit of a rhythm near the end of the year last year here's what I think is unrealistic an unfair when it comes to Steve ... is the Atlanta fan base which I Know one love\nThinks that every call is going to be perfect that's not the case in a typical NFL game if they're calling anywhere from sixty to eighty place you're going to have ten percent of those that you wish you could take back that's no different was Steve star Kesha and\n... and so I I think that there is an unfair expectations set before him that he's a hundred percent clean a hundred percent right hundred percent on top of it and that's not football that's not realistic football\nUh ... and I think people are starting to come off of that or any look you know coming into this year the big expectation was red zone red zone red zone because he had some atrocious red zone costs less or there's no doubt about that one\nBut we also have to remember who were dealing with when it\nComes to ... this is a guy who had zero time of the NFL\nHe didn't cut his teeth as as a quarterback coaches are running back coach or a passing game coordinator he you know he he didn't come up as an intern he didn't do any of that he was a college football die\nFrom the northwest obviously which is where all of this kind of got started you know at at as the head coach at your job he'd come hang out it's it's it's a sea hawks practices and get to know everybody and he was a pretty good play coloring college well\nHe was a kind of guy that Dan couldn't wanted so obviously they they they got together and I thought that the learning curve was going to be the one because he was going to learn to somebody else's off and he wasn't putting in his own they want it to try to keep ... from learning like his thirtieth officers and his ten years the NFL and yes that's an exaggeration for people who don't realize that\nThat to me it was a big mistake because now you're asking your office coordinator who's learning a new team new weapons new terminology knew everything else to learn somebody else's dolphins versus having an NFL guy just simply learning other often the learning curve would have been much less\nThat said Steve ... and ... Ryan are clearly on the same level right now not wind is currently on a five game no interception run right now\nSteve ... and not Ryan are clearly on the same level right now not wind is currently on a five game no intersection run right now which is a single season career best for him\nHe's never had more than four and a single season eleven and two dozen eleventh two thousand twelve and two dozen sixteen two dozen Seventeen he ended eleven and seven sixteen with for game interception a U.S ... know intercept districts and started two thousand twelve a Seventeen to gay so he's had to separate six games but he's never had it in the same season\nClearly when you look at the the the red zone those those things no longer exist they are absolutely scoring it will and the red zone and having no problem so I think yes Steve start season is free and clear about hot seat he's doing a much better job and he and not clearly have a much better relationship this year\nAll right now I Know last segment we spoke about how the falcons they're just what three or four plays away six and won five and two ... right now they're currently sitting in last place in the NFC and AMC salad NFC South I'm Sorry I'm with New Orleans being one up to the falcons actually had a chance to make the playoffs\nPlayoffs hot\n[noise] yes ... I'm going to say true Moore says the wildcard I'm I'm gonna say they still have a chance of the division\nI mean it's still the same right it's still New Orleans ... we still expected him to St at some points don't we like we expect it there are clearly not going to go Seventy nine this year\nBut it doesn't mean that the falcons can't get hot you know they got nine games left you know you look through the schedule Alex within Redskins they don't scary Baker may feel that the Bruins they don't scare you ducked Prescott and the cowboys don't scare you\nJoe ... and the ravens don't scare you Josh Rosen the cardinals don't scare you and then what does that leave it leaves Drew Brees and the saints Aaron Rodgers and the Packers\nCam Newton and the Panthers and then James when singing the bucks you win two of those four games doesn't matter what's to it is and then you beats a you beat Washington Cleveland Dallas um\nBaltimore in Arizona you know seven in junior final night and then you have seven into this and all of a sudden you're ten and six ten in six is good enough to win the division\nAnd if you go five and one of the division in ten six overall you probably have most of the tie breakers maybe not all of them but most of them so I still say that there's a legitimate shot the falcons can actually win the division and more than a legitimate show that they can get to the playoffs\n[noise] okay now\nThe conversation has been that everybody on the often to eat yeah right yeah they are everybody eating in some way shape or form the biggest ... biggest conversation naturally Julio Jones that's why receiver no teeth who you'll get the least five touched down by the end of the year\n... you know I Would hope so right I Would absolutely hope so um [noise] here's

right actually I'm actually give me a year ago but before that used to be ground turkey for sure now it's definitely like a bean based chili with like vegetables and stuff I mean what you consider\nGo

Redskins quarterback\nAnd Joe Theismann so we will get into the conversation on our will get into the conversation with Joe but where we do have to start the show with is coming off not that long ago game four of the two thousand and Eighteen World Series\nAnd this was going into the game that I was very intrigued to see who\nOf the two thousand and Eighteen World Series and this was going into the game that I was very intrigued to see who is going to be the starting pitchers you knew that rich show was going for the Dodgers there was maybe it's thought Palmer aunts would go for the Boston Red Sox ended up being Rodrigues\nAnd you also wanted to see how momentum wouldn't carry over and if it would carry over from what was\nAn exhilarating gain story ended exhausting game three in where the Dodgers were leading Boston comes back the tide on the Jackie rather junior home run in the eighth\nThen you get into the thirteenth Boston takes the lead the\nDodgers tied up and then eventually the Eighteenth ending max Muncie and is just amazing story continues with the walked off home runs to make this a two one series or the Dodgers were still trailing so you were wondering what they carry over would be\nAn early on both these pictures were dealing hills unbelievable Rodrigues was unbelievable as well and\nThen in the bottom of the sex you started to see the Dodgers put their touches on this game and start to make you think\nOkay this is going to be tied up to to the Dodgers are going to be able to carry over from that exhausting when ... number three in a game that I felt like it was never ending and put back to back wins together\nHere in getting number three in getting number four as the Dodgers picked up around in the bottom of the sex and they also pick up three more with the ... home run off Rodrigues where he grunts by his glove and we got the ... so that makes it for nothing\nAnd when it's for nothing I'm not thinking Boston's coming back in this game\nWith as much respect they do have for the Boston Red Sox and what they've been able to do this year when you have that crowd going in LA\nEven though they arrive late and may have lost her early and a game for and there are many other games in the postseason but when you have the home crowd going and you have a four O. lead and you're about\nTo tie this thing up to a point a to a peace with nine out to go on a game I'm thinking the Dodgers with the way that Boston for the most part in game three local lifeless at the plate and then for a large portion and game for like life list as well as rich as rich as hell only had\nOne one head allowed you're thinking yeah the Dodgers going to win this one but then the mistake started to just come one\nAfter another after another after another\nBy the Dodgers manager and Dave Robert and Robert's is seeing the seventh inning play out you have read channel on the hill\nOnly allowing one hit in the game Bogart swaps pneumonia is then strikes out\nAnd the next thing you know they've Roberts emerges out of the dugout they put in Alexander hell out of the game which I didn't like\nWas never that go to football gave up by the time he

I'm really a dad and youth football I'm passionate about that's where I'm coming from from uh from adapt perspective um\nThe scientist so confusing I'm ... years and um you know you hear that she the headlines I'm based on what scientists and so I wanted to find out what what is the science saying and I want to from New York to LA to Canada\nUm talk to the greatest minds in the world about you know what is she the what what is it and here's the thing that I universally came up with that they told me when\nI asked him well what is it they would always say neither nor pathologist neurologist studying it for years and years I'm studying brain for years and years there like it is a pattern and we don't know what causes it and we don't know what causes we are observing it\nI'm like ... like ... well Germany weren't on observation state and when I saw that I Would just like wow how could the headline to get to where they are and then I start you start asking more questions than there are cases where people who have the CD patter but\nNever played football never had a concussion never had head trauma I'm never had any domestic violence\nSo what that tells you is you can't keep just targeting contact sports and football simply because of all cases that you have that are outside that realms\nSo the scope is white and there's obviously clearly more research needs to be an old timers is nearly a hundred years in the working hundreds of medical doctors decades of work on that and they still don't know what causes that\nShow it just really looked at I when I look at that are really found the truth of it I was like oh that was empowering to me and I'm like I really wanted to share what the science really says two families because it'd about kids it's about um families\nSo I'm having a marijuana signed signed on\nOne side says they don't know that that's what they're meeting about like the you know I I every one of your talk do they use words like unknown make cards may not could explain but the ... the best one is we don't know\nAnd that's why when I when you go back to what I said the very beginning they are like we're observing it we don't know what causes it and we don't know what it causes\nAnd what the symptoms are from it um and when you have ...\nWe're observing it we don't know what causes it and we don't know what it causes and what the symptoms are from it um and when you have cases outside of the sporting arena obviously that widens the scope and\nThere's such a a a fear of our epidemic is people are so scared and fearful thinking there especially parents that their kids have a concussion I keep in mind that this is outside the realms of sports to\nTheir fear their kids are going to get the tea and you know what I should come so passionate about kids like it it will be nice just to know the truth you know the ... where we are really with science\nSo that if you have that information will you could make better decisions for whatever direction your family wants to go read the report a sports are not part of sports I'm In a part of the book to is it really help ... help people understand the treatments and therapies along with the protocols that are in Mazie\nMy son was a star player makes a quarterback BYU\nHe had a couple of concussions with if it's within three week period I took him to UPN see in Pittsburgh where

do that doing great go ahead okay\nSo like I said I looked for the Meryl ... interview and I do not agree with him at all I mean if you've got hundreds and out of a hundred leather cases being diagnosed with the tea and obviously there's a link between the two now whether he's going to say they're not\nGoing to be clear just be clear it was a hundred and Lebanon brains that were ... and ... a hundred and ten out of those a hundred of London had the tea it's not every one tent out of want to live and just to be clear on that\nI Gotcha so he just that one eleven that got tested now what are the odds of another hundred no let me get tested and another hundred and ten being diagnosed with sea to eat\nThat I don't know and we have the study of that but here's the tricky part it's two things and that's why when he got into the whole explaining a statistic I disagree with him just because\nThese brains can't be tested until the player is dead for CGI you can't test it yes a living

going to be that large I mean of course\nWith the seven thousand it could be you know you could have less of a percentage than one tenth of one eleven but it's not going to be\nLike eye popping leave huge difference from that ratio in my opinion um that's just that's just a ... matter of principle you know what I mean if if you have that sample size that I mean it's going to be relatively close to that which puts the number very high an extremely eye popping and\nBut once again he didn't think was fair about that and I I don't know if the numbers are true or not from what he was saying but

called brainwashed\nAnd there's a lot of reaction from it and it gets the conversation of\nWould you let your kid play football and also what is the appropriate age to allow your child or to play tackle football if you would let them in your opinion and also if you want to give your thoughts of the interview you can as well and they buy buy two on two for CBS we have one caller did hang on patiently through the break who\nHad to which carry him over from the last segment so they get to him right now before we get into a little college football will go out to Cleveland and we'll talk to Kevin good morning Kevin our you\nKnow do good and there are so quick question about the concussions how can we never hear about it from a boxer and I'm a fighter who gets kicked impulse that constantly and let them do talk a lot of caution\nWell you you do hear it in other sports hockey I understand it's something that's been talked about over the years um with boxing in that manner and I may I it it's a fair point um it's not something that I watch is frequently so hence why we talk a little bit more about football but\nSome arrows point yes there are other sports where this does happen where there are high impact collisions such as that I'm a mayor such as a boxing so you're right about that\nYeah because they don't wear helmets off and they're just getting kicked in constantly which you don't hear about it costs them as much as you do not feel\nAnd I'm sure you've read up on it and if you Google it that you will hear but right now the also another thing with the NFL is it was ignored for so many years that like if you watch the movie concussion the NFL ignored this topic for so many years and now they're finally embracing it\nAnd they're finally admitting that yes there are problems that we have to improve the game of player safety with X Y and Z so that's also another reason to be fair why you hear more about it right now but I Do appreciate the phone call Kevin thank you so much time\nWe got to get into college football because we're coming off the college football Saturday also get you ready for a big NFL Sunday where again does take off in a few hours in London\nAnd they get into college football because we're coming off the college football Saturday also get you ready for a big NFL Sunday where again this kick off in a few hours\nIn London between the jaguars and the eagles and there's a whole lot going on with the jaguars and their team will get into all that but let's get into the college football yet two teams in the top ten go down and that of course we're Texas who they did lose to Oklahoma State\nThirty eight to thirty five and then Florida goes down through Georgia and on the Georgia Florida game\nGeorgia wins thirty six to Seventeen it just shows you where the two programs are at\nIs a building near for Florida with the new head coach\nAnd give them credit they've done a nice job this year but they're not on the same level of uh Georgia\nRight now and that was displayed and what we got to see Saturday and a lot sided score thirty six to seven TNN at\nTimes it was close but the Andre swift made it be a little bit more lopsided to maybe what the score does reflect but Georgia's a team that they will get back into the college football playoff conversation I don't know if they're going to get into the top for by the end of the year but they're in that conversation with only happen one loss\nAnd you wanted to see how they would bounce back from the last Dallas you\nAnd they bounce back with a very nice to meet you up against Florida Florida you continue to attract them along the rest of the way but I'll be curious to see what that program is this time next year and then with the Texas Oklahoma mistaken and Texas I never thought they were the six best team in the nation but with the record that they have\nThat's where the they were going to be so you have them fall back and they're going to drop out of the top ten and so it was Florida but at\nThe end of the game and I didn't watch this game live but I saw the highlight of it the Oklahoma State quarterback is taking a knee and yet at Texas player Russian very hard and it led to occur falafel\nAnd it led into a little bit of a a scrum right there and watch it at right now ... comes running onto the field Tom Herman was outrage but it was just player who was aggressively rushing on a on a kneel down\nAnd guns you then just puts his hands up\nIn the air and at the end of the game the two coaches did embrace it and they talked it out there how did it over and everything was fine so those\nAre two top ten matchups of teams that did go down and we'll see who does enter now the top ten\nYou have to consider Ohio State they do not play this weekend but they only have one last night was to Purdue Kentucky could go into the top ten and maybe Washington state could be I think those are three teams that you would consider\nA potentially going into the top ten only two well because Florida is going to fall back from nine and Texas going to fall back from six outside of the top ten\nThe more you all the more you can say if you have at

[noise]\nIt's just that guilt show right here on CBS Sports radio\nWe have a football Sunday Coming up later today as it say right at the halfway point so next week I I think it's a good time to just look back and see where everyone is the national football league what surprised us in a good way and what surprised us in a bad way who have been impressed about and all that so we'll do that next week but\nHey you got some good games this weekend Packers in rams saints and Vikings ravens in Panthers\nAnd even some good divisional matchups where yeah teams are going in a different direction but you always do with these divisional matchups\nThey're always usually tough game and you have one with the Redskins and the giants have paid for the giants should have no business being in this game because they can't block\nAnd the Redskins have a good from seven but this is a good test game for the Redskins who'd and three out of their last for weeks they have victories in our only last word to the same\nThey beat the Panthers along the way\nI had a victory up against the Packers so that's a red skins team they beat the cowboys last week they're moving in the right direction but if you're a team\nThat is going to be in the conversation to win the seas and now may be looked at as the favorite which you could solve that debate on who will be the favorite of the NFC depending on what Philadelphia does in a few hours and if you're still believe in the cowboys they're not that's up to you\nBut at the Redskins won that continue to be the top dogs in this division keep on winning\nAnd I and I know that it's just easier said than done when you look at their schedule named me a tough game a really tough game that the red skins had\nThe rest of their way\nOn their schedule because there's not a game on the schedule the Redskins that you look at it and you say\nOh the Redskins they can't win that game not that they're going to win them all but they took care of business the last four weeks three times that the giants they had the falcons at home that tap other home it gets used used in improving so that's a very tough game than there at Dallas there at Philly\nAnd our home against the giants so you got to when you're the visual games but it's not a very typical schedule and that the team that's already foreign too so we'll see if they could take care of business or if you lie and hotel and say call and they have the game and that's at metlife stadium Brown's instills another one of those were the Steelers\nAnd two so we'll see if they could take care of business or if you lie\nAnd ... and they have the game and that's that meant like stadium Brown's instills another one of those were the Steelers should win the Steelers are catching that read them right now and I think we will see something different than what you saw the first time between these two teams where it was a tie because I Believe the Steelers are going in one direction\nAnd the browns are going in another direction this is a building near still for the brown and we've got excited with the browns early on\nBut after that jets game\nThey choke or the way up against the raiders they come back they beat the ravens then they lose the charges and it was to the ...\nSo this is a continuous year where you're learning when you're Cleveland you can't go from ... to sixteen at all overnight or even to ten and six so there's going to be some ups and downs but the brown schedule gets extremely tough\nAt Pittsburgh today at one PM then you're playing the chief yeah the falcons who now three and four after their went on Monday Night football against the giants and thereby week\nSo that's something that easy then you had to buy like he had the bangles the Texans the Panthers\nNot an easy schedule San easy schedule whatsoever so the brands you start to come down\nBack to what they actually are but the experience these players are getting these young players and the time they are getting right now will be very valuable and you look at the browns maybe next year as a team that could potentially be one of those wild card spots in the AFC if they continue to move the train and the right direction\nRavens that Panthers last week Panthers come from behind they have that dramatic when in Philadelphia they started the fourth quarter down Seventeen often they win the game Twenty one to Seventeen and the ravens lose on a Justin talked or miss the extra point\nTo the New Orleans saints ravens and Panthers this is going to be again I'm going to love to see him go up against this ravens defense which has been excellent if the ravens can force turnovers on camera Newton and protect the football with Joe flat going the wrong it without Collins they can win the game\nBut that's the key here you have to force turnovers with camp\nYou have to force those turnover so you want to see if this Panthers defense can progress and improve 'cause it hasn't had not been as impressed with his Panthers defense compared to other years but\nIn this case it was extremely impressive what they did last week in Philadelphia up against the defending champ down Seventeen up they come back and squirt Twenty one answer and something that makes you raise an eyebrow and when you look at the Carolina Panthers\nPackers at the rams the rams to me and I've been saying this for weeks and you don't need a PHD in football to say this but the rams to me are by far and away the best\nIn football this year that does not mean you win the Superbowl though\nAt the end of October you got to continue to stay healthy you got to continue to play good defense play good often you have a great coach and McVeigh but right now the rams look so good but you had the Roger's factor in here\nAnd if you let Rogers hang around he could come back to bite you in the you know what so Packers at rams the rams should win this game but it comes down to the ... Rogers hang around and if you let them hang around and make a mistake that sort of a comeback to hurt you\nAnd then a saint set biking we all know this was a playoff game last year the division around the Vikings have the Minneapolis Miracle where at the time it was seen them since the fond digs but\nTo the division around the Vikings have the Minneapolis Miracle right at the time it was seen them since the ... but this is the to me the marquee matchup of the week at this is the best match up of the weekend\nBecause you at the same steam that\nIs cruise in right now we're Drew Brees and you have a Vikings team that's playing ... solid football right now after a slow start\nAs this uh biking skiing I think will be very dangerous add some problems early on what the defense Mike Zimmer was not happy it's clear that he wasn't happy but this all fences so much potential\nI think this is going to be a high scoring affair I lean towards Minnesota because I think the Minnesota defense is better than New Orleans but I can see there's been thirty something point back and forth really fun game and I like her cousins\n[laughter]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nYou are listening to the sec build show [noise]\nEvacuate show right here CBS Sports or radio I time to get to the pay\nIs another week in the NFL week eight let's get to the ...\nRegain National Football league\nI don't want to call it a hot streak because the minute I call the hot streak I Will start to regrets\nBut I Am six to know the last two weeks and that is put me in first place now in our picks which I don't know if I should be proud of that\nAre bent Horowitz is James ... you are now both tied your game back of myself so baton let me ask you a quick question are you more annoyed that now I have a one game lead on you\nOr are you more annoyed that you're tied with ... ...\nWhat's the answer to that question I'm not a noted neither okay you still topic oh you think everything's going to be signed with yourself\nThe truth is the way I've been checking and he can look at look at my record when I'm actually here if you do the splits compared to what yeah yeah yeah for me was one on the air if night and day\nTo be again back after the weekend McKenna I'll take that any day\nThe bad weekend for him\nWhen he did while though in college football for you didn't hear ya complaining about it then what did he go to one one\nOne week yeah I haven't had to lose in college we can yeah I suspect has got to complain when things are going his way than we know who ban yeah\nBanks it'd be oh and sixteen and the text and he was still tried to spin it just look at the football team you root for April tries to spend that from week to week no way to spend\nThe listeners can tell you I'm not going to hear it on the line but for the giants they get to run around the law that they do [laughter] lot\nBut enough with the trash talk 'cause you're only as good as your and this upcoming weaken the games will be decided today so let's get right to him coming up bright and early ... nine thirty AM Easter\nYou have the eagles and the jaguars inland\nThe spread is three points in favor of Philadelphia\nTo thing I'll take Carson wants all day over Blake for those both these teams are not playing as good as they should be the loser this game I don't think will make the playoffs\nI think Philadelphia the better team I think they won the game but Jacksonville\nHaving four players\nThey got arrested and no charges were press they let them go\nBut that just screams to me of a dysfunctional team\nAnd a team that has a lot of problems right now\nPhiladelphia is better that had some heart\nHey I'm a dysfunctional team\nAnd a team that has a lot of problems right now\nPhiladelphia is better that had some heartbreaking loss of hitting this game as close and the fourth quarter Philadelphia will pull away and they'll be able to hold on give me the eagles lie in the three over the jak\nI agree with your pet I disagree with your assessment though\nOkay you said the eagles you know we'll pull away and the fourth I don't think it gets to that point I think the eagles jumped out in front of you know\nJust to make her I was saying if the game is closed compared to the other weeks I think they'll be able to finish the job this time around\nI don't know if I trust them and that but look at the ... track record\nThey've been out scored in their three game losing streak fifty seven to nothing in the first time\nAnd combine that with the fact that they've scored fourteen of your points in those games I think the eagles jumped out in front of early I think that they\nAre going to be more desperate team or the jobs are a lot more distracted right now\nYou might have a ... guys getting arrested in the club in London what are you doing out in the clubs to begin with when you're you know\nBasically playing for the season this weekend I Love the over here and sing new cultures oh yeah that's that's what they're doing that's exactly what they're doing I was like every week anyway I hate the eagles in general but I Love 'em in this game give me the eagles modestly\nCan I just do a little preview of what I think we're ... analysis obey\nYeah everything what you guys just said I'm going with the eagles lie in the three what are you guys Christopher\nI Am taking the eagles mhm but for a different reason it just seems like Jacksonville is way too much drama going on there talking about their quarterback getting bench they're talking about the offense in fighting with the defense and the quarter back in ... it's called himself a scapegoat this week\nThe eagles just have less drama around them and the Doug Peterson quote I Know we all took it at face value there's no real pressure here ducks play in a mind game with these guys he's trying to get the pressure off them\nHe pressure creates diamonds as we all know\nAnd they got diamonds on their fingers from last year\nYeah the pressure stuff from Peter city last me on that one it's a mind game when you're trying to take away a bind but when you say this is the new norm don't tell me now the pressure's off the pressures you beyond even more [noise]\nUm but talking to grown also this week when I talked to him or her own and also Doug Peterson but with dogma Rhone I asked him a question\nOn what was his message to Blake ... any dance around\nThe answer and he just gave us more to a message of the team of with the take away the football more and we can't turn over the football as much as we're doing it I don't think they have a lot of no matter what this I don't think they have a lot of confidence simply for the defense clearly shows that as well but yeah I like Philly so All right so we're all on the eagles laying the three\nGame number two for twenty five\nPm eastern rams and Green Bay the rams home up against the Packers nine point spread here the rams are the favorite [noise]\nIt's tough to pick against the rams right now\nI think the rams when this football game they are the better team but the Roger's factor either keep the Packers closer has them in a back door cover late so with that being said I like the rams to win the game but give me the Packers\nDo like a ...\nI Love often well then this is again for you\nBoth of these people don't level\nAnd those people all losers\nI Love often well then this is the game for you\nBoth of these young people don't level\nAnd those people all losers\nOkay it was the type of people that that honors loser but you're not taking the under this one I'm I'm I'm never taking and under ever\nEven if a spread was a hundred and five you I Would I'd rather just keep\nMy own money not make money and not be a loser because only squeeze that the under ... square it you know the both of these teams can put up ... points look at what these officers have done all year bought one of these teams is going to put up a hell of a lot more points than the other and that seems to\nWork at that off that they can beat you any which way they want to ... Gurley they do it that way they want to teach in the air well guess what we got cut off in three headed aerial attack\nAd in the fact that Aaron Rodgers is ... and he's facing probably the best pass rushing the league as they come home for the first time in a month give me the rams I think they went by double digits easy\nAll right there we go their separate what you've got\nUh no no no no no\nThey don't go up they had two weeks to prepare for this game to come up with by yeah you're going to give me the best player in the league\nWith an near double digit line the best player in the fields Rogers I don't care what anybody says you know brain doesn't planes on Monday Night right gotcha the bet you're giving me the best player on the field than your double digit line\nPackers China center and I and I go back go Well Jerry ... your ... you\nKnow why not too old oh stop it don't you'd be disrespectful\nTo Jerry Kramer\nAlright game number three final eight twenty ... we have New Orleans\nA rematch of the division around in the postseason from a year ago where we all know the Minneapolis Miracle did happen\nMinnesota now is the new quarterback\nNew Orleans though even on the road is a point and a half they bring\nIt up to pick against Drew Brees right now it really is I pick them last week the nice job of against the ravens thank you Justin doctor but I'm going to pick against Drew Brees and the same here I think Minnesota is just a more complete team\nThey don't have the better off but they still have a damn good often with her cousins digs\nFeeling congressional Rudolph please get going that would be nice for my fantasy team but nobody cares about my fantasy team I get it I just think Minnesota's defense makes they stopped late\nMinnesota wins this game Ben I think it's high scoring too and you like that\nBoom\nMic on\nIndividuals and businesses with tax problems listen carefully if you owe over ten thousand dollars in taxes or I have an file tax returns us actually can help you take back control the IRS can seize your ... your paycheck closure business and file\nCriminal charges our team of tax attorneys can stop collections and get you protected us actually offers a price protection guaranteed to get you protected today us to actually elders eight plus rated with the BBC so called eight hundred by one nine Seventy seven Ninety six us ... eight hundred vibe on nine Seventy seven Ninety six\nIf you are behind on your bills than this messages for you how would you like to have a large portion of your credit card debt or medical bills forgiven national credit card relief would\nLike to give you free information on a proven debt forgiveness program it's not bankruptcy it's not consolidation this special program actually wife's clean the portion of your debt that is forgiven call for your free\nForgiveness information now eight hundred to hug one six six seven oh that's eight hundred to no one six six seven oh don't wait call eight hundred to nine one six six seven oh not available in North Dakota\n\n[noise] we are able to use e G the Atlanta [noise]\nAnd the wind and enter calm communication station\n[noise]\n\nW ... radio dot com radio station seasons are searching eighty W.

Georgia Dome academy what we're doing what we're going to be doing so I always like to start with where we were about a decade ago in two thousand and seven\nWe had two hundred and forty two million dollars in economic activity here in Georgia\nDo the film and television production in two thousand and stuff and not bad\nThe film tax credits um the Georgia entertainment industry investment act passed in two thousand and eight and this past the school year so I'm just last year we had nine point five billion dollars in economic activity here in Georgia do to film and television production\nYou might say that we have a ten billion dollar a year business\nI'm going to go on with these numbers but the point I Want to get across is there is no other story like Georgia's\nThere's no story in any other state and the other territory any other region in the world where you see this kind of dramatic and indeed unprecedented gross Georgia is now number three in the country for film and television production\nWe're actually number five in the world and when you look at major feature films so grossing major feature films\nSeventeen of the top one hundred grossing feature films or rather Seventeen at the top one hundred major feature films when you look at how much they've grossed\nThose Seventeen films were shot here in Georgia more than any other state or territory so we're actually number one in the world when it comes to major feature film production pretty remarkable we had three hundred and twenty film and TV productions here in Georgia last year\nNinety two thousand two hundred Georgians are now working in this film and television industry according to the motion picture association of America so I Hope you're getting the picture film and television we're kind of killing it here in Georgia\nKind it is not a word we are feeling a jet that's amazing it is so just to be clear what\nDrove that type of growth from two thousand and seven from two hundred and forty two million to nine point five billion and twenty Eighteen\nThank you for that that is a great question and I can answer it with ah hopefully some real specificity three things that we looked at a gym we drive the film and television\nThe Eighteen thank you for that that is a great question and I can answer it with ah hopefully some real specificity\nThree things that we looked at a generally drive the film and television production industry first is as I mentioned the film tax credit we have a great film tax credit easy to use easy to monetize no cap snow sunset clauses in our state stands behind it\nSo if you're going to come to Georgia and shoot a major feature film production\nYou can feel confident that that film tax credit is here right number two infrastructure\nGeorgia has over a hundred sound stages or in the state pretty remarkable we have north America's largest sound stage here in the Atlanta metro region and we actually have the second largest sound stage complex in North America here in Georgia\nSo along with the studios along with the sound stages we have world class inventors support systems\nAnything that you might need from camera rental property houses to the um the the the soft um businesses that are associated with this industry from travel agents or to construction\nUm the carpet houses in ... for example are participating in driving what we're seeing in our sets here so a film tax credit and infrastructure and final a crew\nEnough Georgians to do all this work and frankly a few years ago three or four years ago there were some questions about whether George had enough crew to sustain this as I say unprecedented dramatic growth\nAnd that was addressed by the Georgia film academy\nSo that is how the Georgia film academy came to be the gateway for jobs for a lot of people in Georgia let's talk about that I Know I you mentioned infrastructure I Know you mentioned the film tax credit and now they're screw\nWhen it comes to crew in Georgia and jobs I Know that that's kind of tied in with the film tax credit correct let's talk about crew and how the Georgia film academy provides the crew in essence for the the industry because you all are training ground so to speak\nFor people who are interested in getting into the industry as far as production is concerned ... tell us a little bit about that\nSure so first you had asked about the film tax credit and um let me I'm explain a little bit more about it\nWhen work is done here in Georgia services are utilized on film and television production companies receive a twenty percent tax credit in addition there is a ten percent up left as we say that has also allowed to be used\nOn top of that twenty percent when the Georgia Peach is put in um the trailer of a a motion picture or a a television production\nSo as I say easy to use easy to monetize and it really works well infrastructure um is the second driver in this industry and number three is crew\nSo again there were questions about whether or not we had enough Georgians to do all this work a few years ago and because this industry is so important to our state\nWe wanted to make sure that when it comes to the film and television industry Georgia is all and\nSo in January of twenty Fifteen governor deal announced\nThe Georgia film academy a collaborative effort of the U. S. G. the university system of Georgia and the T. C. S. G. the technical college system of Georgia simply put we want to make sure that we put Georgians to work\nIn addition I like to say that there's three things broadly speaking that we focus on the Georgia film academy one is leadership we want to make sure that our us she institutions in our T. C. S. G. institutions all work together collaboratively\nWe want to make sure that our us she institutions in our T. C. S. G. institutions\nAll work together collaboratively number two as I say jobs for Georgians right we want to make sure that we put our students and our neighbors and are returning vets to work on our sound stages in our sets jobs for Georgians and number three and this is where it gets really really interesting Amanda\nThe Georgia film academy in addition to jobs which to be crystal clear is mission one for the G FAA jobs\nIn addition we're committed to doing something that really no other state has ever done before which is in addition to this immediate economic activity which is really profound in many ways a game changer potentially for quality of life here in terms of the economic activity that generates\nWere also committed at the Georgia film academy to building a permanent and sustainable entertainment industry we have some thoughts about how to do that but first let's talk about what the G. F. A. 's core mission is let's talk about how we've addressed that\nOkay so when you say gee essay just to be clear this is an educational academy that is governed by the university system some George ... that's\nI can attest to everything that you say because I had been through the G s a one program\nAnd you're absolutely right it's most definitely a foot in the door and the right direction I think with a booming industry in Georgia a lot of people are being hoodwinked the a lot of people are saying oh you can work with us from this and ... and we'll get you in the industry and that's not necessarily the case\nAnd I think that uh our listeners should definitely visit your website and learn more about which schools they can actually\nEnroll through and like I said if you are not interested in being a full time student\nThe continuing education classes is another alternative one thing that I also like the the college program works with the work development centers as well so if you're unemployed if you would transition out of your job and you're looking to re enter into a different career\nThey have the funding and they have the resources available for you to go through one of their development centers you get the financing from them to attend continuing education program or even a college to a different program the G is a is a part of that certification through the college please do not call G s a asking\nHow you can get an application you have to go see one of the educational institutions like you said either the technical or the state colleges correct us right now one thing that I Love about the G. S. A. is the fact that\nYou're instructors are more than overqualified you talked about the experience and I just have to brag a little bit on my instructor his name is Chuck car and truck and he was phenomenal her ear and if you are a slow learner a faster\nLearner a medium alert or it doesn't matter as long as you can just apply which you touch see and feel and pass the test\nAnd you mentioned about how you're not just stuck in the classroom\nTalk a little bit about the tools and resources that you guys provide for people to learn about how to be successful onset because I don't think a lot of people understand when you say sound stage and when you say a production area you all have the same equipment that they have on set\nThank you Amanda so we're we're not playing around this is in theory this isn't an idea we are literally training a workforce there are no other states have ever done anything even remotely like this\nWhy is this important because if you want to be a grip and you're actually working with grip stands on you know which way the ... goes you're going to get hired by the way up to go to work\nA on a production so again we're not going to show your pictures of cables were going to put actual working cables in front of you and finally the Georgia film academy operates directly with industry\nSo what this means is when you come trained with us as you did Amanda at pine wood at lamb studios were we operate a school and operate a sixteen thousand square foot sound stage something that no other school number higher education\nInstitutions anywhere in the country probably anywhere in the world has you're going to learn in a in a facility that is exactly like the kind of facility that a few weeks later a few months later a few years later maybe you're going to be working on this is something that everyone in our state should be proud of\nReally should be I have to say one of my most exciting moments was when we were walking from the G A fake classes over\nOf they really should be have to say one of my most exciting moments was when we were walking from the G s fake classes over to the production area we walk past where the grip and electrical putting together the set in construction while putting together to set for ... right [laughter]\nAnd we're all just like why died in ... and just glaring would we leave because we were like wow we're on a real marvel movie sad yeah it was phenomenal\nAnd and our students are working now I'm On the steps yes\nLet's talk about some of the classes I Know we talked about that construction scenic painting lighting and electric grid and regain\nAn introduction to special makeup affects these are some new classes that you have that as a post production film and TV ad editing digital imagery story ... why I Am going to go ahead if sign up for now an introduction to special makeup effects in production at county\nThose are different is the need changing\nUm no so um what what we're doing is growing what we're doing at the George film academy so before I say anything else\nJob one is in job one as far as I can see will always be putting Georgians to work right now Georgia really doesn't have a film and television industry\nGeorgia has a film and television production industry but we at the Georgia film academy who all share a vision believe that we in Georgia can have what\nLos Angeles has what New York has what bully what has what London has which is the whole ecosystem of a business right\nSo I'm Talking about production but I'm also talking about content creation which means screen writing in television writing and I'm also talking about the other end of that pipeline which is post production\nI can talk with more specificity about this but once we start to do that once we start to train people as we are now doing as you've noted in these fields\nRepresentation the agencies will come and financing will come and distribution will come and you had mentioned earlier about how\nYou love the expression y'all he would and you you reference us being Hollywood or the south which is great those those are fun\nBut you know what we're Georgia and um I Believe as do ah the rest of the team members at the George film academy we have great stories to tell here in Georgia we have the means to tell those stories and the Georgia film academy as deeply committed to making sure that we do just that\nI think that it's fantastic that you guys are coming full circle I see now you're in ... it seems like maybe faced to where you're trying to incorporate the full gamut of everything to do with production post production and maybe maybe in the future pre production\nIf you'll I'm sure something personal with the which I think I'm sort of goes to a what our entire gee if a team feels\n... on the Georgian I grew up here I went to high school here I Love the states so much Amanda I worked in the entertainment industry most of my adult life I have a professorship it comes to a State University but I I spent twenty twenty five years working and living in Hollywood mainly writing and producing a television shows\nOver the last ten years or so I've been in the story rooms and I've watched this industry grow here in Georgia I can tell you that what your film academies a leadership team feel strongly about is putting Georgians to work but in addition creating an industry here in our state where George and never again\nNever again has to leave to do what I was doing which is content creation or never again has to leave to do any\nKind of field in this business\nA robust production industry like we have and are going to continue to grow as well as the whole ecosystem of a business\nI Am so excited for the for the boom is it's really about to take off even bigger is and then we thought it was really big writing\nRoe as well as the whole ecosystem of a business\nI Am so excited for the for the boom is it's really about the takeoff even bigger reason and we thought it was really big right now but it's about to get bigger isn't it\nWe believe that the entertainment industry in Georgia can be a legacy for all Georgians peaches\nPeanuts and production\nI Love it teaches peanuts and production but with that said we appreciate your time today in the website is Georgia film academy dot org it was such a pleasure having you here ... thank you Amanda we're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back with more of Atlanta up close\nJoined the ... the one oh three and judge pretty ... ... talk twenty eight

that very business or\nPublic facilities may not have provided proper lighting for security they also may have negative Julie hired the person responsible for your and once you hire us we begin the process of obtained evidence take you witness statements investigating your client Thomas of yes\nYeah sure well first I Want to speak to your point yeah these these people that are leaving their homes they're not doing so because they want to you know their normal life has been disrupted an up ended and these journeys that they're facing are not easy\nUm it's not something that somebody would want to do you know imagine leaving your home leaving your family here in Atlanta and not having you know and to go into the grocery store and not having food to by not being able to buy food\nUm ... that's not a journey that you would want to make oftentimes along the route you know people are facing violence especially women and children are are more vulnerable to sexual violence\nUm and we see that and many of our projects that we work in\nUm so it's it's very very difficult situation being faced I'm so you you asked about the difference between a refugee in an asylum seeker\nUm so the difference between a refugee and asylum seekers an important difference so somebody who is seeking asylum is fleeing war persecution and violence and their home country and as applying to the UNH the our um which is the un high commissioner for refugees\nTo be resettled in another country um so once somebody has been granted their application for asylum has been granted that's when they will receive the refugee status\nOK so a refugee actually goes through the legal process of trying to get permission to be in a country yes and someone who is an asylum seeker is trying to correct goes through the process correct\nTo be in a country yes someone who is an asylum seeker is trying to correct goes through the process correct so complicated\nIt is and it's very few people that actually are resettled compared to the amount of number of people that are actually applied for asylum\nSo what happens\nUm well in some cases they're turned back\nUm and they're just being brought back to the very same context in which they're fleeing\nUm for example in Honduras um you know you have a lot of people that are fleeing the gang violence that's happening there I'm trying to make this treacherous journey to reach safer ... safer countries um fleeing gang violence meeting a lot of treacherous journey as along the way\nWhat when I think about what you just said I think about\nMyself and I and I think a lot of times in the news or when we hear reports of refugees and people seeking asylum coming to other countries other countries not wanting them pushing them away it's like a country will journey of putting them in makeshift space is just so that they can be separate from other people\nIt saddens my heart because I don't believe that people understand that when you say forced from home it's not like you get up thirty they noticed to vacate no these people's doors are kicked in and they are forced to leave with whatever they have correct\nThat is correct I'm oftentimes they are given to notice that they have to leave their fleeing war situation so you could have\nUm your village that was bombed for example by infighting between rebel groups or um\nInner factional fighting whatever it may be and so you sometimes have to leave with what you have on you if you don't have time to grab your documents you don't have if even if you have documents um one thing that we look at an exhibition is like the concept of stateless people and the different rights that they are afforded versus\nA somebody that does have a nationality or does have citizenship [noise]\nUm so yeah it oftentimes these people are fleeing within thirty seconds and can just take whatever they have with them [noise] stateless what's that yes they're stateless person is somebody who doesn't have citizenship um and a lot of countries across the globe um women for example when they give birth citizenship isn't automatically granted to their child\nSo um that child is said listen doesn't necessarily afforded the protections of somebody who does have citizenship\nSo when we talk about the exhibit um about a force from home you said there are different components of it is is that the Georgia world Congress center it's approximately ten thousand square feet yes walk us through what's going on and all of that [laughter]\nYeah so it's a free open to the public outdoor exhibition 'em and were set up outside in West plaza park\nUm when people arrived there actually given an identity card with a new identity that carries them through the entire exhibition experience and so they can either be an ID pie which isn't internally displaced person there can be an asylum seeker or refugees that that identity card stays with you in plays a role throughout your experience through the exhibition\nUm then you meet your guide 'em and you look at the different push factors um that have forced you to flee um then you're asked to choose very quickly um various different items that you would take if you were a force from home yeah\nI'm Still trying to really put people in that mindset in that situation of like okay wow I really only have thirty seconds what am I going to choose my going to choose my family heirlooms am I going to choose my life saving medications that I Need\n'em so really putting people in that experience um and then you look at various different context that I mentioned I'm brandy Honduras succeed and Syria and Afghanistan\nUm and looking at the different medical complications and vulnerabilities that are refugees and people fleeing face\nThat sounds absolutely amazing is like\nUm and looking at the different medical complications and vulnerabilities that that refugees and people fleeing face\nEra that sounds absolutely amazing it's like you have a first hand experience of what it's like to be forced from home based off what you describe the exhibit to be well don't take a quick break and we'll come back and talk more with

F. A.\nYou mentioned in a moment but the entryway into all Georgia film academy training and courses and ultimately jobs is through our first course which we called G FAA one and that is a core fundamental scores in everything that you need to know about production to be of value to set\nUm students that our institutions are students through um the Con Ed programs\nAre going to take this um six hour a week course which the institutions the U. S. T. T. C. S. G. institutions offer six ... six hours of college credit for six hours a week for sixteen weeks when what you're gonna learn grip on we collect ... one week lighting\nYou're gonna learn soft skills that are really critical to being a value on set walkie talkie protocol how to read a call sheet\nHow did not mess up a shot when it's going on on a on a on a set set where where you're working um if you take all of these um these classes and you pass to OSHA ten training and use it a hands on assessment and the written assessment you get through all of it and you're still committed we're going to put you in um\nOur second tier of course which is one of the specific um craft areas so now the Georgia film academy as offering grip and reading\nWere offering lighting and electric and we're offering scenic which is set construction and and painting you know again you're not going to go into a classroom and read books and that you're going to go to one of our workshops and learn the trades that you're going to need and then finally\nOnce you pass these two classes you have the opportunity to sign up for the Georgia film academy onset production internship where we will put you\nOn a set on a on a stage on a professional production maybe a marvel movie or maybe it's Walking Dead or maybe it's one of the fast date movies we are going to put you on a set where you're going to work side by side with professionals\nAnd you're not only going to learn a specific trade but you're going to be of value to production\nWhy are we doing it this way the answer is what's really sort of unique about the entertainment industry is that it requires two different factors in order to go to work one is\nEnough knowledge and training and skills to as I say man to be of value to productions\nInto a foot in the door everybody seems to understand that to go to work in the entertainment business need to put in the door you need a break but before we put you\nOn to a set on one of our I'm a great sound stages here in the ... in the state before we go to Tyler Perry studios and put you into a production there we want to make sure that you know what you're doing and more specifically Europe value to productions\nSit down and talk to anyone who is a key grip or a cinematographer or a screenwriter or producer and ask him or her how he or she got their start has her start and you will hear stories about how as I'm saying they got a foot in the door they got into a set and they work their way through this process\nCan attest to everything that you say because I had been through the G s a one program\nAnd you're absolutely right it's most definitely a foot in the door in the right direction I think with a booming industry in Georgia a lot of people are being hoodwinked the lot of people are saying oh you can work with us on this and ... and we'll get in the industry and that's not necessarily the case\nAnd I think that our listeners should definitely visit your website and learn more about what schools they can actually\nEnrolled through and like I said if you are not interested in being a fulltime student that continuing education classes is another alternative one thing that I also like the the college program works with the work development terrorists as well so if you are unemployed\nIs another alternative one thing that I also like the the college program works with the work development centers as well so if you're unemployed if you a transition out of your job and you're looking to re enter into a different career\nThey have the funding and they have the resources available for you to go through one of their development centers you get the financing from them to attend continuing education\nProgram or even a college to a different program the G is a is a part of that certification through the college please do not call G s a asking how you can\nGet an application you have to go through one of the educational institutions like you said either the technical or the state colleges correct that's right now one thing that I Love about the G. S. A. is the fact that\nYou're instructors are more than overqualified you talked about the experience and I just have to brag a little bit on my instructor his name is Chuck car and truck and he was\nPhenomenal her ear and if you are a slow learner a fast learner a medium alert or it doesn't matter as long as you can just apply which you touch seat and feel and pass the test\nAnd you mentioned about how you're not just stuck in the classroom\nTalk a little bit about the tools and resources that you got to provide for people to learn about how to be successful onset because I don't think a lot of people understand when you say sound stage and when you say a production area you all have the same equipment that they have on set\nThank you Amanda so we're we're not playing around this isn't theory this isn't an idea we are literally training a workforce there are no other states have ever done anything even remotely like this\nWhy is this important because if you want to be a grip and you're actually working with grip stands and you know which way the nickel on a grip stand goes you're going to get hired by the way up to go to work\n... literally a on a production so again we're not going to show your pictures of cables were gonna put actual working cables in front of you and finally the Georgia film academy\nOperates directly with industry so what this means is when you come trained with us as you did Amanda at pine wood at lamb's studios were we operate a school and operate a sixteen thousand square foot sound stage\nSomething that no other schools are higher education\nInstitutions anywhere in the country probably anywhere in the world has you're going to learn in a in a facility that is exactly like the kind of facility that a few weeks later a few months later years later maybe you're going to be working on this is something that everyone in our state should be proud of\nThey really should be I have to say one of my most exciting moments was when we were walking from the G A fake classes over to the production area we walk past where the grip and electrical putting together the set in construction while putting together to sit for ... [laughter]\nAnd we're all just like why died and and and just glaring would we ... because we were like wow we're on a real marvel movie set\nYeah it was phenomenal and and our students are working now I'm On the U.S yes\nLet's talk about some of the classes I Know we talked about set construction scenic painting lighting and electric grid and regain\nAn introduction to special makeup affects these are some new classes at you as a post production film and TV ad editing digital imagery and for story craft one I'm actually going to go ahead and sign up for now a introduction to special makeup effects in production accounting\nThose are different is the need changing\nUm no so um ... what we're doing is growing what we're doing at the George film academy so before I say anything else\nIs the need changing\nI'm no so um what we're doing is growing what we're doing the George film academy so before I say anything else job one is in job one as far as I can see will always be putting Georgians to work right now Georgia really doesn't have a film and television industry\nHas a film and television production industry but we at the Georgia film academy who all share a vision believe that we in Georgia can have what\nLos Angeles has what New York has what bully what has what London has which is the bully ecosystem of a business right some talking ... about production but I'm also talking about content creation\nWhich means screenwriting and TV writing and I'm also talking about the other end of that pipeline which is post production\nI can talk with more specificity about this but once we start to do that once we start to train people as we are now doing as you've noted in these fields\nYeah it's a really difficult experience um because we're all human beings um and we all deserve access to basic healthcare so it's really hard to see\nReally difficult experience um because we're all human beings\nUm and we all deserve access to basic healthcare so it's really hard to see populations that have been forced from their home and haven't had access to consistent health care and how that affects all aspects of their lives and you know a lot of times we see a lot of mental health drama as well\nUm one part of the exhibition that we have is a virtual reality that you spoke of so it's actual actual patients that we've had an art projects that are giving their own stories and telling about their journeys that they've experienced along the way so you can hear firsthand from refugees and asylum seekers about the journeys that they face\nUm but yeah oftentimes these journeys are very treacherous\nSo what's the difference between a refugee and in the ... because I think a lot of times in the United states we just hear refugees cry a rape murder hey we're all the negative things associated with people who have been forced from their homes\nAnd I have a hard time with that because I'm thinking at one point these people's homes they have lives that could have been me you know and I was forced from my home and I didn't have\nAny type of food any type of healthcare just nothing literally just opposing my bat so tell us a little bit about the difference\nYeah sure well first I Want to speak to your point yeah these these people that are leaving their homes they're not doing so because they want to you know their normal life has been disrupted an up ended and these journeys that they're facing are not easy\nUm it's not something that somebody would want to do you know imagine leaving your home leaving your family here in Atlanta and not having you know in the going to the grocery store and not having food to by not being able to buy food\nUm ... that's not a journey that you would want to make oftentimes along the route you know people are facing violence especially women and children are are more vulnerable to sexual violence\nUm and we see that in many of our projects that we work in\nUm so it's it's very very difficult situation being faced I'm so you you asked about the difference between a refugee in an asylum seeker\nUm so the difference between a refugee and asylum seekers an important difference so somebody who is seeking asylum is fleeing persecution and violence in their home country and as applying to the UNH the our um which is the un high commissioner for refugees\nTo be resettled in another country um so once somebody has been granted their application for asylum has been granted that's when they will receive the refugee status\nOK so a refugee actually goes through the legal process of trying to get permission to be in a country yes someone who is an asylum seeker is trying to correct all through the process correct so complicated\nIt is and it's very few people that actually are resettled compared to the amount of number of people that are actually applied for asylum\nSo what happens\nUm well in some cases they're turned back\nUm and they're just being brought back to the very same context in which they're fleeing\nUm for example in Honduras um you know you have a lot of people that are fleeing the gang violence that's happening there I'm trying to make this treacherous journeys to reach safer ... safer countries um fleeing gang violence meeting a lot of treacherous journey as along the way\nWhat when I think about what you just said I think about myself and I and I think a lot of times\nAnd the news or when we hear reports of refugees and people seeking asylum Comey to other countries other countries not wanting them pushing them away is that the country will journey of putting them in makeshift space is just so that they can be separate from other people\nIt saddens my heart because I don't believe that people understand that when you say forced from\nIf space is just so that they can be separate from other people\nIt saddens my heart because I don't believe that people understand that when you say forced from home it's not like you get a thirty day notice to vacate no these people's doors are kicked in and they are forced to leave with whatever they have correct\nThat is correct I'm oftentimes they are given to notice that they have to leave their fleeing war situation so you could have\nUm your village that was bombed for example by infighting between rebel groups or um\nInner factional fighting whatever it may be and so you sometimes have to leave with what you have on you if you don't have time to grab your documents you don't have if even if you have documents um one thing that we look at an exhibition is like the concept of stateless people and the different rights that they are afforded versus\nA somebody that does have a nationality or does have citizenship um so yeah it often times these people are fleeing within thirty seconds and can just take whatever they have with them stateless what's that yes they're stateless person is somebody who doesn't have citizenship um and a lot of countries across the globe\nUm women for example when they give birth citizenship isn't automatically granted to their child\nSo um that child is stateless and doesn't necessarily afforded the production of somebody who does have citizenship\nSo when we talk about the exhibit um about a force from home you say they're different components of it is is that the Georgia world Congress center it's approximately ten thousand square feet yes walk us through what's going on and all of that [laughter]\nYes there is a free open to the public outdoor exhibition 'em and were set up outside in West plaza park\nUm when people arrived there actually given an identity card with a new identity that carries them through the entire exhibition experience and so they can either be an IT pie which isn't internally displaced person there can be an asylum seeker or refugees that that identity card stays with you and plays a role throughout your experience through the exhibition\nUm then you meet your guide 'em and you look at the different push factors um that have forced you to flee um then you're asked to choose very quickly um various different items that you would take if you were forced from home yeah\nI'm Still trying to really put people in that mindset in that situation of like okay wow I really only have thirty seconds what am I going to choose my going to choose my family heirlooms am I going to choose my life saving medications that I Need\n'em so really putting people in that experience um and then you look at various different context that I mentioned I'm brandy ... and Syria and Afghanistan\nUm and looking at the different medical complications and vulnerabilities that are refugees and people fleeing face\nEra that sounds absolutely amazing is like you have a first hand experience of what it's like to be forced from home based off what you've described the exhibit to be well take a quick break and we'll come back and talk more with Doctors Without borders about their forced from home
