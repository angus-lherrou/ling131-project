nature will be able to share is giving you access to the community\nFor for eight nine to two seven zero three so during the rubber Padilla sitting in for their Bozeman who was on those high seeds will be I Want to I have to find myself a good radio side hustle\nI mean I feel like everybody else got all kinds of the other stuff going on\nTo use their platform to uh you know get a couple of dollars in a pocket so y'all let me know what I Need to be doing 'cause this whole working things overrated I mean severely over it mellowed ah not not to to read on people but I have a client who I've represented for ten years\n'cause he stays in trouble once a year for ten years or the last case he had was a Twenty one town felony case or they were trying to put him in jail for Thirty years\nSo of course he didn't serve a day literally not out we're not a minute in jail um you know most of their charges dismissed beat the other ones and so he ... he owed me around thirty thousand dollars now you know former NFL player so he got it I called his brother today he's a man you know\nA man I had to pay my other lawyer so knob broke right now\nAlmost drove off the road so you paid your divorce lawyer but didn't pay your criminal lawyer you don't realize that if you are in jail you ain't gotta worry about No Child support or alimony or anything else because you're in jail for Thirty years I feel like that to be the priority\nIn your bill payment plan a strategy not you know the other way around you know I see your cell phone is still on your on your Facebook page at like eating good you know you ain't destitute living in a box you know\nMaybe I'm the one who's wrong maybe I misunderstand but you know that's part of the job when you were practicing while you kind of have to just do it and then hope that somebody decides to pay you when the spirit of the lord touches them and just the right way in order for them to be compelled by that spirit\nTo actually pay their bill and unfortunately you can sue them and then do follow the bar complaint claim malpractice than do end up suing you back and you'll still never collect the money you can send them to ... collection agency we all know how well that's ... that works all they do is just keep calling your phone\nOr even if you do get a judgment against them is almost impossible to actually get any money from them\nSo these are things that don't really tell you on ... bill law and order any of those other lawyer shows you the kind of assume lawyers get paid for the work they do but generally speaking if you click thirty percent of what you Bill you or have done an amazing job for this year going back to the phone lines\nOne thing we decide lazy and I decided to look up the actual ages of the people who are talking about running in twenty twenty so you've got John Kerry who was born in Nineteen forty three during World War two who is Seventy years old you got Joe Biden\nUncle Joe who was born a year before John Kerry during World War two in Nineteen forty two who was Seventy five you got Hillary Clinton you know she's a young ... she was born in Nineteen forty seven and she's Seventy years old\nAs long as these people continue to soak up all the money in the party all the airspace all the room\nIs very difficult for new voices to bubble up remember even an oh eight Obama they told him to just go ahead and be Hillary's vice president because he was too young to run then ain't nobody do a combined ticket he said no no no no go ahead and do this thing now right now\nAnd so it may take something very similar to that in a twenty twenty and away body will are Obama's running against Joe Biden a senior statesmen Chris Dodd a senior state when Hillary Clinton a former senator former first lady\nAlmost run against Joe Biden a senior statesmen Chris Dodd a senior state when Hillary Clinton a former senator former first lady\nAnd he had to go to overcome all of that why can't these people that are still going for the top spot themselves\nJust moving to that they've visor erode that Graham who bought role you raise money for people you get out there and campaign for them you talk to voters you give them leadership mentors ship you set the agenda for the party\nInstead of actually trying to be the candidate yourself let some young folks come up we had a on a Presley Beto O'Rourke we got all kinds of a young and exciting candidate around the country who are really ... really really ready to step up into that spotlight but they can't do it\nIf you still have these stole works so the party a standing in the way\nNot to say there's anything wrong with old people I Love old people I'm going to go hang out much Catherine um after the show today because I feel like and he spends more time with her\nBut at some point in time you have to transition over into that leadership role that mentor ship role instead of simply trying to continue after these goals dreams and aspirations you may have had from youth because there's nothing wrong with passing the torch on going to go to Vincent on line for Vincent\n[noise] hey ah you're right though you get ... you are\nBack on hold up think or you can hear us oh a sea of Lacey can get him on to make sure but all all the same note regarding the ah the historical nature of not moving inside let's understand that with President Obama\nDuring the time that he was president Democrats lost one thousand at forty four state local and national racist over the course of that decade or the that eight years that he was in office\nBecause they didn't bring up those bootstraps under them remember when President Obama left the dean the with nearly broke\nA Donald Brazil's on the show earlier this year and she explained that when she stepped in AS Party chair person it was impossible for them to have a a a a national apparatus because there was no money left in the party\nThen it ended up being they had to basically co mingled the Clinton money with the DNC money which is why they were able to rig the primary against Bernie because there was no additional money out there for other candidates\nSo instead of the reason for this was the entire time that Obama was a was president these other folks were out here raising money talking the donors solidifying the grass from power\nIn hopes that they will be the nominee and twenty sixteen it destroys the party to prop up this many older states persons who aren't involved in day to day operations of the part and then we have ... ... go ahead\nYeah can you hear me now\nAre All right you're right and see that ... a ramp them we're talking the other day about Cliburn talking about ain't going to get out of the way you know a resident crab walking around and care a lot you know get out and it makes me think of John ...\nI really didn't I don't I don't when I see or hear him all I hear talk about is him coming across the bridge and getting what\nYou know and all this year but I don't see the champions potential champions and potential fighters tomorrow he surrounding them and introducing us to the generation I'm off ramp had a young lady in our community who\nIs the national Action Network you meant you know on TALK Mary pat\nPat yes yes and even more he'd eat conditioning her and she joined in other you even want to turn this over to turn this over to the market and that's what has happened you're exactly right it's got its you know the valley\nAnd she joined in other you even what turned it over to turn this over to the market and that's what has happened you're exactly right it's got to get it if you don't develop any church you for tomorrow then you will we won't have no health tomorrow\nYou know just on that same no just look at the the civil rights organizations as an example so many of the titans of the sixties and seventies\nOr didn't bring up any bootstraps behind them remember wrote a Dr King raised a Reverend Jackson to follow in his footsteps most of the other organizations didn't do anything like that so when that person died or moved on a retired or couldn't work anymore\nWell there was there was no organization was the cult of personality so when they were gone the organization was going that's what we're seeing with the Democratic party as it slowly dies out because they will not invest in younger people coming up\nAnd making sure they have the resources they need to excite the party that they made no sense to me that the Republicans used to be the old white guy parties remember when you think about Republicans do you think of the audio white guys and a smoke filled [noise] doing their thing but right now the top three leaders in the house of representatives for the Democrat Steny\nI Am so we'll see so\nFor all for eight nine to two seven three unease and talked to Haiti W. A. okay [noise]\n\nDo you want answers so you can handle the truth\nIs on the [noise] too much true [noise]\n\nAll right we'll come back and talk protein eighty eight okay the voice of the community called in for for ... to to seven\nZero three also in our question somebody one of the groups that while you're talking about Democrats having old leadership why don't you talk about the old leadership in the Republican Party\nAnd you're right Chuck Grassley a deterrent judiciary chairperson about seven thousand years old I'm John McCain was older than dirt before he died a Lindsey Graham is a little bit younger was too old but the the differences Republicans recently had the Tea Party revolution\nSo between two thousand tend to the other and fourteen we saw an entire wave of new young are elected officials entering the Republican right\nThere were plays much of their leadership no even Paul Ryan who is still the speaker of the house currently a believe it's still in his forties so he's a younger gentleman um\nMcCarthy who is ... foods succeed him his in his early fifties um many senators that just Rand Paul a Ted Cruz are on the younger side so you have the Republicans\nHave an age issue in their party\nBut it is not a good optic when you have Marco Rubio um who's in his forties as a senator standing next to you know Dianne Feinstein who I think is I think she went to school with Cesar at one point in time so it is it's a bigger problem on the Democratic side because we have people who have been in there\nFor generations or Senator Leahy from Vermont I Believe had been in the Senate for forty four years that's too long to be on any job I never want a job for forty four years doing anything at all go home at the ...\n[noise] I don't really\nI'm very well I'm not on the phone I'm Will lead to the what we're we're looking at here when you talk about passing the knowledge on that's that's the reality yet it has to become functional and the format of unity within our our\nUm kill it as a people I'm\nNew to the gate with an fame by making it functional\nYeah oh yeah I'm not just you don't just want to pass it on for the sake of passing it on a oh does your you know you're thirty eight years old so you get to be the first in line no I'm not saying that but I Do think that you have to start grooming people from a from a young age from uh like Reverend Sharpton they will marry pat when she was I think twelve\nUh started studying under Janice when I was Seventeen or Eighteen or you have to start that training process to matriculate them through and so then by the time you're a voter age you can start you have the ability to pass it on to somebody who\nThe training process to matriculate them through and sold them by the time you're a boomer age you can start you have the ability to pass it on to somebody who who's still have the same values and that will just you\nKnow we we have to change that dynamic from passing on to living out in growing into the cause I I don't want to pass all the ability to represent us with other people to any one wild knocked\nThe developing an infrastructure with the remainder of the people the you know politics can make some ... out of leadership\nWhen leadership is Lee needed at all levels and\nWe we lose focus on the the the wealth and it is an absolute wealth\nOf different levels of border\nWe can be maintaining while we'll also utilizing those who will be best suited to be ambassadors\nTo other folks and that's the difference that we have a highly melon needed people\nCheering ourselves from the tragedy that we experience as a people over the last few hundred years so our our elderly people have to be functional with them so that we recognize going into that I'm\nLevel of ... and that's what we will be teaching about what sells services to ourselves\nWe have to understand the things we are not teaching ourselves\nFor our students that are are be diminished because of focus on a picture that is\nNot so much us but we are definitely a part of an affected by so we've got to balance to keep while we have elders and young dynamic men like yourself we're right in the mix of success\nIn the outer realm of what our community in the inner realm as well you can do the work to make\nMany more lawyers if we'd meet and hopefully we won't\nBut the the point being there was a ballot for our people that doesn't exist with other people's in the same manner they already have a ... in the ... culture\nTo to maintain their cultural dynamic from we are creative people and create chores for our

H. B. O. K.\nGoes for eight nine ... an oak tree on news and Dr ... eighty W [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] it seems as though it's it\nTakes to tell you wanna smoke don't talk\nAbout your tap married for almost race gender sexual assault sci fi channel [laughter] do you want to see\nSome money on something so we don't want to play\nSo why\nHave much\nOf our welcome back to those companies be calling for for\nA nine to two seven zero three you know you got to be on a certain mood and listen to the big ... just aggressive I mean that's a very detailed account of Robin old lady\nUh yeah man I might listen some country music or gospel after that I got to\nClinton's wants a spirit calling for a ... to to seven zero three are mega millions and Powerball or this weekend mega millions is over a billion dollars Powerball is like three hundred and Ninety million dollars of just letting you know no you're not going to win\nI'm just been completely for it with you there is no chance of winning there is a better chance of being attacked by dinosaur while trying to buy a lottery ticket then you actually winning the lottery the what the lottery is is a reverse excise tax on the poor\nWhat my by that I mean that basically what the lottery does is convince people who have very little money\nThe excise tax on the poor what meant by that I mean that basically what the lottery does is convince people who have very little money\nThat they should spend that money and give it to the government and then the government will use that to pay for his resources on the basically false hope that you'll get some money in return\nYou're taking from the poor and given to the rich so the government does is give themselves\nOr give the rich a one point seven trillion dollar tax cuts corporations named paying money millionaires ain't paying money billionaires ain't paying no money\nAnd that's why we have a two Twenty one trillion dollar national deficit and ... on the state levels in states can't run these same deficits they have to find a way to plug those holes in their budget a great way to do it is a lottery in casino gambling\nPlay on people's mental health in gambling addictions and then take their money their use their last four or five dollars a day ... um that they have\nAnd use that to sin rich kids to school because the GPA requirements for most states scholarship putting HOPE Scholarship disproportionately impact rich kids\nThis sounds like one of the worst Ponzi schemes on earth but\nSomehow we fall for it year after year time after time and allow the rich legislatures because you have to be rich from those for it to be a state legislator because the state legislature doesn't really pay you anything\nAnd who has you know two months to take off from work to service the legislator unless you have your own business you're or you're independently wealthy so those are the people who make the laws for us people either have a economic support system that allows them to do so\nOr individuals who are just simply independently wealthy and they do it as a hobby\nSo they pass bills that benefit themselves so every time you're playing the lottery you were just putting money into some rich white person Sam's with a the minimum is\nI mean the minimum is opportunity at ever winning and not to mention the you know why the lotto jackpots have been so much bigger the last couple of years you know every once in a while back in the day you have a hundred million dollar Jack Potter two hundred million dollar jet but doesn't seem like it's always two three four hundred million dollars now\nBecause the lotto change the algorithm result team fewer people winning per year which allows for them to have bigger jackpots build up\nIsn't that brilliant it sounds like it's a rigged game where they can just change the algorithm to allow the uh to allow the jackpot to build up even higher\nSo stop playing their game stop being involved with it may make really tough governmental decisions made them make the tough decisions on cutting spending or raising taxes are finding some other way to support the government\nOther than raiding the pocket so poor old grandmas who think they are going to make it with the lotto going back to the phone lines where Walter online for Walter\n[noise] I don't [noise] I don't know where to start you how to build a cap is like um ground laying or Jackson State\nUm you ever seen that side of the old players Clark Clark ... mean playing anybody but somebody all quarks level\nBut North Carolina and went to is Caroline how to handle business and handle business pretty well and they get paid a six figure come forward\nAnd that six figure calm support the schools athletic budget\nAnd look it it's great that it supports the athletic budget but every year\nThat six figure incomes supports the school's athletic budget\nAnd look great that it supports the athletic budget but every year or so some little black boys gives his butt heads would open a her spine broken have run into these big over ethnic doors so why sacrifice them but\nBut some black child at all mass or tested again at Harvard so what difference does it make\nIt real violent sport at those schools they have that toppled the line and see see me and I do not have the same money if they see you have they do they\nHave it but the athlete their father athlete\nHey grandma ... exactly staying at Arkansas Pine Bluff here just as big as a kid at LSU it's Carolina or they wouldn't be able to beat them\nAnd sell it all the games are competitive and some of them or not but the main thing is is that you're gonna get hurt by playing the sport Patel oh whether you're at any level plan to get anybody\nBut look now at ... absolutely no difference and run into them boys out there the bus they had open that gives the big written the boys than they're doing it for valley horn them girls out to every businessman who wait a minute either you're doing this latest thing your whole body like\nDid you like this so lost to their friends when your alma mater went down in Baton Rouge and they got they tell it\nTo them by a son and and they're not on the same level clock is much smaller school will solve the soul wants to debit between a choir going out there and getting crushed my southern or suddenly coming up here and getting crushed by Georgia not then I'll pay\nThe difference is Nick Saban is the highest paid employee in the state of Alabama the Georgia football coach at the highest paid employee in the state of Georgia the Lsu football coach\nAt the highest paid employee in the state of Louisiana these folks are competing on a an entirely different levels Nick savings contract could take care of the entire a UC football budget for the next ten years they're dealing with a different kind of medical care they're doing for different kinds of trained routine they didn't want\nTo die for ... medication you how'd you love your plan just NFL players\nBut the pillow every other year are you set one child gets his head split open right now\nGiven Saturday they're getting their head split open game ... white schools against other big why schools and I get a game and I just gave you a scenario and two black schools\nThat are on our on the same level and wants to go to the gas mask but after that if you don't have you know some of them coming in Georgia in Utah alone car going at Jackson State I Know you don't want that\nWell the only one the reason I didn't like the court versus southern game could have been got blown up by play trombone back in the day but to you're still at least dealing with people who are on the the ... who are on a similar athletic level of a similar training you know it was you know what you want to look I'm Still not like you said about long enough\nOh wow so you go first okay All right so first of all of what what was her name um

paralleled with with what you have she's smart enough to have at least somebody\nSix days a week right so she had six of them and then she was seven correct\nYeah it's a it's a leash law Jeanette Johnson ... years old ... from Fort valley right so she had a game plan ... a lot\nThe football team or the bachelor the ... you see where I'm going to you know I think for Sally ... they really have something going on I think they really have good plans are but the word that she used that she didn't do anything illegal or ... that's a little stretch\nIt out even if you read and write a story from a Ernie ... in a ... just in the AJC but they really do detail all the charges against the individuals and apparently this was going on for a long period of time they just happened to finally get caught and ... and the case or matriculate to find out more information Jay what's your take on it\nMy first take when I first started this was wow um that's when you look at some point you have to look at things and you know maybe we went a little bit too far now\nWow I'm that's when you when you look at some point you have to look at things that you know maybe we went a little bit too far now in all fairness I'm\nFull disclosure I didn't go to college I went straight to the military mhm okay um I've heard stories of this their stories of that you always hear that stuff so I've heard of\nI'm not going to name any particular sororities Marines anybody's um fraternities cars on along the hate mail ... right but you know you hear stories of\nYes for lack of a better word these young ladies being pimped out to these fraternity guys you know when they are sweet hearts or whatever\nDiamonds and so on to another or I don't want like I'm not\nI'm not as deep in I'm not deep into it because that's not my my space that's not my area but of course I have a lot of friends and went to college and what have you in um you hear about it and you know everybody in line so this is another level of it in the words of the great negro poet a temp see the game is deeper\nThan just working off the beep or you know this isn't that so as with anything if anybody you've ever done anything there are different levels to it so now where we're at the levels at one point were just okay we're loaning them out to our\nFraternity friend\nThe next level is a man you pay me I hook you up with her or we're you know this is the next this is another or the next level where someone else says you know what\nYou need this they have this this is what you gotta do to get\nSay no I think also it's

Africa Obama had to defend the white woman\nNo no no no no no no no they call it a black man to Jack ass but you're was the ... you can defend the white will know has not everyone you know how race related it rather everything is race related she could have bad ... from Star Trek every day when he did that he was he was being a jacket and he had\nJumped up like that in front of a little mom or somebody who was hot back then he ...\nHe told them all Robert home all come along with\nObama has an instinct because of his mom to protect white women\nLike that's what I was just a genetic if it helps them in in ... I'm not gonna I'm not going to ... I'm not going to bite on that look why he left in limbo let me say this\nI Am not a big as President Obama fan I'm not to be his detractors\nI'm not going to bite on there and look why he left in limbo let me say this\nI Am not a big as President Obama fan I'm not to be the tractor I'm not the biggest fan when I won't do is fight on that because you gee that's a set up he is\nHe being a jackass look how ... how about something that I was kind of wondering why am I Wonder if past services because\nYou were black sometimes they're just a bad server\nBut look how about this how many people got shot in Chicago and they do or do bomber show up how many people got shot at Sandy Hook how long did it take to Obama to get a plane up there the crowd them a little white children\nOh my God these little way be well I'm going to save from all that you should send about tables with Hokkaido coming favorites really learn a lot of contacts\nLet me jump in on that and this is this is this one kind of pains me honestly does pay me and that is that um if you saw me in the middle of the street walking with my shirt off\nI Would call the ...\nYou would try to help me you say hey Jay ... what's going on now if you saw me for three months walking down the street when my shirt out you lie on his J I hate to make this analogy but that was not a normal occurrence in Sandy Hook\nAs much as it pains me to say and we'd decisions where desensitized to it we would because it was happening so frequently in uh Chicago it was a normal occurrence\nBut of course it was a normal occurrence so they're the reaction is going to be different and we have to be fair about it but\nTo be fair about a governmental actually can actually affect shootings in places like Chicago because those guns don't just\nLook at him they on the state of Illinois in order to hold on let me get\nTo it so those girls aren't just grown up on the ground that cocaine isn't just ruin somewhere on ... a cottage grove but meanwhile the school shootings or almost impossible to stop because they're completely random occurrences that can happen anywhere in the country\nIn any given time there's literally nothing you can do to stop them from happening you can't armed teachers can't armed security guards you can't hurt him to school so why didn't he addressed the after political issue that he could affect and fix which is violence in Chicago which governmental action could actually do is it a crime what's the little white kids\nWell um I Can't say too 'cause you make a good point and I don't know about the government action everything fixed and all that but you're right is she should've addressed it more but to marginalize the Sandy Hook shootings\nUm that that's yeah that's not fair well no that's not your marginalizing that but in in again in the in fairness in in context that it was not a normal occurrence up there wasn't it wasn't anything that we see all the time so they're just going to be a different reaction you would agree with that\nI feel like we see school shooting every week okay we're going to do that we have a final you agree with that ... out I couldn't agree with that but I won't say that we have enough school shootings where you can look at some point some white children suitable schools to three times and I don't\nCare if they were white Chinese black or whatever when you have a hole in the white finished we have a school shooting\nThat killed five and six year old children anything is tragic okay ram mother is dying is tragic a a an eighty nine year old grandmother dying as tragic as fifty nine year old\nMother or forty nine year old mother is a is even more tragic I'm twenty nine even more Nineteen nine five as we go down is even more tragic 'cause that's less life that has been bought five\nYear olds get shot what'd you aren't gonna come on mom\nI'm a pin you down or would you agree with that\nActually oddly enough I Would ... you ... ...\nAbove five year olds get shot what did you want to go I'm I'm I'm I'm a pin you down or would you agree with that part actually oddly enough I Would ... you ... do they know you wouldn't\nYou wouldn't cry more over a five year old and lives in\nEighty nine year old has done more they've they're you're losing more with them you're losing eighty nine years of knowledge and experience losing eighty nine years\nI had ever had a ... you're losing out there and never had that ... yeah you're right you're you're losing\n... their generations after eighty nine year old they're going to more of them who looked up to them they're matriarchal patriarch started to feel worse for the old person dying but that does make them a greater with a hundred and six when she\nDied so I like old people but [laughter] but um but my point about the ... we got we got sidetracked my point on that is that because Obama called him a name\nThe white woman would not go and protect Chicago were literally take any action into when thousands of people were getting shot Kanye saying you know what I'm going to go to the other team I'm going to have to put some consequences behind what I said so widely he gets rejected for actually doing what we all say we should do\nTanya a didn't get rejected for doing what we all say on do I think you're I'm over ... over simplification um\nHe wasn't jackass when he did what he did period point blank that's that's non negotiable now like how you set it up and you know and a um as the as the um what's that does it you know when to what is the movie was even tried it and I'm a GED brothers\nThe voice of the community calling for for eight nine to two seven zero three yes the last statement continued all the way through the break on this discussion that we're just having so I was about to go to the front lines but let's continue this we're just a second so we had this question during the break about Obama versus Trump\nWho is a quote unquote\nHarder president and and so my definition articulation of order if somebody who does who does not care about the consequences of exercising their power or there will over other people think Andrew Jackson oh you like having a bank I don't want to have a bank I'll shut down the second bank of the U.S think\nProven hey we don't need to bomb Japan we can do the blockade them they are in decline already\nDropped two of 'em on them to new I don't care\nThat's why I mean about how we're in strengthen the ability to exercise that power so cash you were saying that Obama wasn't a soft president I feel that he was\nSofter than Egypt and caught him so ... explained to me how he can't be considered soft we was so afraid to exercises that will power particularly when it came to black folks\nMy argument wasn't about ... or or just by the sound weird whether or not soft or hard especially the show yeah right right yeah we're we're but it is is about\nUm more than what has he done for my how I look\nThat was that that was more of what I was talking about so far it doesn't matter so for heart is about okay what is he doing for me I don't care if the due to the harder to do it on the block if he ain't doing nothing for by a car it don't matter but that that\nThat isn't the issue that has been table isn't that what he's doing so he was not the issue that has been tainted dishes has been table is whether he was\nSoft or hard is that correct Robert yeah yeah that's good that's that's the address this issue of\nMemorial Day because I didn't know they are going to ... I thought it was on hold on a claim I turn on your photo [laughter] I'm In a plane while being a soft\nOr hard president matters because if President Obama was more on the mold of a a Andrew Jackson or Donald Trump or one of the president did literate just don't care and go do what he feels like then when you had George Zimmerman killed Trayvon\nObama will just shot him to a drone he don't care what you don't think Trump will do that then when it comes to things like affirmative\nAction he'll just push it through he's not worried about whether he would win re election he doesn't care how it affects the electoral college he doesn't care how to fit the Turks do you want her to the lawyer but he didn't care he just wants to get it done he wants to push his agenda through and a lot of us that's what\nWay more than you think you'll get a little bit so alright Coby Coby scores eighty point six reports\nA deploys again doesn't go to the playoffs doesn't do anything LeBron is considered solve writing an NBA no they just become more now they skipped Bailey says the call him so this is the old or a ... a lot of people don't know\nAnd ... on his income on a lake ... skip the call him so this is the old or a ... a lot of people don't feel that okay go okay look around and so\nBut what what does he go every year so the fine okay because point taken so\nYou ... your ... I don't know how how how do you know I Know you don't study I'm OK outside of the other and I'll jump in here but it's a difference\nThat a robbery or not we will because we weren't talking about what someone did for us because that isn't\nOkay so the whole image though I'm a jungle you're worried about Mormons are involved in order to be worried about so\nNo it's not the image what we were discussing is the lack of will the lack of and that's probably that's where you are referring to the Bronx now lack of will the lack of killer instinct whereas Donald Trump uses the bully pulpit I mean as a means to an end\nHe uses whatever tools they need right whether Obama does\nPresident Obama let every elected Republicans defined him\nAt every turn he never reply the ways it's the way that Donald Trump and nothing else we call him stupid we call him dumb we call them crazy become everything in the world you know he does she fights back he pushes back he pushes back\nThey called President Obama everything in a book see let me let me let me get here being docile is not always the solution okay getting picked on and never fighting back is not always the solution okay and let's be let's be real America likes a fighter\nAmerica like hates weakness America when it comes down to a we're not talking about who you are we talking about who we are as a collective so\nThe American um America they like someone who fights back punches back and gives it to him now I had this discussion when President Obama was a first run and everybody's like well he's he's not that person is not that person you have to fight the fight that you were in not to fight that you want to be okay\nYou already got me you got me you got me you got Robert well maybe not Robert yeah me we got you cast he already had us the people that you don't have\nThose are the ones that you have to go out and get those are the people like they want to say okay gotta love fire and his belly you know he's ... vinegar and that's what you all don't understand the concepts will be nice to be nice no you've already got the nice vote\nNow you have to go out and get the folks that you do not have oh like ... or\nYou know that they stop basing ... when the pirates wanted him to face them you do you feel like a parent but when your own fight so this whole this whole segment with a comparison about Obama in ... it was a contrast styles\nIs not about Obama and Trump congressional styles whether it be Obama Trump jacks and I'm\nIn ... whomever ...\nAnd ... this is the reason I won't go in between twenty\nWhat we're seeing are contracting styles all of a sudden Cory Booker went from being ... and that's why I don't like about Cory Booker when Obama was president\nCory Booker was like Obama he was nice and professorial and you know saving women ... or ... buildings and stuff now Trump is mean now Cory Booker is me and he's doing Spartacus moments all of a sudden he's yelling in the eyes of bugging out Democrats have to develop a natural personality and quit just right on the waves Ryan pick something that you actually want to live in\nYou have to fight the fight that you are in not to fight that you want to be in and when Democrats understand that and grass that concept then they will move forward until the end is no\nWhen we know James Carville I'm Sorry to solve this quote um they represent James Carville on MORNING Joe this morning and when like he was or represent about Michelle Obama said when they go low we go high James Carville said no\nRepresent James Carville on MORNING Joe this morning and when like these are represent about Michelle Obama said when they go low we go high James Carville said not when they go low you kick him and I think that is the mentality that you have to develop now\nI'm going to go so far that I Want to I don't want to uh put off any uh falcons fan now mom myself I'm a Kansas City the fate okay and we we are both of our teams have had that same problem over the years\nYou they didn't have the dog you know they have they're going to let me see if you don't you don't have that finishing you don't have that that in you to finish it off so I'm not done enough of those who ... was it she said the same thing you have to be able to put somebody away and instead of\nPutting somebody away the Democrats want to help you up in Russia often okay you're with us and you know what happened\nThe person that they help up and Russian mafia slap some did in the face\nAnd I I think for for me the thing is if you're going to do if you're going to be the fighting party\nDon't be fake don't be you know than it don't make it just obvious you just put 'em on for the cameras um Spartacus I don't care about getting kicked out of the city if you do have you didn't hear you leave right now took what were we were to be just be you would also be an authentic\nVersion of you not to them you know manufactured made for TV here's okay funneled

the eagles had played all season\nSo I wondered if it could be a springboard same thing with the cowboys\nWho may handle the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Redskins\nWho ran the ball and they were steady about it and so other than the giants which are probably not a team that can win the NFC I guess logistically they still can but likely won't you got these other three teams that are vying\nFor first place and supremacy at this point in the season in the division\nAnd I wondered which of these teams would use week six as a catalyst and a springboard and would then put together a couple of good games because then you start to establish a pattern\nWell\nOnly one of them did now we had the Redskins and the cowboys on CBS by the way facing each other and week seven it was a nationally televised game in the late afternoon window east coast time second round of games regardless of where you are\nAnd it was Washington that put together back to back victories and now takes over I shouldn't say takes over stays in Seoul\nPossession of first place in the division and the formula is pretty familiar when it comes to the Redskins another hundred seven total yards from a lot of

I'm also a bunch of goes oh we're not gonna snows over budget cut us off in a extra Institute with us from us\nNow really impressive and again that went down to the wire something the patriots they go on the road\nThey beat Chicago and if you look at the end of the AFC standings excuse me they do have still just a game lead over the Miami Dolphins\nBut obviously already took care of them in their first match up with the season and things are reverting back to form it in that division\nAlso kind of nice for the Steelers that they don't play and we can never set and they have their by week but everybody else in the division last which means the Steelers are now on top of the AFC North\nThe Texans have won four games in a row they pile on with the jaguars who are going through an existential crisis\nJay Moran vi doing a little more talking on Sunday but you're going to have\nTo read between the lines about the issues not only that exploded in the locker room after the game but the the fact that these Jacksonville Jaguars can't get out of their own way\nWho you are walking here you are the ... the ah we rode with these earlier Weaver source of the causes of what's going on here right now in a way to go see 'cause no okay but they know Seeger was going on or\nBoom hell no\nExcuse me I Know you have a nine o'clock so I'll keep the short I'm a business suit in the back of your closet you warming nearly every day before your office went quote casual\nI used to be the c._e._o. of your closet now I'm just out one interns no one ever talked to I always thought you'd circle back with me get granular keep me in the pipeline but not\nNothing don't you remember the ... presentation\nYou still coffee on me and I still looked amazing during the break out talk back human eight so I think it's time for me to move on I got a great resume and I absolutely crushed in interviews okay let's make this a clean break shift the paradigm the only thing I ask that you think outside the box here and do this\nTake me to goodwill where I can really make a difference\nYour donations to good will create new jobs training programs and education assistance for people in your community to find your nearest donation center\nGo to goodwill dot org donate stuff create jobs a message from goodwill any ad council\nAll of you to stop what you're doing [laughter]\n\n[noise]\n[laughter] you\nKnow there are many ways\nWhere do you do go click or W.

local news President Trump said they kept Brian Kemp would be a great governor and also said that Stacey Abrams is totally unqualified\nDo this and this is a black is the mall where you know think training ... they're saying this\nOr is this is a laser and the way they have the actors talking it's like they are trying to get to\nThe uninformed strictly about mosaic and try to persuade down in a different direction because you know this planned out the way they got it um\n[noise] uh I'm totally act out but wanting to know that that is making us talk with each other\nAnd all of them are so I think that you know it's going to make a stronger more than more than anything else I don't think it's hurting us I think there's more of embarrassment and I think people are going to move to Korea\nUm who we really are on to the public\nWill sell yeah\nThank you brother alright yeah right well\nYou do I appreciate your calling you inside a don't forget\nThat November fourth Stacey Abrams Brian Kemp and the libertarian candidate Ted meds\nWell actually debate on channel two W. as be TV dot com and the W. as the TV news at what all play it live this will be a debate just a few days before the actual election now\nIt just really should just be Stacey Abrams a Brian ... but the libertarian candidate will be allowed to participate or he's going to be a distraction\nThat's all he will be a distraction or and possibly take away valuable time from the two people who actually have a chance of winning\nBeing that you you moderate a lot of debates cause you break down for the listeners what goes into\nA debate for a candidate like how do you prepare for such did that research you do a tremendous amount of research I've\nModerated local debates a congressional debates the whole nine\nThe first place you start is understanding the nuances understanding the differences and also connecting those differences to the will of the people and once you have an understanding of that and and that's fundamentally different from city to city county to county district district\nThen you have a base to start from\nI recall young Julian moderating the mayoral debates in the state of Atlanta and there were a couple of people running who decided not to answer my questions I Know a lot of people\nLooked at the time when a when the young lady a merry did not answer my question but the truth is she wasn't the only one the reason why that went viral is because\nWhen I went back at others who were running to ask then my second time they decided to go ahead and answer the question but with her she decided to steal not answered the question so created this weird moment at this back and forth moment that went viral\nSo as I Know you said used to work\nWith the Democratic or a party how would you prepare your candidate for a debate won't you had to make sure the knowledgeable on the issues and doing that it's sometimes difficult given\nType of a lecture you run it many times the\nAnd doing that is sometimes difficult given the type of electric you run it many times there are questions that you know absolutely will be at the other thing you do is you study the moderator and you study the paddle is who are involved\nA few of the debates I have moderated\nWe also have a panel and that panel is allowed to ask questions\nUnderstand that if your panel represents the Hispanic coalition expect questions about that so doing basic research on who's actually asking the questions and what organizations are allowed to put forth a question can help you train your candidate they also some tricks\nOr there was one guy we're running an African American males in the city of\nI think it was fair deal\nI think it was fair deal this was years ago and he did win that election but I remember doing during debate prep\nI had him carry around a pocket constitution\nAnd he had the constitution in his pocket and also told him to carry around the city charter in his pocket and the city charter had all kinds of crazy stuff that nobody really knew so the guy he was running against a typical white male candidate\nWhen it got to the point of where one candidate got to ask the other Kennedy the question\nI told my guy to ask him something really obscure that's in the city charter now this guy was already an elected official serving on the council and we pick the most obscure thing and we just knew his opponent would never know it and yes his opponent didn't even know the answer to the question\nOr our opponent did and I point it went so far I mean our Kennedy went so far as to say or to the opponent hey I actually carry around a constitution and the city charter every day because I Believe in this country and I believe in the city it was all bogus and they move out\nBoth are a lot of work a lot of preparation goes into into these debates my final question for you is being that this debate is three days before the actual election yeah how big is this and how much could it sway voters\nIt's not as big as it used to be it used to be huge to have the base like this right before the electric because of the ... the advent of early voting and absentee voting\nAnd so you're going to have a large sliver of the electorate already participated now here's what's interesting I'm Julian there are some states that actually allow you to go back and change your vote some states allow you to go back and change your vote if you changed your mind Georgia's not wanted them by the way but there are some states that if you voted early and you saw a debate is oh goodness\nWhat have I done I voted for the wrong person I Need to change my vote some states allow you to change your vote as long as it is done before the final day of the electorate\nWe steal the election day and that's really\nFlaw that's wrong because election day\nIs no longer election days election days the last day of the election is what we really should be saying oh November six is not election day November six it's the last day of the electorate today is election day tomorrow is election day the next day is election day you've got election day until November\nSo because of that these debates are not\nAs effective as they used to be [noise] [noise] yeah they should have already done it if I remember that takes agreement from both camps for zero for eight now too to seven zero

plane was ...\nAnd that's one connection that I haven't heard made those of us who are in the news and in the know watching these events take place\nThere's a causal connections between the two and when we talk about America and it's a influence throughout the world corrupt as it is\nIt when we talk about these assassinations we have to connect those with the deaths and the bombings and the drone stove a Obama and all these other presidents they're all dirty or their hands are all feel with the special another reason why I could never\nSupport this corrupt system unless it's under duress which were forced to do\nBut I wouldn't want to ask you the question and a jihad brought this up and it's something that I have seen and I'm sure if we watch television we see more and more uh [noise]\nUh this this a white man I'm Brian Mann white woman a connection that they're creating\nOn the commercials and then all of the television as a young man and living in this system and understanding a political strategy what do you see that as a the the reason why they are promoting\nAgenda and I can tell your mom after I hear yours if you don't mind not clarified the agenda\n[noise] uh I Know I'm asking you ... if you have seen\nThis a phenomenon on television where they are connecting in the news is a black man I'm Sorry the white woman uh with the black man in the movies\nIs do black man with a white woman just just about every aspect the media had they're showing a black man and commercials with a white woman\nHad I gone through that okay that's what that's what I'm asking\nRight here don't that's not true um ... there was a report and I think this report is from twenty Seventeen so it's not an old report um but it's the talk shows that basically eighty eight percent of all commercials are still done\nWith the same race on race actors so basically your commercials will show all white people\nAre all black people are all Hispanic people give it the market that they are attempting to influence so in the end of the day you may see an increase perhaps but it is still nowhere near the majority of what you're saying\nThe television commercials and the reason why is because these commercials are meant to do one thing they're not meant to create a diverse utopia of America they are meant to promote an influence people to buy something\nSure should I say that the point that ah I see in this uh uh what I see this growing incidence of this type of a imagery\nHas to do with the ... the fact that black people in this country have no culture because they have no culture they are that they sting their inability to promote the ... the legacy of their own ancestors through the infusion of white\nCulture is a interest and\nThe legacy of their own ancestors through the infusion of white\nCulture is a interest and I believe that that is because not a utopia in this country that they're trying to develop but a system where people forget where they come from as we've seen we're I guess we're the experimental guinea pigs\nOf the world to show that if you raise a generation of people within a culture\nThey come from a ... and and that a different culture that they can virtually eliminate\nAny connection with their own ancestry through uh the imagery that we see happening on television that some of us said than to maybe\nSo I that's one of the things that I asked seen it because we bring the culture we is no holidays no nothing you know when Tiger Woods came into golfing they say I guess now we're gonna have watermelon and chickens and cows gains in our food now\nYeah so ... that that was one ignorant individual who said that and what I Try not to ever do is\nQuantify everybody in some general statement because anytime you generalize people you're guaranteed be guaranteed to be one thing and that is wrong everybody is not the same so I I get your point your point is that there's a\nDiluting of the culture which is true but the looting of the culture did not start with the commercialization of our society it didn't start with a celebrating holidays\n[noise] no no it started with the uh what they call the caricatures that were created when we first got here which started the self hatred whether I was the lips a hair knows is these are things that you ...\nWhat's your you do I do understand that culture\nIs always transforming progressing\nIf you ask right now particular historical tribes in Africa that try to keep close to the tradition of their ancestors they will tell you stories\nAbout how things used to be and how today they are different as well even though in our societal understanding as Africans in America we would think that they\nAre ... are not only closely\nI in relation to activity and culture try ancestors but they are an exact duplication and they will tell you they are not\nThey will tell you that historically from their point of view society they have also

he's not going to stand up to the national Rifle Association that's why they're running all these ads against me up because they want the man that they bought\nA in my case we're prepared to stand up to the n._r._a. they sued me they drop me to court for two years all because we said we would not allow guns to be shot in a city park\nRadical that you cannot shoot guns in a park for our kids play in our family picnic that's why people are so incensed by this that because common sense and decency seem not to be able to prevail in this compromise I think\nThe the problem than Andrew has though

understand is\nThat communities will experience crime\nOr just in Jacksonville earlier today ... ... people shot\nThe question is what are we going to do about it and what I'm going to do is take on the n._r._a. and hold them responsible for the rent and crime and I\nI Want to ask you a miracle and Broward County sheriff Scott Israel is a supporter of your campaign the Florida department of law enforcement is currently investigating sheriff Israel for his handling of the Parkland massacre even though he told me an interview that he thought his leadership was amazing do you think his leadership was amazing\nThough I don't I think they were failures on on on many sides quite frankly I'm I think Scott Israel is independently elected by the people to Broward County and they're the ones who will have to say about what they think about his job but\nMore importantly or it isn't easy tactic to go after Scott Israel rather than actually taking on the folks who are complicit and the kind of rent the van is that we see not only in our schools but in our neighborhoods are kids right now are going to school having to be taught what to do an active shooter drills\nA rather than on the arts and science and language arts and history and culture and politics\nAnd it was literally terrified that if they drop their kids off at school they want to know when they go to pick them up where they pick them up alive or in body bags that is unacceptable in this state and we deserve a governor who is going to stand up to one of the largest and most powerful lobbies who stand in the wake of any form of commonsense gun reform\nFor three of the way to keep people safe is to have accountability for the people that let our communities down our parents\nShare of Israel what that community down the school board and the school administrator let the community down they adopted a promise program which said\nIf a school student is getting into trouble we're going to pretend that he's not committing offenses that individuals should have been arrested and of course the FBI who ignored that pleading for help from that great lady in January\nNobody has been fired at the FBI we have a crisis of accountability at all levels of government I think Israel should have been removed from office by the governor now and I think there needs to be changed in both Broward and and the FBI as a result of this this failure\nThat was our defenses and that Gillum debating in Florida gubernatorial race very tight race there just as in the state of Georgia Brian Kemp and Stacey Abrams for zero for you not to to seven zero three\nSo how do these two races in Georgia and Florida how will the shape the outlook of our national politics\nThere's a real are transferable value to having certain people in office even if they technically are not in federal office so let's say Stacey Abrams gets elected in the state of Georgia how does that really impact the country will number one\nIndividual running for US Senate and U.S Congress and the state of Georgia they will be able to benefit from the fund raising power of a democratic black female governor that's number one messaging is free but distributing your message costs money so that gives them\nThat gives the minute an advantage they don't currently have in addition to that it allows for the state\nTo begin its own situation of what is important governor's set priorities in every state they run and so have you have a black female Democrat and a black male Democrat running Georgia\nThey they run and so if you have a black female Democrat and a black male Democrat running Georgia and Florida respectively you will you will see a real difference in their list of priorities\nSo\nWe'll Georgia voters do Georgia voters should vote Georgia voters have a\nVested interest in this race in Florida\nThey should pay attention to it but they have more of a vested interest in the race in Georgia but they should pay attention to it because it was worth understanding\nHow your politics is working his state's next to yours because a lot of times\nThese values are connected to the values of the state right next door so I think it's really important to understand right now you have to black people and to ... southern states who are running neck and neck with a traditional white male candidate has ever happened before I had the same time no is the first time this happened at the same time\nBut further down the road than Stacey Abrams they basically were on the same page with HOPE Scholarship he wanted to see
