about your speech to the extent that I said if I had been there I Would a slap on the air out of view how would you have responded today\nOkay so let's let's step back for a minute you're saying if I say the speech yesterday and then you criticize my speech on social media or in my face\nOn social media oh and then you on social media decided to threaten me exactly okay I mean that's happened before Sarkozy exactly what I Do I'll be read and when I see\nI'm Sorry to be ready when I see you if you are big enough and bad enough to threaten to my physical safety on social media and I've approached a brother before who threatened me on social media I saw a man and a bit and I walked up to\nAnd I asked them what we need to do what's going to happen here we are and he was quite a as a church miles\n[noise] and you know you're making my car because this is what\nShe did and well what he said and what he did on social media to cognac and when you talk about this kind of ... and I'm Glad that you a genuine truthful about that bear peacemakers and there are\nPeople who promote violence\nYeah I don't bother to do when you when you threatened my physical safety\nI Need to know what we are going to do I need to come see about you if I see you publicly somewhere and I know you've already said here's what I'm going to do to reside Ritchie one I see him if I see you publicly I don't need to run I Need to figure out what we're going to do today are we going to dance and what was going to happen\nOr see that's my point because she I did do that and say that all social media to ... and ... was man enough and big enough to overlook that because he has a bigger purpose\nThat's fine well I tell you this brothers are typically I Do not take the high road\nIn the to overlook that because he has a bigger purpose\nYeah that's fine well I tell you there's brothers are typically I Do not take the high road\nI take the same road you came traveling all I've been doing that for a long time now sometimes I Will take the high road I use my judgment to figure out what's the best route to take but if you go out of your way to threaten my physical safety or the physical safety of those that I Love I'm a man first\nAnd I will if I see you went public I Will say something to you\nKnow if you want to argue with me about politics the platform and philosophy and agendas no of course not there's no need for that but if you came to me with violence if you came to me was the threat I Need to let you if I say you somewhere\nWill see a game at ... ... what you're doing we no biggie is dead\nPocket gay their various other political and social rat on\nHis interesting to me that you are putting it seems as if you're putting the blame on the person reacting to a physical threat why not put the blame on the person making the physical threat in the first place\nYou can actually see I made the physical threat\nYeah telling me here's here's what I'm worried that if ... just being one hundred and ... stepped up to ... I wouldn't advise him to do so but if he stepped up to the un said chip you threatened me let's ... what are we going to do I wouldn't blame you for that\n[noise] well you know but you are missing the point was to our generation of children to have seen people like tea a likes Newt a write you on the intelligent very intelligent people right well we'll promote violence\nNow I don't him oh about ... days for me I'm a very peaceful man but if you're going to step out of your way to physically threatened me\nYes sir and I so they use the only way we need to have a conversation about that we need to talk about this\nYes sir but the point is continue to and you and you were in the uh the comedian\nOr Sinbad response\nHis response was moderate and indicated the individuality of the individual being able to say and believe for the wrong key I mean this the gangster life is going to threaten a man who's trying to peel character business social\nWell that's exactly on me and then when I tell you guys building a economic strength within the Atlanta community specifically the west to an area of Atlanta in addition to that he has a curse an entire generation to understand the concept of ownership\nA he has a remarkable mentoring program right here in the city of Atlanta so when you talk about this in reference to hold on hideous wait a minute wait a minute did you when you say these things in reference to continue doing all this positive stuff yeah and then you call someone like ... low life simply because he disagrees with ...\nHere's the thing no no no we is threatened him\nOkay and if Khan gay some in Congress stepped up to the gym I Would have absolutely no blame for ...\nSeeing it it's not that he still if he was not what you would blame room for stepping he took the high road this man is trying to think about the economic power of his people\n... Yes sir he didn't say that yes he did it go ahead\nAnd eat raw a prison reform to the president was so has the clean energy to the president so has the media has I think you laid out all of those is you\nThis has to play instead of having infighting and trying to ...\nAll of those issues\nOf this just apply instead of having infighting and trying to ... and demeaning individuals who are working for the same purpose and ... and threatening damn we need to promote these type of beer majors and work with and I see white supremacy has taught us to fight\nEach other yeah why you went to the gangs and say look we ate to stop doing this that's why the game to the cycle now became a a group that's trying to lift the community you and and and the big guy you know is named you're you're one of your partners so these are the things that we need to try to do\nYeah but you know what else to understand I understand that sometimes a man will fight or it happens sometimes\nPhysical altercation would take place I Do not condoning it and I do not promoted but I Will say this if you threaten somebody it'd be threatened a man and you say you're going to physically do something to that man\nExpect that man to step up and say what are we going to do here\nBut now that I'm ... now I'm not saying\nCertain I say they expect it if you are going to put that energy out they're expected to come back and that's my only point\nDangerous that's what makes it for our children when we see the type of incarceration mass murders that were doing for one another and call one another data what makes people like Snoop Dogg and tea I\nI forgot how 'bout those guys work\nFor zero for a\nNicer to seven zero three that gives you the conversation on once again I just got to say a big thank you to all of the listeners who voted for me in the AJC for\nBest news talk radio personality in Atlanta a big us all sorts of my producer Julian\nA it is definitely a team effort to all of the staff at W.

rookie quarterback Josh Allen will not only miss Sunday's game against the cold because of his right elbow injury the team has been relatively hush hush about it but we see multiple reports that it's well it's\nSome type of a brain to as you the L maybe a partial care\nUh it's in that right elbow corps so it's going to have to heal completely builds do not consider it to be a major injury right now but any time you hear the name Dr James Andrews\nUh who is an orthopedist specialists and he does operations on I mean he's pretty much every big name aptly these days he's the most trusted surgeon out there when it comes to these types of surgeries he's being consulted for a second opinion and so when you hear his name there's generally some red flags\nThat are waived he will not start against the cold and there is the the distinct possibility that he could miss multiple weeks for the Buffalo Bills where does that leave their quarterback depth charge well Sean McDermott\nNot elaborating on it a whole lot just that they're looking at the options they're watching film and it will either be Nathan Peter men who did come in and relieved Josh Allen in the second half of last week's game or it will be Derek Anderson who was just\nSigned out of retirement I mean I like to see Derrick Anderson back on the football field again\nNathan pyramid against the Houston Texans had

there is not allowed to work with when it comes to this cardinals office and the season\nReally is all about trying to get him to the point at which he can be the elite quarterback be a franchise leader despite how wrong he was coming in so it's the job of as does have and the Denver Broncos to stop and\nI think his uh his own town I mean I mean he was he was a member drawn to it makes it look easy I mean he's got a ... would release rate for work in a ... who's got a very very high football like who are very mature guy so\nHe's ready to play him he was he was one of the guys that when you

I Do for a living and while I\nThe book called the ... five rivals created the NFL in lots of Ford's empire I Love history and history buff and this was right up my alley and it comes highly recommended it's after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS force radio were pleased\nTo welcome longtime sports writer Baltimore Ravens columnist and author John eyes and burned to the show from Baltimore John thanks so much for a couple of minutes\nOh my pleasure thanks for having me on it\nOr even as I'm I've read part of the book and I plan to read the rest it's fascinating the first question that jumps to my mind is why did you decide to right that's what drew you to the inception of the NFL\n[noise] well uh yeah this is my tenth book I've written I've written football and baseball written horse racing and hardworking or yeah or you know fascinating character fascinating time\nHere will just stop and pause and go wow and ... or a no brainer honestly for somebody else George because\nUh the the character that I'm writing about it here George how or any ... died now they're all in the hall of fame\nBut a ... in this story and you're young you're in the twenties and thirties they don't have a lot of money they're trying to make a go of the times you know a wartime depression and how the world are they just go and\nUh when it was really sort of failing enterprise to me it just jumped off the page and it was like you know how can I not take this on at some point though I you know it was very very rich story telling a terrain for me so are there was no way I was going to Mr\n... you talk about going back to the thirties where actually the national football league was failing most people didn't even know that the league what's out there was an anywhere close to the popularity and say baseball which with America's game are you mentioned horse racing too so what was the turning point what\nBut at the league was out there it wasn't anywhere close to the popularity and said baseball which was America's game are you mentioned horse racing too so what was the turning point what how to keep the NFL afloat and turn it into a ... at least the building blocks in the business that it is today\nWell I think we started tinkering with the game first of all this started tinkering with the rules I mean\nFootball was which pretty boring I mean college football's well it wasn't a ton of passing you know it was a lot of just sort of handing off and it was considered like a like a like a character building exercise for a young man you know so\nGood guys stayed on the field and they got a ... and this is what much going on so so they opened up the game which is that they really open up the game with ... they they they were ruled that can that worked against having a passing and they eliminated though\nSo it just became a more interesting sport uh and that helped him and the other key thing I think with the draft no question about it uh that level the playing field for\nRelatives Philadelphia came up with that and because of the bears and the giants were better than everybody was lopsided and and and and people were having a hard time connecting with it and that made it a more competitive and George you didn't know what was going to happen once they've put a draft him twice\nSo changing the rules is something that still lingers and still survive the NFL [laughter]\nIt's no different than the the things that I came across now I'm very active covering today's NFL and in in many respects straight line it's the same stuff that's going on\nJohn Eisenberg with us from Baltimore the book is called the league how five rivals created the NFL and launched a sports empire you mentioned the five guys and you've you've given a couple of the names here and they're all hall of famers\n'em but they're not all with us so how did you how did you get first person accounts or get to know these men when you didn't have the ability to interview them\nWell first of all I interviewed some of their of their family members they still on the themes I mean the release in Pittsburgh\nA George houses family in Chicago so you know I went to those places are interviewed affairs joined houses are always the bears for getting in the past ... she's in her nineties I interviewed her when I when I told that other people in the late ... when George Washington\nDaughter oh\nIt's just inevitable she'd seen at all so she she was a great source and so I went to the hall of fame and can't and I have this amazing volume there does not lead they have a great research libraries it doesn't release a library it is with the official minutes of every week meetings going back to the first one\nWhite yeah so the the voices leap off the page there for that that was a very helpful document needless\nOh my goodness why do you think ultimately succeeded John why do you think ultimately it didn't hold each state afloat and as I say it was the foundation for what we have in two thousand Eighteen\n[noise] that that's an excellent question and uh I Do believe in God uh you know how\nTo order Marshall and for all these guys they did believe in it and that sort of the periods where all that it could have folded during World War two there were it was really problems than it could have folded during the depression they believe in that so they have to go and a ... really just\nRip your source of all this and in any way that they could certainly wasn't profitable\nAnd then as I said you know they'd been tankers\nReally just rip your source of all this and in any way that they could certainly wasn't profitable and then as I said you know they've been tinkering with\nThe rules that it just became a much more dynamic I'm\nPetitioning which is something that college football did not do\nA until much later into the sixties actually unlimited substitutions that created to platoon football and created modern football uh suddenly it was a became a week of quarterback you had a you know Johnny night is you know he didn't have to play defense [laughter] and so suddenly became very exciting\nDynamic game and it happened just as television was coming in so the timing was good and so it's a lot of forces a lot of factors but uh certainly those were the key ones and television coming in suddenly everybody could see\nIt and it just it just took off\nAt what point did it become mainstream popularity\nIn the ... a definitely a nice thing is I mean a lot of people the last thing in my book is the greatest game ever played ... holes in the giants the famous game where are you know forty million people watched that game\nAnd so at that point in the mainstream or no question about it or you know a few years before that it was getting to be very popular especially in New York New York Giants uh uh you know really really took off\nYou deserve again ... nutty nine Seventy\nAre you looking for senior care for your mom or dad but don't

as a model coke abound\nYou got to any any big coming up this or going to be attempting to address of the fact that there are homeless children are in the Atlanta metropolitan area who are going without assistance we're going without care and you want to address to\nAbsolutely thank you so much for the opportunity and I'm In complete in the ... process I\nWas astounded by the numbers of homelessness and our metropolitan area mhm um people know how to dress it up to kind of go through life\nA certain way so that led Shawna nice no basis you don't know ... and the the biggest part of the research shows that um if you're staying at a hotel if you are on a couch if you're a veteran out at somebody's house might come in there\nIf you don't have your own physical address that as a definition of homelessness right while you're just saying they're two or three years that's a definition\nAnd so we want to bring awareness to it because there's a lot of activities that go on for the holidays mhm but we're a people and what can they do January through October\nExactly exactly this is a good issue that is a new to me you know the kind of a reason that our church the way we\nApproach ministry is is to make sure that we see about people of first and foremost to your basic needs you know food and and we try to make sure that we provide clothing but we're not able to do the shelter peace\nAnd that's the piece that is it makes me feel\nInadequate you know because that because that's what people call for more ... more so than anything else folk ... who are homeless or as you say you know squatting with somebody else's space or or living in a transitional spaces like hotels are each\nDay you know and there's a role you don't always talk about these morning or the mom was in the dead as in the babies at the bus stop will what I'm Talking about is the people that I'm passing by who live in the uh\nThe hotels on the strip on an almost throw all for them to do through the strip or to stroll which I Want to have both of them yeah okay and uh and so and I always wonder you know how people are so I'm\nJust brave and and and resourceful and how people you know a whole family living in one little hotel room and how they're able to pull it together and pull off what looks like normalcy to\nPeople outside\nAbsolutely you feel it late in doing childcare I was able to care for a homeless family may literally live in their band mom and dad and three children and mom and dad knew how to go to the\nThe rest stop and use the public was you know facilities and wash up right the baby's cutting outlive that because they you know they still had a sense they're close we're not there they have holes in their clothes and more importantly that spirit was sunk in you know the other children were like I look at you and you know rocking on them\nAnd that has never left me and I just I now I see why how it's all coming together\nAnd you know I'm just thankful to have to be as a available and a vessel you know to hopefully\nUm bring more awareness but we know really just Neal wearing as we need people who are willing to support the cause a because we need places for them to go most shelters you got a check on their you know grab is run gets here appointments you know you know hey\nRight ... and they're not\nBecause we need places for them to go ... she got a check on their you know grab it run its airplane mass you know you know hey\nRight ... and they're not many shelters shelters are are going away instead of being increased you know 'cause we must you know the the government has to pay for these tax or for these tax breaks that rituals getting\nAh got to pay a you know for that so the money comes out of that you know since they give it a tax break less money is in the is in the system\nAnd of course we break we blame or they blame your title meant you know for why the balance of ... for for the reason that the budget is in deficit and so you know you see the connection between the the breed an average of people who are in power\nAnd how it affects people who are just barely scraping by\nThat we were talking about earlier of

to be as many places that I can\nTo help people identify their purpose and say that need a way that they cannot paint the goals and dreams in life\nWell you're going to go even growing up with any place where we need to look watch for you when the not too distant future\nInto power yes they do something like that she worked with act is this mapping yeah she where it would help beauty she was kept conniving when she went in there you have to understand nation is is against nation\nAnd you know and I'm not against everybody but it works like that\nWhere he liked that a president the ex President Clinton he was in power you know but you know most Americans and most people say that Lance just don't know how people used foul you have to look at the press the button that that turned me off\nBecause you know so we all have power\nWe used to power in different weight that's just my comment\nOkay thank you wouldn't bad either before for forty nine to two seven zero three a real job come on\nNow for a man or woman or a\nComment that was the one common at all not at all you know you're a\nBut I think I think um I don't think I think I'm I'm an Oak Ridge you that men empower\nDefinitely should not do their power to do one mhm period right However I'm not going to involved in this particular case\nMonica Lewinsky of any role Islam is what I think most Virginia oh\nParticularly Kate Monica Lewinsky of any role in this and that's what I think West Virginia or talked about and I'm not going to just completely opposite of women\nOf their responsibility also to reject the advances of men and power and et cetera on if if if the man goes further than he is actually you know she rejecting\nThen he's raping or sexually abusing off our thank you you can you can go with a heavy or legal charge and you know what I mean if it's not just just what the man you know the the um\nSo if you know becomes complicated because we mirror and they were this particular scenario you know what I mean what what what Mrs Clinton said\nWell yeah I mean I tried to opening up so we can you know go beyond just this particular time yeah I just want about what I usually follow in general you know\nYeah well I agree with you that that it shouldn't be done\nOr we shouldn't abuse of power status or whatever I'm off in a power we have over a particular situation to to negatively affect the\nStatus of women you know almost I I agree with that one hundred percent you know I mean I I don't have an issue with that um men do it um should be held accountable for it\nBecause of it and I'll go back to Clinton because Clinton was a married man so therefore you did on his vows or on a his relationship with the plant and accept the whole bunch of things you know fell into that scenario but let me ask you this question you mentioned the group of people\nThat that that had um that raise the children and the children stayed with each other and they engage sexually resell was that age limit on the engagement\nWas what was it so there was a ... they were a part of a Cold War you know so everybody was around the same age they grew up together and courts or do they want an occult ...\nSo that they have in their culture a certain age when sex or they they just you know because you're talking about\nAn article that was the the the piece I didn't go that's specific it said roughly when I gave them from home they just brought home a letter that need to go a little bit further well now it's it's something it's\nJust it's just it's informing us or the ... I mean I think the reason that is in the book in the first place that is to let you know that there are different cultures that exist and that you that that you or not just you or me or we don't know uh\nAnd and it cannot be the arbiters and the judge\nOr the behaviors that are formed\nA independently in other indigenous cultures you can't do that\nIf they wouldn't have to just to my knowledge science there when when brothers because they don't play that I Will say this group rather rent yeah\nGo ahead and I'm I'm just at this age I Do might help you with your statement is also did not say that they did not have relationships with women to produce children now and then have loving relationships with women it's in the day you're gauging homosexual activity as well that's what it said\nOr that and I was in the normal for them\nYeah semi that article\nIt's not a book I read the book for you I get to be an El Al give you a reference I almost\nI still got all these other genders for not all of this stuff to try to justify some\nDamn behavior and tell me that but let me read it a little bit further than we've got\nYou got all the gender or not all that stuff that justify them down behavior and sent me that but let me read a little bit further that we've got to have a\nI Would I Would I Would definitely go share that information on them ah yeah I looked at really what\nHappens is that but wherever that is where we imagine no we we managed to the north of the total human family and that\nUh no I'm not an you that but they're no roof and who ... who edited out who your term I don't know the total a family who determines who can set the north would have told you more than three out of the year my\nThe evidence for the evidence to your study of the human\nAh well what would you got to understand the jungle no but you don't know the for the entirety of the human family oh you know which is what record has been kept up you know an ain't no way for you to know\nJust like we didn't know about them people down there you know we've had enough answering you for your call that I've talked to\nLast for for a day to seven zero three\n...

eight nine ... seven zero three in the studio in say ... executive\nDirector of the New Georgia project you all have an ...\nWe do and I'm very excited about it um it's a flagship act I essentially you put your address then and it pulls up a personalized ballot everyone bet you are eligible to vote for in the upcoming election\nThere's a picture they're a little bitty bio but also they're voting record um so what their stances on issues that mattered at like\nA and their ass stands on issues that matter the young people um and also who they've been endorsed by ...\nSo a lot of times I find myself and I use if I'm at I worked in politics right now I'm a community organizing I'm never because I've never gone to a vote\nAnd been one hundred percent certain about every single candidate on the ballot there's always a judge that I don't know who it is or anything um and so this is a way to remedy that a\n... who they vote for who they been endorsed by\nAh we're constantly working on that we are going to act\nA their donors so the top five donors for every candidate and put that information and everybody's phone talking to get a you can go to the apple store the eye to store\nUm or the Google place door and look for New Georgia project I'm and download the app it's free it's really easy to use we have a explanations of all the five constitutional amendment\nI'm into statewide referendum because that's the other thing people do they know they're going to vote for for president\nThey know who they're going to vote for for governor me get to the bottom of the ballot and you see these five constitutional amendments have no idea what they're trying to do ah they often are written a by lawyers uh and so not designed for ordinary people to understand what they're designed to do so\nWe have some simple breakdowns are in the act that tell you what the five constitutional amendments you could do what a yes vote means what a no vote means\nUm and yeah and it's three New Georgia project in both the apple store and the Google Play store\nRemarkable so during the commercial break actually download the app okay and I'm going to play with it a little bit today but what information do you need to put in this app in order for it to\nA populate all that in fact so\nStay with it a little bit today but what information you need to put in this app in order for it to a populate all of that in fact\nSo just your email address um and as the address so there are two ways that you can find the personalized valley you can put in your address where you vote but it also can you can also put in the address for where you are right now so right now I just put in the address for the studio\nAnd it tells me the members of Congress and all of the state representative and state senators\nThat are running for this part of the city um but I can also go back and put my home address I live in the west in ... and so yeah it's it's and so for people who are doing community events\nYou want to help people it doesn't just have to be your own address it can be it's based off of GPS\nLooking do you can have a personalized ballot for wherever you are so if your camera saying you're going door to door you at the mall your um spell house homecoming this weekend a weekend right you can provide\nAll of the information to people who have questioned\nLovely lovely vet see things like that can be game changers\nI Hope so that's the plan right that's the thing we want people to be so we didn't register three hundred thousand people just said that we can have three hundred thousand registering for everyone at three hundred thousand new voters you want to actually a million new voters\nAnd wanting to be informed and confident when they go into the ballot and so many times people go in and and they vote the top of the ticket and they walked back out because they have no idea who these other people are and we want to change that\nOne of the significant differences and what the New Georgia project did is that you guys track people and if it wasn't for your strong tracking mechanisms in place you would not have known that these individuals you register many of them did not go all the way through the system\nAbsolutely absolutely and it's important again we're not just it's not a numbers game for up we're really trying to change Georgia were really trying to bring underrepresented in underserved communities to the Democratic process right George is going to be the first state in the deep south with a white minority\nSo African Americans Latino and Asian Americans are going to make up the majority of Georgians\nIn about six years right so what does that leadership on all look like what are the ... what our policies and it looked like what are our politics and I look like are we going to have leaders who\nCome from the communities that we live in and who feel accountable to our communities\nWe weren't as many people as possible to participate in the process right um there are states that are majority people of color you have California and you have taxes right and so Georgia is literally right now writing its history writing its future\nUm and we want as many people as possible to contribute to the story\nVery well said for those who are listening and they would like to possibly get involved with the New Georgia project how can they do the\nNew Georgia project dot org ... is our website ah we're on other social media platforms so Instagram Facebook Twitter a New Georgia project\nOr you can find us there or not we have offices in nine cities across the state uh so if you are looking to drive people this is the polls if you're looking to knock on some doors we have tax banks regularly so it's like phone banking but we text voters and we have music and food and we're just cracking jokes um\nBut it's still communicating with voters via text message so yeah\nI Love it have you guys heard what happened in Jefferson County\nWe have and we were pissed about it I'm absolutely and it [noise] you know I think George has a long and a recent history a voter suppression and it's always something as I was ... is our elder elder\nOut for those who may not know Jefferson County had\nAnd in recent history of voter suppression and it's always something if I was ... is our elder\nElder for those who may not know Jefferson County had about fifty\nSeniors who were celebrating they will come in from the senior living environment\nAnd they were getting on the bus mhm this is a nonpartisan event absolute\nWho's now part of it they were getting on the bus or the bus above at a bunch of black people or the picture on the bus with a bunch of black people with their ... yeah so that was all ready to problems with the Germans without a commission right even though they're not part of it so they get into the bus they're going to vote mhm\nAnd somebody who's passing this pro black our boss called the commissioners and the commission called them and said you got you got a ship that down right what wait a minute ... would that this is you have the right to assemble and so I had to talk about this from CBS forty six last night\nWith true illustrations of actual racism how do you call to push back and say well y'all just using the rice madam why don't you live\nAll the push back and say well y'all just using the rice called mount of why don't you understand that racism is a reality\nOf the matrix of this country\nI can I can explain something about the propaganda that is put that out there every what\nPropaganda media we happen to let what propaganda\nWhat's that what propaganda\nOkay I Will give you an example yesterday there were stories out there that then I think pretty big story that were totally ignore one of the with Ken interacted with Robert Mueller has this report come out but um you know yesterday that three floors of the municipal buildings in Puerto Rico were raided by the FBI yesterday\nRemodeling white on his which I don't care you don't ... well I don't care about now\nDoing well here's here's we're going to talk about what what about this white woman who's who tried to stop a black man from getting into his own apartment building\nWhat about that or out of mind huh I think that without as long as she racist\nI don't know if she was just trying to see if somebody live there and I didn't\nLet the individual would have done a young white man the same way you think it's I mean what do you think would have done a young white man in the same way\nI didn't hear anything about the story until I heard it on your radio today I'm\nSorry I'm sure you did because you said that just sitting and listening to Shaun Hannity all day Sean is going to talk about this because it doesn't fit his narrative may\nWell you're not going to talk about the other big story I say you know Robert\nNot a big store now not a big story small potatoes mixed\nOkay I'm Talking about on that we know there was one person in the twenty sixteen election heal absolutely colluded with Russia he took the step yesterday in the house and it becomes\nMore you know Trump to take the fifth yesterday about him I was watching the news all day and they're not going to fit\nHis name was ... he took the fifth yesterday but all of a sudden the media comes out with their propaganda say that oh Robert Mueller remember him he's going to come out with a report after the election because they have to sit there and propaganda ICU every single day\nEvery single day he'll be part of the let me ask you a question you play the part of the I mean racist white people do you know\nI don't know racist like I told you before I Know some people who wouldn't want their grandkids coming home with a black person I disagree\nWith food you absolutely not so so wait a minute you are okay with your children hold on the part of the ... are you okay with your children dating a black man\nI have a son not probably not that he could they lack well he did a black woman his high school sweetheart was a black girl she was a lovely woman\nYeah I don't have a problem with it after you don't have any problem absolutely not have you dated a black man\nI pretty much only love the person so now huh I've only dated one person like\nYou said it pretty much about 'em so there's some room there somewhere that did you say pretty much what happened something happened to the story there\nI fell in love with one person I was sitting there and he said he too she's in high school I didn't date in high school\nOkay I Gotcha well here's the thing the party luau racism is real racism Israel and every time there's a story about racism I think it deserves some attention and sometimes they all levels to it but definitely all of these and incident that happened to be documented a worthy of compensation within the realm of news and talk\nSometimes there's a lot of propaganda that what\nPrompted that makes me want to be in one of the stories I highlighted today that's all the propaganda name one\nGuy let's say that again Charlottesville you mentioned that in the very beginning of yourself where are you talking to\nYou mentioned Charlottesville it's one of these races think Donald Trump is racist because he didn't say something\nI read the men a quiver jaded wide\nAnd that's the only money racist thing Donald Trump is racist because he didn't say something\nI fed demand a quicker ... white supremacists and neo Nazis to the same people who protest them that's exactly what he did he say they are very fine people on both sides can really do you wait a minute do you really believe he bought a new that neo Nazis and white supremacist ... people\nWho you believe that let me ask you do you believe neo Nazis and white supremacist verifiable okay that's where the man says remember he called the people who attacked Kavanaugh mob boss he called them a mob but he called the white supremacist ...\nNew York times story on the very nice people there were people that came down for like Minneapolis or something yes there is there asking you can disagree with him all that now I don't think that makes an evil people New York times that they're advertising really talking about when you find that when you were\nOkay well you didn't even people\nOn the part of low and you know he was part of the SARS\nOn the part of ... of this conversation I appreciate the call call me back tomorrow I have no hatred you're absolutely correct and I do not want to four zero point not to do seven zero three their digital conversation today some days I have more patience than others forgive me I'm human Tanya stale\n[noise] how you doing today retired I'm great how are you find I have two things I Want it to to say OK I'm the first one is\nUm about the phony I get caught last week I don't know if you remember but I caught I was having a very upset day because they um [noise] I had gone over to Marietta\nAnd um they had basically a turn around and said that you know it was everything that by countless journalist leave though uh for the voting a suppression issues and everything like that and I don't know if you remember that call but anyhow I was very upset so what I did was\nUm after that I call it to ... ... email and call my representative\nNow I Do remember the call and it's an ego show\nOkay I don't know if they listen to your show but I've not heard from the ... and I'm getting a little upset what I Want to happen is something that happened in Georgia assembly to um make it or not illegal for people to be housed in the office\nOf secretary of state and then run for office\nDo you remember as I shared there is no legal nor constitutional mandate that would require a secretary of state to resign you you do have a\nCat we change that can't throw it changed that law Adam Smith them they were that he was\nI I I emailed in contact and called my what else I've not heard from either one\nAll right let me let me help you with that I Would tell you who they are the\nGimme gimme a second let me help you with that and we have to understand that okay you are likely not to get a phone call to after this election\nNot to get a call back some people may return your phone call but you don't even have staff full time staff working because we have a part time legislature\nOkay well from the staff members aren't even working uh in in a lot of these officers that you're probably contacting but here's what you absolutely need to do\nIn January we will begin our legislative session continue to push it in the month of January they tend to be more responsive okay there in the office they are coming to the capital and their staff\nIs there as well to make sure you got your voice you okay so yes by law this can change but that's all the way it will change and you did have people like max Cleveland who ran for US Senate he resigned as secretary of state in order to run for us in it so\nAge but that's all the way it will change and you did have people like max Cleveland who ran for US Senate he resigned as secretary of state in order to run for us in it so people have done it before\nYes that's ethical thing to do that um so I Want them to get that and thanks for that information on that so I don't get mad at them\n[laughter] you know I mean what what number for them if they didn't know\nWhat they need to be responsive madam if I served in that capacity I Would try to be responsible for every day but just keep in mind that some of these things happen on the political cycle that it happens and that is part of the political cycle the month of January in Georgia okay\nYeah I just moved and my my pets um rats were very response sits on Wednesday the did you come from the way it is\nI'm a powder springs\nOh you came from another era I got ya yeah it it just depends once again all of this comes down to people right now there'll be a little over a thousand I don't watch\nIt on the other thing is I'm the guy who ran against well the guy who won last year Shannon bark I didn't hear you say anything about that is probably because you know how to my head but I'm going to say I'm a writer a talk show host I listen to him\nAnd I forgot what started the ... and that's on hand they are a few which are fan\nAnd everything and Archie Bunker extremely rice for our shot that he actually warmed up last year and maybe a ... or the year before\nThat but here's what we know about that when he didn't win this year\nMadam appreciate your
