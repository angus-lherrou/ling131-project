the\nThey looked at what your test scores are in the lower grades and how you end up and there is no correlation between lower test scores and income earning ability later in life what matters is whether you were exposed to raise\nThose among them mhm yup deep and one thing we live out of felt that yeah\nBut they have a big study I mean with millions of of data points in\nAll black people have a whole lot of sayings that really capsule encapsulate as what you just said like you gotta stay black till you die the point of view that whether you are rich or poor education I'm educated you going to be black and you're going to be discriminated against\nBlack boys who grow up in millionaire households are more likely to be poor at some point during their lives than white boys whose families only earn thirty six thousand dollars a year\nShocking and I tried to think I read that I tried to think of um some black boys grew up in millionaire homes in the top one percent home and I I just\nIt's hard to wrap my mind around that concept not that they would be climbing and then\nWell to do family whose boys are suffering right now that's when I could name so that's I don't\nKnow read my man around\nBut to do family whose boys are suffering right\nNow that's when I could name song that's I Know in a rabbi man around\nI don't you know black boys who are under achieving black man with under achieved their parents\nYes who maybe didn't finish\nCollege uh ended up getting in some kind of criminal trouble well and they say look we give money the other thing is this past race with President Obama's election there was a lot of talk about post racial\nAmerica yeah we get title one money based on family in one way to not give title one money to schools where they're high concentration of the black students because black students he helped overcoming races\nThey don't just need help overcoming poverty they do okay and interestingly enough the discrepancy the disparity is not nearly as for now the among girls as it is low and then why is that we live in a male dominated society the people who have the most power or still white men\nThey exercise that power against black man more ferocious\nWith and they do against ... went black women are not proceed emphasis threatening ... competition\nAnd by well in our most highly educated segment of our society\nAnd there is believe it or not between black women and why women with similar family income there is no\nDifferent and earning ability ... ... black girls and white girls from similar economic backgrounds have the same earning a built over their lifetime so\nMetaphorically kill all the boys are right works right as like pharaoh and here I\nWrite and we're black women have to own that and fight for policies that\nCounteract that European summit oh I didn't go to school on the farm it that's what are you a food [laughter] you know you just being foolish because why would you\nI flew am I went to school and affirmative action but also assume that I took my primitive action tip and did the best I could with it right I don't know where that did not use you work with a lawyer in affirmative action in\nYeah in law school that she hired me to work for her just because her opinion was totally opposite from a ... she defended oh institutions that were accused of racism\nAnd she knew that my point of view was totally opposite of hers and she I mean that's the only job I ever got to do now Bob lawful oh she came to me and asked me to work for her\nI just wanted a founding board she wanted a different opinion\nI don't know what she wanted and I guess you ... I Hope she got it oh I was in her they had a person who was again\nOh affirmative action teaching voting rights I was in her voting rights glass and somewhere along the line I don't know she figured out I was the person is you need to hire to be her own research and assistant\nAnd I think now topping is we're opposite\nBut this idea that uh we don't deserve any special help that's a form of reparation actually affirmative action is a form of reparations and not just repair for damage done in the past what ... what the continuing damage of continuing racism in this\nNobody said that on this show\nBut I'm just saying that the ... the way some people put it\nNo okay now what we're saying yeah a little town to the ones who got away but yeah I'm here\nAnd and uh I'm like this I refuse\nTo let right people who are addicted to why me me back to the plant tastes\nAnd what I mean by that every year\nThat we have any mix and you have black folks come in all crime please vote please please vote and every you to me in my honest opinion it just seems as if we're going backwards\nI run into\n... no I don't well I used to but I've stopped voted okay and they want to do my math\nBeing a problem with this is it have you ever heard of what a nice scene you know the return no okay you should Google they how did you call\nThis is it have you ever heard of the night feeding you know the return no\nOkay you should go there how did they call ... has said that torn night too if you are the return for the African in the ass and they are to make it easier for us to get citizenship\nIn Guyana\nAnd I'm not the thing to give up your American citizenship but\nIf you're going to have citizenship in Guyana and the United states do it\nNow are you willing to go to San Francisco citizenship or plan on doing it okay so that's why you know well yeah OK I'll write about long we're going to splinters wanted to ask you a course Kim there's one more\nQuestion before you go yes when did you stop 'em\nI'll stop voting I'm In a rock Obama's second term\nOkay yeah I was just curious\nThere have been that long ago no it hasn't been that long will it will\nDo in my own family land got problems hey we have also ...\nMalcolm myth that came out into the people you know we all political um\nHe said we were up a little ... still do something like that because they put them first and they put a laugh thank you all for taking my I'm tall\nReally glad you know thank you have a member did we get man that okay well we have a call hello\nHello hello you're on the air thank\nYou so much for taking my call I had a question regarding uh America in\nBetween teenagers and I want to know how to raise a a daughter like you're young lady was raised because she is a darling she's meeting her education she set for you and I'm sure she must be of her father now these two black girls I to an African\nAmerican girls they were fighting over there and wait for it\nAnd so one of them went home and brought back a night oh married or the other one in ... and let's see sixteen and Eighteen then the other thing I wanted to ask you about how do you get rid of this a jealousy envy a amongst African American women\nIt it's and I'm not the only one that has noticed that many other people have noticed you now if you get sick when I'm\nWell I'm so saying they hear about those two girls fighting over there in our town lose her life yeah this is just horrible I have noticed that there is um\nThere seems to be a lot of envy and jealousy and desire to have conflict among black women like girls and then you know shocking to me I don't know how you get rid of\nOh Jay and were you saying something well I think one of the ways to to stop it is to make sure that black girls have ways to affirm\nPositive identities and role models getting them involved in group activities with other girls are striving to be achieved birds and\nDo in in ...

right in hopes\nOf college football officials that they'll have a tough time with the targeting definition just like being a failed does but I think they do a pretty good job for the most part because

know and you could have got like central Florida an underdog but they're not making ... ... about Eighteen track their weight age they are arguing for an Eighteen playoff back\nWhat ... I almost think that Michelle Knight Bob our coffers cat does anybody on late is dark flight for the national ... thank you\nThank you Steve when in Knoxville, Tennessee where the ball's fans witnessed the greatest off in ... in college football and ... maybe one of the best you've ever seen in Alabama earlier this afternoon a set of last year that you know there's not a lot of arguments after eight\nThere is I mean if you looked at everything right now and you went okay Alabama ... and ... if we just looked at the ranking so we have right now Alabama Clemson LSU Michigan\nGeorgia Oklahoma Texas\nYou know I don't know if I put central Florida there I I get the the story and what they've done and it's kind of Boise State issue and I don't want to demean the blue turf and the great program for our listeners in Boise but\n\nWhen you look at the power five I I just don't know if you can slide central Florida and because of the old BCS well they're undefeated like Notre Dame is undefeated they bite Alabama but they weren't any good right so if he did an Eighteen play off off the saint Pete top twenty five\nFrom what I project will be this week which will be Alabama one climbs into and the three LSU for Michigan five Texas six Georgia seven Oklahoma aids\nYou have UCF than knocking on the door with the one loss of Ohio State team in Florida at eleven see the the the argument goes away\nWhat you're going to get now and then that's what I said earlier my opening huge opinion that there's going to be that one last debate and I'm getting people\nTweeting me had Saturday huge well there's no way the SEC gets two teams in I just told you how if Alabama is undefeated playing in the SEC title game and Georgia would beat them in Georgia that has lost another game and the real one last team those to one last teams will be in the college football playoff\nGuarantee so the question is if you're in that one law is cheering category well issue controls her destiny because if they went out there in I I don't think Michigan has that control now that Ohio State was upset by Purdue\nIn Penn State was beaten last week by Michigan State\nTaxes now on the big control their destiny the college football playoff neither does Oklahoma\nGeorgia does because if they would win the rest of their games and you know number low in Florida in their annual robbery game they would have Kentucky they've whatever Alabama they they have they have their past as one last team UCF doesn't know great story\nBut it's not worthy of being in the final four now if we had an Eighteen playoff they would be in that conversation\n\nIn in the final four now if we had an Eighteen playoff they would be in that conversation\n\nThen the power five can be taken care of that you're conference championship winners they are in regardless so now you put a lot of value in the regular season and even more value in the conference championship games because it guarantees of bars\nNot weighed in on a committee not wondering about strength of schedule you rewarded power five\nThen there's three other spots where Notre Dame would come into play and then you get those two spots to debate there you go hey team playoff\nSimple make me unseasonably commissioner okay there you go and I'll cleanup college basketball as well what'd you do is you get\nRid of shoe companies funding youth basketball teams slimy and dirty people\nEntice the parents with offers of money in college coaches can say well it was on our team is the evil side of the NC double A.\nEight hundred seven

lost the world series the rent the following year may return\nTo the world series to face the Dodgers and the Yankees did win that World Series now the Dodgers last bit of Nineteen Seventy seven they were turned in Nineteen Seventy eight where they met the Yankees again same result the Dodgers lost that World Series to the Yankees\nSo you had the Yankees who lost then won the Dodgers who lost than law in Nineteen Ninety One\nWho loss then won the Dodgers who lost than loss in\nNineteen Ninety One the Braves and made it to the world series up against the twins they lost to the twins the following year they returned and Ninety two and the Braves ended up losing that World Series to the blue jays\nThen you have the the Texas Rangers\nThe Texas Rangers last World Series in two thousand

and then return the following year since Nineteen Seventy six the Yankees lost\nThem on Dodgers loss loss Braves loss loss rangers loss loss royals lost one\nSo just something interesting to think

Sandy Koufax days so ... ... at this point there yeah the seventies were great for me growing up but\nGuess what it's two thousand or ... Eighteen and the Dodgers are going to blow it they'll they'll get high up in there like a your other guy said a a six games not lose\nJust because a curse a catfish and they're pitching is right or got them here but guess what they they can't\nYou're not are you actually Dodger saying\nI'm a Dodger fan all my life\nAnd just wide no positivity here just whatsoever because the richer hard after so many years\nYeah I I guess yes since Seventy eight Seventy ... you know ... it's like a ... they just can't for doing when it gets to this uh this point you know ... ... ... the Los Angeles Dodgers are in a great market they should've\nEver won a lot as much as the Yankees have their share it\nWith the with the Yankees have done is is the most in baseball so it's the talk the failure they should be able to go in twenty something championships it's the talk to you\nKnow I I Know it is but the Dodgers Islam what fifty eight from Brooklyn you know they they they they go to a Los Angeles and and they they want and what a ... a a a world championship says that and that's\nAbout it last night didn't gets you excited whatsoever down you're not pumped up about your team during the world series\nI'm totally prompt but I also like he I don't mind what [laughter] you know\nYou can at least have like a twenty four hour period where you enjoy this one and not worry about the the matchup a beginning you're going to lose right away\nAnd I listen to the game tonight and I was still like last night when they lost\nLast night and then did you watch you know I can I'm at work so I got to listen to the radio it's a little different okay so down\nThe phone call I I just think that's interesting we finally get to talk to a Dodgers that I remember when I met you got to the world\nWe appreciate the phone call I I just think that's interesting we finally get to talk to a Dodgers that I remember one Mets got to the world series up against the royals a few years ago\nWhen the Mets swept the at the time I don't think we do the opponent but when the Mets sweat the cubs at the time\nAnd the first twenty four hours even before knowing the opponent I said boom that what it all look at the pitching with the ground with Harvey was sent the guard with max set for this playing well Murphy hit in the cover up the baseball no one's being enough\nAnd that's just a natural fan reaction when your team gets to the big game or\nThe big series whether you are expected to win it or you're expected to get sweat\nYou're expected to be Seventeen point under dog you talk to yourself into a way where your team is going to win does not mean that they're going to win and if you want to be objective that's fine\nAnd I think the red Sox are winning in six games gr several things the red Sox and five McCain thinks the red Sox are running and six games but I'm just surprised in the aftermath in the immediate aftermath of right after\nThere was a situation where your team gets back to the world series two years in a row that right away it's oh yeah no chance they suck the horrible\nEither terrible that they're not going to win the Dodgers have a chance in the series\nFor me personally it's just nearly impossible\nRight now to pick against Boston when I make it opinion behind a microphone and I couldn't against Boston last rumbled for this round and it's tough to pick against Boston because of the way that they dominated the Yankees at the Bronx and the way that they dominated Houston\nIn Houston and we know what the Yankees were before the year and we know what the Houston Astros were going into this postseason and when you have a team that\nWon a hundred games on one of three and you take care of them and beat them around like a rag doll on their home field that's why I'm picking them to win the world series\nBut if you're a Dodgers than listening to us in LA or if you're listening to us wherever you are and you're a Dodgers than they don't give us a call tell us why you think your team to win 'cause the first Dodger fan that we hear from is Domingo loom\nI'm excited but I'm not going to sound excited I'm going to be telling you that they got zero zero chance whatsoever whenever someone says a team has no chance going into a series and I and the championship game\nI just laugh at that notion\nNow you may look it's a match up where you think of team is a heavy favorite but it's a hundred percent lock it's just not\nThe Dodgers are good baseball team did they not get to the world series last year in our back in the world series this year they're really good baseball\nTeam I just have a hard time\nIn seeing not saying it's impossible but I just have a hard time in my heart picket against the red Sox right now with what I've seen so far in the post

I think they were able to exercise some demons\nUm that they got from that game seven last year and so that might carry them on a as actually go in as the under dog with a dark horse in the world series against the red Sox\nHow was the locker room other than Roberts after the game because obviously on the minds of the Dodgers pliers they still have to win for more games knowing how close they got last year\nI Will say this I mean every I've been through oh man won six now before that one two three so I guess this is the fourth or fifth locker room celebration in the last month a because there was a postseason clenching celebration in San Francisco we're a part of an end the division clenching after one sixty\nThree the amount of champagne suits by the way yeah it's a lot I got a lot of air to wash out but I Will say\nThis that every single one there's a couple of guys that get rowdy and rocket but for the most part the veterans in the room they see it and I went through all of the last year as well\nAnd I will say now that I've been through however many it's been ten twenty over the last five seasons I've been covering this team I'm nothing still has been bigger than that one year ago in Chicago at Wrigley Field when they went to that first world series and twenty nine years\nNothing's still has been bigger than that one year ago in Chicago at Wrigley Field when they went to that first world series and twenty nine years and you can feel the ... the sense of relief in the room and the cool thing was is the visiting clubhouse in Chicago at Wrigley Field is too small\nSo they held the celebration in the workout room which is much bigger and they're drinking out of the cops and keep it hit that three home run game\nA it was a lot that was the biggest the most amazing one I've been a part of tonight's was was big it was probably second or third on the list\nBut there was this sense of unfinished business we still have four and more to go we still have not reached our goal or in this one that I Would say in years past and celebration fast\nMichael do aren't there from MB CLA joined us right now is that killed show CBS Sports radio we knew going into that game last night that hater\nWas going to get into the ballgame and stay in the ball game for quite some time he ends up going three innings by it ends up working in the Dodgers advantage somehow because they were on to one you get them out of the way early\nAnd also you had that change where they bringing Kiki hockey game or into the game and then also uh you moved tailored to left field and tell her makes the biggest catch of the game or later on a few innings after that\nYeah and I heard that in this lead up to this segment that that you claim he sounded that Chris Taylor catch that definitely was a game changer in this game a so we'll go back to the first year of your first comment about hater entering into this game seven\nBut he changed his court a little bit and then he ended my my interview with him by saying one thing I Know is going to be really really cold [laughter]\nI\nHadn't been there either and not played there so he's looking forward to playing there but um\nI I I I say that because the green monster for some of those right handed bat is going to be interesting to see how they adjust left feels a little bit deeper for some of those left handed power back like Muncie Ind Ballenger in the lineup so we'll see how that goes when the series shifts to LA I doubt it's going to be a hundred degrees here like in LA like the world series was\nUm you know last season so I don't think the ball will carry as far as you saw there was no home runs in the three games of the CS at Dodger Stadium or between the Dodgers and brewers so\nThat could take a couple of guys out of the game I heard Alex Cora and that's a great story line two out of all these storylines in the world series former Dodger teammates out Cora in David Roberts who went to the red Sox won a World Series now will be an opposing dug out as managers as there are two teams fight off\nI'm looking forward to seeing that as well\nBut I heard Alex course say that I think he's going to start a JD

that is going to be interesting as you saw in this and healthy yet it was a chess match between the Dodgers and brewers especially with that\nThat sacrificing of the pond in game five were weighed

game series and all the move they've made before I'd never seen anything like it and that only ... only see that in the national league because of\nOf the pitcher spot having to bat and I wonder now that David Roberts has been through that kind of mental battles through seven games I've out corals he hadn't played it before or in those three games that will be in the end out or is up to to compete with him and that kind of chess moves gang\nMichael ...

on CBS so yesterday and the Michigan Michigan State game where in Michigan\nIn fact and start your full day of football\nOn CBS so yesterday and the Michigan Michigan State game were mission can end up ended up winning the game and covering the seven point spread\nThere was a whole lot leading into this game we all know the rivalry between the two\nAnd Michigan State since like two thousand seven two thousand and eight\nHas really dominated this rivalry but this was a huge game for Michigan 'cause you know the narrative about coach ... ... when the big game you have a six twenty four match up Michigan is the favorite in this one they should win the game that the better team\nBut let's see what ends up happening\nAnd a lot of people were in the camp of oh this will be a close game\nA lot of people were in it and it's not crazy to think that going in\nAnd you had a bizarre start today with what happened before the game but then also\nThe lightening delight the ... the weather delight flat even make this game even longer to where you really get things going and you have to pick it up later on in the game after having to take your players off the field and go back into the locker room but before the game happen\nEmotions were running high\nTo say the least and what the motions running high sometimes people do stupid things so I guess it's a tradition that Michigan State does\nIs that before the game they walk as a team across the field and they link arms and doing so so I was reading a tweet\nAnd the tweet was saying that they were supposed to go on out\nAt a certain time and they ended up being ten minutes late and the Michigan football team thought they would be able to take the field by ten AM\nSo Michigan was under\nThe impression that at nine fifty Michigan State will come out they would do their tradition where they walked across the field holding on to gather at Michigan State holding on to gather and than Michigan will be on the field right a warm up so well that's true or not Michigan's on the field a few Michigan players they're trying to warm up\nAnd they're not moving when Michigan State as a whole team walking across the field so what happens\nA Michigan State player in Michigan player they get tangled up\nAnd then eventually leads to Devon Bush checking the Spartans logo and the middle of the field\nSo\nI think that was right what's that been Bush did and I didn't love the whole interaction\nBefore the game with Michigan at Michigan State sure it's fun to watch but I just thought it was something that was necessary but it just adds more fuel to the quote unquote rivalry\nAnd as a football than it was fun to watch but I Do find it comical and before the games and we sit in a few games before or the other day when you have players just marketing chirping at each other before the games I just let your play do the talking sometimes and it's always a time to celebrate\nBut for me if I'm In Michigan\nI don't know if I Would have went about it that way because it should've been expected that yesterday you defeated and took care of Michigan State pretty easily\nAnd it's going to be expected that you went every game on the rest of your schedule besides the Ohio State game will have to see where those two teams are going into the highest steak it 'cause Michigan should be Penn State\nBesides the Ohio State game will have to see where those two teams are going into the highest steak it\n'cause Michigan should be Penn State oh November third in happy valley they show it doesn't mean they will but they should\nMichigan should be able to take care of Rutgers as well Michigan should be able to take care of Indiana and then you have that Ohio State game that will probably determine who goes to the college football playoff\nIn representing the Big Ten and by the way that a battle that Penn State games actually at Michigan so that Michigan so it's you have Michigan\nUp against Penn State Michigan at Rutgers Michigan home versus Indiana and Michigan at Ohio State so Michigan should be able to take care of Penn State and all over Michigan should be able to take care of Rutgers at\nRutgers Michigan should be able to take care of Indiana and then you see the comes down to Ohio State so I don't know if it was the right way I didn't think it was the right way to handle it before the game\nThen after the game and and at first I was wondering how the Michigan famine react with I was actually went to Michigan fans before the show started to make my good friends we were watching the baseball game together and they were a little bit of noise about\nWhat happened with Michigan and Michigan State not so much before the game they didn't love Bush kicking in the middle of the field but really after the game that they didn't like it\nIs it like whatsoever so here's the audio from chase when a bitch he's the Michigan defensive player he said this after the game of Fox and my friends that are

Colts sending classic James ... fashion looking grumpy miserable and frustrated and discussed and he looked at me and he said\nThey better and the jets ended up getting the victory and making change very happy\nFor this week and also very proud of his football team now we'll see if the jets could make it three in a row let's welcome in their starting left tackle Calvin beach in junior who's kind enough to join us right now on CBS Sports radio Calvin attack yeah thanks for the time and how are you\nKnow work thanks for having me\nWell we appreciate your coming on Calvin the last two weeks I've been very impressive you start off the year one in three you beat the lines and then lose three in a row to the dolphins Brown's in jaguars but the last two weeks you started off with the victory up against them bring them back it up with the Indianapolis Colts so how did this team turning around with two victories last two weeks\nYou know critical really you know work together and just say let's get back to fundamental let's get back to what we know a A R auto when it could have said it's about her and not worry about you know I thought it was about taking care of what we've got a quick are going to practice every day could in the war within\nWelcome execution they practice and they ... they would ever do that the past two weeks and have a great challenge and the public in this week going into that Colts game you talked about what the meat\nSo they go out and execute on Sunday if we're gonna have to do that the past two weeks and have another great a challenge and opponent coming in this week\nGoing into that colds game you talked about what the media about growing up in this team has to start winning games in a row instead of losing a few games in a row last week what did you learn about the team and what do you think they proved with what you had to St prior to the game\nYou're not from from the that that particular comment of growing up I think the basic straps you know a quarter do set it up at the game you know flash who were lost that game where\nYou are a couple of points and you know they started to rally at an ... that we found a way this place down the stretch and found a way to the gate and then you've got to take take pride and just find a way to win\nA game for the national football league is not an easy feat but uh you know of course both also came in the next day and and so there's a lot of places that stop the style so you know there's still some more for food and even after winter like ...\nWhat do you tell the rookies than the youngsters on this team because you have experience you point in the leagues since two thousand twelve how do you get them to try to buy in and try to get the most out of this team this year\nYou know just keep growing up and actually you know you can't check your foot out the gas you got to keep coming in putting working every day\nI'm you know your body's starting to feel some rigors of the season at least eight to come into the room or do you know a more cold or hot weather you know a whole body work you know take your credit body is better than what you thought you were doing is you're going to add a little extra credit for your to your routine in the animal actually see a corporation\nUm if you do that continually every single week on the way to put ourselves in a position where you know a world where we feel that we've done some things and they put ourself a playoff contention but you know right now our focus is this week uh like I said we've got a great opponent coming in this week uh cut the system and then this week\nYou know the young guys understand with the state but you know the veterans understand what's at stake and we have a great opportunity in front of us you know ... those talked about going into you know this the homes that and find a way to win three of them and went in it for our fans and went in for us you know at least that's the thing is the proof so no red opportunity coming up this week and we'll see we'll do it\nIt's not going to Calvin beach in junior right now and CBS Sports radio it's ... show so much of this year is obviously about the quarterback and Sam Darnell when you take a quarterback that young in New York at CERN overall and you start him right away just one of your impressions been so far the USC quarterback\nAnd many sandals every every step of the way a was with grace with boys are with resilience a got a lot of respect for the kids and how he's\nApproaching the game of focus the race and it's been going out of executed those that day so we're in excited for him I'm excited for his career credit for his growth this year are you know my job as an attack all is to keep them clean as possible to make his job as possible so excited for for what he's going to an hour we leave the state right now\nAnd you know and I know whenever rookie planes in this league any player that plays in this league there's going to be some mistakes then shame it's had some mistakes but something that impresses me it's a short term memory how was able to put those mistakes behind to go make a plan that next drive\nOr that's why I mentioned resilient you know because that's exactly what he is right now and I really enjoy that about all of his ability to to come into the huddle a good players that play so caught up play uh with the same type of confidence that they call plays with earlier on and I like I said I respect that about him a lot um you know he just going to continue\nTo grow as as a player to the park so excited to be a be here with him you know to start a journey what's he like in the huddle\nHe's confident man you know to be honest with you he's confident enough to be you know sometimes I forget how old are you is but to be his age it's come into auto where he has his career as a little older than he is afraid of the game for you know in a more years and he has to come in\nHey it's come into auto where he has his peers who are older than here to play the game for you know in a more years and he has to come in to the huddle have confidence in and be able to to to ask a more of the nights are that's great it's a habit at the age\nOf ... though he's going to continue to get better and better or as he gets more reps\nWhen you were going into camp and there was a chance that he could win the job and I said hey if he goes earns their job they should start in week one did you sense that confidence right away like when did you get a feeling this guy was going to be a special player\n[noise] I mean he's been that way since he's walked in you know he's been quiet who's been poised um you know he had that quiet confidence since he wants yeah so you you solve that uh the day walked in the door so that wasn't it wasn't like he just turned into since you've gotten a job so he's been the same guy says he wants to or it can really appreciate that about a person\nHow long does it take to build chemistry 'cause you're always building chemistry with uh some new names and are clearly a new quarterback in the offensive line trying to improve each and every week just wears the chemistry Adam this all sense of you know right now\n[laughter] you know I mean is this is the national football league may you don't have time to like try to think about how you can steal chemistry you gotta do it like you got to spend time each other\nYou've got to go places with one another guy go eat with one another you got to get to know each other's families um and that stuff happens organically and hatch it happens naturally a but it's one of those things that just has to happen for for a teams are thriving for for the chemistry among the the us to continue to get better\nTalking to Calvin beach a junior right now jets playing the Vikings this Sunday at one PM eastern ... show on CBS Sports radio we look at that all fenced in line\nAnd we talk about protecting Sam and how that is the most important first four games zero offensive line on ten fact the last two only three how is this often to line got better as of late\n[noise] starting to trust each other more you know a more than anything just on a trust each other trucks can work what we see what our eyes trust in each other and practice which translates into the game I mean there's been around each other more you know a kind of started a little rocky but\nYou know kind of settled a settled down a little bit and then starting to catch a group of again we've got a great difference coming in this week you know have had you know a great sense of the past couple of weeks and it's now just putting a permanent execution on display or this Sunday Sunday so\nDo you think this is going to be something that you could maybe continue into the future what this group because that was a group that going into this year there was a lot of question marks especially when you started rookie quarterback\nYou know that somebody's got to talk to Mike and it goes about honestly I'm you know my my job is to play on Sundays and make sure that the quarterback is clean make sure that was also a lot of everything that we can and everyone game\nOr to put ourselves in a position where we can learn about effectively the fish really um and then let the chips fall where they fall we're right now you know our focus is making sure that we as a unit are doing everything we can to produce one\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know how we do want to read the ... one for hip hop and R B\n\n[noise]\n\nJust say no in fact\nLifting of WG eating\n\nWe be

Cooper statistics said that over sixty percent of children have witness domestic violence in their house and today in the studio with me I have Roderick Cunningham he is the executive director of the Beverly Cunningham outreach program\nRoderick welcome to the show thank you thank you Amanda well I saw you when it's grim yes and I see you throughout the community\nBringing awareness to domestic violence apartment with a lot of different organizations to really informed people and educate them about the statistics of domestic violence tell us a little bit about you and your program and how you're connected to the Beverly Cunningham outreach program well\nAgain my name is Roderick I Am and I'm the executive director of the Beverly Cunningham outreach program and I started this program and I don't know if my mom who was murdered October twenty seven two thousand nine a right over in Decatur, Georgia right off of flat shows wrote and a\nShakespearean three marriages of domestic abuse she's she experienced financial abuse as well as physical abuse as well as emotional abuse most people don't even realize is different types of abuse and um most people will just the domestic violence as physical\nSo what we decided to do one is to educate person I was on it when I say persons that you started with a middle school high school college students and the job out of the community and even\nAdults senior adult experience a lot of domestic violence as well\nFrom children or and or their caretakers\nBecause you know they can't do certain things once I get to a certain certain age so we educate on that as well as part of like the forums that we do and things of that nature so we do to teen dating violence as well as a general body of a commute to educate experience on domestic violence\nWow so your mom was a victim yes that was about your mom tell us about this kind of\nA ... kind of him she was a bright little short woman low feisty you know she love love the lord and she loved to have child care for over Twenty years and a an in home childcare and the children loved her\nI just recently went to one of his graduation on behalf of my mom and you know she she actually cry when she's seen me because it was like my mom in there\nAnd just be left up to Raj being the community things of that nature so and she was all over the communities will begin to different churches and just beating the people in her community you know people just come by Amos Beverly what's cooking the day you know she was a fine person to\nIs and just feeding the people in her community you know people just come by Amos badly which kicking the day you know she was a fine person to a but\nAnd that shows that you will never know what the face of domestic violence looks like sometimes people don't look like what they're going through and her first marriage to a pastor\nYou know had been a second marriage so entrepreneur\nAnd then her third marriage is to a regular Joe he worked for ... a trucking which you know moving you know a box with some things of that nature you know when people are moving and I had been doing that for a while and but he was a big talker though he loved here I'm self taught you know those one of those type\nAnd um then October twenty seven\nYou came in a house our exit process in for the United states Secret Service getting ready to make my career move of thirty five at a time and he came in a house use the microwave heated up some food mother cooked yeah go see it was a club or almost churchgoing she was trying to change him\nBut you can't change was already there are sometimes you just have to let it be\nHowever came and started argument with my mom next thing I Know my mother saying what you're going to do with that guy\nPal and\nIran over the next room ... not not going to do because the doors locked and he opened the door and says she and my Mother's Day what you're going to do about it and we were told you so for a minute and then he walked away from it with a gun in the same\nI looked over at my mom blood coming out of our mouth\nCan see the womb and hit the memos springs on the on the ... and\n... and that's why I'm so passionate about because I feel that the creator left me here for a reason because he could easily kill me too and my baby brother who's hearing impaired those in the next room so I feel as though that I'm here to serve a purpose\nWow I I'm I'm I'm very emotional right now I mean I'm such a tragic story you know and\nNo Child should ever have to wait is their parents die at hand is someone who just having a bad day yeah and that's pretty much wedding sounds like these and I'm just blown away with it you are part of this statistic you and your brother a part of that\nSixty percent of children who have witnessed their parents\nBe abused in the home and you're right looking at your mom hearing her story hearing about how vibrant and beautiful she was\nThat does not look like the face of domestic violence\nAnd I'm just I I'm I'm speechless and tell us how how long has your foundation being in existence I Know your mom was tragically murdered in two thousand nine when did you decide I Want to honor my mom with this outreach program\nBut almost precisely a year later I um do you have to tell them I ... I guess I'm One of the ones who went to counseling sometimes you need to talk it out\nAnd have someone just to listen to you and just for you to be able to crowd or someone to share your pain to let it out and be able to continue to do that to let that paying out a so two thousand fan is when I started a program\nObviously with Arnold some time to be the exact uh in it and I have to tell this little short story with that\nWe apply for a five but wants to be three in July of two thousand than ... August of two thousand three and five but once they threw stamped\nWow that's very quick and three weeks later we had it in the mail\nThousand three and five but once they threw stamped wow that's very quick and three weeks later we had in the mail\nThat doesn't happen that stuff and it takes six months to a year to get longer\nAnd they asked a whole bunch of questions [laughter] so ah but I Will say also forgiveness when something tragic like that happened is very important because November two thousand Fifteen he was then it hangs penitentiary by president in other words I went there I forgave him for taking my mother's life not on behalf of my family\nBut myself personally so I Will say\nIf you are divorced from your perpetrator\nWhatever the case may be could have been a boyfriend let let it out let the worst come out of your mouth I mean it from your heart that you forgiven now because what you do if you take that into the next relationship\nYou know just keep off relationships relationship and what happened in the prior relationship with creep into your relationship and it certainly not even which you consciously want it to happen like that it'll happen so you have to forgive and it would have to move on\n... and here's the catch is that it's more than they have back there at home wow wow so is is between a rock and a hard place they're happy because they got what they may but at the same time it's not enough to survive here in the in the U.S state\nOkay well let's see here we talked about HIV even and we talked about human trafficking also when you're less talk monthly workshops that you provide in each county throughout the year the next one is mental health care mental health is huge now you know a lot of people are really\nComing out of the closet so to CERN in saying I\nHave mental issues I mean I'm not you know a lot of times we taught me knows people say oh she's crazy no that's not the case you could just have a a slight chemical imbalances factory where things aren't as\nIts just burdensome for you to just deal with daily life right talk about how you our organization is bringing more awareness to that through the workshops I see you offer free mental health counseling\nAnd we do it two ways one through the school system\nOr because you have some children that are in the school system that I actually proved effects actually you know going back to a shelter but but however is something that they can't help but like you just say there's a chemical imbalance there\nBut they all they may really is this a tender love and care sometimes\nYou know when you've got first got news for the industry ... you had a mental somebody took your hand yeah that's what they made\n... they don't necessarily all the time they eat those ... ... and all those different types of medication because that in half says the issue more so it it comes to them down yes okay I'll give it a medication that however one medication wears off\nThey need to know loving care again to walk them through that process and we have mentors within a program that I actually walk them walk with them along the way and they can say man\nMr Cunningham or misguided ham or amend or that they helped me wow and they look at it at all if you are my friend and they trust you so when they go on through life\nYou're the one that they can contact even if they go to a different state they move on and you help build there's a sting because most of the time the self esteem was very low\nSometimes some people have a main miss about them\nBecause they're covering up something in their ... their mask and you know and we help them to uncover that mask\nYou know and to move on with our life and go forward and enjoy life\nLook okay you don't have to tell everybody your condition just tell me and I can compensate with you we talk about if we go out to eat would go to the movies together and make them feel comfortable you know and that's how we get rid of the children as we show them a video\nOf sex trafficking we showed them a video of what exploitation looks like we show them a a video or what HIV the middle of the things that makes it ... all these different things look like\nIn this case is good for them to chatter Mm because after we turn to a video of what a Chelsea in this they sing themselves ... once you get them to open up\nChatter Mm because after we turn the radio would have jealousy and they sing themselves ... once you get them to open up got to be ready for the\nRight because they have a lot of issues that that you probably are not even prepare for dessert and one thing that you share with me here in the paper that you gave me it says that in Georgia and Ninety percent of those who die by suicide had an underlining\nMental illness and that suicide is the third leading cause of death among use ages ten to twenty four in America there so there is a problem here and I think the more we medicated the worse it gets so we definitely\nNeed more exposure and opportunities to get off an offer for the free services now\nBefore we and I want to talk more about\nYour monthly workshops let's talk and its let's talk HIV mental health and human trafficking and the Beverly Cunningham outreach program offers these workshops on a monthly basis for next when you said it's coming up November the tennis November and then after that it's December and January so far so for us\nIf someone wanted to learn more about it in a register what's the website\nIs W. W. W. dot B. C. O. P. dot org alright B. C. O. P. dot org granted him is that for the Beverly cutting me on average for around ... you know Roger I'd enjoy speaking with you today about this I'm so happy that your organization is doing this on a level that\nThat it needs to be done on this is the type of organization that\nConnects people with the resources and the services free often times that they need to be better\nTo live a healthier life and to get the assistance that they need to get out of a troubling situation or if you know of someone that might benefit from these workshops let them know about it now if someone also wanted to volunteer or if they want it to donate they can visit the website and they can be led to do all of those things\nOr they can just email simply info at ... dot org\nOut of work to [laughter] be resemble keep it simple I Love it well you know Roderick I mean your story has absolutely touched me you know and there is no look for domestic violence it could be anyone and you as a child that's dealt with that reminds me of my own personal family member that have dealt with that he\nToo watched his mom be murdered in the street by his stepfather in it has haunted him in a sense because\nLike you said with ... he doesn't know when this man is going to be released if he has been released over a ... I Believe he too has forgiven him but it definitely changes the trajectory of your life if you don't lean into that forgiveness\nAnd I applaud you for\nNot just letting it's hot and you but free yourself through this organization in Beverly Cunningham outreach program that's helping other people that maybe in some of the situation that you were in just as I said oh I'm thank you so much for your time today would you like to share any lasting worse to a child that experience in this right now\nIs for a child has experience with something like this right now talk to her coach talk to your

to experience the future of driving with a Nissan intelligent mobility here's what they told me [noise]\nBefore he died more into that I Want us to take a step back and\nReally that people know some of the programs that the nonprofit offers you talked a little bit about girls talk and the college prep let us know what all goes into growth talk in the garden I mean I've been there of course I Know but informed to listeners of how that goes yes so we um\nSo we've put on a number of these uh at various middle schools in the city so we target and ah bring in some ... motivate some speakers um so these are all women who can inspire these young women so they speak from the heart\nUm and really talk about the things that they've overcome as well as just answering questions from the young girls so it's a wonderful wonderful event I'm so not only do they hear from the speakers but we also do a number of different\nUm activities with the young girls to really help promote 'em and let them think about\nWhat makes some floors and what makes them special so um it's really again like Taylor was saying it's it's just an amazing event to be a part of\nAnd um I think these young women definitely got a lot out of it as well so not only just helping their own self but also you know making these connections with these inspiring women in our community as well\nAnd not only that um I Believe that all of the speakers we brought on Dave enjoyed it just as much as\nBarring women in our community as well\nAnd not only that um I Believe that all of the speakers we brought on they enjoyed it just as much as the young ladies and they get just as much out of the conversations as the young ladies do so everyone walks away leaving more power than they came and you know wanting to do more so\nI Know I did when we had it what was the first school we did uh we did em okay middle school was the first school what we did and we went to supplement of yes sickly and middle school and I remember all the young ladies in their\nSome of them were athletes but a lot of them were wanting to be doctors and lawyers and here salad and I enjoyed like watching them really light up when we ask them questions I'd when we would ask them about you know the definition of character I enjoy the answers that we received back from other girls\nYeah so it was a great opportunity and when we do girl talk on the garden a poster bloom fast\nIt's more of an intimate environments so we hear firsthand of what's bothering the girls\nUm what challenges they have it's a very candid and it says that for just having I mean it's it's not a lecture it's not a workshop it's a conversation and I think it's important because we all talk about the future is female um and we need to nurse these girls and that is true but how are we doing it I mean we could\nPut up all day these images of these powerful women that look like them they see them on TV they see them on social media but the thing is we need to tell them well how do they get their ... and they need in order to get to that space and be on TV and be inspiration\nInspirational and be those living on TV so what we need to do 'em as have programs like this have these conversations and\nI mean there's a lot of other nonprofits do the same and I love that because we touch more lives and if we give the girls the tools they need\nThe reality is they can be there but unless we do that invested in our girls the futures female is just the hash tag and we don't want that we actually want to give them the tools ... make it easily

left nothing rash FEMA community things of that nature so and she was all over the community is well speaking of different churches and just fate and the people in her community you know people just come by Amos babbling which kicking the day ... you know and she was a fine person to a but\nAnd that shows that you will never know what the face with the master bounce looks like sometimes people don't look like what they're going through and her first marriage to a pastor\nYou know and then a second marriage so entrepreneur\nAnd then her third marriage to a regular Joe he worked for a live a trucking but you know moving you know a box with some things of that nature you know when people are moving\nAnd I had been doing that for a while and but he was a big talker though he loved to hear him self taught you know those one of those type and um then October twenty seventh\nHe came in a house I was actually process and for the United states Secret Service getting ready to make my career move us thirty five at a time and he came in a house used microwave heated up some food a mother cooked yeah go see it was a club or my mother was a church school she was trying to change him but\nYou can't change was already there sometimes you just have to let it be however came and started argument with my mom next thing I Know my mother saying what you're going to do with that guy\nPow and\nI ran over to next Rome look I'm not going to do because the doors locked and he opened the door and says she and my Mother's Day which you can do about it and we were told her so for a minute and then he walked away from it with the gun and they're saying I looked over at my mom blood coming out of our mouth\nExplored it for their services services have little or nothing kind of like I'm a migrant worker sense that I Am going to have his act with the same thing ... we see different a sweat shops we hear about 'em over in different countries but in the United states when people say\nLabor trafficking give us in a clear picture of what that looks like an\nAnimal said before I give an example it can actually be male or female ... just the general I cease to female as being in labor traffic but males can be trapped as well I'll give you an example of it um you have a female\nThat is I'm at an office\nWorking as a reception is her big ... she's a secretary for one of the executives however she's she's being paid\nSeven dollars an hour for a twenty five dollars an hour job but the thing is is that if not on the record so now it becomes labor trafficking for those services so it's a it's a waste thing and that's why when he was saying earlier\nThat is a pay little or nothing\nThat's where literally ... pay little or nothing is modern day slavery is essentially what it is\nSo this is a situation where these people are they forced into the forced into it I can relate to sex trafficking I can relate to exploitation but I'm trying to wrap my mind around someone foreseen another person to work in an environment that they can escape and but they can't\nTell how does that even began Roger paint us a picture of how one would get sucked into labor trafficking\nOf that same person that has just spoke a is from India mhm they come over\nOh one would get sucked into labor trafficking\nOf that same person that I was just spoke a is from India ... they come over to America they want to come up to America for a better life however another\nSomebody knows the frame that can get them over to the U.S and they say hey I can get you over here and get you a green card I can get your visa et cetera they get\nAll of that for them they don't charge Mm\nSo when I get over here they painted okay now you you it I don't want to save name of a corporation but you at a corporation now\nSo that's how I was under the table because I got you overhear down to what I said I was going to do but you never mention anything about payment anything like that now you over here\nYou living barely ... you like in a one bedroom apartment your children will still back there in India and you're doing the best you can you almost homeless\nBut you want to be here in Atlanta but free\nThat paint a better picture\nFor you yes and I think we all had probably encountered someone who's been forced who's been you know forced into a labor trafficking\nAnd didn't even realize it yeah when you separate anybody from their family you gave them barely enough to survive and they don't really have a support system the Mac eat eat eat is slavery and here's the catch to that end nearing indentured slavery is ...\n... and here's the catch is that it's more than they have back there at home wow wow\nSo is is between a rock and a hard place they're happy because they got what they may but at the same time it's not enough to survive fairly\nAnd the U.S states okay well that's what I see here we talked about HIV and we talked about human trafficking also when you're less talk monthly workshops that you provide in each county throughout the year\nThe next one is mental health mental health is huge now you know I'm a lot of people are really coming out of the closet so

your you offer free mental health counseling yes\nAnd we do it two ways one through the school system or because you have some children that are in the school system that I actually proved effects actually you know going back to a shelter but but however is something that they can't help but like you just say there's a chemical imbalance there\nBut they all lead me really is this little tender love and care sometimes\nYou know when you've got first got news for the industry ... you had a mental as to why they took your hand that's what they need ... they don't necessarily all the time they those ... ... and all those different types of medication because the betting passes the issue more so it it comes to them down yes\nI'll ... I'll be able to medication that however wants the medication wears off\nThey need to know loving care again to walk them through that process and we have mentors within a program that I actually walk them walk with them along the way and they can say hey Mr Cunningham or miss kind a ham or amend or\nThat they helped me wow\nThey look at it at all if you are my friend ... and they trust you so when they go on through life\nBut the help me wow and they look at it at all if you are my friend and they trust you so when they go on through life\nYou're the one that they can contact even if they go to a different state they move on and you help builders esteem because most of the time the self esteem was very low sometimes\nPeople have a ... about them because they're covering up something ... their ... their mask and you know and we help them to uncover that mask\nYou know and to move on with our life and go forward and enjoy life look okay you don't have to tell everybody your condition fill me and\nI can compensate with you we talk about if we go out they would go to movies together and make them feel comfortable you know and that's how we get rid of the children is we show them a video\nOf sex trafficking we show them a video of exploitation looks like we show them or a video or what H. I. V. the middle of things that made you what all these different things look like in this case is good for them to charter Mm\nBecause after we turn the radio would of Chelsea in this\nLike sing themselves ... once you get them to open up got to be ready for the\nRight because they have a lot of issues that that you probably are not even prepare for is a\nAnd one thing that you share with me here in the paper that you gave me it says that in Georgia and Ninety percent of those who die by suicide had an underlining mental illness and that suicide is the third leading cause of death among use ages\nTen to twenty four in America there so there is a problem here and I think the more we medicated the worse it gets so we definitely\nNeed more exposure and opportunities to toss an offer free to the free services now\nBefore we and I want to talk more about\nYour monthly workshops let's talk and its let's talk HIV mental health and human trafficking and the Beverly Cunningham outreach program offers these workshops on a monthly basis and ex when you said it's coming up November the tennis November and then after that it's December and January so far so for us\nIf someone wanted to learn more about it in or register what's the website\nIs W.

C. O. P. that or\nOf work to [laughter] he resembled keep it simple I Love it well you know Roderick I mean your story has absolutely touched me you know and there is no look for domestic violence it could be anyone to and you as a child that's dealt with that reminds me of my own personal family member that have dealt with that\nHe too watched his mom be murdered in the street by his stepfather and it has haunted him in a sense because\nLike you said when Mars he's like he doesn't know when this man is going to be released if he has been released\nYeah and it has haunted him in a sense because like you said with ... he doesn't know when this man is going to be released if he has been released a novel leave he too has forgiven him but it definitely changes the trajectory of your life if you don't lean into that forgiveness and I applaud you for\nNot just letting his haunting you but free yourself through this organization Beverly Cunningham outreach program that's helping other people that maybe in some of the situation that you were in yes as I said oh well thank you so much for your time today would you like to share any lasting worse to a child that's experiencing this right now\nIs for a child as experience or something like this right now to go to a coach ... stricter talked to someone that you trust get it off your chest so that you can get help and that you have to move on before you get to go do it because you don't want it to carry it to you though\nWell let's just answering questions from the young girls so it's a wonderful wonderful event I'm so not only do they hear from the speakers but we also do a number of different um activities with the young girls to really help\nPromote 'em and let them think about\nWhat makes some floors and what makes them special so um it's really a gun like Taylor was saying it's it's just an amazing event to be a part of\nAnd um I think these young women definitely got a lot out of it as well so not only just helping their own self but also you know making these connections with these inspiring women in our community as well\nAnd not only that um I Believe that all of the speakers that we brought on they've enjoyed it just as much as the young ladies and they get just as much out of the conversations as the young ladies do so everyone walks away leaving more empowered then they came and you know wanting to do more so\nI Know I did when we had it what was the first school we did uh we did em okay middle school was the first school that we did and we went to suck limit of yes sickly and middle school and I remember all the young ladies in their\nSome of them were athletes but a lot of them were wanting to be doctors and lawyers and here salad and I enjoyed like watching them really light up when we ask them questions like when we would ask them about you know the definition of character I enjoy the answers that we received back from all the girls yes\nIt was a great opportunity and when we do girl talk on the garden a poster bloom fast\nIt's more of an intimate environments so we hear firsthand of what's bothering the girls\nUm what challenges they have it's a very candid and it says that for just having I mean it's it's not a lecture it's not a workshop it's a conversation and I think it's important because we all talk about the future is female um and we need to nurse these girls and that is true but how are we doing it I mean we could\nPut up all day these images of these power for women that look like them they see them on TV they see them on social media but the thing is we need to tell them well how do they get their what they need in order to get to that space and be on TV and be inspiration\nInspirational envy those living on TV so what we need to do 'em as have programs like this have these conversations and\nI mean there's a lot of other nonprofits and do the same and I love that because we touch more lives and if we give the girls the tools they need\nThe reality is they can be there but unless we do that invested in our girls the features female is just the hash tag and we don't want that we actually want to give them the tools ... make it easily accessible so they know what to do and how to navigate life in order to excel and be in those positions\nAnd I really enjoyed the part where we were able to incorporate things that are affecting them now because I like social media via the whole conversation on social media and how you present yourself and they were asking us questions and we were actually learning stuff from them I really enjoyed that\nPart too yeah yeah I was a great part I mean that was something that we don't have or at least I didn't have [laughter] growing up and I'm so also you know being a mother of a young girl and boy
