I didn't think anybody that knew that but me I thought I was the only one I guess you could get as\n\nBad as a pause worthy moment in our American democracy\nThat was a pause worthy moment the president of the United states has proclaimed and very specific terms that he is going to end up birthright citizenship in the United states of America\nWhat was the first time America ended birthright citizenship\nWhen was this case an issue before this United States government the whole argument of birthright citizenship well there was in Eighteen fifty seven\nDred Scott versus Sanford also known as the\nDred Scott decision landmark decision by the United States Supreme court\nThat held that a negro whose\nAncestors were imported into into the U.S and soda slaves and slave or free could not\nEver become an American citizen and therefore had no standing to sue in federal court\nAnd that the federal government had no power\nTo regulate slavery in the federal territories acquired after the creation of the United states Dred Scott and his slave demand\nWho had been taken by the owners to free states in territory's attempted to sue for his freedom the decision was seven to two\nIt said that you had no birthright citizenship in the United states of America as a black person descended from Africans\nBecause of the fourteenth amendment the adoption of the fourteenth amendment and the various clauses in that amendment it ... the Supreme Court's ruling\nBut it looks like we're back here again\nFor zero for eight nine two seven zero three what say you let's go to mow bars in Atlanta ... good they welcome\n[laughter] hey good morning Dr Richard ... I'm great how are you I I\nI Am good you know there were two points um but I I wanted to talk to you about [noise] uh I guess I'll go with this whole thing with Trump you know a lover in quite a will distraction knowing that it's not going to happen after our system of checks and balances but he gets talking\nAnd I'll Wait a minute let me push back on that I I don't completely in wholeheartedly disagree with you a hero the is obscene to debate about two very reasonable Harvard educated lawyer on CNN or into political bond is that\nI've seen the debate by two very reasonable Harvard educated lawyer on CNN on into political pundits that always go head to head the student and the teacher okay I've seen them argue both sides of this that through executive order\nYou can actually interpret what what bird right citizenship is\nThrough executive action one argued for another argued against it the point is is an arguable debate\nIt is an arguable debate that will wind up in front of a conservative Supreme Court\nWhich will do the sided issue once again about checks and balances can the U.S president go ahead and and change something um you know on amendment without a constitutional convention or an act of Congress to change that particular amendment it will succeed and offering another distraction as this goes on\nBut the evidence by going to say but why do you say is simply offering you know the distraction I mean I think it's Syria's when the U.S president said and believes it and solace will support him as well as his up appointing Supreme Court when he says he went in birthright citizenship I think that's real\nOkay and when we say he's going to end birthright citizenship immediately in our mind it comes to what your population what Democrats it doesn't matter\nOh well I agree it doesn't matter but he doesn't talk about ending the maternity hotels but be you know department of homeland security are rated this year that was a Chinese what who pay up to eighty thousand dollars to come to this country a few weeks before there were deliver\nBecause we know that that\nIs a harsh reality for many minorities who do know graduate but do not get the same love in the marketplace Julia I don't know if you know this brother\nDo you have any student loan debt I Am a couple of thousand okay then you got a little bit you got a little bit of debt right evidently when you file or if you ever filed and I'm not talking about your particular I'm just saying in general if you ever filed bankruptcy\nThere are two things that bankruptcy will not forgive you for one\nIs if you committed fraud you have to steal pay the money back to student loans those are the two things\nThat bankruptcy will not help you out of fraud and student loan debt there was something wrong with our laws young Julian when a person can hit such harsh times\nThat they can't even afford the bare essentials of life and to take care of their fundamental bills they can't pay their debts we have a lot we have this great reset button called bankruptcy and penalize you but at the same time you get to come out of it eventually right\nBut you still were older student debt why don't we push for that why are black Republicans pushing for that I have yet to hear black Republicans in any public way challenge the\nMainstream Republican ideology so that the needle can be pushed\nAnd if they did that here's the catch young Julian if black Republicans actually pushed the agenda and the Republican Party and other black saw movement and the Republican Party they would then opened up opportunity for other blacks to showing the Republican Party\nIf that's what they did but it seems as if black Republicans especially in the public spotlight utilize more so as props\nTo simply rubber stamp the existing agenda of whoever's in charge and that's what this looks like it's yeah and that's what it looks like four zero for eight nine to two seven zero three let's go to Todd calling from his mom was basement targeted they welcome\nI Am not calling from my mom is [laughter]\nAnyway [laughter] anyway [noise] fourteenth the fourteenth amendment pretty farm on that but he's doing what he usually the\nMe read a section I Want to read the section and here's what legal scholars argue sexual one of that fourteenth amendment and I definitely I definitely give you Tom Todd to respond okay it says all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction there up what they are going to argue\nIs that if you are born in the United\nAnd subject to the jurisdiction there up what they are going to argue is that if you are born in the United states\nBut your parents were not legal citizens then you are not subject to the jurisdiction there up that would become the legal argument so ... there's a level of argument there I I think any reasonable person a reasonable judge would say All right let's dismiss that silly argument\nBut unreasonable judges\nActivist judges conservative activist judges would not\nYet he would\nDo you think so yeah they will you do realize\nThe same law has been a chilling Trump that he can't do this through executive order have a similar philosophy of the lawyers that he appointed to the Supreme Court\nThat's true I Believe yeah that's true but I I'm not I'm not inclined to believe that a judge work their way we'll try to push this through\n... that's why I said a reasonable judge would not authorize the would no no a reasonable judge would not unreasonable activist judge on unreasonable conservative judge would\nI'm not even inclined to believe that they would that's just way too risky at this point just point five I'm just now with that Hickenlooper you were talking about Hillary know Hillary shouldn't rush to oh Hickenlooper is getting up there too big a looper from Colorado we talked about him briefly before what do you think about this guy rented cars\nCars troop leader can

why\nHe's running the state of Colorado near rather well they're in the forefront of two main two big things are there and the public demand right now want of course the ... selling marijuana yeah which has been very great for that state yeah\nWell yeah but well financially it has yeah they need to get they need the federal government needs to get up off of it so it could be more secure so they can secure their money better\nAnd immigration ... Colorado's pretty good immigrants now and Hickenlooper then he's been an advocate for for their I'm\nSafe progress to get to citizenship oh I think he I think he will be a good candidate based on the limited information I have bottom at this point Hillary Clinton would not be\nI'm actually going to my mother's house and I will be doing for work in her basement but [laughter]\nHe said you thought that your caller there\nAre so tight as with another person on our radar\nA Hickenlooper was not on my right off the president not at all not at all or possibly for zero for a now too to seven zero three you're getting rid of the really ran radio news and talk Thirteen eighty W.

Lance bottoms [laughter] well I tell you this out rather be worried about um\nIllegal aliens coming here then to keep worrying about African American children who are being slaughtered in ... Atlanta is the number one state you know for what thirty or forty years\nFor human trafficking of children and and so they're killing so they're not they're raping molested their own children and send them home to therapy in their own homes and they're still getting up and go on to church on Sunday Morning but they're killing ours and ... and under what government system and George had been up under a white Caucasian male\nTo fitness twenty Eighteen people do you do know that your children are not safe in the state of Georgia\nGeorgia in California at the top two safe and human trafficking\nYou know that under each year that we had a governor now what governor had spoke on these things if you have a man like Brian Kemp who is a criminal who should be in jail Lewis show and you're out in\nSuburbs open when he has done a Mac and what he has done behind towards the secretary of state he's not going to be a governor he's not even to be secretary of state and it says it is a race war then what do we want to do about it and that makes me so angry to hear this and I am so happy that\nA lot of our young you are not following this lead there are so during their revolution as they are fighters and their down with the game and I'm very very angry disappointed to hear y'all talk about that and you ask them who he'd be voting for\nThis should be no question about who you're voting for you not tired of seeing your young black children being the number one children that are being molested on the black lab and ...\nThat's what happened in your state and you're not going to get any kind of a change for bad with the wind chip in office if he takes the bulk of their parents\nWhat are you making gotta do for them and not only that I'm even let you talk about um he's going to make in it but I don't know about your book about this Obama's coming here I Will be at that rally\nWhen you talk about issues like this you should not have a question about who you're voting for and what Trump is doing what he's talking about illegal illegal aliens and Mexicans because that's all he had nothing else on his register is nothing else that he's done significant than he'd been in office the only thing that he can do to spark\nThese dumb idiots to do the things that they're doing it to talk about things like that and I tell you if you're a Jewish if you're Spanish if you're a Latino\nIf your neck that can't if you're Muslim is your Chinese\nYes what do you are people of color and you you might with African Americans because you are people of color and it doesn't matter what Trump does what they do that's why they want to change to put things in the constitution because they know that our time is coming so they think they'll play to install now to make\nFor us to kick those stones over but that's not going to happen because our grandchildren are great grandchildren I Want to be the majority and if you think that just because you are somewhere on a Supreme Court said you're going to put down a law to the majority of we're going to stand for\nYou it's not that happens I don't even worry about Trump puts in the Supreme Court I already know what's going to happen with that you they're only there for as long as it's\nWhat as long as they lift their their their point it for life\nDo you think that you're going to be the minority and you're going to tell the majority what to do and you're going to lead us on the wrong direction I don't worry about things like that I worry about\nTo six o'clock we will have full and politicians and music\nAnd we rattling to make sure that that you know what to do on Tuesday that I'll go to the polls into Tuesday why did the fact that\nYou've got to remember when I went to fight in Vietnam I couldn't even vote I turned Twenty one and a foxhole and Vietnam wow do win able to vote before I vote for this country now I can vote I Want to go to the poll Tuesday and make history\nBack to command I appreciate your call the update okay but thank you\nSir for zero for you not to do seven zero three that get you in the conversation today for zero for eight nine to two seven zero three a Tea Party Lou are coming from the birds\nThat last caller dairy fat and and actually that's one of the reasons why a lot of us don't believe in Medicare for all because I don't think the government can bring anything\nYeah do you believe in Trump because this is according to commander Mickey ... that this has gotten worse under President Trump not bear disappointing appointing right and you're going to challenge your commander in chief\nI Will look into the issue I I find it or are you looking\nDisappointing disappointing right absolutely you're going to challenge your commander in chief I Will look into the issue I cited or are you looking into that lead into a bar to move with my kids aren't veterans yet yeah but they will be right like God willing absolutely\nWithout duty part a little while many of and I don't know if you do this particularly but many people who think like you do criticize me and say that I'm anti American I'm not patriotic anyone who knows me any member of my staff\nThey know that when we go on to eat if I see anybody in uniform and I'm Talking about police fire or military ... always pay for their meals always and if they sit in the family I pay for their top families meal\nI tell the until the waiter or waitress or the manager do not let them know who paid for it I Do that every single day so that every day okay because I appreciate their willingness to sacrifice that doesn't mean I Need to agree with the agency\nThat doesn't mean I Need to agree with the war\nI agree with their willingness to fight okay so so and I I Would challenge do Republicans who talk trash about me especially conservative radio how much money do they raise the ... police benevolent sci fi I raise money for them every year how much do they raise every year for them\nWe're talking about cops who have had a injuries in the line of duty and the government chose not to take care of them I raise money for those cops\nSo I'm just I just wanted to put that out there because of some people get a twisted uh as far as my dedication to my general community go ahead tired I'm always\nI always hear in your voice your dedication to the community all people in the can I Do hear that in your voice all the time I admire that about you absolutely\nI got to admire to me that's what we thought over here anyway [laughter] I Love your I admire your your dedication to your community absolutely operated they're not mind your dedication to the fact that\nI think your idea sometimes you know like when I look at Medicare for all I see that taking the problems in the VA and our VA hospital and transferring that to everybody that\nI don't believe in a single payer system correct no I don't what system but let me just say you had your perfect world too far to look what system would be the best system to increase who receive health care because we need to do that\nWell I mean I think I Do believe in a safety net system for people that can't\nUm take care of themselves I Do believe in the I mean there are people that have certain pre existing conditions\nThat we need to protect I Do believe that but when you when you just throw out preexisting conditions in general you can take it was a study out to California where half the people on the Obamacare plants all demographics it can be doesn't matter what drink a lot less what we'd get their free services get their free checkups and then drop their payments for the rest of the year\nAnd then just because they can pick it up again I think we need to wait out the people that truly need help versus the people that just want to gain the system\nOkay and there there's always game the system you know that but you can't you can't get rid of the system because of the one percent of people that would try to game it you can't get rid of it\nBut we can ever everything is so heated we can't have a discussion on issues like it when you look at Obama's you're one of the things they put in with those computers and the camera it takes that twenty five percent of the doctor's\nTime they're very burns you out with the system and it takes away their personal interaction because they have to look at what what is what you know it was meant to be\nWhat the government wants you figure treatment plant not what the doctor thinks is best for you\nAfter you look at what what is what you know it was next to me what the government wants you figure treatment plant not what the doctor thing is that you look at you look at issues like that there are people that actually have to perform the services that are very frustrated you have doctors wanting to retire telling our kids not to be doctors\nAnd they are but let's allow the doctors see part of ... the doctors next time we do this\nLet them shape it\nLet them tell us what's most efficient because that's what we lack during the political Mandalay between the Democrats or Republicans under under the under the leadership of president Morocco bomber we got rid of the medical professionals\nThat's right and you get you get when you say when you transfer to Medicare try I mean the Medicare Medicaid systems pay the doctors\nWhat about forty percent less as anybody asking them how much are they going to be you're gonna you're gonna get this profession where people were very hard and hunger a lot of stress and say we're going to limit your pet we don't do that for any other any other profession out there but we're going to do it for this profession people that to me I wouldn't\nReally matter I Will say this the other side is completely off to Iraq or to say this needs to be a free market system and that is it there should be government intervention\nI think president bronco bomber was on the right track I Believe you should have fought all the way for single payer because what he eventually passed was basically the Republican version of universal healthcare\nIt was if you listen to ... this is a Trojan Horse for single payer it was it was designed yeah I mean do you hear people talking about premiums going up and how they you know they cared about it is I Want to get people to come down the road to Medicare for all\nHard you know here's the thing the part of ... in in this particular paradigm you always have\nAlways have winners and losers the single payer option eliminates that more so than any other option but and the current construct you will have winners or losers and those winners and losers will uh will vary it every year there will be a barrier of winners and losers every single year\nI I you know sometimes you have you had a situation like like a year ago there was a little boy and\nA and M. read he got to be quick and and you can you can you can raise you can do you can you can get in that treatment when you have a government run system the government decides no that will not happen and that's the problem when you when you when you had a thing where the government says no that will not happen that's\nWhere the ... but that's part of the talking points you guys are tempted to sail to the American public and you called them death panels when it was absolutely not that at all I'm coming to heartbreak I got to go see part of Lou operator called\nCan I ask about the issue before or after the break the what\nI called about something else\nThe part I'm ... I'm going to say this to you\nBecause you gave me a compliment\nI'm going to do something I have rarely ever done and that's put you on hold and bring you back on the other side of the particles don't disappoint me\nAll right thank you hold on [noise]\nThey'll made me regret this moment\nYou gonna run with the man already knew the doctors W.

[noise] well I\nJust developed receiving driven by here for more so basically the dealers dot com social media is low enough to say it's not because of any particular one thing but there are lots of moves being made in the NFL and I think some of these moves\nMicro surprising NFL fans some of them surprising falcon fans now if you just jumping in the car and you're going All right so what's the deal we got in two minutes Dukes and bill we do anything\nI don't think so um we did pick up saying beetles or guard who was not a trade deal he was basically out there and ah the falcon ... decision they made a roster move but it gives us some depth Mike but outside of that we're seeing all these flash moves around the league and the falcons they're not going to be a part of it as far as I think with about a minute left here\nYou know we were just talking about our fear which when Bo Morgan producing today and uh you know the thing with Vicki is the falcons picked up his fifth your option member you can do that for a guy in the first round of Carl yet but they can also cut him they you know because they figure they also don't have to pay him next year you understand that one\nI mean we're we're always on the assumption when we talked to listen sometimes we do we do have the option perfect but we don't have to exercise and even though I thought we did so\nI'm Wondering why don't we maybe make a move to be more proactive in the past rush department I Know Dr Fowler hasn't really amounted to much of anything is the first round or a third overall pick he visited entire season when they see I was only got a sex\nBut you're seeing the rams in a mode Carl is like it's when now we are all in now I'll give you a third round of this the next trapped in a fifth round or in the twenty twenty drive to get a guy because I'm I'm taking a flyer that he can help my past rushed\nAlong with the dynamic and sued obviously with Donald so they're doing it you know they they made that somebody moves I mean they probably make more than anybody the season if you go back to to march\nRight I agree with that Mike and remember what this is really about they have a rookie quarterback who's bowling\nHe's still in his rookie deal guys the new NFL says if you draft the right guy quarterback and your team is good\nYour window was about four years because of the point where you're gonna have to pay Jared Gulf the twenty five to thirty million dollars he will demand is usually when your team changes it happened with Seattle okay and it's happening in other places around the league where you can't maintain the kind of veterans you want\nAnd so they went out and sign all these guys and now you look at the rams they are still undefeated and all of a sudden Mike they go we got a real shot right so that\nIs allowing them to do some of this stuff and it's just the fact that the salary cap as not being you know sort of their cabin not going to the quarterback in that that's kind of what it is now the capital continue to go up but yes you're right they're being very aggressive here a couple of other moves guys and we'll talk about the dogs coming up and just a second we just mentioned before we went to the break\nSafety how how Clinton Dix\nHas been traded the Redskins are sending a fourth round pick to the Packers now we see the Redskins on Sunday\nAnd I was talking with Bo about this and I said wait a minute Dix as a starter for them but teams are also seen guys if they potentially are not going to bring back next year and they're moving on from so if I Know I'm not going to resign your next season I might as well go get some picks for for you\nSo you've seen everything from guy sticking a strategically right about how they're going to proceed dress how look I'm not going to pay higher Clinton Next Fifty million or whatever he's asking for\nThen you've also got something on the Green Bay side which smacks a bit of vendetta you guys in Montgomery was given specific instructions to either let's go to the end zone or touch back take any and let's give Aaron Rodgers with a two minute the office of chance\nYou say Hi Montgomery was given specific instructions to either let's all go to the end zone or touch back take any and let's give Aaron Rodgers with a two minute a fence a chance to make a play he tries to return the ball and he fumbled and it basically cost and the game\nAnd ah he's training or an apparently there was a lot of bad vibe and their locker room about time Montgomery from the players not just the coaching staff how about that one but you know that goes down earlier today golden Tate against traded from the lions\nSo the eagles get to pick up some help because uh they want to beef up the the receiver core there\nIn the rams trade or for Dante fellers we've mentioned it and so either way I got some major move some big names being mentioned here\nOr as these deals as we've talked about traditionally the NFL hadn't worked his way into my point I think you're seeing more movement simply as guys it in teams adjusted the cap\nAnd how they're going to approach now really either you're in it or you're off season moving forward to either loosen up some money or to to basically say listen we're moving on from a guy and there's no reason for him to be here let's get let's get a pick because picks right and that's what matters the more you have\nThe more potential moves you can make when it comes to the spring especially with the draft and it gives you a lot of leverage\nAnd that was like you know the Bella trick business models everybody tries to it tries to emulate here's the thing a lot of talk and venturing this up and I gather you're frustrated have you seen names and selling some some names bigger than others heads of marriage Thomas Tamm Mary's times maybe time is going to the Texans and they'll play the Broncos in Denver this weekend how about that\nBut yeah the uh the falcon ... percent costs what what are we doing what's her a lot in life are going to roll with practice players in backups and just hope these guys uh catch on\nAnd then the debo comes back in two weeks right for two weeks and then we'll be ready to roll I mean I get it I I Know you're you're with me when you say you want to see this you think this team is in the wind now mode as well and why are we as aggressive with some of these other ...\nI think the mindset of coach Quinn and I think he's kind of hinted towards this and he talked about it yesterday\nThat when you look in the team they're confident in the guys that they have now you may feel differently and make it on me feel differently but that's a decision that's being made it flowery branch I as I said guys\nI think some of the guys like on the defensive side to send to play better you know you started the conversation by talking about victims is the fifth year option and unless he's hurt they can move on from him and it doesn't cost us anything\nSo you know in essence what we're telling you is the next one two three four nine games\nAre big deal to victory easily okay\nIt's the same thing the ... of the books are going through ... with their quarterback right now they're trying to figure out of shame it's just their franchise guy and do we want to pay in that twenty million dollars next year might be for alternately we give them a big long term deal he's been to up and down to inconsistent to commit that kinda money to him well guess what\nYou know these that's Russia's man they make big money and the guys that are dominant in this league or deserving do you want to invest in a guy that really had one stand out season this far and how do you feel about him being a difference maker you can't be here for the NFL might be able to be talking about well he's coming right you\nSunday [noise]\nDown in flames and or limit you Sunday Morning radio game\nGolden's ran to the program funded by greater

Fowler a for falcon fans and this is where we're at All right when you look at where our football team is and we're going to talk about Washington coming up here and we've got our stock report is five\nTo get tickets frustration today when when you hear the falcon fan that with the injuries we have Mike that uh\nYou know there was really I don't I'm not going to say an attempt or no attempt to make them over to 'cause we don't know that how often the phone was picked up or who they talk to write but at the end of the result is we don't have any additional players fruit tree\nThe one thing that went down this afternoon wouldn't make sense for us because you could move arming conceivably ha ha Clinton takes place free safety for Green Bay you would not be able to resign him at the end of the year and by the way you gotta keep coming back and we certainly are very happy with the Monday Casey right\nSo you could have Casey play the strong safety if you needed to he could play free and that's an upgrade that's a play maker and a and then when he goes at the end of the season you get a compensatory pick which would almost make up for the pick you would send it would've been a force routed the Redskins fan right so that's one that makes I mean everything else we talked about is kind of subjective its name recognition that guy is a big name this and that\nYou weren't going to get an audience at Lyman because you're not gonna give up a first round pick and you can't afford the contract has got probably attached to him anyway but this is one that would have made sense I don't you agree I listen to me we need we need some help in the second area and\nAnd you can't afford the contract he's got probably attached to him anyway but this is one that would have made sense I think don't you agree [noise] I listen to need we need we need some help in the secular areas and that way you know ... has been around a league he's a solid piece is going to get paid by somebody next year so not by us\nYeah it's a great point you know when you look at this and we'll get into the Redskins during the second but when you look at our team if I was asked you right now\nWhat's our biggest need moving forward this off season now you have to remember we're getting can't O'Neill back right you're going to get these guys back off of injury that are currently not with his Rico's coming back so think about the defense for second\nYou still have one of the youngest defenses in little league and most guys under contract greedy situation that'll be handled okay\nVic you talked about it they picked up the fifth year but they've got some options there you have a defense that basically Mike is going to be intact of Andres back you're talking about not coming back he's still in the ... the deal right you got the boat that you're going to have to make a decision on to me that's an easy when you're paying and let's keep it moving\nThe point is the number one thing we need to do with the office of lie next year right and and and I'm only bringing this up to say are you willing to give these picks away today to make these trades knowing that you're going to have to use\nSignificant picks Mike to upgrade and at least get some depth in the office of law you can't just go about it and go out and get six guys and free agency on the line you may you may have to but they're not adding sick\nWe don't have all the tax base out there I think we fall in the middle like middle of the road and actually getting every other moves that Russia was we're not even aware of between now and then but\nI got to look we're probably most likely going to move on from ... anyway\nRight and and then plus go we're hoping that you know first suicide was a two year deal scribbled option for the third to forever random fuss go either way it was eleven million down there was a it was some is gonna break the bank but you might move on from him anyway so you gonna have to go get you're going to have to commit either free agent money and I hate that I Wish we could just dress about fencing lemon\nAnd have a couple of guys under contract for a few years\nAnd like you me and every other general measure the NFL because quality offensive linemen are a rarity these days that's why we're not the only team in this book but we cannot in my mind ... keep tumbling together to San Francisco on your re agency or you've got to commit to it at some point so and then on the other side\nI think you have to sell convention ready to say adios to a big basically just didn't get there you know do you want to go get another defensive end to the draft a pretty good drafted offensive\nThat it is it is a ... and you're right I mean you could potentially get an a game changing kind of player\nDepending on what we're going to pick now this is all again guys were so far away from all this stuff but this is the stuff that goes on at flowery it's not well let's just pick up the phone and make a call and make a trade you got to know where you're headed and what is the most important thing moving forward\nAs much as we're worried about the Redskins and this week and then the browns and the cowboys were what we do in the playoffs\nWe also have to be worried about what are we doing the off season what's our money going to look like all of this stuff plays into this oh for falcon fans if you're a little frustrated and I do agree with Mike the Clinton ha ha Dix thing that that wouldn't make sense some of these other moves I don't care if you're caught up in the name recognition or not\nBut if you're telling me that we don't need help in the secondary when we've lost both of our starting safety's right I\nDisagree so that's one that you know at least you know you could argue about it and and now we'll see what the media has to say well damn dental addressed the media tomorrow including the or the falcons guys earn a decent position in the sense that we got a schedule ... now that we think is one of those rescues games just over what their defense is going to do let's packages eccentric\nBut it's a road game too and we're all looks good rowing two on the road right now right so we

more detail into this at five but\nWhen you look at their total defense right now they're giving about three hundred and twenty two yards you know our office has been stabbed guys\nThey're past events they're only giving up to forty two but the thing that jumps out the page to me is that just given up any or drunk rushing right there one of the best run defenses in the league and we have struggled

producing the show Mike and I are having a conversation with Andy bunker up you're going to the pre game show for the hawks tonight pre and post as the hawks take on the Cavaliers were down at six thirty but uh he was just saying he came in and he was man\nBought a crazy day with all the movement in the NFL and I think you know for us we're feeling the same way you know I've been covering their bill and been around for twenty some odd years now and to think back\nThis is very rare and odd where you have literally Mike if you go back two weeks ago mhm you probably had two major moves that have been made you know around the league various teams included right that includes some brand names I mean today dumb areas Thomas gets moved\nFrom a Dante salary we're gonna talk a lot more about it but man that's been cranes\nGold dictate how Clinton Dix all that coming up is the big story at five twenty with NFL pregnant but I think this is the shape of things to come and there's more younger general managers there's more sense of urgency around the league\nAnd there's also the reality of you know much like you know in in a you know ... years back with the hawks we knew what was going down like ... are we going to if you're if you can't get milk you have to do a ...\nYou know much like you know in in a you know ... years back with the hawks we knew what was going down like are we going to if you're if you can't get ... to do a contract trade his butt and get something for him yeah let a guy just walk well there is a sense I Believe now the NFL is sort of stock or trapped or they know\nA trade equity so if you want to ah let a guy walked why don't you trade them if you don't feel that you're necessarily going to the Superbowl here's the thing though if you're somebody like the Packers what do you say you got Aaron Rodgers who's living around trying to carry this team on one leg\nYou know your your trade a guy in ... decent safety you know what what is it messages saying like princes golden Tate he gets treated by the lions he wasn't really do anything special this year but you know they just acquired a defense of lemon from the giants a week earlier so\nSometimes it's a mixed message but I guess in some cases there is a little bit of money ball here at\nPlay that or got like time Montgomery there's some dysfunction where it right now he's gotten a lot of room because it's got a gut feel like he blew the game for ... you know that that I think plays into it but yeah man I'm with you but let me ask you about the falcons as we get into the soccer and poor guys brought to you by friends at dominoes soccer and for every day\nYeah man a large three topping pizza seven Ninety nine carry out only about as good every night of the week and not just one per customer man some go to your neighborhood dominoes more details or dominoes dot com I Know what you're saying Carl and lifting your cars you're saying well the fact has had to make a move today didn't they\nThat's exactly what he shared well they did but it was not via trade insane Beatles who Zane beetles a guard who is basically on the free agent market he was playing currently you played sixteen games with the forty niners and twenty Seventeen\nHe also played with the Denver Broncos that same beetles we're talking about Sam how dare you ah yeah St beetles that was a pro bowler and twenty twelve so Mike you go out and you add some depth to the offensive line\nOutside of that the trade deadline has come and gone and the falcons did not make a move now again if you're going there may have been one move it made sense to me\nThe only thing that you could argue because guys we did break it down for you last week but just to recap yes we need some guard help I they feel comfortable I guess with garlic twice her but anybody who had a starting guard in the NFL was going to cost you a big time traffic to found 'cause we're never going to be prepared to give up and what if a guy called has two or three years left on that card contract you got to fit our couch salary cap deal\nSo there was too many moving parts or something like that\nCould you found the middle of the road guy I mean we don't know seems like we're not privy to the phone calls on the phone calls made received my time is to mature off and they're not the only threat but anyway regardless we basically stand pat we bring in some on drafted I should say free agents on the float\nThe ha ha Clinton Dix thing makes sense he could play free safety you could certainly moved ... to the strong safety and then you've got a guy who's a play maker\nYou know a guy who certainly has got some experience like who's an upgrade over Jordan Richard too don't you don't even want on the field right now who you picked up from New England\nYou know so with all due respect to Dan in the Brotherhood is not a shot but I I Do think there is some stubbornness there from the coaching staff or perhaps the ask was just too big but here even if you get a fourth round her and you give it up to get hot Clinton did\nIf he doesn't sign with you at the end of the year you get it compensatory pick right so you're going to get coverage there so I to me it was like in in the final analysis something like that would have been a a\nNothing to lose why not roll the dice yeah I don't I don't want to say a no brainer but that one makes more sense for us meant a lot of the other stuff that went down today and I know you're going to do is we need help with the past rush we do but to my point I think you also need help in the secondary based on what we have right now\nAlthough I Would tell you that if our guys just play better and I'm Talking about as a collective group of men pointing anybody out you can if you want to but I think guys need to play better that includes up front with Vick be easily and that includes you know in the back half as well\nMike what that said before we hear from Dan Quayle 'cause he's he talks about Adrian Peterson guys are getting ready for the Redskins he talks about that big physical Redskins to fit\nYou know in the back half as well Mike what that said before we hear from Dan quaint 'cause he's he talks about Adrian Peterson guys are getting ready for the Redskins he talks about that big physical Redskins defensive line are you disappointed because if you still feel like we have a chance and we do\nThis and we said this a couple of weeks ago you know going in at bingo game it's frustrating as it was was that it's not over right and now you look at the bomb those teams that are you know\nThree and four right here in the mix kind of all these teams that you know trying to get back to five hundred were one of them\nBut the the guys we still have control of our own destiny especially in our division now some people say well you're not going to win the division safer better this year okay to feel that way but we'll see that Thursday night or you know Thanksgiving we get the Carolina Panthers December twenty third and we still have to play a buck team that doesn't know who their quarterback is going to be long term\nI still think we have a really good shot to win the division but are you disappointed knowing what our situation is\nSlowly we ... we gave me the limitations are over salary and ... you know there was there was no way to get to what do we need most right now I mean do you trust let me is right now do you trust right turn Garland they were guys who were on a winning team when we beat the rams\nKept their Donald you know

say this I'm not a cat follow just although I play one on the radio all I Need to know how much how much money we have to spend and the guys that I Want to go get\nNow that's easy because I think that's how most fans see it but the reality is when you started inquiring or at least taking on contract might they could have ramifications for the next few years on your team right\nAnd the reason we just brought up the or the Clinton did\nOr he's going to play with DJ swearing in over there for the Redskins were going to see them again how how much she'll be able to be used as a you have to be determined\nBut we were just doing the numbers he was a three point one uh kept it a for Green Bay now for the Redskins five point five total guaranteed dead kept so didn't try and I know it's nerdy walkers cap stuff but remember the or if you go with a three point one number\nIt's pro rated through whatever the for seven games he's played so far that's already been paid by the Green Bay Packers right so you'd have your take on the the balance of that and we believe are kept space is minimal report five million right now\nSo if you signed him and he got hurt you basically dead in the water for any other emergency type moves\nSo I mean you you you don't have to use your phone kept you got to use it was eighty nine percent but we're we're obviously up against it and we will continue to be next year\nThat's a big reason why I mean we're just pointed out it's not an excuse 'cause I Know some documents that are trying to make not excused this is reality\nYou can do to wiggle room you're gonna do it but you know but I mean ... years ago even and there's no intention of stand there with you because next year you'd have Casey and Ricardo Allen but you don't can't O'Neill is back in case either you know the safety the future right press so you would you'd probably a let this guy go but you gotta compensatory pay it can be science with another team is a free age\nThey are one of the things that pointed out and he's right I mean the recovery time on these all depend on the individual\nBut you know coming back from an Achilles injury it's usually eight nine months for real like that's not you'll be back in six months so we are under the impression that record it will be ready and and back next season and we hope that he is but that that's something that you have to think about but either way just pointing that out guys as we talk about what's been going on around the league let's get to the big story\n[laughter] time for the big story [laughter] [noise]\nWhat is up with all of these trades it is rare in the national football league halfway through the year where you're talking about you're paying attention to deals that are being made Mike let's start first with the Texas Texans that is sending a fourth round pick and seventh round pick to Denver for the Marius Thomas\nShare the Broncos are they going to force the taxes they also going to swap seventh routers in this deal but they may Thomas who unfortunately because I I own I mean in my fantasy league and I know these things he's kind of been the odd man out as a manual Sanders has been grabbing the lion's share of throws from K. scare them\nSo they may time is expected it and he gets it and and now you're going to see them cause fuller is out for the Texas too so the Texans needed to do this otherwise W just double teaming triple seem very often so here's the thing no Carl not only just maybe go to play with the Texans his first name as a Texan is in Denver against the bronco\nYeah that's kind of weird willful has an ACL tear a baby's Thirty years old though and hunger than Sanders which Sanders is the one that for some reason our quarterbacks connected with him so you know where does this go well it gives the shot Watson right Gainesville stand up\nAnother option now outside of the guy that everybody by the way how good how good is Hopkins are you seeing someone catches he's making this always yeah he's a legitimate either way monster game for the show and Watson last week by the way statistically yes so we'll see where it goes with the ... time and so that kind of got the day roll your then you go All right great\nThat meant either way monster gave it to show in Washington last week by the way statistically\nYes so we'll see where it goes with the ... time and so that kind of got the day roll you and then you go All right great then the eagles trader third round pick the alliance for a wide receiver golden\nGolden Tate has been a mixed bag this year for the lions and you're saying well what are the lions doing well two things this is one of the things we're seeing now in in football Carl general managers moving on from guys they have no intention of resigning\nSo the eagles same thing they can basically rent this guy for a third round her and hopefully parents can use them in the slums of them do things that can do if they don't like the way I could lower is being used you can put gold tape is five\nAnd then they could um let him go to the end of the year and then we get a compensatory pay yeah besides if somebody else you would get a picture you it's almost like you're swamp it a third or fourth you know for that third\nI I think this is a good move by the eagles um again another team that thinks they order or should be in the mix my now you look at the record and you go well they're not as good as they were last year but this is what you make these kind of moves I think Doug Peterson is trying to open up this off into a little bit more\nFor Carson went and this is a move that could do that we're talking about the trades and went down in the NFL the falcons if you're just joining us did not make a trade they didn't pick up name beetles a guard or off the free agent a heap as far as he was out there you know one with the team but this is the adept move if anything\nRemember the uh the lions picked up snacks the defense of lemons yes I Am a snack so if you're looking for you know where's your alliance faint like well what you just picked up a guy while you're moving because you have no intention of moving on from take after this\nAlso John Elway to switch point just told the Rocky Mountain west of where the newspapers out there that they want to see the younger receivers get some uh get some rep so that's also part of the the Broncos plant also today and this one was more about frustration and a bad vibe in the locker room Packers anti Montgomery to Baltimore for a seventh round pick\nThis on the heels of them not following instructions that was coaching staff and trying to play in return they kicked when they want to just simply taking the lead in Rogers get a crack at it from the twenty five he fumbled it and they blow the game\nA roster spots basically what the Packers I think you had a lot of guys and that locker room who were upset\nWith him he talked about it and and you know for me this is taking the too far he's he said his family had been getting threats after that you know Petra nation I get it being frustrated 'cause you're the last ... that's taking a little bit too far either way he has been training Mike and remember this is the same guy\nBut we play them in the playoffs a couple of years ago he started running ... eighty eights yet and we made fun of it but uh I I think for Mike mccarthy now they're talking about air and Jones is the guy that should get a lot of the carries\nAt running back either way he moves on and it's one of those deals where literally Sunday cost him his job with the Packers\nHey rams trade a third round picking a fifth round pick\nFor defensive in Dante salary today\nYou know what you can say about the twenty Fifteen NFL Draft force that a third of those guys aren't on the team to drop them a lot of busters a lot of guys that have gone out to a different locale not they fell if you guys remember all world defensive error overall pick

and you know winning the first half of the uh\nUm you know the regular season but it looks like the rams have have won trade deadline day as well because they you know certainly have been um [noise] you know that that outside linebacker edge I'm kind of pass rushing\nSpot has been kind of the week spot of of this defense I'm underweight Philips this year I'm you know they have a lot of young\nA talent a lot of young guys that they've tried to throw at that position and and you know overall it's been okay um [noise] but certainly it's a position where they can improve upon it was really interesting how on\nUm Monday showed that they came out and his weekly press her and said um you know basically was honest and said yes that's up to ... that we'd like to improve on and uh we think we've got something that that may work out and you know report today they\nAdded a bunch of other teams and um for the players\nSo obviously they liked the player it's a um you know it's an expiring assets um that they gave up a third in a a future fit for\nUm they've got uh some of that ammo or to give up because of some of the players they've lost and free agency have lined up some ... picks in the future so maybe it doesn't hurt their future draft a situation as much as maybe some other teams so you know in a year in which the rams I've gone all in\nUm you know trying to um put together the best team in the NFL and uh it's looked good the first half of the year I'm you know certainly they continue that on into the middle of the year so I don't I don't think ... be upset for a you know with ... with anything that the teen has done over the last\nTwelve to Eighteen months it's all it's all coming up good\nRight now the rams lead the NFL intense action they add another former first round taking Dante salary spending a few minutes post trade deadline with Joe currently at the Ventura County star with us here after hours on CBS Sports radio or the last couple of weeks because of the injuries there have been some questions about the secondary I\nHow how are they evaluating that area and I even tobacco sailed right now\nYeah I mean that was one of the um positions they were kind of rumored to to be interested in improving but you know when they were in in the offseason going into this you know with all the moves they made bringing in markets Petersburg ... going to keep to leave I really thought you know they maybe didn't have the best secondary in the NFL and maybe that's Jacksonville but they\nYou know I thought they really had one of the deepest um secondaries or Troy ill with somebody that that really played well for them down the stretch last year as adept peace and bringing in Sam Shields was\nA ... and under rated um peace um [noise] you know uh the ... the safety so I've been really strong remark is joining or and and John Johnson um you know really the the problem had been that charters game where they lost both\nA former all pro quarterbacks Marcus feeders and to keep delete both got hurt in that game a Peters I'm really you know I don't know if it's the injury just hasn't looked the same\nSince he came back that next week against the Vikings and and played in didn't look right but you know it was a calf poll um you know you wonder how you could play\nKnow if it hadn't healed but certainly he's been out there and you know hasn't been as is his plane making self them at the big loss has been to leave I mean they they really misses leadership and Mrs you know stabilizing um nature about him but the um\n[noise] um you know the the other guy said you know Troy hills been up and down but you know he he had his first NFL interception two weeks ago against the niners I'm you know he seems to have kind of you\nKnow I'm you know one break down again but besides that he's he's\nIn two weeks ago against the niners I'm you know he seems to have kind of you know I'm you know one break down again but besides that he's he's really been kind of a good ... piece for them sand shields went healthy has been\nUm you know quite good and and you know I think the ... uh is one of the better slot corners in a league so you know it's a position where they could improve uh simply because they've had so many injuries there um but I think the only reason they would really need somebody if they made a booth today I think that was a signal\nThat uh keep till he may be further from coming back further and as you know maybe not coming back at all\nHow much fun with the game between the Packers and the rams\nIt was something I mean I'm you know there's been a lot kind of reporter and said about you know how many Green Bay fans were there but I think that really you know I'm you know the fifty fifty nature of the fan bases I think really made it um\n[noise] you know like a college like atmosphere really gave it I I think it intensity that you know a lot of regular season NFL games really lack um so what was it was fun and memorable and and you know I think the thing that I've said repeatedly is that um you know a lot of people kind of chalk that up to you know Wisconsin writes traveling and\nYou know or or maybe vacationing in Los Angeles and those are people that don't know understand Southern California I mean\nI'm you know this is a a a a place that did not have a an NFL team for Twenty years that generation of fans were free to pick 'em you know any fan base that they wanted to associate with and in that time you know the national teams like the Steelers the patriots\nAnd especially the Packers um you know became Los Angeles team that went on a with a radio station in Green Bay and I say you you're going to be surprised how many\nHow much green and gold is is there and and um you know it certainly ... the guy even surprised me a maybe a you know\nMaybe some more than than I expected but you know I think it really you know those were Angelenos and that's kind of it it really underscores you know the long term nature of this move in LA I you know the ramps have done everything right they put the best product you could possibly put on the field\nUm [noise] you know they have they've signed stars you know keep you know people that ... you know play those type of players that people want to pay to see 'em but it's still going to take time they're going to have to do this over a long period of time um you know to really kind of um\nHeal the wounds of you know these teams leaving the market you know decades ago and\nUm and it just shows you how you know the chargers that look at the situation the chargers and the the rams have done everything right\nUm and they're still dealing with it the chargers you know maybe haven't done things as right and uh and they're even tougher situation\nHow much have you noticed an addict buys for Iran's not only with the playoff spot in the devil figure wins last year but as you mentioned then adding stars and and he

time to develop or get a good quarterbacks coach quarter there he could really really be impressive you'd already shows flashes to always well he was in Oklahoma and I think of who gets better over time it's just the focus on the plan that they have\nWhich is what now that that's yeah that's the thing I mean are they may be one of the things that Joe indoors seem to want to do early on was just to accumulate\nYou to try to build the pieces and I think that's one of the areas that they got from what better it they've got a good fish but they don't have that\nExtra player that you can look and say okay here's the guy that we have to choose the root for because while you're at and they just have to continue to do with the ownership is we will have to say this is ... is going to be they have to be transparent with that plan stick with it\nI Will say that about has love I'm Glad that he didn't\nInclude John Dorsey in his sweeping changes so I I Would agree with you about Dorsey he's been on the job less than a year and he's very well respected some of his early decisions they're already reaping benefits so you talk about the the defense it's young it's aggressive\nEither tops in the league and take away a rookie cornerback Denzel Ward who they selected to number four instead of Bradley job he's a huge reason why I'm also they got their fifth round pick\nWho's been upgraded linebacker ... and then if you think about the couple of free agent decisions that Dorsey made no generally you don't see top flight upper echelon free agents land in Cleveland for a lot of reasons\nBut Jarvis Landry he's leading receiver and Carlos Hyde as are leading Russia and and I do like the fact that he's found ways to plug holes both long term and short term\nAnd and obviously Baker made builds the reason why they went ahead and made this change has long said that\nBut to fire Jackson and Haley sends a message that we do not want any more damage done to our our face it a franchise\nBad but to fire Jackson and Haley sends a message that we do not want any more damage done to our our face it a franchise and the guy they believe is is the future for them\nYeah and and I think with the Broncos in Texas yesterday I don't know if John always writing off this year but I think to see some things and whether we get to see them against Kansas City in the news to\nOne of the biggest problem they turn over falter which really haven't had any consistency with case given the quarterback\nBecause the difference I think between this year than last year she really ever turn the ball over when he was with the writing this year he's making the kind of throw it plays either from Boulder interceptions it you know it's cost them games that were so good reasons\nTo go to just make some decisions about what you want to do if you're Jody away and how do you want to put system to physicians that they can be competitive for the rest of the season and then the next year\nYeah I think part of it was what could they get for him and getting a fourth round pick an exchange from was also big um yeah it's as much as dumb areas Thomas is the guy that's been there forever and he's he's one of the most recognized\nA Broncos in the community you're right about the ... not just the the turnover is it's also the penalties they've been at a big of a big mess\nDo they do like there to rookie running backs that's been huge for them\nOr they feel like the friends of mine is getting better um I don't know that he's throwing in the towel as much as he's recognizing that there are

which is is grown too recently but major league baseball's ... a trade deadline has always been the one that got the most headlines\nThat people got really excited about now the NFL maybe deciding it was a jealous about all that mid season attention for major league baseball now the NFL has has moved its trade deadline later in the season which means teams are more inclined to either part with or acquire players\nAnd so we've\nAlso I mentioned this earlier but it made me laugh out loud Mary Kay Cabot who covers the brown for Cleveland dot com tweeted just after four o'clock Cleveland time just after four o'clock eastern that the browns had ... had made no moves in advance of the deadline\n[laughter] and then trade new one but they definitely made some moves in the last forty eight hours or I'd trade moves the rams who already leave the NFL with ten facts they trade for Dante Fowler who is the edge Rauscher service\nThe the outside linebacker and that three four but at times weighed Philips will use of for three or use for lineman so he can more if he can go back in\nThat three four but at times weighed Philips will use of force three or use for lineman\nSo he can more if he can go back and forth\nJacksonville did not pick up the fifth year option on his rookie contract so he will become a free agent barring some type of an agreement with the rams but they asked him to the mix a group is already got Aaron Donald ... can sue a group it's already got multiple first round draft picks\nOn the front line of defense\nAnd so the rams get Dante Fowler big deal for them there have been some talk that they might add to their defense of backfield\nBut instead they go with valor\nSo this is interesting both for the rams who are at eight no butter going into a critical stretch

just about\nCreating conversation creating but this is what happens the college football world and the the big five conferences and the playoff committee they want to be top of mind they wanted to generate some debates\nAnd so they released these rank and the only ones that matter are the ones that are done at the end wants all the conference championships and all this season schedules had been

what about the new committee chair his name is Rob ... from the University of Oregon so he takes over for Kirby ... they have tons of revolving system they don't change the entire committee all at once but they straddle the number of new members that are brought in and there's no transition this year for the college football selection committee we\nHad a six outstanding new members as you know that the Thirteen member committee but uh the beauty of these new members as they were fully prepared a they understood all the tools that were were available them and they jumped right in they ... they were fully engaged and the beauty of this process you use that it is the human element when you have\nThirteen you know broad background diverse experiences and to be able to come into a room in

that discussion or you know it was clear that we thought Alabama was number one\nIt's good to know they watch the games in case you're wondering and I'm being somewhat ... tongue in cheek but do you remember the old polls and actually some of the the current pulls a lotta times are done by coaches or by force information directors by people who don't have time\nTo sit and watch all the games 'cause they're busy with our own college football programs but it is required of the committee\nYou have to watch the games not just the ones that you're interested in not just the ones in your own

you started putting up resumes ah UCF was the only team in the country who had not played a team with a winning record through week nine\nHowever you take that one piece of information but you also watch them and you know they haven't experienced quarterback\nOr a quality often um and you put all those pieces together and you saw we ration twelve that means they were really in the discussion on

this week\nSo it's really about somewhere between ten and Thirteen and and they agreed on that and then the debate ensues about where should they actually be slot and remember it's not happening in a

Richard good man just shout rather man I'm trying to keep up with new brother you are also\nWith the New Georgia project\nThat's correct I'm chair the board of the New Georgia project\nFounded a just a few years ago and since two thousand fourteen we've registered three hundred thousand about three hundred thousand new voters and uh so we have seen this fight\nWith secretary kept 'em unfold before our very eyes we've been engaged in this work for a long time or he is a most adept architect ah and shameless practitioner a voter suppression\nOr so we've been engaging him you know we filed a lawsuit rights to the secretary of state as he is a has placed fifty three thousand Georgia voters will certainly try to exercise their constitutional right to vote\nA on a pending state has to be clear this is a game that he is playing um it's classic voter suppression the effort is to shave some votes ears shave some votes there\nOr he is both a player on the field running for promotion and serving as part of the game you really ought to resign or in order to uh assured the voters of Georgia that there really is integrity in this process I\nLooked at some numbers last night and ah this is actually on the eleven o'clock news but I looked at the numbers last night myself in a Mike Dunn then and it\nWe were able to analyze a few counties that the New Georgia project had a very strong influence in the camp county\nFulton County counties where you had strong minority representation in population but not\nAs much in the voter registration the camp can give an example of some numbers here this time in the previous election cycle for governor at this very time early voting DeKalb County was at around forty five thousand people\nToday it is almost one hundred thousand people that's right okay I Believe that is by direct effort\nOf voter registration from organizations like New Georgia project and also the dog manic follow up the organization you chair\nEngaged in because it wasn't that you are engaged voters you actually followed them through the entire process that's why you know who didn't make the roads\nAre this right or and their science around the ... where it clear that uh if if you touch people about eight times they're they're likely to show up at the polls so our message is very clear not only in the cycle but in the next\nVoter education people need to understand issues understand what's at stake when people think their lives at stake they show up to vote education registration\nVerification because they're purging people from the rolls and often they don't even know it and then mobilization we've got to do all of those things education registration mobilization verification all of those things have happened\nEven know it and then mobilization we've got to do all of those things education registration mobilization verification all of those things have happened that's been our work\nFor the last four years and uh I think we're seeing the results of it or we're trying to raise what we see as the the new emerging American electorate an electorate that reflects the wonderful rainbow diversity of our nation and increasingly of this state\nAnd I think that there's some folks who see that tide rolling or some see as a blue wave but I I see a rainbow wave emerging I see people of all races and ah backgrounds I see young people emerging listened up king understood this\nAnd and way back in Nineteen fifty seven people think about the the speech that he gave at the Lincoln Memorial in Nineteen sixty three\nI Would encourage your listeners to go back and read without the king said in Nineteen fifty seven standing in the same place in front of the Lincoln Memorial he gave a speech called give us the ballot\nAnd he said if you give us the ballot we will elect governors in southern states who have not only felt the pain of the human\nBut the glow of the divide that we would address lynching and all of these issues if you give us the ballot at twenty eight year old Martin Luther King junior just twenty eight years old\nUnderstood in Nineteen fifty seven that\nA diverse electorate has public policy implications so this this election is not just about as we as we register voters of color is really not about ... about complex and it's about direction that if we create a more diverse electorate I think will come up with much more common sense public policy\nThat creates living wages for workers give seniors security and helps us to build a tenth as large enough all of our children\nWe got him on the other side I have ... toward knock\nInto building share of New Georgia project they have registered hundreds of thousands of voters as an organization that's verified\nThey had been in the back and forth with\nThe secretary of state Brian Kemp who happens to be the gubernatorial nomination on the Republican side for governor [noise]\nHere's what I Know Brian Kemp who understands he understands that this election will be very close and he is utilizing every advantage he can't even if it means breaking\nThe law violating the rights of individuals judges have already ruined multiple times that he

S. B. day and um I Believe it was probably yesterday that not not when they called it shell and so I'm really disheartening about that we need to call Ian Moore I'm\nA couple of points that want to um I'm gonna rush on because like I said I don't get a car cost that much are\nThe um found that you that quite today I don't know who the ... but I never did just before I Love that song because if it it it's like the updated version of Bette writes on tonight\nOkay and um I Would say that said um labor came because he always says if you don't write the kids have a ...\nSo I think that they're still on the situation with the um fourteenth amendment is coming I'm across as confusing because on the television they're saying that he can't do it what you're saying that he can't support I don't know which one\nIs also helped me okay so allow me to help you understand the ... they're saying that he could not fundamentally transform the constitution that is accurate he cannot and fundamentally transform the constitution in other words he cannot add or take away from the language of the constitution\nBut what he can do is sign and executive action that would absolutely\nWe interpret the constitution as it relates\nTo birth right now what would happen in that case he can extend every president has the ability to extend their executive power beyond what the constitution allows that's wild when they do so\nOur checks and balances must be an acted in order to stop the actions of that executive order so if he did sign it it will take either the U.S Congress\nThe Supreme Court or a federal judge to stop it and they can hold out here by a number of means one they're going to return it\nOr they can give an injunction which basically said we're going to stop\nWhat you did until we can hear the for argument in court now wants that overturned baking filed and appealed Trump's people can fallen appeal\nThat will eventually permeate to the Supreme Court where I think he will only stand to get one possibly two votes from those that he appointed and no more\nThan ... it dies on the rival so when they say he can't\nDo it they're technically right in the sense of transforming the constitution but remember the power of the executive order or executive action\nIf it extends beyond the constitution must be checked by one of our balances in the United states government\nOkay okay so in essence he can introduce the argument and but he's on more than likely it's going to be shut down\nNot enough for nine or ... percent yeah I I think is completely shut down especially going to the Supreme Court\nOkay so I think that\nThe other part of this and I wanted to get your take on this and I'll hang up ... I\nThink that when the when the fourteenth amendment and even the constitution was written um it was written on the premise that this country what's got to be open to everybody that came in because that was the foundation of how they the the the Caucasians got over here but since um since the country has\nThe evolution of this country has happened it's open to every nationality and the Caucasian members of this society are diminishing in numbers so they have to do something to say that this is their country because they never wanted it to be\nEverybody's country and what they wanted it to be the Caucasian land and um I think that that's what's happening I just want to get your take on it because that I think that's where we were going with this fight for territory in this land and it's not working out in their favor the way the laws are written\nRight now so they're trying to change everything which brings me to the the ... that you and I talked about a few weeks ago is that we're we're really moving forward on really fast towards a lawless\nBrings nature the the ... that you are not talking about a few weeks ago is that we're we're really moving forward on really fast towards a law if\nA Siamese because if we can't if the laws that we have in place now are not good for everybody including um the Caucasian race because they are looking like they're being at at a disadvantage then it's not going to be right for anybody but I just want to get your take on that and I'll hang up and listen and I was like\nThank you I appreciate your call and your thoughtful question uh yes remember nationalism white nationalism is protectionism it is the protection of the white lineage this country is getting browner and younger by the moment\nFor me that is a real problem the experiment known as the United states of America is unique in the fact that it not only allows for diversity but at its core\nFour zero point not to do seven zero three\nLike the way to put nothing so I just got a husband in Atlanta live\nFour zero point not to do seven zero three groups like the way to put nothing sir I'm just going to Hudson in Atlanta line for us and good they welcome hey hey\n[laughter] every time I call you put me behind one road\n[laughter] how are you going to\n[laughter] go anyway but you talk about oh no way without\nThat brown people that's why they're that's why Trump is doing this thing about this uh this if you wasn't born here he understand they're saying forty four but it's going to be earlier and that's why you have the opioid crisis thing now there was no crack crisis\nThere's an open your prices because well I don't know what the percentages are bad but I could probably estimate there's not a black people and they play at Seventy two thousand people died last year\nOr from opioids and or you can look at that percentage and the other thing was the border thing\nPeople can't be crossing the border of without somebody helping them to do that I live in central and South America for years and you can't just go through one place when I and then one place that so they say well they had they had the referee yells out there now\nAnd they will just letting them through and the last on that was I did the uh when they had the Cuban Haitian crisis in Nineteen eighty I went to Puerto Rico and we only sent\nA one company just a company okay nobody knew where you went we were there when you went there we took care of it nobody knew where he was there wow an and a ... and in a company is not five thousand\n[laughter] there was a ... a company is a well oh about eight hundred wow ... ... ... reinforcement yeah okay\nUh we didn't set it up over ... the whole battalion did not go so uh they they select people well well ... ... people to go and do what needs to be done and then there's an MP unit to do the other stuff but\nSand than five thousand people and another two thousand for what what did they say it was a thousand yeah that is so so somebody somebody's orchestrated in that whole thing\nYeah you do this we have more troops being sent to the border than are fighting ISIS do you understand how crazy that is yeah that's how the numbers work out\nOK well see I I I don't I Try not to watch much news I listen to you\nI when I come over here in Atlanta\nListen to you but if I'm In South Carolina and I can't get you I have to listen to rush so you want\nMe to low rush whoa whoa and and then I got another who are arguing so wait a minute let me try to help you try to help your life your man because there must be a horrible existence or to listen to rush over me\nNo no no no no I don't listen to 'em but if I if I flip to us states in\n... he's the guy that's on I did it listen you can also listen to was on the radio at if you can download it on your cell phone\nAll right I Know that's called the radio app and you go to your app store is radio that's it downloaded and just type in W.
