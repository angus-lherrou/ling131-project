obviously from where you said you gotta lotta your plate um you know ... ... with the state conference N. double ACP\nAh one of these issues like justification I mean what what from a public policy standpoint um what are these what are these issues and why should people be concerned about not only that goes but the overall phenomenon of justification\nI think they need to be concerned because it's it's overall changing the face of the city and and the region\nUm as we ... we heard from Reverend Jackson the phenomenon white flight and now we see justification during the reverse we see now I'm that new people are coming into the city and there's not enough affordable housing for the residents ... been here\nYou know forever like you said with grandma and your auntie and all of those people who live there and so when you have a deal like the girls\nThey need to put a real agreement in place that protects\nAre those who you know are not making a large amounts of money you know that have you know affordable housing stock and you know looking at the deal from lawyers perspective\nYou know when I look at the Affordable housing trust which are seeing my eyes agreed ... pay twenty eight million or two affordable housing when you have a five billion dollar plan\nUm it's just a drop in the bucket and needs to be renegotiated and then you have equal payments that are made two thousand Eighteen two thousand Nineteen two thousand twenty\nTotally fourteen million and then three more equal payments and twenty twenty two twenty twenty three twenty twenty four so now we're talking about fully funded ... at the front ... right so my concern was when I was at the meeting with the mayor last Wednesday and she tried to outline this proposal or was that we don't even know where the twenty eight million it's\n... is is is just let ... let ... even talk about the meeting a oh yeah because um it would just I'll be honest with you\nUm I wouldn't know ... bottom supported ... some stuff like this coming ... you may not just that the days ... ... no [laughter] no big ... have a say no big\nStates labor supporter because I have watched your politics and when I got to worry about when you get to the table ... would you cut ... deal for the masses\nAre for the classes because one of the conversations we've got ... have the conversation ... black folk now don't you would do it here and I called the show too much truth ... that some class warfare going on into our own group now that is true um that the black Bush was ... just feel like\nAnd the black elite look we we might have ... we like to see I Am ... we like we like coffee houses and\nUm that the black bourgeoisie just feel like in the black elite look we we might have will we like to see I Am route we like we like coffee houses and we like to see a wife or walk the dogs in our neighborhood that means it's going to be safe and we like to be able to go to Starbucks and have a narrow ... next\nTo us and we'd like [laughter] I mean if it wasn't even a real I mean it's a money thing your grandma me to try and survive\nI don't believe you get to be river jak they Seventy seven and you got to worry about whether you can maintain the house that pay for just based on the taxes taxes to tell the people I just happened to look near my house\nYou know they build some how Islam woods near me that is so big you could put my little house and there's three times and I'm like now what it does go on sale for\n... ... what is this going to sell for what is this going to do to my property value so then the other day we just got the you know you know public pop politics all politics is about public policy and what a attorney Greg he's talking about what is the best policy\nThat could come out of this um\nWhat do you want to see happen kittens there'll be fix it do it needs to go back to the drawing board of what what what are some of the advocates say\nWell before I went to the meeting I Believe that it could be fixed\nWell and I was talking about the meeting itself I Love my yeah is held in a small\nRoom holiday oh where'd you get half of the people already would green shirt zone people who have never seen before green shirt so yeah they have the room filled up with you know we\nSaw with it just was city employees and then the police are there in in force and they're keeping you know citizens out of the meeting I I I Would have not been the that was disappointing I was ... percent of the fourth try to get into the meeting with other citizens and I was looking at the mayor's face\n... and she looked at first it shocked and then she just kinda sit back and didn't do anything and I I'm sitting here thinking to myself I was going to come here to listen to hear how this is going to impact the city water an open mind and then when I see how that like that it takes me back to ...\nYou know well people call the show black and white sand they would just point because a hundred yards from net for y'all were is the room that has over two hundred and fifty see the city council chambers what we could have done it in the atrium of it he had plenty of seats in there I mean why cramping a room with Seventy five two hundred seats\nWhen right around the corner you had could have had\nTwo hundred two hundred fifty seats and you could have televise it was not being televised I sit here just thinking I'm going to be to make commentary and put some of it on the air\nOr as we were watching it they knew that this was a issue because of the week before I came down when I got down to the city hall I Would just come in because I feel just like you were given the city away then I come and take it hell we given it to him I Would at least they put up some resistance when I got there the whole city\nAnything that's given is really not being given away\nThe bottom line is this\nThe five billion dollars worth of development going on in the Gulf is five billion dollar development that is not going on in other places a restaurant if you have a more ins or another restaurant for example going in the Gulf\nThat's that's a more into a restaurant that has not somewhere else in the city earnings tax revenues\nSo don't believe the height when they say that it's not going to take anything from this it's going to be two and a half billion dollars\nTo two billion dollars worth of property taxes that five hundred thousand five hundred million dollars of sales tax that the city will be losing to this development and we're not getting almost anything back\nHere's the thing that I Want you to answer for me the coalition 'cause he's rate does get it the facts and give all the information had this group come up with a position\nOr a ... a proposal lazy just seal the deal or do you all have an ... alternative to what should come off the table because that's all want to begin to do because that someone would say the gals are going to vote is a living I'll get help me to me do you have this is going to be voted on probably next Monday\nWell it's going to be voted on and what we're saying is it this deal is so bad okay and you're not you're you're not going to make it any better in a couple of weeks or we are are saying right here now is we want to stop it on the fifteenth yeah ah they're able\nTo you know for all that because they were going to try and they didn't know that whole national and now what about housing or jobs in none of that\nUh they're able to you know for all about who they were going to try and they didn't know that

right\nAnd and now the people who live out there they had they complain about everything\nLack of police I Can't go and so I you know whether they were ready or not I don't know\nIs should they seem like they would the city council fight the mayor on everything he tried to do out there I'm sure that poor man wish that ... that he could just you know ... is miss is almost misery adversity kills me would pull these what a bully\nAnd a again um you know we'll see what happens with that but at the end of the day I'm you know\nWhen we landed at all we're going to lose it all now because of\nThe time and see people think that the reason that many of us find so hard\nAgainst the Gulf because we know what that represents that's the loss of Atlanta politically\nAnd Ninety thousand I said man with three hundred and Ninety thousand down\nHere in College Park ... fed veal stock bread you can have your lake and all that out\nBack a cage affair down here to do or you\nSay you got a Thirteen hundred in the valuation ... eight hundred sometime\nRight about nine hundred I said by the end of the year it'd be a million bucks do\nYou own it or\n[noise] oh you got to find out what you're going I Know he even from here so they keep your GPS to either what else you got for though\nI wrote a book about gentrification called monetize justification in getting people how to make money off of this stuff we're historical time when it comes down to this real estate and these businesses starting up mhm lobby\nSo obvious to her job in the conference tomorrow and I'll be speaking about another car for math ... must must you have a\nMy eldest she said well I'd better call you and I'm like yes ma'am well yeah it was so you better car better car\nAnd see what I'm saying that we're talking about well Jesse Jackson's in time for rainbow push conference at the Hyatt tomorrow or they have a justification panel at two o'clock and I understand young folks like you and I are Thomas can make a lot of money don't get me wrong right but what we got to look out for people like miss Geneva\nWho work back in the fifties and sixties who retired in the seventies who now in her eighties and whose income is not going to go up and if she stayed in that\nA hundred thousand that million dollar home she would have to already she would have already been moved out right and so unless she bought four or five of those when she was young like you and I\nHeld on to them now she can cash in four million dollars\nBut generally that's not what we did right and so a while it is a and investors market if you got that kind of real loot\nUm you know if you held onto your stuff through the storm or some of us you know kind of cleared the decks of member toward particular homes when it all collapse in two thousand\nOr eight two thousand nine some of us got stuck out here with dozens of homes that we had to liquidate\nBut those were able to ride it out man if you could have you wrote it out in Atlanta I can tell you just owned a little bit of stuff I got a a house that we're renting for Eighteen hundred this uh but that we're renting for eight hundred\nOr just two years ago I'm On a very low and you can get Fifteen sixteen hundred for it is it it it had built up a little different man is so great inside the city now I got one that I Am really happened to that a dilemma with right 'cause I Do I can double the rent on it\nBut I'm asking should I Do it you know do I do I need extra eight hundred dollars now this is the benevolent capitalism me I should add that some family that work at a hospital in maybe fried chicken that the my favorite chicken spot continue to written this place for a hundred dollars\nAnd sold the pure capitalism and yeah get that might offer but the benevolence say no help somebody there you go yeah and so you have to struggle while as a turning a war at least I'm saying I've just been on it and say that I still have an\nOh let's say no help somebody\nThere you go yeah and so you have to struggle while his attorney or at least I'm saying I've just been on it and say that I still have an internal contradiction\nOr not we're making money now 'cause I ain't nothing about being broke that I like nothing right but that's where some of us and and I got some friends who don't care what they said look not only are they going to get the Eighteen hundreds they'll put the family that can only afford the eight hundred out\nNow leads out of the people read the let the least run out and they told me they go move now I got a decision to make so\nBut ah that's great minded to be made man but mine is not the end all a for a\n... or the book it's not just about to tell\nUs what your book or you call in to push your book sale about the book\nSo now I'm not I'm not necessarily they'll call in to help with the ... no not the the L above what we're going to learn what the name in the book is called monetize gentrification right\nAnd it's called the uh subtitled building black ownership meaning we got to start the conversation about ownership because of the people who are all things and getting pushed out you don't have to worry about the landlord telling you you're not going to know you\nHave the problem with that Tom and them put you on hold so we come back it it does have a down side and the less public policy meet your ownership because gram on my own it outright but guess what happens to grandma\nWhen it gets to a million dollars she cannot afford to pay the taxes on it just simply can't afford and there there was you can't afford to pay it gives who come knocking on doors it come to reverse mortgage people we'll take care of that for your grandma in fact all you gotta do is use this little pinch off your monthly equity\nAnd ah then you don't have to pay one died you can stay at home when you die whoever sells it will just lose that percentage of equity that you have used up and we've seen these games over and over again because grandma ... who bought a house forty years ago for forty thousand dollars if it was in South central she could have done that\nBut now she can't afford no nine hundred thousand because the taxes on that even with a homestead exemption you're still paying tens of thousands of dollars in taxes on it and said that in ... alone and so you know and so I'm saying do for\nGrandma will what you're willing to do for the developing Atlanta\nFreeze the taxes that the current market rate current level\nAfter they get certain age then the taxes should never go up again\nAnd let them keep their home at age in place because all grandma ... can do is move in with her grandson because that's who gonna end up paying those taxes and if she got two two or three other property he's not going to be able to afford it\nThough there is a downside to this don't go into place and come back would that Thomas wrap up we'll talk to Mike and we'll talk to whoever else on the phone lines are full it's too much true for their Bozeman ... and talk Thirteen aided W A L K\nGoes to a foreign aid to teach those trees are news and talk Thirteen Haiti that were you able\nTo do too much truth and the

quarterbacks\nAnd the new emphasis that the league has put on this particular area of the game I understand the league is trying to make it more safe it's trying to preserve the life of its quarterbacks who of course our\nFaces a franchise is the most marketable commodities ... for you as a referee and for the guys who are out there trying to implement this emphasis\nHow difficult is it for a raft\nTo make that type of a call to throw that flag when it's all about the judgment\nYou know the the ... and ... and and you're so right with\nWith how many different rules have been implemented over the recent history you know the target area for defender is is very ... if you really think about it because everything up and the euro below or for their head and neck area a limit the scope when the area that they could ...\nI Will say from a fifth year than they are going up I'm a lover of football but I think every rule that they've implemented has been a wonderful role because there is a lot of the uh the cost of the quarterback or a pastor\nShould have some special protection because he really is\nBecause there is a lot of safety or that kind of a quarterback or a pastor should have some special protection because he really is the only player on the field for for the most part it's standing still and getting hit by someone that's moving so fast that him um so so I you know I'm all for all of the safety or\nYou know the the new EP limitations and new rules that they've they've put in over the years for the quarterback this one\nAh what it appears this happening and what what felt like happened here and and the first few weeks is that they've kind of put a directive outs\nThat are saying you know if it's the majority of body weight a ... and some black and white issues on what\nI always felt like as a referee in the NFL I wanted to have a little bit of a play and and allow myself to use my officiating experience or officiating documents to apply some judgment as to whether I felt like\nYou know the majority of body weight started quarterback but it's just a good football play and its physics because this guy just got their clean and and ... quarter back up and these guys are so big so fast and expanding person naturally their bodies are going to fall right on top of each other very quickly\nUh with that said I always felt like if I thought he gave him a little more as Ben Dr said you know giving him the business as he was taking him down or\nOr a little something actually just to punish on necessarily\nThe index card number the index card it wasn't even a year ago maybe more people know jeans name because of the index card that he used for a measurement and the raiders cowboys game in December and also it's funny a story

[noise] [noise] my name is\nThomas find it on the job is to make her feel better than half of them\nBecause we found [noise]\nThat's just one record that it's ... it's not not only Drew Brees is he possesses itch but there could be more coming up over the course of this the then it's just a guy who got a couple of different records and insight\nAnd the next one is note passing yards in NFL history a first on Westwood One with Kevin Harlan then on the saints radio network he was a just a couple of weekends ago that drew was responsible for sticks\nTouchdowns for through the air to on the ground there was a spin move that kids could not wait to recreate when he got home\nI saw an interview with him maybe you guys did too and which team got home from the game he said he got home from the game and his sons already had it all set up in the backyard and all they wanted to do is recreate\nThe spin move on which he had scored down low or near the goal line and they were all excited about doing that they move over and over and over again\nSo it thirty nine years old man can still fire up it's been moved over to a and he's so much fun to watch that quick release the accuracy\nOf the ... he he has an incredible report with Michael Thomas what are you a lot like a child Brady or Peyton Manning or a Brett Farr a name any of the great\nThey put the ball where you can get it\nWhich means they turn you into a better receiver that you were even if you weren't great these guys raise the level of play everyone around them because of how they can\nPeople are that you were even if you weren't great these guys raise the level of play of everyone around them because of how they can deliver the ball\nAnd the way that they see the field I mean think about the the brainy touchdown pass to Josh Gordon which turned out to be five hundred yes he needs to credit dolphins of light I Will credit the office of blind he had so much time back there in the pocket there wasn't even a guy who was rushing him\nAnd and the the off into blind gives him time to stand up and look and wait\nFor the play to develop down field and of course that puts a lot of pressure on the defensive backs\nBecause they're trying to keep up with receivers like Josh Gordon or Chris Hogan who actually it was in the back of the end zone and a behind Gordon\nAnd it allows temporary anytime to wind up and Chuck that boiled down field but the idea is that yes you got\nReceivers who are making place but you've also got these quarterbacks who can deliver it in such a way that it makes these receivers look good and they do they do [laughter] that's a that's the beauty of having a quarterback of this caliber it's after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio\nTwo hundred one yards that's what Drew Brees needs to set the NFL's all time passing record there actually still two guys ahead of him well Brent Barbee and Peyton Manning but with two hundred and one yards he could pass them both both and become king in terms of that particular record\nBut I mean it was one of the words Olson during a fixture so to speak so I'm very very says a lot of both the teams are going on for years where we're from the players for everybody has been\nKind of like what breed he said after passing five hundred touched down\nSo a lot of different guys who'd been on the receiving a lot of different guys who have made that possible [noise]\nAll right our phone number is eight five five to one to four to seven or toll free line that's brought to you by guy go with a quick way you can save money switch to a guy go and if you need homeowners renters or motorcycle insurance to go along with the car insurance\nYou can get it all at Geico dot com eight five five to one to four CBS what's the game that you're most looking forward to this weekend Ron finds me on Twitter and says Baker mania had the gun\nOh yeah it has in fact I'd say that it sounds and extra gear even a following the overtime affair with the Oakland Raiders runs as I Know they fell short this past weekend if they clean up some of the mistakes they can open some eyes this weekend around the league\nYeah I'm\nIn a word that huge accent I'm tired of preparing to when I'm tired of ah getting close and not coming away with a W I Know they finally got that monkey off their backs when they were able to pick up their first when of course that was the the entrance\nOf Baker mania or the the entrance of Baker Mayfield and the birth of Baker mania on that Thursday night against the New York jets are now it's full height\nBut yes they need the winds one guy can certainly set a city on fire and he's all ready to face the franchise and people are thrilled about it but at the winds don't follow you can only go so far\nI Will say this about the browns they'd been competitive in every game season opener against the Steelers they were down fourteen points in the fourth quarter they came back to force overtime now I get it they didn't win it everybody was plucked on ... ...\nOr any overtime but still they forced the O T saints week number two in New Orleans super\nBuddy was put on ...\nOr any overtime but still\nThey for cod saints week number two in New Orleans superdome\nThat ... most of the game was the adventures and kicking that really doomed to them and now of course they may change a kicker then weeks three is the game against the jets and wait for going into overtime again\nOn the road at the writers and so they're close I Know coach Jackson's tired of being close but they're they got to be able to string a couple of wins together so what's the\nGame that you're most looking forward to John says on Twitter the most important and intriguing game is one and three Atlanta versus one two and one Pittsburgh it's like a playoff game\nYou say so eliminate or um sorts\nThat one I might agree with loser of this game probably misses the playoff should be entertaining with the explosive often some players yes\nHowever think Atlanta's had it still of explosives all kinds of players and would really like to have a little lock down on defense Dan Quayle and that's supposed to be his thing\nAll right so you can find me on Twitter a law radio Pamela says the cowboys at the Texans that's the game she's most looking forward to there is a poll up or you can weigh in on Facebook

next few minutes when gene scare into our dean thank you so much for your time your stories you're inside I've already learned so much if you wouldn't mind\nWould you watch what goes into the weekend the NFL official\nThe preparation the grading process I Know a lot of people asking about that and I don't really have a whole lot of inside so if you don't live ... what is the typical work week like for an NFL referee and an NFL official\n[noise] probably one of the best kept secrets in the leg to be honest with you and ... as a referee I can tell you I did document that personally I did a few uh a few news articles and things of that nature throughout the course of the season when the NFL would permitted to allow that window were courting to be pulled back a little but\nIs between twenty five and thirty hours a week of preparation you know again what Enron Sunday you would get your hard drive and that locker room of the game as it played the television you know depending on how long your flight was back home that night that you got out usually on a one o'clock and you're on your way home by eight o'clock that evening you\nSit in the plane and you put that hard drive in and you watch I always watch my game coming home\nThat night because I wanted to see the most important part initially was how does this entire three hour a fair play to television\nDid we moved the game along efficiently the game play well the TV and the viewing audience that's the first thought is that so I Would get home that would be finished more than ... would always be finished before I went to bed Sunday evening so then you would wake up one day a\nCondo revisit most of everything get all of your paperwork and reports filed on on a computer program that the that ... provides a penalty reports game ... all of these things that are referees do on Monday [noise] get all the paperwork for the last Tuesday Morning\nAt five thirty every Tuesday Morning UPS and FedEx dropped off the hard drive on my front porch that had all Seventeen games that were played the Sunday that day before Monday Night for the hard drive\nThere will be three angles of those games on that hard ... sideline view and zone view and then the television view [noise]\nUh and then ... would start breaking that game down and Tuesday you would get what would be called a preliminary grade from your game and people fail to understand this was well every there are several officials on the field and the NFL\nBut because it's a dry things are a little different so I didn't even open my suitcase when I got to the hotel in Pittsburgh which was only twenty five miles away from my home\nAnd when I opened in on Monday afternoon to get my dress shirt out to iron it I realized that my referee ... was not in my bag so I phoned home and my children were all going to the game I called I one son got on the phone us to gene go upstairs and the he said that Iraq passed on the bad\nAnd oh my goodness so he gets in the car leave early the police from Pittsburgh meet my children on interstate Seventy nine and hold them over they thought they were getting an escort to the game no dyes give us a rough patch get back in line it's still going to take you four hours to get to the game [laughter]\nUnbelievable Monday Night game it's eleven fifty eight PM and and with the game\nIs almost over there's ten seconds left one official thinks that he has a follow up to ten second run off which is going to end the game I announce that the game was ended on at ten second run off we we collaborated again that was an attempt second right off play we have to put time back on the clock they've taken the\nNow we're walking to do it's over time it's time first time I've ever announce overtime\nRules in my life I'm a panic in a little walking from twenty to mid bills because I Know they're going to film the coin toss in overtime my older brothers over my shoulder you know what they're going to say I'm trying to push them away leave me alone I'm trying to script us I go to flip the coin\nFlip a coin doesn't slip and over and it goes out of my time I left on it the coin is in the air like a pizza shell straight in the

you raise your hand be honest nobody's looking back maybe it's still dark in your house or your alone in your car is you're commuting early on this Friday morning raise your hand if you thought\nThis was actually the end of the patriots as we know it goes back to back losses to the jags and then to\nThe lie ended okay they beat the dog but it's but it's the doping I get these court thirty eight

Hogan was behind Josh Gordon\nOn the the uh Seventy first well as the five hundred top down but the Seventy first guy to catch a touchdown from Tom Brady in his career those are the two numbers coming out of Thursday Night Football between the patriots and the colds it's after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio\n\nBut I think about the the five hundred that's an outrageous number to be sure\nBut the Seventy one to me is actually more impressive because I Wonder how many of those guys are out of the league and I think about Tom Brady who now has had more touchdown passes in his career than all but two guys who ever played\nAnd I think about Drew Brees coming up this weekend only needs two hundred and one yards\nTo be the NFL's all time leader in that category and Everytime these guys step on the field now you've got different office of records that are in jeopardy that could potentially fall\nAnd it's it's awesome to watch them play to be sure but as much as it's about these guarding numbers it's also about the fact that they've survived you know the average NFL career is not even for years\nAbout three and a half years somewhere between three and three and a half years\n\nAnd the reason Tom Brady is throwing touchdown passes just so many guys is because he's the constant everything else around him as change so often and I love that I Love it when you hear drew talk about records when you hear Tom Brady talked about records what they talk about more often than not\nThe number of different guys who were involved in getting them to this point\nI just think both people to have really worked hard and um you know a quarter rectum from doing so and these people to catch them in blocking the folks who make poison coaches the coach and these are all you know great ... so\nPretty cool pretty cool\nSure is milestone moment for one Tom Brady it's after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio Julian Edelman came out with all kinds of fired energy intensity is you can imagine about a year and a half\nWorth of roars built up as he runs out on the field Eddie gets to a corner and he finds a friendly group and of course all the whole stadium was going to send to\nThe fireworks are going off and all the colored smoke and everything else so it was neat to see him back on the field [laughter] ah I'm sure your word surprise at all that\nHe was the on the receiving end of the first pass that Tom Brady through maybe everybody knew what the cold or maybe the colds knew that you shouldn't care either way it was good to see him back on the field and with all of that energy just\nBursting waiting for the chance to be out there again so he had I think seven catches fifty seven yards is a that's a number that stands out to me but mostly it was

to give you a taste of it what's the biggest topic in the NFL these days\nIt's about this emphasis on reducing the pastor penalties and the protection of the quarterbacks have and so that's where I started with Jean the very first question and I\nAsked him how difficult is it for a raft to make that kind of a judgment call\nYou know the the ... and ... and you and you're so right with\nWith how many different rules have been implemented over the recent history you know the target area for the offender is it's very ... if you really think about it because everything up and do your below or toward the had her neck area a limit the scope when the area that they could contact the ...\nI Will say from officiating there whatever from a lover of football but I think every rule that they've implemented has been a wonderful role because there is a lot of states the uh the color of the quarterback or a pastor\nShould have some special protection because he really is the only player on the field for for the most part it's standing still getting hit but someone that's moving so fast that him\nUm so so I you know I'm all for all of the uh\nYou know the the new EP limitations and new rules that they've they've put in over the years for the quarter but this one\nOr what it appears the top of what what felt like happened here in the first few weeks that they've caught up with a direct you about this thing\nThe Peters is happening and what what felt like happened here and and the first few weeks is that they've kind of put a directive outs that are saying you know if it's the majority of body weight\nA ... and some black and white issues on what\nI always felt like as a referee in the NFL I wanted to have a little bit of a play and and allow myself to use my officiating experience or officiating document to apply some judgment as to whether I felt like\nYou know the majority of body weight started quarterback but is it just a good football play and its physics because this guy just got their clean and in Russia quarter back up and these guys are so big so fast and the standing person naturally their bodies are going to fall right on top of each other very quickly\nUh with that said I always felt like if I thought he gave him a little more uh spends writes said you know giving him the business as he was taking him down or\nOr a little something actually just to punish on necessarily\nUh then then I Believe that I Would I Would call that roughing then you know and allow myself to make that judgment although it happens in a fraction of a second\nI'm you know when you're screwed in out there do you feel the difference I think and I I I Would hope that that scope opens the little when a lousy officials to apply some of that\nOkay next question and I can't even

don't fight against their head that they had put in the little to keep black folks that once I Am white but was it on\nOur wall of Judah ... painted black cool we don't care about being ...\nLet me help you understand that wasn't the point [laughter] but you know and say here's why hold on to here's why are ones that never wants to point the point was this was a city on cemetery which meant that the Seventy percent of black residents were paying\nFor all of the cemetery grounds number one number to\nWrite the city this was a city owned cemetery oh so you're ... right the Seventy percent of African American population was paying for the whole cemetery in addition to that the fence that separated\nThe white side and the blacks out if you look at my documentary which is on peach tree television and CBS forty six news the documentary clearly shows that the black side of the cemetery is not kept it all is a dilapidated falling apart or the tombstones are broken and then the white side as well Maine\nBlack side of the cemetery is not kept it all\nIs a dilapidated falling apart or the tombstones are broken and and the white side as well maintained however once again Seventy percent of the black folks that are there who are paying taxes are paying to up to the White Sox but they're not of keeping the blacks and so that was the issue\nUnderstand that yes I I you know it's a good point that when it comes from a federal dollars in my city my city money uh\nYou needed to be fair you needed to be fair is your money your band\nThat need to be fair I I totally agree with you yes but my point is oh no no no off the page huh okay\nJust flip that only ... unique to slip and then let them know that ... really don't care but when it comes to win but when it comes to be there to be with life or we don't care\nYeah but that was never the argument the argument right the argument wasn't let's be buried next to this white person the argument was this fence that splits white and black people it shows the black folks that are buried for them their family members who are buried there not keeping up the property but they're paying for it\nYou think the women the female Republican or maybe Jeff Flake\nThose women that was\nThose women those women Republican senators are not going to be able to confirm they're not going to be able to vote yes they had a\nTotal of attorneys go see one of them yesterday and these were attorneys across the aisle democratic and Republican ... a tiny female attorney came to her office I think in um they said it was so many of them they had the scheduling into different meeting\n'em and they had\nClosed door sessions with her I think this was the one is from Alaska and they told her\nThat if she both know then they got her for her ... she cannot afford to go in there and not and not um adhere to their commands and ... and ... and their demands and that's the justice on this situation she definitely the one in Alaska she's not going to vote yet\nI don't see it happening and um can you still hear me we're yes\nOkay so and the other thing is I think that more than anything\nYou've got to look at the whole\nThe whole situation the big picture of this one lady vote this women vote 'em it's just devastating for the Republicans for them to put this guy in that office it's not going to happen for them even the ones that like Lindsey Graham and the rest of 'em and Lindsey Graham says something last week and I thought was very telling he said that this vote\nIs not how you vote the vault determines how what their future is going to be like in the Senate\nLike they already know that whatever they however they vote that's what their constituency is going to look at as well and the terms of whether or not they get reelected and they have downsized the woman vote so much these old white\nI'm Republican and that they don't see the value of it did you see that I'm clear on the other senator that within the elevator not um flake but the other one no um\nWhere he told the told the girl the ... the woman to grow up and heat wave just saying that uh like get outta\nMy no ... yeah yes I saw that and there was another incident afterwards was really an infant and it was Mitch McConnell basically defending that US Senator saying all of these people who want to remind people my members all we will not be swayed\nRight yeah they don't they don't they don't understand that they don't appreciate the magnitude of this situation it's going to really\nBe don't appreciate your Marlantes Geron they don't like democracy they really don't watch it\nAnd I the last thing I Want to say 'cause I Know you have a lot of college but the other dangerous piece of this that people don't understand is if you keep moving\nThe bar as to what our laws are you we're gonna end up in a situation the consequences of that ... is that we don't have a society that says\nWell since you don't follow the laws I don't have to follow the law the ... you cannot\nThat if this is a very dangerous place for us to be because you cannot keep moving to scale over to fit what's right for you when these laws of what we've you still are bad you know just to keep law in this country right so if you if it's good for you to just say\nI don't want to do it and I'm not going to do it and I can do it this way then the rest of the world is not the rest of the country will do it as well so I'm hoping that we get this right\nThank you so much for taking my call I appreciate it\nI appreciate your call I'm sure there's many times and fractions only as strong as enforcement\n\nIf someone commits an infraction\nNothing will happen to that person if there's no real to enforce\nThe rule of law [noise] so what you write\nNothing will happen to that person if there's no real to enforce the rule of law [noise] so what you write\nAs policy protocol or law means absolutely nothing without men and women who are in place\nTo enforce it\nAnd willing to do so the infraction is only as strong as enforcement for zero for a die too to seven zero three let's go to get again in Atlanta Gideon good they welcome\nTo part with rich piece of glass and to you or do you uh same here you are you know you gotta keep a job you've got to keep a roof over your head well I'm\nGoing to do that sir no matter what 'cause I bet on me\nYeah so that's a understood\nRight but you know it sounds like this whole brother before you continue it sounds as if you are seeing you waiting that I'm saying something out of the need of\nMoney so let's go back to that point is that what you're saying no I'm\nSaying that you understand I got to keep a roof over my head I got so what does that mean what are you talking about\nWhat was your point is if I drew later on we saw it All right so you talked about this a document called the constitution\n... berry document that was used to a slave your address just that was used\nAt your end festival and oils rather they will your ancestors too sir\nRight exactly our ancestors\nYesterday that was that ... that was used treats\nCommit genocide cake land\nAnd just devastate your and my ancestors in Italy online column in after I called in and show clearly that it is a law when they talked about all men being created equal and use it it\nJust so I don't disagree with any of that I've also said that the constitution the founders the frame of state and write the constitution for people that look like you and not this was not a country founded on the principles of democracy this was a country founded on founded on the principles principles of\nRich white man should rule the world that's why you wore a white man\nWho own property you were the only person who could actually both white made that did not own property couldn't even vote you have to own property you had to be influential fluent rich that's what they want it so it wasn't written as a democracy it was written as their

let's go to ... in East Point what a slim\nListen I Want everybody to know\nI had a bit is on and tell us do it in the back in Atlanta had one that was the lowest salary oh for real you may be up at the Alamo hey the bullying and as you go all the time you know what I'm saying you know kind of what concert where you are a little bit of it\n[laughter] [laughter] oh man you you you were pimps are\nI Know there's a man who has been chosen to live in a way out there but back in the land is a is that right I hear that one day a lot of ways\nYou know what this guy's business slim you know destroyed it when the when the law changed in the city of Atlanta\nWhere they put anyone who was caught purchasing a prostitute in the newspaper\nThat did it\nIt was the way back to that once the city saying if you get arrested for purchasing a prostitute we're going to put it in the newspaper they started doing that and I really killed your business or a ... rifle man that's\nProbably why they're Joseph cambell backed up about\n... thank you for for you not to do seven zero three or let's go to Todd in Dunwoody Todd ... de welcome\nYour shop friday keeps out friday I'm going to refrain today\nI don't expect that you will for um the boat just came in the vote just came in and\nNow there's they're likely going to be assuming everybody's vote holds up\nA fly for Kavanaugh was a sitting judge and I'm hoping strongly that they make a strong consideration but somebody feel that flat who came from some place other than the ivy league there a lot a part of the reason why government has failed us\nAnd not have put it put it on the ninth justice on the Supreme Court here to six arguments that had been hurting the session already this session is because they are so focused on those Ivy League schools exclusively\nErnest session already this session is because they are so focused on those Ivy League schools the exclusively and that's the problem\nThat's a serious problem they ... they could have picked somebody who probably still would have been favorable to the Republican Party and the president or in the middle of the road\nAnd would not have had any controversy connect to none at all if they had just been willing to broaden your search and now they need to broaden it starts to doing um Kavanaugh's they soon to be they can fly that at this problem is that happening again they failed us\nWould you want it to be in one of those six cases that have been arguing for the Supreme Court already Madison versus Alabama\nWhich is a death penalty case a west Hauser versus the fish and Wildlife Service which is a case about preserving habitat in comparison to um the rights of private property would you want it to be there having your case argued under the threat that he might come down to a tie vote later on because those foods can get a nice\nPart yeah you don't want to age you don't want an eight person a panel of judges you don't want that grid locks the system either get it right or wrong but don't get a neutral Everytime\nAnd then there's one other thing that they aren't talking about each one of those justices get at least for clerks to pick and I'm the chief justice gets five if he wants to but dove clerks a major influence there they are what even comes\nTo they are and they're scholars typically why very smart they understand the nuances of the law more so than the justices they serve\nGood investigators excellent investigators they help pick who's going to even get a chance to get an argument whether they can have your case heard in front of the Supreme Court so we should be talking about that too but having said that I repeat quickly I Hope they brought in their search past Ivy League to feel Kavanaugh slot that is about to be\nThey yeah I don't think that will be a bad idea and remember this at the Supreme Court level taught you actually don't have to possess a law degree a lot of people don't realize that these ... was developed as a citizen sport and it did not create a constitutional mandate for\nYou to have any official training a formal training in law in order to sit on the court\nAnd now the fact that I Wish more people knew and let's let me say this an exit to the constitution is really not a complicated document for somebody who at least had the tenth grade education in his of average intelligence what makes it difficult to be a judge in this country is the case is\nUm and how they're how they line up with the constitution you don't need to be out of the ivy league or to be able to do that\nYeah real set a goal for zero for eight nine to two seven zero three let's go to ... in our state but they are welcome good morning Dr Richard how are you doing I'm great how are you\nOh same here I'm great also yes I felt compelled to call in on the topic when you talked about this ancient history\nThat's why I Believe that we need to go back and study into the region around North Africa particularly injured or you know I've seen it in about your history or something last justification\nIn order for the northern king and to insert here for trade the holy stores in the Bible\nTo put themselves in that region and their people to be part of the whole story and the books so with that the conquest of that reason it for the original holding people to sleep in the northern region were hostile they obviously fled south into further down in Africa so that's where the Hebrew\nCommunity which we can change that during the transit riders slave trades we're the rivers sweat but in that sort of transatlantic slave trade you know and as a whole people aren't there\nBut in that ... trans Atlantic slave trade you know and as a whole people\nAren't they were ... thank you brother appreciate your point of view for zero for eight nine to two seven zero three anything goes friday let's go to Mario midtown ha ha midtown Mario\nAnd the day well how you doing good how are you can't call it uh but uh I'm I'm I'm Alive so I guess that's a good start amen to that let me give you my prediction let me move right into this thing or this man is going to be confirmed default but a no brainer at this point we're going through\nThe formalities a leaf people have shown everybody they don't care what we think and uh\nI don't know why everybody's all ruffled I mean\nThat they're going to do what they want to do you know they don't care what the rest of us think and that is obvious\nBut you know this is the thing we saw it this this is the consequence of voting and I'm just so happy I have a guy on the order of my uh absentee ballot because always will absentee and I'm so excited about casting might as well I Can't wait I mean I think to fill out the ballot I Can't wait to fill it out\nBut folks need to realize that this is what happens when you opt out of the system and you get what you're stuck with it at that point you know the the ... what Michelle said it best Michelle Obama democracy continues\nWith or without [laughter] that's right if you want to sit home and not participate\nAnd that's fine and democracy goes on\nIt goes on and now you can't get mad now when we get stuck with a a Supreme Court justice like what we have because that's a result of voting yeah so uh you know I mean I don't know what more can be said about it I think we're gonna have to ... farm tomorrow\nAnd uh unfortunately his a position on the Supreme Court will that will be after beside his name forever you know\nRight and he was a man he will submit the conservative agenda of the court\nOh absolutely I mean you're talking about a roll back you'd think Trump wrote evacuated you get on the court what rolls back next I mean we we are and for a while a wild ride ahead of us um\nYou know I'm reconsidering go I Want to go to Canada or Paris to live I don't know I'm ... I'm I'm just you know at this point is like\nWe still need you in America Mario [laughter] go visit those lately but we need you into fights or\nWhatever to help\n[laughter]\nOh man that plays ban lifted that was the infamous street back in the day\nKnow but there's no reason why the Democrats can talk about uh once he got that him if indeed this is the white transferred I don't know when it transpired that way when it comes to the full Senate and they vote for it and they're going to go through that entire debate for how many hours is it thirty hours of debate or whatever they are going to do which is which is just a waste of time\nHere already made up their mind is go for the vote is just stupid it's it's just a lot of games that they are playing and I think that when I saw the press conference with all of those old white man because if you did a combined age I'd be like five hundred years old if you can buy a dollar a year\nAnd they're like five hundred years old and they send up there and there lecturing women victims\nPeople in brutalized and they're getting up there lecturing women to get over it and then in the same group who smoke are sympathetic empathetic there the next breath to accuse me of being alive stopped to think back to port of being a liar there is no reason to put this lady to come out put herself through what she has put through been been put through\nTo lie about a man that she she didn't know him which you know and then the FBI not going to you know examining the house that she described in detail you can't find that house\nIf that houses still don't do that you can't go to a cursory examination of that how can you tell you can't go look at it didn't even bother doing that so she says she and we know it's a sham that's okay I said like I say lose the back window battle lose the war and it it will only happen if the attack on Democrats\nCould just get it together I mean if they could just get it together which they never ever seem to do there is just such a huge disappointment because you know fight for anything they always give up oh we've got to be fair we got to do this okay and I believe in fairness I'm a very ethical person\nBut you know sometimes you know you can't put it was it that you can't bring a knife to a gun battle you can't do that you have to fight them where they're at\nYou can't wait for them to get to where you're at you're never going to get to where you're at it there was people are never going to come to where you're at because why because power because they want to keep their power the empower collapse we know that because we have a corrupted person in office in front of us right now so go ahead and just move forward let him have his seat\nNow so go ahead and let him happy feet go after the impeachment though not I don't don't be mean don't be so easily like they can they be that's that's\nWhat I had ... when I like rats my word for the friday but I Will use we easily stop being way easily ... recently that you stop a battle after like\nFour zero forty not due to seven zero three\nOr so Brett Kavanaugh in Wall Street\nOpinion article said that if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court this week he will be independent and an open mind that justice now he needs to be indicted on with that statement now you can you can actually hang something on that statement\nThat's alive\nHe wrote that he was highly emotional during a Senate hearing last week as he defended himself from sexual assault allegations he said he regret some of the things he said then I wanted to see regret when he said I like beer\nI drink beer ... drink beer\nOr was it when he argue with the U.S senator who acts and beauty drink to the border blacking out he's a I don't know whether you\nShe said well well I don't have a drinking problem yeah but I'm trying to find out did you drink and blackout that's what I'm trying to figure out\nHe apologized for the U.S senator after the break he was all over the place does he have the temperament\nFor zero point now too to seven zero three as I said before the issue has nothing to do with him drinking when he was a teenager\n\nThat will be hypocritical of me I Would like intellectual integrity if I say this was about a man drinking when he was a teenager\nIt's not really even about the mistakes he made while he was a teenager this is about his current court character\nBecause if you're willing just to top it from the front of the world and speak in front of the u._s. sending it'd be under oath and lie about a ... day you'll have a court character problem a question anybody's transformation\nIf they are and able to acknowledge their previous sends\nA question I question the sincerity I question the authenticity I question the

D. before we went on there and it kind of freaked me out a little bit but I help my composure and when we got on there I didn't know what the\nWoman was going to actually say about this whole situation I knew when we were talking about what we were talking about Trump\nAnd him going to a campaign rally and bashing and alleged victim of sexual assault\nPresident Trump decided to start bashing Dr Ford and hurt plains of being sexually assaulted so we were talking about that and everything is going as\nI Would expect she's saying that Trump is simply tell them the truth I'm saying well does his tone is not helpful to Kavanaugh it you know normal stuff\nAnd then she said something that really shocked me and I also think it shocked Chevron read\nThis woman said let me ask you a question\nThat this is what she's saying live on the news lately\nIt said let me ask you a question\nThat this is what she said live on the news let me ask you a question do you really think that sexual assault and Chevron reading are looking at each other like\nDo you mean if she is telling the truth is professor forward is telling the truth\nIf if it did happen that way is that really sexual assault and I'm like wait a minute do you realize your OWN TV battle because I just entered the twilight zone she was basically saying\nIf it actually happened the way described during the Senate confirmation during this hearing if it happened that way she's saying that it is still not sexual assault\nWho's conduct you're talking about banning this murder in a yeah Jason Van Dyke this Menorah cop yes oh well so first of all hold on a brother or we talked about this story on my show multiple times\nVan out this murder in a yeah Jason Van Dyke this murder and top yes once that first of all hold on a brother\nOr we talked about this story on my show multiple times um I've made a phone call to a friend of mine in Chicago\nJust to keep me updated because now the jury's deliberate and this was Seventy years ago we talked about the call McDonald's we came against this coffee in the beginning when he was not jobs I became against the mayor of Chicago because he engaged in a cover up the mother of look Kwan mc Donald's\nA sheet of days or the cover up to\nAnd people criticize me for talking about his mother his mother was such a horrible mom\nThat he was a ward of the freaking state\nShe wasn't even raising the kid and she took the money from the city and decided to shed her mouth about her baby being killed by this cop\nSo everybody failed this kid we we're looming hated that surf from day one\nOkay brother I when I went to see everybody if they are and what I was saying about Peter's speaking out in a condo\nOr the leadership here are the Catholic Church or a black pilot kitchen none of them black totally none of them speak out on this harbor hey that was committed that was why was saying about the kind of not not the public and that's where Dr King was saying\nNow the Catholic Church in Chicago as powerful now you had a priest came today a trial with a Van Dyke a mother and he was dead supporting him and he wouldn't even speak to that family and they tried to speak did it did praise\nAnd the brother was talking about nets in Germany this is what we're seeing Raj Shah we're seeing nasty Germany exploding here and that's why I don't like Hitler was put an ad out he was put there to the atmosphere and make it go forward\nAnd the popular papers here they have said nothing about the dishes kind of that's my point not us in the top show arena we have always came down on it\nBut leadership people in power they have took a deaf ear kid is trying to do and that means brother\nThat it will keep growing it will keep going on and there's going to go just the way they vote on it and I just want people to be fair but what's been happening in this country\nAre thank your brother appreciate your call for zero for that to to seven zero three at

these members\nWill do a B and C for you if you could get sent it to sell one cell to vote for Kavanaugh\nAnd all of this is happening in private conversation on cell phones outside of the prying eyes of the public\nAnd once the decision is made to approve judge Brett Kavanaugh it will not be because he's some great jurists it will not be because he will make it\nIt will not be because he's some great jurists it will not be because he will make a remarkable Supreme Court justice\nIs because somebody got promise toys\nFor zero for eight nine cute to seven zero three anything goes friday boys
