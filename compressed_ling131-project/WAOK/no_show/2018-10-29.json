there for your own enjoyment this is basically where you will become a man and a consulting role after your retirement the way I see LeBron with the Lakers you've already retired thirty four years old you'll continue to put up grapes that you'll never achieved that greatness again\nNot against Golden State they continue to pounded out they'll get clay Thompson figured out you'll never achieve that again you're in that division you're in that conference you'll never do it again you'll make movies you'll produced movies you can be the next Jerry wind Trump for all I Know you'll never reached that level\nMichael at the end\nSill average twenty points a game at over forty years old with a little bit of a belly bad genes off the floor when he was with the Washington Wizards you might have that Michael was still trying to compete and win on a team that he partially don't\nI don't know if I can say the same for you and that's what makes it sad\nThe greatness as they're throwing down his ...

of losing the finals\nYou might not reach Michael status Michael status was about being a killer until his dying breath out there and the floor you might do reach wilt Chamberlain status\nIf I ask you out there on the floor nine out of ten years maybe eight out of ten or seven out of ten depending on the night you'll say bill Russell was better than wilt Chamberlain and rightfully so more tenacity more championships more smarts over it absolutely would be worth it but of overall talent will Chamberlain pick and choose what that's the one it\nWasn't overwhelmingly important to him with winning for LeBron I have to call into question yet again\nNot about being better that you left I could see it the first time and even the second time if you were to bring guys with you and actually put together a run you'd be at the top of your game I'm not doing the segment right now\nBut from the way I see this two and four to start off the year with those running mates and I'm hearing oh he'll be

here between baseball and football\nI like many of you spent time over the weekend is\nFeeling terribly and a feeling that the anguish and the pain of what happened in Pittsburgh that synagogue on Saturday morning um where you had eleven people who were killed during status services means they were there at a baby naming ceremony something that a lot of family\nWe had eleven people who were killed during Sabbath services man they were there at a baby naming ceremony something that a lot of families do in churches all over the country and as I went to church on Sunday and got together with my kids I teach first and second graders on Sundays I couldn't help but think\nIt's supposed to be a place of peace is supposed to be a place where you're safe and instead a gunman opened fire and not only killed eleven people but injured a handful more including some first responders and so then all over Pittsburgh as you can imagine\nTime stops life comes to a grinding halt or there were two thousand people who packed to Pittsburgh call for a vigil on Saturday and then er at the vigil was on Sunday and then the Steelers holding a moment of silence before their game against the browns\nJust it's it's a stark\nReminder of how fleeting life can be how precious it can be and and that nothing is guaranteed but also about how dark and evil\nLife can be as well and so I Know that even as we talk about sports many of you are thinking about that processing it\nThrough your own your own walk of life and and your own habits in your own perspective and that's what I did thinking about going to church on Sunday how you would never suspect something like that to happen\nAnd so definitely I had been praying for the families of the victims for the loved ones and for those people who were there whose lives Are Forever changed I don't know how you get over something like that I'm using my air quotations of course because your life never quite looks the same\nAnd sports as an opportunity for for people to forget a little bit right to have a a distraction even if it's for a moment\nOne six six seven oh today not available in North Dakota\nProtecting data across modern

Peter Schwartz I Love the way he does the scores\nAnd everything he does a great job to make sure I pass it along [laughter]\nAnd um I wanted to mention I was listening to the game on the radio uh yesterday the Packers and the rams mhm and I was so disgusted with the Montgomery when he took a kickoff instead of staying in the end zone\nHi could set Aaron Rodgers up to twenty five yard line\nAnd they never should have taken that ball he's not a great runner taken out of the end zone John Robbins in announcing the games that he's never ran the ball more than twenty five yards on a kickoff anyway and I don't know if that was McCarthy's mistake\nNo no no no it was not McCarthy said afterwards that time was supposed to take the Neal\nYeah at why did I I just don't get it\nI mean for the same reason that Cody Ballenger decided that he would try to leave early birth dates and steal it what was it that the night dating or I don't remember exactly what any it was on friday night but he takes all but his own and he gets caught in a rundown when he would have been a runner and it's going to get there was a walk right behind him so yeah sometimes players think they\nHave an opportunity and they take it even if it's against the game plan is not always the coaches for the manager's faults\nOh yeah I I realize that but you know my God I mean you know who you know Rogers is like a\nA blue sky Walker of the Green Bay Packers math and you know he's the one that makes that team and you got to tell yourself hey I Need to Neal so he could we can set it up for him and he's trying to do something that was really stupid and you know ... I'm Sorry\nOkay to Indiana fumbled the ball nobody'd be calling it's stupid I mean it just the whole idea was that he was in the end zone and why run it out when you already are given the thirty five yards\nI mean in a you know in the whole pros and cons that you run through in your brain why are you running it out at all even if you don't think you're going to fumble the ball which he ended up doing you still aren't likely to get thirty five yards\nYeah well I think you'll get a chilling out then\nYou know I think he got what he did he got one from Aaron on the sidelines and then the poor guy was by himself all by his lonesome as the rams are able to run out the final two minutes so yeah he he felt like the weight of the world was on his shoulders for sure\nOh absolutely and I just wanted to say it was a great world series I kind of would like to see in a few more games one or two more games but uh like you said but on the other hand they were saying Luke Wilson last night how he's been in a slump and he comes up to bat\nAn eye on the road here that and I'm thinking watch them hit a home run [laughter] ... yeah but they're looking looking back yeah Hi Ronda thanks so much

the for nothing lean to the bullpen blew it starting with Ryan Madsen\nUh and obviously on a game five which is really the combination for Steve Pearce and pretty cool the most improbable series MBP it's after hours here on CBS Sports radio eight five five to one to four to seven and eight five five to one to\nFour to seven so much happening in the NFL in week eight as well and and I'm just going to touch on some of the story lines uh the the rams surviving the Packers\nBut getting a major assessed from Packers running back time Montgomery so it's really difficult for Aaron Rodgers to lead a a game winning drive or there'll be field goal or touched down in the final two minutes if he doesn't have the football\nBut time on governor he decides instead of kneeling down in the end zone which apparently was what he was supposed to do he decides he can make a play and he rushes that ball out of the end zone and tries to return to kick off and put his team in a better position instead he fumbled football and so the Packers never get it back and\nI felt really bad for him quite a lonely spot to be in on the sidelines there where there are a lot of Packer fans in Los Angeles I thought that was weird it was just me but here are the rams were undefeated and they're taking on a really difficult opponent another opponent\nHas more fans are maybe more vocal fans than they did there at the coliseum so rams and Packers they fight almost to the end and entertaining game on Sunday afternoon\nAnd also in the AFC North of Pittsburgh Steelers getting a slow start but then getting by the Cleveland Browns and it continues to be a bunch of growing pains and and lessons to be learned for young Cleveland Browns team including their quarterback Baker Mayfield but I tell you what one of the things\nThat I think is astounding about this season\nEven as we marched through a week after week and of course there are Pittsburgh Steelers fans\nAnd the Pittsburgh clubhouse himself the franchise itself wondering what every now and then\nWe think we'll hear from Les beyond bell why do you think Libya ... report\nHe has to be there by we ten if he doesn't want to lose this this year on his resume completely\nAnd yet here we are through weaken number eight and not only is he not much of a blip you don't hear much about it and would you change if he does decide to show up but man the

the browns early they couldn't capitalize as they are moving the ball up and down the field and it was almost like a that missed field goal the second missed field goal was a wakeup call for the Steelers and they finished up with to Antonio Brown touchdowns before they ever got to the half\nAnd then they were often running so for Ben I only had one sack which is good um the browns and generally defensively we'll get to the quarterback they did have a couple of takeaways are still tops the NFL there\nA book for the the Steelers to have Antonio Brown and big band and James Caan or do the dirty work uh there's another when they're so three in a row now and they're on top of the AFC North\nThat wasn't the most important thing that was taking place in Pittsburgh over the weekend as you know we've talked about it already but a moment of silence before this game started for the victims and the families that were affected by this shooting at the synagogue on Saturday morning and I read that there were two thousand people who showed up for a vigil on Sunday\nAnd so thinking of Pittsburgh uh wishing the city didn't have to go through it um but the the sports I feel like such an afterthought and yet I Know that they help in the healing process even if it's just a step so we're thinking of Pittsburgh and for the families of course those victims who were there to

I wake up recognition looking at me for a pay cut but I'm assuming\nThat you lay down when they can never go wrong with the way down scheme in Danger Arena when he did you have to tell them I Would I like\nAre you a national is to make it even argue if you are a Republican or a conservative or are you to a nationalist yesterday as I was debating Shelley winter on the campus of plug\nIn Atlanta University I brought up the aspect of what nationalism ... means what the actual definition is\nAnd also said\nThat there's a reason why the word nationalist or nationalism has a bad name and even Trump in his speech contextualize the very same\nShelley winter conservative\nShot back and said that he was a nationalist too\nAnd I actually well when did you become a national is because I've never heard\nYou say that is it because Trump said\nFour zero for not due to seven zero three let's go to Tony good day Toni welcome\nHey what's going on more than a shot I Do on\nThe motor brother how are you oh at first I Want to say because you met your restaurant everything was great and they would come and rub it\nBut first I Want to say a bigger state you met you at the restaurant everything was great I didn't think he would come and brother thank you become a man\nHey man I Wish I could have been a a fly on the wall to listen to the debate that you had against Shelley man\nI really wish I could have been there did you make any type of styles tunes or anything like that or was it recorded\nFor ... yeah it is actually on the Facebook page so Nicole\nOr my assistant she recorded at Facebook Live you would have to go on the real talk with a ... page scroll down until you find demand is is in there and and already have a lot of views but yeah so she did stream it live I think\nShelly had somebody streaming live as we are connected to his social media and there there were many college students they screamed it also\nOkay and then I listen to the debate last night with a safety and yeah yeah man or what what's the a libertarian guy's name what's his hand met when he was such a deal the distraction man ... total\n... what was his purpose I mean he's one percent I mean to me that's just to put in place to just kinda deviate away from all all of the true facts that\nNeed to be brought out between those two candidates it was to me a straight distraction because I kept focusing on this dude it was like what does this do doing here you can't even answer questions clearly enough no offense to him if he's listening\nBut I think they it was a little boring\nA date I I think those two really need to get down to get a little dirty and really explain what their true agenda is to become governor because they're just blaming each other and I know that that's part of the political process but hey I Want to hear your strategy what is it that you actually intend to bring\nTo the table that make me want to vote for you and they're not doing that they're just throwing money that's all they're doing\nYeah it was basically a repetition of their commercials so everything you heard them say was significantly similar\nTo everything you've heard in the commercials and so and I I really blame to a large degree but third party candidate being there because if you had just Stacy and just camp and you would have seen a much more dynamic debate about who recently\nAbsolutely because then the true sex would have started to come out but it was even the way the moderator allow them to voice question why he would say well actually you know lifts a question and the question was actually focused towards Stacy\nI Know exactly right they use their middle sounding board almost right nothing more they don't care about his politics\nRight no damn yeah it was great I was like some sort of like I thought the question was supposed to be directed the yeah right Stacy exactly really yeah you\nGuys do better than that do better than that I mean we want

though I didn't believe he would actually win the primary\nBut I voted for Bernie Sanders and I remember the phase where even Democrats traditional Democrats\nWere talking about Bernie Sanders is not a Democrat he's not a progressive he's a socialist even though he'd never described himself in that way he's always described himself as an independent in politics and the Democratic socialist in policy he's always saying that\nBut they tried they tried to marginalize his impact by saying socialist why is it ... that Republicans are not trying to marginalize Trump for saying nationalist\nTwo teams [noise]\n\nOoh that always though [noise]\nWhat's happened and welcome back for zero for eight nine to two seven zero three lasers ladies and gentlemen Arkansas Arkansas has altered rational race in this congressional race\nThere's a guy named fringe ill he's a\nCurrent congressman\nHe came out and the damned a political action committee\nCommercial ad from a conservative pack\nI played some of that on the show\nEarlier this week\nLet me remind you of this commercial now remember this was a real commercial actually being played in Arkansas\nRight now let's hear that\nWhy do you think about what's happening in Washington congressman French\nAnd the Republicans know that it's dangerous to change the presumption of innocence to a presumption of guilt is factually for black me if the Democrats can do that to a white justice of the Supreme Court with no ... no cooperation and witnesses including her best friend said didn't happen\nIs fathers when white girl lives on the girl why Democrats on election black folk again always told my son don't mess around with that if you get she will crime rate\nI'm voting to keep Congress let French and the Republican because we have to protect me envoys we\nAfford to live in white Democrat take us back to the bad old days of race verdict life set does this last year and a white girl screens rate\nPaid for by black Americans for the president's agenda not authorized by any candidate for candidates committee now the guy behind that pack is a North Carolina man named burning Robison Vernon runs an organization called black Americans or the president's agenda that's according to the Arkansas\nTime I have burning on the show today I missed the Robin how are you doing fantastic I Hope\nYou're doing walls for all I'm doing very well let me first ask you about [noise]\nThe content of the commercials on because this is not a parody this is a real commercial airing on\nArea in the state of Arkansas what made you approve this commercial\nShow airing on Arkansas\nAre airing in the state of Arkansas what made you approve this commercial\nWell actually we we it finished its run on friday and we started the jobs that on a Monday which is running through the election\nI got to nobody cares about the jobs that are ... ... ... an or the abortion out but right let me get why nobody cares about those that I Would just say we're in Georgia are we care about the\nAd that has made national news so it's great that you run another ads but let's talk about the ad that made national news because we're in the state of Georgia not really involved in Arkansas politics you're from uh North Carolina but what made you put the this time together in a proven\nWell again your listeners should be said man because or all all the ads because they will end up\nAh defeating Claire McCaskill electing Josh Holly in Missouri but in any event we can talk about that later [noise]\nUm I was horrified watching the Kavanaugh hearings and actually I was trying to come up with a school choice at since uh the Democrats are opposed school choice of what\nI'm here to support the union to want to crush black boys in the in the union run schools that don't teach them how to read right now but I I didn't have as good a school choice out and I\nSaid wow you know the Democrats and the friend is a folks running the Democratic party right there on the me too movement\nHad just done a frontal assault on black men and and the women who love us so let's put an ad together because again a white Democrats can't jump they have to get Ninety percent\nOf the black vote in order to get elected in the south\nAnd you know with regard to jobs or abortion or or or the Kavanaugh hearings there's more than ... percent of black writers who are up are concerned about the fringe position so the Democratic party so that's why we put that together it's a very effective ad\nThat's why I approve the ad because we want it to make sure everybody knows that if I'm In a black folks catch hell with the presumption of\nInnocence Sarah Leah Kurt standard for convection what happens if you change that if the me too movement is successful and we believe all accusers\nMiserables ... miserable leave Emmett Till's accusers\nOkay so ms Robison my response to you is this\nA Brett Kavanaugh current Supreme Court justice did have the presumption of innocence presumption of innocence is a standard hailed within the confines of the court of law not the court of public opinion\nHe has no constitutional right\nTo become a Supreme Court justice that has a courtesy offered to you do out the transition and progression of your life and he's reached that status use in there so there's no question about the presumption of innocence\nThe presumption of innocence is intact for Brett Kavanaugh just as it should be because he has not been charged no convicted of anything in a court of law in addition to that you add up or claims\nThat Democrats and this is a quote girl white Democrats will be legend black folk again do you actually believe that\nUh we have to answer your place again I ask you there was no trial with Emmett Till should we believe that accuser to white Democrats did\nKnow that that's the reality reality as women nap what's ... women have made false allegations we talked about talked about this program many many many times before my question in my ... with us\n... but I I Want to ask you the ad takes to test the me too movement saying we should believe all\nMany times before my question in my ... and ...\nBut I I Want to ask you the AT T to pass the me too movement saying we should believe all accusers\nNo believe that that's not I do not believe the me too movement that says believe all the ... for example I I don't I'm good with the me too movement let me say one good with the MeToo movement because I Know senator harassment takes place\nOn ... and I know women have been suffering in the highlands\nBelieve all accusers\nI don't I don't care who wears a T shirt that has nothing to do with my phone to me to believe if I Believe a person based on the pirates of evidence I Believe that person for example have a small to get caught up in the me too movement to write ... lost his job I stand with cabbage smiley\nI think with Tavis Smiley did was something\nThat is done and workplaces where men worked

O. carries a voice to the community [noise]\nBarry White trying this [noise] speaking of voices lord and my boss [noise]\nThe war was the Lowes for oh four\nTo seven zero three you get back to the ... you're checking with people in our lab [noise] um [noise]\nYeah come on Russia the let's see\nHow you doing man or a minor mobile how you do good oh I'm only man but I I I wrote about\nUh this is what I Do I let my both between Democrat Republican or whatever the independent party is that's what I knew\nThat will be personally I Am sleeping body of a I wouldn't necessarily how do you do that I didn't know that you could do that I I mean I'll do it I mean I Do it\nI had to do to I tried to like let me know between a Democrat again\nIt's hard to do to try to like split up between a Democrat again and and a half into one time there was like oh it might have been in the\nPrimary though that I could do maybe in the in the general elections are often sometimes I like some independent candidate but I could never see myself voting for Republican on the circumstance I mean I I Am\n... I wrote it for Republicans on certain officer an officer that I when I Googled their information as opposed to when I go to the Democratic\nOr the Democrat nominee I like what the uh I like some of the the stance that after that the Republican had a better stance on a certain\nPosition and the Democrat or they're in one case I stick to your member it was something about the environment of the community and I like what the Republican state as opposed to the Democrat was going to let the corporate what the corporations want it so I bought it for a Republican in that case so and I did my phone I just I just a\nSemi with him when I was voting so I looked up to the different candidates and that's how I voted voted on which one that\nUm they bring with issues that I agreed upon um as opposed to the Democratic party or the party of labor nah not really because you got races on both sides are set\nIs that that is that\nIs true um however\nYou know and I was just I'm just thinking about me and I can only speak for myself when I came to anybody else but the thing for how to feel ... I Would like to encourage people to think though a and to be open to feel and to not ignore\nHow they feel when they hear different people's policies being a being shared a just generally across the\nBoard of what Republicans tend to want to say that they want things that are hurtful to the majority of the people and to not have worked on the\nRepublican or Democrat sort of saying our Republican or the science\nWhen I say that I wouldn't know what I said was\nIs that the policies that are generally promulgated by Republicans\nAre and I say and I use the word generally they are generally hurtful to the masses of people and they and they always have this white Supreme is kind of kind of near over to him or and that's what causes me to feel that these policies are not right because they don't feel right\nTo me when I look at it when I read it when I when I study it it's something that ain't gonna be helpful to the most people is going to be helpful to a small few a a ... of ... and you and generally people who are white that's why I don't that's why I don't ... what Republicans it's not because I ... the Democrats and again I Would it have to do with\nIt has to do with the policies and the policies that are anti human you know what I'm saying yeah I understand\nIt and then uh as far as with the whole like you mentioned your demanded you the Jewish uh people are you know I can see all the news they're saying they're just white people that are battling otherwise I mean why people are the what is it the or\nThe or the European white people in the Jewish people didn't want to say just like the white hair they they they let us down in the same group if they're still ... percent yesterday when they're saying one percent together I don't really accept a re a right but\nThere are there are some people who won't just as there are some people who won't justice who happened to be white I mean those are the people who who who to who we can't live with if we know that's who people who are the people who won't justice who\nCan live with it ain't got nothing to do with if you're black or white do you won't just\nIf we know that some people who other people who want justice\nWho can live with it ain't got nothing to do with if you're black or white do you want justice do you have a heart for people who are suffering is money the only thing that drives the way that you owe the way that you vote in the way that you fall down on different issues if so you know then\nBe with that and and roll with that I just spin it launches a row with people who don't put people first I Can't do yeah\nYeah but you have a large majority of people that's how they roll with the money and yeah so I'm gonna do with the whole law\nRight and just because they do it doesn't mean that is right it doesn't mean you know the right\nTrack it doesn't make it it don't mean like it doesn't mean that is right but that's what that's how they chose what their own failings our own thoughts\nRight now and then we're not when I was hoping people because they're not getting shot\nHow how easy it is to just to be toppled over into a a lying aligning oneself with fool fascism ... or you know to see black people or I saw this little this little are precious little black girl on social media are actually she was on the Dr phil show\nTalking about how much she loves white people how much he just ate\nAll think that this is something\nThat couldn't be real it couldn't be true but it is the way it is true right now right right right right right okay so that's an example\nOf how people get sucked in to loving others and to put it others above themselves you know\nHas meant that woman has mental illness so you have like people are walking around a\nLot of people they have an email we better you know how much as we can take all they traumatize daily\nOf course he I I Am like a a Clarence Thomas was mentally ill he doesn't need about the black community I think Kanye West mentally and a lot of these are several Lebanese are mentally ill that's why I don't let them speaking me on the political em on any level they just did this to entertain I don't I
