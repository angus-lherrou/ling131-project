to three two and one still trailing the bangles in the AFC North at\nForeign to bank was the only had two hundred and Seventy five yards despite the fact that they've taken the lead lead to end the games they did struggle offensively elsewhere in the AFC North I Can't help but I voted for the Baltimore Ravens with a franchise record eleven sacks of Marquez Mario to\nTheir one of our candidates for Monday MBP on Twitter a radio or on our Facebook page and I'm all in on that ravens events\nAre shut out I said this earlier but it's really hard to do a professional\nOften it's only managing a hundred and six ... yards only seven first towns and know points that's actually hard to do in the NFL but the ravens and the titans finish with a Twenty one nothing score\nAnd so the ravens are able to bounce back as well\nIt's after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS forge radio eight five five to one to four to seven that's our phone number and we'll throw in a few more storylines before we get to the top of the hour but Michaels in Detroit welcome to after hours\nGood morning hey\nListen I don't know if you remember what a couple of weeks ago I call it ... it was after Indianapolis and shoots than\nAh the cutter head it's hot and crime and use a number and I said well you know a lot of ties as good as the loss in the Gulf of size doesn't do any good\nSo I Do the research I went back ... years where a tiger would make a difference\nIn a team making the playoffs so to hold off and the two thousand and for the journal I finished up in\nThe in one mhm and one division right it made the playoffs a New Orleans finish that seven and nine but\nSure all line up at the library for for the better conference record so or wouldn't have met so then the next time I found something within three thousand in the\nPhiladelphia Eagles beat for call boys wild game of the season darkroom diminished nine sticks and won the cowboys were nine and seven and ...\nSo that's only one time in ten years through thousands game four thousand feet or a tie actually made a difference in a team making before it off so what's the point\nNotes within once they want to read an old\nAndy was three and all of our and then I have to assume going for the top but when you're one drew and want isn't any difference and wandering through your job the goal for ...\nNo it is a difference you can't just because you haven't found the examples of it and you mentioned Carolina found any examples of it doesn't mean it won't make a difference this year\nI mean right now I Am dealers right now the Steelers are in three two and one and they could end up winning their division because of that particular tight I mean we don't know how it's going to play out and there's a bunch of teams that have died and we'll see how it affects them\nWe are what are you\nAt ... sweetheart\nOr ... when you only have one time in ten years I mean that your mail mavericks don't why\nHow many teams actually finished with ties and those ten years\nAre counted ah there were about\nCincinnati drill\nOn okay it's really it's not important we'll see how it well see we'll see how right it's minimal exactly so now we've got a few more\nOf them this year and we'll see how it plays out either way the NFL's not changing so I'm not sure what you're arguing\nOr on your show girl for when you're wanting to do some of your folks for goal for thought it was a a one on one it's going to see I mean it's different than wandering through\nNo it is different but you just wanted mathematics it absolutely is different it's not the same thing anyway thank you so much Michael uh we'll see how it plays out after this particular season since we have a couple of more ties in the NFL more maybe have a greater sample size\nEight five five oh never mind it's after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS portraying us all a lot of you are weighing in about the track me versus the defense of slug fest and uh I I like some of your comments and I liked the fact that it's not uniform either\nUm that there are some of you like Craig who says I find no enjoyment and watching the NFL right now because of that because of the way that it's pass happy and you expect\nTo see teams put up these garde numbers\nBut Steven says he prefers to track meets he says watching high scoring games with a thousand total yards is fine ...\nPlus it's like watching NC double a football since the big twelve conference is high octane passing right well it's one of the conferences um let's see Bob says considering my Steelers can't stop anyone defensively I guess the track meets will do [laughter]\nFor now whatever suits your purposes right a Steve another Steve same thing track meets watching scoring is fine but real send us says smash mouth football is what I prefer and Mike says defense the games in the seventies\nSo the nineties were some great games and dug says\nToday's gains remind me of the old AFL lots of passing very little defense nothing against the AFL but I'd like to see a defensive struggle from\nTime to time and so there is a different debate\nBut\nWhat makes headlines is not so much the ravens with their eleven sex as amazing as that was as\nDominant as it was as well as the chargers played against Baker Mayfield and hit him over and over again uh as long as the Seahawks played against their car and got to him over and over again\nI it it's not necessarily going to be the guardian headlines on the front page of a your fair the front of your favorite website or you know the front page of the sports section of your newspaper because people do still read those\nUm it's it's these guarding numbers and it's a Patrick ... an Eighteen touchdowns and it's up and down the field and its hold your breath\nTo see who has the ball last and and if one team can answer a what the other one just did so\nI definitely\nWish there was a balance so I appreciate what a lot of\nFormer players quarterbacks have said about the age of the NFL we're in right now which is that the often does have an unfair advantage and it's mostly because of the space that's been made possible by the rules changes um but it's also about the ways that\nIs um but it's also about the ways that quarterbacks are protected and so it just and it's a completely different era that we're in right now\nI cannot quibble with rules designed to make the game more safe and honestly\nThere every single week instances in which I feel like a flight should have been thrown for helmet to helmet contact the hit on a mark Cooper yesterday in London is a great example of that the guy did not can cuss himself\nHe gets knocked pretty much out and has to leave the game with a concussion and somehow there is no flag on what was the helmet to helmet hits\nAnd so I I definitely can see the protection for quarterbacks it's not a forwarded elsewhere even though there was a whole lot of lip service given to no one shall be leading with his helmet whether it's often whether it's the fence you see it every single game\nUm helmet to helmet contact that's not cold and so I I Want the NFL to be safer especially when it comes to head injuries um but\nRight now that's not what's changing the game it's about all these pass it or fear it's calls that allow receivers ... to roam free or even back to get into the second level of defense and it's about the quarterbacks and and how much space they're allowed to have\nClinical trial the Michael J.

W E okay but I have a clip of Trump\nSaying I think he was interviewing with Sean Hannity or somebody on Fox News I remember Fox News on the safe place of all things bigoted so he was on Fox News\nAnd he was saying that Khan gay has has great respect in the African American community he has a lot of followers in the black community and and this guy likes me that's the way it was basically saying so why was ... at the White House because according to Trump\n... has a lot of black followers well why does that matter right now because I'm a little something called the midterm election now he's oh blame used to the fact that we've been\nPut continued to reserve category like he's on the bench at the moment he's not really an active player on the court as it relates to the black community in that sense but remember this is the same guy who went on national TV and said\nI said President George W. Bush doesn't like black people I Know people disagree with him doing that\nBut remember he was speaking to a collector frustration built by many black folks who went through that hurricane and they felt as if they will be treated like second class citizen he created were set up a page and in that moment of their electorate frustration and he was gay\nAnd he did that and now look out tap dance well this president and not even when they're half French just really afraid\nFor the role for not due to seven zero three we got more\nWell I'll tell you first of all I like him a lot he's been a friend of mine I've known him for a long time is a very different kind of a guy I say that in a positive way but he is a different kind of a guy\nOr those that are in the music business Asian genius and that's okay with me because as far as I'm concerned he is I Will say this one guy and he came out very strongly a number of months ago something happened my polls whatever like\nTwenty five

... and doesn't have a protect us from the a microwave frequency of the cell phone\nAnd therefore it leaves our our brains and our sales ... breaking don't sell bonds and everything but some ways them that we can use to protect ourselves is that this is our best friend and if you look in the\nCell phone manual you see that they said to keep the cell phone at least ten millimeters away free me is that all the time but most of us just have it right pressed up against her are facing thing and also you have to be aware of weak signals 'cause we could've signal the more the radiation that is being spread\nAnd um when you put your cell phone in the past or in your pocket\nPointed number pat towards us because this radiation comes out of the back of a cell phone and also such a pans music from left or right and not dial on the speaker phone and then we have to remember that when it comes to business what cell phone does is that you can build a big website on a cell phone\nYour minimize your creativity as far as being able to create value just stuck with a little tiny let the thing and you have and we have to remember that Johnny Cochrane died from a brain cancer from using cell phone but anyway we leave that for what I wanted to say is that what\nI owned the land so you had before you had to you know those original models or were they made it even more radiation than the president

the phone and granted Enron phone and I said baby you're on the phone too much the only put the phone down go to sleep\nWith me but I doubt I agree with with your assessment one hundred percent but let me say this also\nDanger ancestors\nYou know in in biblical scripture all biblical scripture is sometimes it it it it it's for the benefit of history\nBut it's more for the benefit of understanding ourselves ... cells which you mentioned earlier was these forty five I'm not forty five but these refrigerators\nThey have people who study this instrument called a human being\n... makes it tick what makes it not kick hound them and you know all the things that you mentioned earlier they do this on a twenty four seven basin in laboratories than in scientific laboratory and\nIn in scholar I mean they just study the human being ... you know what I mean and what what we have to do also is understand how the human\nBeing works and then the ancestors gave us the cold and the codes of conduct send the principles that will have a fight against anything that this refrigerator throw at us so discipline is required\nTo restrain is required you had a minute ago answer like is required also but what you found out that even though you know something sometimes you don't have the willpower to strip the do it\nAnd now you have to build that muscle up all over again you understand what I'm saying mhm Mm not really know the you know where where we talked about fasting where we talked about about this as staying and asked and that's all of those things are building muscle building strength building\nAppetite I mean the controlling appetites annex cetera and what we've done it just walked away from those principles into a world where do what you want to do no restrictions no rules no nothing\nI bet you feel do it you know what I mean that's the danger that we have right now so\nBottom line is they gave us the ancestors gave us the spiritual wisdom and the knowledge on how to count on any thing this materialistic refrigerator throw at us we just have to reapply and it's not easy just like you said a minute ago it's not easy and it's a lifelong battles because they are constantly\nComing at those advertised to push those appetite in the wrong direction moderation is another principle that the ancestors gave us\nThat we need to respect that and you understand what I'm saying oh don't balance is you know 'cause you know a principle ... odd you know when you get out of that when you when you spend too much time on one particular thing and take your your life your body and spirit out of balance right ... to to do some ills\nThat the other than just that\nBecause that's what constitutes an addiction\nThat's right and and then the body that this instrument to create a crater called the human body it's so tuned that it'll it'll let you know immediately want us out of out of order when something is out of place you know what I mean I walked by their I took a shout out of the day and I looked in the mirror and then I'm going to go to the gym you know what I could quickly outta place\nAll summer [laughter] a\nGood hard look good and the million man and a lot about the look like you mentioned the later but you've got to get her to do but it's a little over ... feel differently as we'll let you go to oh you did you use is running back and forth you know run with a crime to lose weight to ...\nThat eating the wrong things again and eating at the wrong time\nYou know what I mean so it's a kind of what I'm saying is a constant battle to control this into the call\nAnd then that eat in a row favorite dinner eating at the wrong time you know what I mean so it's a kind of what I'm saying is a constant battle to control this is that they called it human if at the end of that but I no doubt you know what I mean no doubt that that's all I wanted to throw in the car and also let me ask you the to the humor rely brother and I got\nHim again any place in the script you with God says his own name or this what people say God said in the\n... I mean you know God I got a whole different names I don't deny that I don't know about it I don't even know to that end up in the yard with a hole in your in laws anyone would all law\nLoves their W I say my name is ...

John what I [noise]\nHey Russia and I love rather yes base you know or even love Robin\nI wanted to I'm Talking to you briefly about the purging up that record here in the state of Georgia a dead Google that information and over the past eight years\nOr two thousand eight actually that had been about eight thousand uh boulders eight million voters I'm Sorry\nIt had been Cory ... from the ... and between a two thousand eight and two thousand six team\nHas been almost six teammate and focus and there were nine states that have been class has racist states that they have to clear it with the federal government so they could hurt people from the voter rolls so this is an old practice\nWas well it's a it's a very old practice and remember because of the Supreme Court gutting a key provision of the civil rights act which basically say you must get pre clearance from\nThe department of justice before transforming your election rules because that was got it and there was no\nWhich basically said you must get pre clearance from the department of justice before transforming your election rules because that was good it and there was no longer a need for pre clearance things like this can happen when they happen however\nThe response has to be quick you have to get this in front of a judge immediately because the deal Jay has no authority to block it before it happens as they used to\nYeah that's a clear and that means that we cannot stumble nah sweet owns this let's get out the vote people let's get people to read that challenge to all of a you're listening to talk to at least ten people and get it at least\nOf them to register and vote if they already registered voters encouraged him to vote please\nRead your brother appreciate your calling for my car Yes sir thank you John for zero for eight now too to seven zero three Stacey Abrams campaign they are demanding demanding\nBrian Kemp to resign he is the secretary of state and currently gubernatorial candidate now some people have an issue with him overseeing an election that he's involved in so let's put this in proper context he's actually overseeing multiple electrodes\nThat he's been involved in he oversaw his election of secretary secretary of state when he was re elected he oversaw his election running in the Republican primary now\nThere were some Democrats who resigned\nWhen running for a different office max Cleveland resigned from being secretary of state to run for US Senate he released a statement saying listen this guy needs to do what I did now other Democrats did not resign but here's the difference here's the nuance in the conversation\nNone of the other Democrats who was secretary of state had this level of question surrounding their handling of registered voters\nNone of them had this issue the voter purge the fifty three thousand registered who are in limbo none of those questions existed under the leadership so there's a level of question here that's unprecedented\nFor zero for eight nine to two seven zero three do you think camp should step down\nAnd if he steps down would actually make a difference is this for the optics\nNow say just for CBS forty six news on friday last friday\nThat this is a win for states to able to no matter what let's say you can't get the fifty three thousand people register fully okay you can't get them registered fully but we're talking about it on the news on radio CNN just did a segment on it\nIt is creating a national conversation about fairness in the state of Georgia what happens when a political campaigns make national news well typically you get national money\nPeople from other states started making contributions because they feel as if you're being treated unfairly the Democratic process is not working properly in addition to that the fifty three thousand people who are in limbo\nIs Brett how light beer Kavanaugh that's how we have ever known white female voter the Georgia are sticking with the Republican Party they're sticking with it let's go to Daryl in Atlanta Gayle good they welcome\nHello hello I'm calling because I feel that the minority vote\nBlack and Hispanic as well is a big unknown in the election because you're not old at the level that some of the art of elation is poll\nFound because of mistrust secondly because we don't want to write it down there and look at it but they don't really know what the turnout than going to be African American they try to factor and they don't know\nI agree with you one hundred percent as a matter of fact I said this on the news I think the polling data is low but minority participation for example in the last poll scientific poll that was done they assume that twenty nine percent of black people were participate how ever when Jason Carter ran for governor he had thirty percent\nAfrican American participation thirty and he was a white male candidates\nI think Stacey Abrams actually go beyond thirty percent she may hit up to thirty two percent in that column if she does that then that coupled with\nA fifty two fifty three percent female resident fifty one percent if she does fifty two fifty three\nDoes that then that coupled with a fifty two fifty three percent female rather than if they'd be the one percent if she does fifty two fifty three percent female thirty two percent thirty three percent African American she wins the election bottom line\n... yeah I agree thank you for your call thank you\nFor zero for eight now too to seven zero three let's go to flavor king color from slave withdrawn are left to la

I Do not tell them to denounce being a gangster let me tell you why don't do that let me tell you why don't do that I'm listening\nBecause bill clubs and affiliations all across this country and nobody would tell that person to denounce their affiliation what I Do is I showed them good habits to pick up\nSee all new radio dot com that is available now it's a totally new experience that was listening at your fingertips we made it easier than ever to access the radio stations you love now will save your favorite stations and\nOthers to you based on you listen to the news and information you rely on even when you are near radio you can take this station when you're on the go\nDownload the all news radio John John map on your smartphone\nFor any way [noise]\nIs a reflection of real experience yeah and I think these young brothers young sisters\nAre speaking or singing are wrapping from a point of view that they had to win counted themselves so if ... if you transform that reality I think you transform a lot of ... the reason why ... was different job is because you didn't have those experiences\nRight I understand that and I'm and I'm not arguing that what I what I'm saying to just because someone has an experience that negative experiences I'm positive expansion right I don't\nWant okay now watching on the job is your heart yeah listen to a T I apple listen to the whole album here's what you are going to find you're going to find half of the songs are purely about the reflection of his social environment and the other half of the songs called don't be a fool stay in school\nThis is what the stays on his own album don't that don't Davis a trick he says that in his own album but if you listen to the album you get both of those messages\nYeah yeah and that's that's that's also the dilemma that we've we've we give we given these given our young people to different messages confusing the hell out of\nI don't think that's two different messages when you when you actually listen to it in the context that it said how many albums have you listen to all the way through\nAh probably one of ... out probably of fall apart and they let me in\nThe hold on before you go to your point because I Need to clarify and our challenge people\nListen to an entire tea I Am I don't care which one you choose listening to it when he's talking about being in the game\nHe's talking about past tense when he's talking about what he does not flipping houses companies businesses he's talking about present tense he's also talking about what it takes the transit he has a whole song about how to transition out the dough game\nAnd I agree with that but I'm not disputing that I'm I'm with you I'm with you as far as the odds progression but I think that had had somebody not approach tea or\nA or whatever experiences or whatever people came and approached the er about that method though that realm that he came from the safety or let's make a move a transition from there they are here and as a matter of fact our limit their average place up there last week on the show you said if I knew\nThat that are being good or doing something\nWould get this resolved I Would have did that in the beginning you\nRemember yeah I think I say living right yeah because when I was a teenager I didn't understand the contract\nRight right so so what we're saying is that they're they're living right message right can still bring about the Seine\nAudrey where result Adrian end at the same time\nJohn these brothers have a journey just like I had a journey and yes I feel that it would be ... to grow yeah if I decided to create an us in them mentality at this stage of the game\nI don't think I don't think we want you to create that I think we want you to stay connected up there and I agree with you because if you don't stay connected with people you can't talk to them but what I Do want what I what I what I Want to to to ah basically\nSee I'm forced to understand historically they've never this is we we're we're we're we're grabbing onto this like this is a natural thing that it that if you have\nSure thing that that is just have to happen gangster rap and that type of music just came about twenty Thirty years ago Twenty years ago it's not it's not\nSomething that they've been with African since they got off the ship\nNo it wasn't one that that's a misconception a biggie smalls a rest in peace he broke it down because he said they call the gangster rap we don't call the gangster rap\nHe said the truth is gangsters eating halal to jail that's where the man said during the interview he said this is a reflection of our culture were rapping about our experiences so you can call it a gangster rap he said but the these on banks has gangsters of being gangsters did not wrapping so he wrote that thing down that's what they called\nIt a little less than ... [laughter]\nI agree I agree with big as a sense of what a great ... the culture is doing and it's not it's not gangster rap is just what their reality isn't and we have a thing and and humanity when we want to classify everything and we really restricted when we do so\nBecause let's say which he puts out a song about\nAbout the United states of America a home of the free when he put out there so that was a positive song is that still trapped music no it's not it's not even close to trap music ... but he will always be known as a trap music style\nWell I think I think he'll grow out of that because I think more of us appreciate the phone today than we did before and I think they let me say this about Kanye because Conyers problem in the ... intellect Conyers problem is Donald Trump\nTime do you find that got on this issue because of his association and his so called love and auto a admiration and and try and trying to throw Donald Trump on us when we know Donald Trump is not good for\nNo one questions ... uh intellect he said he had a mental problem which he has a slight mental problems but his answer like and like I said oh we admire we respect but when he tried to throw\nDonald Trump on us like he's something good that's why they're getting all this kick back on it wasn't getting a kick back until they basically jumped into this madness what Donald Trump\nYou understand what I'm saying with the uh we'll forty five yeah but you know\nThat that's how I feel about that for us laws Tanya is with her and also I don't think flavor king is also saying that a black skin like that crime was attributed\nThat's why you have to be careful how you word it brother you know I'm big on what I'm trying to help it out I'm I Know a new context but he did not provide yet but I Do what you're saying\nThat there is a real issue in certain categories but let's be clear\nIt's not because people are black is more so about socioeconomic patterns that exist in those communities that still must be addressed because there's in Fayette County there's a trailer park of white people have been set foot in his trailer park you know what I saw when I Walk through the trailer park I sold dope mad I saw I saw syringes\nAnd also some poor people and they had an elevated crime rate in this one community why because of the social economic reality not because of them being white\nRight and I agree with that one hundred percent of all I'm a whiz than is that they got a problem\nWe got some problems I think I Would rather like you say was my hundred percent effort I'm trying to solve our problem they got all the resources they need to remedy that situation and that fell apart refrigerator the forty a all white people don't do that that's on now but we have to try to do the best we could try to live with the ... the issue and our problem in our community\nThank you brother appreciate your call bankruptcy for zero for eight nine to two seven zero to read you still getting where it was a real is man or radio news until Thirteen eighty W.
