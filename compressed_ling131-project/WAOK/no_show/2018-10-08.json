but are you a ... a cemetery where that whatever whatever right guy did ... did a study on\nThe ... say that again\nIt was out in which they did was I think it was the dog to what the cemetery where they were when what they what they are we\nTalking about Camilla Camilla right\nIt was a good report thank you thank but at St Louis I never heard to tell him that we don't care about being buried with white folk and use a new CEO\nWell I never heard to tell him that we don't care about being buried with white folk and use a new system but don't don't fight against their head they had put in little to keep black folks that once I Am white but was another guy\nI wanted you to kill him they shoot painted black\nCool we don't care about being the way we\nCan let me help you understand that wasn't the point but you know and say here's why hold up here's one or one that never wants to point the point was this was a city on cemetery which meant that the Seventy percent of black residents were paying for all\nOf the cemetery grounds number one number to\nWrite the city this was a city owned cemetery so the ... right the Seventy percent of African American population was paying for the whole cemetery in addition to that the fence that separated the white side and the blacks out if you look at my documentary which is on peach tree television and CBS forty six news\nThe documentary clearly shows that the black side of the cemetery is not kept it all\nIs a dilapidated falling apart or the tombstones are broken and and the white side as well maintain however once again Seventy percent of the black folks that are who are paying taxes are paying to up to the white side but they're not of keeping the blacks and so that was the issue\nAnd find him would disrespecting the court\nWould you had no problem disrespecting the u._s. than it\nIs obvious you drink beer sir\nFor the role for you know to to seven zero three I got carried in Riverdale tearing good they welcome\n... how are you great Karen how are you Happy Friday to let me turn my radio down okay so\nI think really that he is not going to be confirmed I don't think it I don't see it happening\nYou think the women the female Republican or maybe Jeff Flake\nThose women those women Republican senators are not going to be able to confirm they're not going to be able to vote yes they had a\nWhole of attorneys go see one of them yesterday and these were attorneys across the aisle democratic and Republican ... a tiny female attorney came to office I think in um they said it was so many of them they had the scheduling into different meeting\n'em and they had\nClosed door sessions with her I think this was the one is Alaska and they told her\nThat if she votes no then they got her for her election she cannot afford to go in there and not and not um adhere to their command and enter and they are demanding their suggestions on this situation she definitely the one and I laugh that she's not going to vote yet I don't see it happening and\nUm can you still hear me we're yes okay\nSo and the other thing is I think that more than anything\nYou've got to look at the whole\nThe whole situation the big picture of this one lady vote this women vote 'em it's just devastating for the Republicans for them to put this guy in that office it's not going to happen for them even the ones that were like Lindsey Graham and the rest of 'em and Lindsey Graham said something last week and I thought was very telling he said that this vote\nIs not how you vote the vault determines how what their future is going to be like in the Senate\nLike they already know that whatever they however they vote that's what their constituency is going to look at as to end the permanent whether or not they get reelected and they'd have downsize the woman vote so much the old white\nI'm Republican an aunt that they don't see the value of it did you see that I'm clear on the other senator that within the elevator not on flight but the other one no um\nWhere he told the told the girl the ... the woman to grow up and he wages than ever like get out of\nMind you know I ... yeah yes I saw that and there was another incident afterwards it was really an infant and it was Mitch McConnell basically defending that US Senator saying all of these people who to remind people my members or we will not be swayed\nRight yeah they don't they don't they don't understand that they don't appreciate the magnitude of this situation it's going to really\nThey don't appreciate your ... they don't like the ... they really don't watch it\nAnd I the last thing I Want to say 'cause I Know you have a lot of college but the other dangerous piece of this that people don't understand is if you keep moving\nThe last thing I Want to say 'cause I Know you have a lot of college but the other dangerous piece of this that people don't understand it if you keep moving\nThe bar as to what our laws are you we're gonna end up in a situation consequences of that ... is that we don't have a society that that well since you don't follow the laws I don't have to follow the law exam you you cannot\nThat this is a very dangerous place for me because you cannot keep moving that scale over to fit what's right for you when these laws of what we've used stuff by you know to keep law in this country right now if you if it's good for you to say\nI don't want to do it and I'm not going to do it and I can do it this way then the rest of the world is like the rest of the country will do it as well so I'm hoping that we get this right\nThank you thank you so much for taking my call I appreciate\nIt I appreciate your call I've said this many times and fractions only as strong as enforcement\nIf someone commits an infraction\nNothing will happen to that person if there's no real to enforce the rule of law\nSo what you write\nAs policy protocol or law means absolutely nothing without men and women who are in place\nTo enforce it\nAnd willing to do so the infraction is only as strong as enforcement for zero for eight nine to two seven zero three let's go to get again in Atlanta Gideon good they welcome\nTo

and my ancestors and then we are online called then after I called in and show clearly that it is a raw when they talked about all the NBA created equal and use it it\nJust so I don't disagree with any of that I've also said that the constitution the founders the frame of state and write the constitution for people that look like you or not this was not a country founded on the principles of democracy this was a country founded on founded on the principles principles of rich white\nManager rule the world that's why you wore a white man\nWho own property you were the only person who could actually both white made that did not own property couldn't even do you have to own property you had to be influential affluent rich that's what they want it so it wasn't written as a democracy it was

ought to be ashamed of themselves\nWhat people were very clear that they would not voting their conscience they were voting politics\nWhat they were really doing this place in their concerns are\nAbout maintaining the status quo as far as black people are concerned they needed someone who was ultra conservative on the court to make sure that no laws no policies are passed into law that will empower black people\nIf you're looking at is you know the kind of way you know that's so new I'm just giving you the real\nAnd I always do that I don't put no I don't put no fancy political spin

a with forty five he's just he's just a mouthpiece for it all that's McConnell and the rest of those they they load those are some lowdown refrigerators bra you know 'cause that whole thing was they would not allow Obama to appoint\nA judge but they open it up and they tried to appoint as many as possible in the same person is holding the strings to that and that's Mitch McConnell he's no good low budget slowed down a politician\nOr if you will or what is what they're doing is they are promulgated white folks the gender conservative white folks agenda you know and that's what it is and that agenda is to make sure that they children's children can't continue\nOr to uh to rain and told lord over black people and people of color as we become and have become the majority in this country they

and we are processing then is killing us right\nIt kills us particularly when we don't respond to it so I get it out [laughter] that's right I Am I going to kill me [laughter] I like you are not going

you have another another car let me say it quite focusing on the right walk or ride reckless over\nRight that was funny I Can't remember when I was one way or the brother that talking that traveled\nA lot I Can't think of his name to mount a mile mile run a mile when you're out of it I'll go yeah uh-huh\n... ran away I see some of us who grew up\nWith our elders Kevin as the truth about these people right well we have this fan waiting with them and we know what the what you can read don't trust them\nSo we already knew that they read the new because when you have some people that are still in power for a few well each flight left over hot less if women are not going to do anything when it comes to ...\nThat you wouldn't refer to me that like that going forward and um but you check me out check my record Mm yeah 'cause I don't I don't I don't ...\nThe thing when I hear people say in my ... when I hear people say let's go let's pull up on when you shoot back out of that stuff it's been plenty of reasons to stop ... right we can name to memorize\nGardening I mean I mean Trayvon Martin we get we we will do pot we should have ... we got plenty of reasons are we\nGoing to go go go go go to Martin Luther king junior some of their views on pop if you're gonna be all that and do all that and you know you know good and will you just talking right you know what I'm saying so don't be trying to dump that I'm excrement all phone me I'm the one\nI just I just would be waiting for them to lead the charge you know what I'm saying why is this your plan lead the charge here jumping off door Nellie is done and given that much credit when he said there are other\nThan because of sound fun anyway for [laughter]\nFor for a nine to two seven zero three is the number is a magnificent ... millennial Monday in the studio with me elders Washington this is what I wanted to do a brother a yes or I won't talk to 'em about the millennial response\nTo the nomination and the\nApproval of Brett Kavanaugh 'cause I'm going to be they\nMhm right what job won't have to live through this and live with the outcome of the policies that are going to be implemented in promulgated by a Supreme Court that has a five to four\nI'm a five to four majority for conservatives right so lab and that's going to get us today crow is is my way of yeah\nSo what ... what millennials how shall millennials response\nYou know as a first of all you know what I hear when I'm Talking to a lot of my\nPeers are they're definitely wasn't a surprise when he came through ... and no one felt like oh my God I agree with you because it isn't a surprise is not something that will do will ... is what it is you should call it out it is wrong it shouldn't be right but I think wasn't it said in a day is\nThere has to be a re education of what this political process is to my generation in my opinion uh I Know that ... see back in the day they used to have the CBP programs citizen education program\nAnd that program was religious teaching black people how to be a first class citizen everything from elementary knowledge to local state and federal government or knowledge about the constitution knowledge about politics and how it works I don't think that\nHas ever been broke down to my generation so especially I just take it to a local Atlanta area ... you know my generation we we hear about the great Maynard Jackson but we don't know what that feel like we don't know what I feel like they have admitted you're going to stand up and go super ...\nLike you know we got Kesha\nAnd you know I Know there's a lot of accused the lover but anybody that has any uh inkling of knowledge you know it's not the same thing so we haven't seen\nPolitics go unapologetically heart for us in ... and I think the reason why is because we don't understand really had a political process work and what it should be doing for us so if you don't understand how can you really hold somebody accountable I mean Ashley from\nAnd this is my seemed like a dumb question but it wouldn't be the first non ... okay All right um\nDo you think the growing up with eight years of Obama as president kind of threw y'all off into thinking that the world was fair and equal ... equal opportunity like every other American citizen do you think that might have\nSo it ... I think it all it's all on your\nAge bracket where you fall in this millennial thing because so I I I I remember Bush I remember Bush winning or\nA his second term and it was the first time yeah I remember that and again I wasn't raised in a conscious how so like I think for the majority of my generation and we've already has been raised that\nYou know this racism thing is over\nYou know we have a fair where I think we always been raised that were brought to light that took off the veil in my opinion was social media\nAnd social media Trayvon Martin was the first\nSocial media thing that really just popped off where we no longer needed CNN to tell us what's going on I can look at a hash tag and see what's really happening in the streets right if you really want to know what was going on the first thing you didn't go to the news\nEither when Facebook Live right and they were showing us live an edited ... information so what happened before social media\nI Would experience something and they'll be like oh that's an isolated event\nRight Brian ... the social media shows like well do the same so I listen to this happening all over the world right so I think yeah we were and then I think when Obama came in we were like oh hope hope and see if we do and then\nIt went from ... like they got a society vote vote vote because he's black black black and they want to get an office and you like to listen to go ... ... people was like well you know that not everybody recognizes like other areas of everybody so we like day so you know we didn't want to heart because it may black\nYou know ... so I ... I'm a person of color [laughter]\nSo [noise] so life as we all I feel like a millennials\nHave always been cheated of their blackness food while we've been we've been cheated on that even even today and we really want to have a real only got ...\nYou know and we don't do it on the suffering we come back okay All right\nAnd we will bring in some of these promises were former forty nine to two seven zero three is the number you out I'm getting ready to bring through college and we don't do rapidly because a lot of folks from holding 'em so y'all stay true don't leave me I'd be like when I get back from one of the story called the movement to say to the [noise]\nYou got Fifteen minutes statistically were total [noise]\nAt least I've been reading one where we can win money money [laughter]\nSome way to do\nIn some way to do or something or will lose alright alright [noise]\nAnyway which will begin to move you know hey\nThis is a girl can really be on a dance me when I'm at home in Atlanta Georgia I hang out with my voice Dr King laughter on news and talk radio Thirteen eighty eight year old kid\nGoes for duty of a new tree or news in the eighties we are you OK\n\nI'm Richard Harris with your traffic update this report is sponsored by X urging that earlier crash on I eighty five north down just that's what shows that is now clear you should be good to go in that area\nAlso that earlier accident in Cobb County I two eighty by north down just before cell ... drive that is now on the right shoulder however delays were made in that area we're getting reports of a few new crashes do\nBoth of them indicated county the first one and north drew it heals road westbound it black ... east of Claremont wrote that is in the left lane and the second crashes blocking the left lane a tractor trailer involved in that when I to eighty five east bound\nAs ... wrote candle road knowing when it's the flu can make a big difference in knowing when to call your doctor the best way to tell us that the blue brings a fever there'll be prepared with a thermometer you can trust the egg surgeon typical scanner back by more than Seventy clinical studies I'm Lucia Harris on news and talk Thirteen eighty W A L K [noise]\nHuge savings on new and previously leads furnishings Beth Wright huge savings court furniture Clarence center choose from a wide variety of new and previously in these furniture and acorn for your home run off and you'll find so folks from one Ninety nine Ninety nine and more\nEverything in our nine thousand square foot she'll run its course started by guaranteed and in stocks ready for delivery or to take on today that are handling course furniture if they're in center at one three nine for six ...

our energy into these young folks\nI mean I'm at maximum Mm and maximum because now he's you know people all around the world ... you have people all over the world that are listening to all of them you know and then they asked him to all of a song ... and we have we have made of communication with other people around this world and how they\nHandle in it that's interesting that you say that because it speaks to\nBut you know we get caught up in conversations about the tangible or about that which we can grab a hold of him many times we missed a conversations about the transcendent about that which is above what we can automatically just grab a hold of\nA hat and because there is at work\nSome spiritual stuff going that route spiritual stuff happening yeah now as well and it ain't all in in in contrary to what people might think it ain't all about money and then all of our resources and that's the thing that we got the help of our young people to see\nA because what what we know how how our generation messed up is what we made them think of that yeah it is all about money if you get money then it's going to be ... you get your quality well money does not does not uh quite to the quality\nOf what money does is just give you more options are to be able to purchase um\nResources in purchasing and then that's the thing if you're going to use the money that you get just to consume and then it don't they don't have enough money is tight here's why this is why are you going to do is give it to white folks right but it's ridiculous yeah sorry\nYou're absolutely right you don't watch the thickest fall on in this world right now\nWhat's that yeah that hot man yeah hip hop the biggest what now the big as well room for Oh yes yes and no doubt when they get bigger states

Wish I could play I play a a a rabid revenge I Wish I could play rabid revenge for you or is\nThat about camaraderie plus all the way it is but what I what I'm saying well what I wanted to say is the

to you were talking about a ... Martin Luther king in the city in the um our responsibility as soon as they say that but I don't know this much different than the million millennials enough except the fact that the community base\nIs not there and it's not that commitment right and when you ... it when you're talking about the books about the music we had this community music to have this one crack\nBut we didn't have music that talk about dying or or you know body or hurt nobody really the only things I heard on that was a shooting before he rode shotgun and that was kind of a crazy thing\n[laughter] you know the economy going again though [laughter]\n[laughter] but you know just don't have snow and you talk about\nWhen you're talking about voting we can't vote no less we also know the issues and ... and when you look at the three things that have two things that has impacted our community says twenty Thirteen I'm going to tell you a quick\nWar long 'cause I got over ... only one\nSecond okay Mara you had a lot of horse that used to have at Fulton County and you have three representatives\nNow they just going to have war you have the new law brandy that I'm used to have a dedicated the for the mayor of Atlanta the c._e._o. and the thing of the cast and the board of commissioner or for the county and now we're not going to have any now how did that happen\nIt happened because we didn't vote right\nAnd I think I think that's why I say that citizen education program so important and that's why I Need that still\nDid get his soldiers in line and just started again about to become a Charles do you know suddenly you'll see the president's direct you know presidents do yeah I but what I'm saying is the reason why so important because you telling us vote vote vote vote none of millennials to go vote right now with our knowledge base is like saying they'll ... they'll cranked up the car so it turns out the car\nWhere do we go we voting Kesha what do we hold her account offered her we vote and Stacey Abrams what is the governor really going to do to us and you might think that public knowledge but you don't know what you don't know and I'll take you need to know\nWhat I'm Sorry all you have to know about states a broom is Brian Kemp\nThat's all you got to not disagree that's all I just do your own so you know I ...

significant concern over the speed of the confirmation hearing of Brett Kavanaugh however\nEven if the ab ate the American bar association decided to do this bar Brett Kavanaugh it would not affect his standing as a U.S Supreme Court justice and here's why the United States Constitution does not make it a prerequisite\nThat you have a law degree or even officially\nTrained in the law in order to become a Supreme Court justice what the constitution was developed the Supreme Court was created to be a citizen lead to court so there was no actual requirement for you to have legal training in order to sit on the Supreme Court\nNone whatsoever\nFor zero for not to to seven zero three and I know some people say well wow that's\nThat's pretty crazy well let me think what else is crazy you don't need to have a law degree to be a judge in a lot of counties in the state of Georgia Washington County to name one there are few more you don't have to possess a law degree to be a judge\nProbate judge magistrate judge now some counties set the rules differently for the galley sets a different way you do have to possess a law degree has to be a good standing with the Georgia bar association and they'd be a but\nThere are many counties in this state where you do not have to possess a law degree in order to be a judge for zero for eight nine to two seven zero three\nMy good friend is on the line job easily or ...\nSome of those are great uh uh I wanted to chime in on the amount of uh Columbus Day or there's no question laws\nBut are you familiar with Dr not discovered which uh\nIs your father oh oh oh ... the search\nFor too long for me that's just the and the thing that was discovered that the people are not Christian but they were either\nUh so therefore they can sell though one and then and it takes to laugh\nAnd that's how a third of them are ... are based on some of the Vatican\nYeah I Am familiar with the doctor know discovery and actually I'm back in two thousand and Thirteen the Catholic Church decided to denounce it\nUm however damage did had long been done I mean that's just words but right the doctrinal discovery um which was a promoted and and um [noise] and distributed by the pope by the pope for people who are not have the same fate\nYeah well there's nothing or about a a Catholic Church or something for my future\nSo let's go back to oh excuse me\n\nLet's go back to two thousand and Thirteen\nOkay\nYou are correct the ... the Catholic Church decided to come short of actually re chanting the discovery doctoring you are right\nAnd it gave gave word to it but they would not go as far as to say they recanted or they did say things like uh we didn't have the right of title to the land but they did not recant the actual practice you are correct\nYes it is a print touch right well let's say a million for long rows of Asia right from you're still active for the game because it's just\nA matter of ah I live in North Dakota is based on a dock cover show or they're sent a somehow we have to focus on some of the things I was still\nLet me ask you this ah Mr measly because used you travel you not falling on social media I consider to be a mentor you traveled extensively why would the Catholic Church\nBasically say everything that were saying they were wrong they didn't have the right to do what they did a it displaced people are illegally or a morally but then one simply say and we can't the practice of doing why when they go that far to say that\nWell you know the manager for may indigenous people of America throughout America was killed in the name of Christ right and a shutdown devote situation uh\nUh so I think that somehow and the travel you're among the lawyer Congo\nAs a thought wow yeah uh but anyway I don't think we are again for for decades less than that and that St Paul I have had a high uh celebrate a major\nAmen to that I celebrate with you thank you so I appreciate your call Roger\nThat's missed the Beasley not job ease with stays in the international streets you gotta understand job easily basically does not live in America anymore\nJust as Mitt Romney and others and he has a roof on that\nMyself but go ahead I'm listening [laughter] yeah\nSo those are just a couple of the things that stick out to me about Brett Kavanaugh and his record as a as a federal judge and some of the other issues are my new show I I don't care as much about 'em but is big when you can't\nSeparate your political bias and conservative agenda inside of the court of law and that is what scares me about him as a justice is that he's completely partisan without the ability to swing\nIf you can swing vote that means that you're actually looking at the law and you're trying to look at it from the legal standpoint rather than understanding every interpretation of the constitution from a political buys\nI'm fairly confident the guy's going to be de than I Am going I it hadn't said this on the air I Am going to take the time out to at least look in the somewhere between three and five of the cases they judged on his previously now vacated seat so maybe maybe on this something out of soon to know all that there is to know\nThat there is to know but I think he's more like Kennedy hit me All right\nNow what makes you think he's more like Kennedy\nHe clerked we Kennedy Kennedy Kennedy was Kennedy was favorable of him\nSome reports that Iran as far as I'm being a possible selection and I've I've heard him speak before I've heard him speak on things separate from court separate from court issues I Know some people that\nThat he taught and I kind of thinking I get the feeling that he's more light like right there where Kennedy is but I you know\nMy ... but there was nothing to his judicial record that would indicate he's anything like a Kennedy as a matter of fact there are other cases so you know the Hobby Lobby case was a was what we will call the religious liberty case that's true okay he has sided\nOwned the religious liberties I basically saying that if you have any particular faith and you work in private corporate America your faith can be protected to the degree of you being allowed to discriminate against another person\nHe has rude universally for those inserting the religious right or religious affiliation in order to change how they can be allowed to discriminate against other people not knowing the Hobby Lobby case\nWe wouldn't call that discrimination traditionally but it is discrimination is discrimination against females because males cannot be included in that group it's discrimination against females and then is restricting of what the females can actually have access to\nWasn't a Hobby Lobby case primarily focused and all female um contraceptives\nDirect woman and whatnot but by\nVirtue of that to say that a company can do this one thing against women and I understand your point your point is it can't be for men to granted that means\nThat the court should have never gotten involved in creating a cavity out for the law through case law but Kavanaugh decided to stand against women to stand against in my opinion common sense and it's a stand against or many of the Supreme Court justices we currently have\nA really wasn't standing against women as much as it was standing against some some policy that would would help somebody in ways that weren't even really directly directly related to their job or their ability to get insurance to get it on their own in the first place\nI don't think I was really standing against when I get the impression that this do and that's why I said like Kennedy\nHe's somebody he's Kennedy was like a strict constitutional is and I get the impression that Kavanaugh is too and in that regard there's a lot of room for him to do the right thing when the right thing is available to be done and a little bit of room for him to do the wrong thing just to just to be rich\nFollowing me okay so I'm I'm not convinced but I'm gonna look I I'm just not going out and I'm just not going to do\nThem and I want you to do this is where because of being on the appellate he's actually has some dissent\nArguments there was one or two thousand and Fifteen even though this did not go into the ruling because he himself was not in the majority if you go to is a case called priest for life

very good relationship with the governor has any type of negotiations get get 'em get acne ... how do they upheld agreement with that a lot of public know in that when I hear\nYou I don't know what to

his wife said when you say the public was on the where that is subjective\nWell okay but we know cause you know you being a human being you know knowledgeable about it you know that the majority of citizens did not know\nYeah I agree and that's why we that's why we work to make sure people knew about it and it just in that they held town hall meetings they had email blast they had digital advertisement on social media they talked about it they're still talking about it we talked about it before it happened we talked about it after it happened we're talking about it now\nWell until you

R. G. KP unlimited that orgy during the commercial break\nYour Julia and\nTheir producer was asking questions about credit repair because it does seem to be an intimidating complex back and forth you don't really know exactly what they're looking for you gave him some pretty straightforward information if you could share some of that information on air I greatly appreciate it\nAbsolutely my finance company which is conquer consulting and go to conquer worldwide dot com and uh we do about ten eleven million dollars a year in the Capitol people who want to start a business but they need money they don't need a million dollars many maybe they need thirty thousand or fifty thousand but we can't help brothers if they don't have a decent credit score\nSo what I advise brothers is number one stop creating new debt step opening a retail accounts like Macy's and ... you know don't don't do that this is what you should do you should\nOpen up maybe an open sky or account got open sky dot com and get a secure card maybe put a hundred dollars on their ... and keep it use it during the month and keep it below thirty dollars because your cycle score is based on how well you manage the money you have right now the credit you have right\nNow explained psycho score as opposed to the all the credit agencies\nIs the um it's a scoring formula\nAnd is based on you how well you pay your bills to pay him one time or when do you pay them or the amount of credit you have right now and your credit history all that makes up your cycle scoring right and it can be subjective\nMhm uh but there is a formula that says that based upon if you have a credit card right now if you keep it below thirty percent is going to make it rise up or if you keep it above thirty percent is going to decrease is pretty simple from um but you also have to know when\nAnd so our job is just to increase the net worth of these men\nSo they can become leaders of their families and the community so they can give money to political leaders and our spiritual leader so we can start making a difference but if you don't own anything your voice is going to be extremely limited and so we're trying to put men in position we are putting minute physician\nThrough this program of learning about four acts and how to have a one page business plan have a eight hundred and fifty credit score and how to trade in a forest market and so we're giving this education away so that men can rise up work together and make an impact that cannot be erased\nWhat's the benefit to ... and ...\nThe biggest benefit is that as I said is having a relationship with someone a cook in a help you number one when I was going through a difficult a financial situation\nOr it didn't last that long because I could make a call ... to another brother who was in ... so the relationship is number one the second thing is the empowerment what is it that you need you know we sit down with you almost like a like a counselor and we ... we
