W E okay but I have a clip\nOf Trump saying I think he was interviewing with Sean Hannity or somebody on Fox News I remember Fox News on the safe place of all things bigoted so he was on Fox News\nAnd he was saying that Congress may has has great respect in the African American community he has a lot of followers in the black community and and this guy likes me\nThat's the way it was basically saying so why was ... at the White House because according to a Trump Card Jay has a lot of black followers well why does that matter right now because of a little something called the midterm election now he's oh blame used to the fact that we've been\nPut continued to reserve category like he's on the bench at the moment he's not really an active player on the court as it relates to the black community in that sense but remember this is the same guy who went on national TV and said President George W. Bush doesn't like black people\nI Know people disagree with him doing that\nBut remember he was speaking to a collective frustration belt by many black folks who went through that hurricane and they felt as if they were being treated like second\nClass citizen he created a personification in that moment of their collective frustration and he was kind of gay\nAnd he did that and now look at tap dance for this president and not even when the half French just really offends\nFor zero for you not to to seven zero three we got more\nI'll tell you first of all I like him a lot he's been a friend of mine I've known him for a long time is a very different kind of a guy I say that in a positive way but he is a different kind of a guy that those that are in the music business Asian genius\nAnd that's okay with me because as far as I'm concerned he is I Will say this when it came out very strongly a number of months ago something happened my polls whatever like\nTwenty five percent\nNobody's ever seen is like he's got a big following in the African American community a big big following and I think he has in a lot of communities but at the polls went through the roof and I have not seen that\nI think if I can honestly say I've never seen that before to that extent so he is respected and he's right\nThe ones for the roof and I have not seen that\nI think if I can honestly say I've never seen that before to that extent Joe he is respected\nAnd he's really a great guy you know what the what she said ask for anything for himself he's not saying hey gee I Want to do this or that\nIs a private guy and he wants to help people and I think maybe most\nMore than anything is prison reform because his wife who is terrific Kim she is the one that brought the attention to Mrs Johnson where I could look at you as many people like Mrs Johnson that are in jail for another thirty five years\nOld I charge frankly every serious but you know you don't get a life imprisonment because you're talking over a telephone\nI heard your attorney general doesn't want prison reform Jeff Sessions is standing in your ways that inaccurate\nWell if he doesn't he gets overruled by me because I make the decision either does it and\nThat's really interesting so let's dissecting so number one ... is there because he can bring black folks I mean that's what President Trump said he my phone number is all about my numbers just when you're ... you have a strong bond with black people black people\nMid term elections so he's they're being used\nNow because there are some level of mutual respect now because there's an ideology that Trump would like to listen to from ... what was that was kinda got black folks\nWould you really doesn't have Trump is just so out of touch he

Jason good they welcome with ours or Hawaii what up\nAnything goes friday let's get it\nWe got Jason and bucket Jason good they welcome whatsoever John how are you what Jason how are you\nKnow what I'm doing alright listen man I'm all the time in on this kind of a thing and I'm I'm Glad and coming back off who said because I Want to go look the man and I want you to just kind of ride with me I I've been listening to what I was on hold\nA lady that you had in there and she kinda illustrated ally first our ember roles and I don't know if you notice or not and this was kind of what are your producer was getting that number rose jump in and out of blackness\nWindow [laughter] you know and then as I'm researching it on the Internet it seems like that is true yeah right\nBecause she knows that you know those are the community we pretty much shutting everybody she no she can push her agenda and can stretch her fame out for that and also of amber oh is it going to count to be a break because we we forgive and we love everybody you know and you know she knows that\nAnd every road if she wasn't you know didn't have a look 'cause I ain't taking that away from the the pretty girl you know but if she won it didn't have a look she has then she would be no by she\nHas no time with the only thing she does is it glorified ... which is a segue to the next part\nYou know we gotta stop embraced and stuff like that man because it it it the way it manifest itself in our community it leads to you know father listeners broken homes you know kid women should get you know getting pregnant at the slightest behavior that we can't we can't embrace\nThat so let me let me talk about that just for a moment because this was a discussion in my class yesterday on during the Eighteen sixties you had a marriage rate and our community of over Ninety percent\nCorrect okay so I'm Talking about uh don't marriage with children so ... percent but you have to also understand what that meant during the era that means understanding social contact right\nSo the reason why you had the marriage rate of over ... percent is because one women had no rights so women do not have the right to own property women in many cases didn't even have the right to file a divorce period so they were stuck in that relationship so rent it does not\nClearly illustrate the morality of the nation just because of marriage versus non marriage so I don't like it when we conflate\nThe values with the morality of the nation specifically with marriage and using numbers based on historical data because first of all the morality of this country was in question on day one when we decided to own people\nSo that's that's the ... that's questionable and immoral already but but marriage itself served marriage itself\nHas to be understood in the social era of that time\nRight and and and I agree with you know to even further illustrates what you're saying that I agree with that is that I mean you almost we almost had to be married just because for the sake of survival\nRight up there was an economic factor in that as well now there was a protective factor with the family unit all the bad is relevant to that society yes\nRight yeah and ... and this is not even so much so much about marriage because it's more or less it's just about a behavior man that is just that you know that that she celebrates its ... walk and all that I mean it's ... you know one thing but that that's kind of secondary but the young lady began and they're a dime of the\nYou know she count illustrate itself and and now this is why I just want you to ... you know and I wanted to listeners really think about this man in the ... this is this is kind of at the root of all of this stuff with Trump you know it's no secret that Trump has questionable racist things in behavior about him but to sum it definitely racism\nBut here's what I Would challenge you and people\nAnd kill people home man by all the right to be honest with you know people can say well black people can be racist because we don't have the power and you're right but\nAnd by all the right to be honest with you know people can say well black people can be racist 'cause we don't have the power and you're right but truth\nBe told behind closed doors were you talk about everybody we blood or we talk about ... if it's a bunch of folks in the card or what they're illegal we talk about\nHis breakdown first of all let's go back to your premature premises while all races I Do not believe they let me tell you why racism is an actual engagement\nOf an act\nOf power right off the guys that you go so in order to engage in that the structure must have you in control\nAbsolute no no not in control you really can't be races which you can be as big as ... you can definitely be a good job or they don't have the better better turn All right go ahead and\nThen that was illustrated body out later when you asked her if she data entry racially she was like well no because I just don't like them to you in person and you were trying to you know if they were trying to say well wait a minute ... well you know whatever whatever why why why I just don't like well truth be told we all have those bigoted views when it comes to something\nI'm not saying right Robert different I'm not saying that's why I'm not saying that is good but I'm just saying we've got almost ... and I know it's hard to do that because of the history of what we've gone through other people but we've got to almost to this point now we've got to almost be\nAble to say okay we've got to remove the motion and the frustration surrounding that say look okay how can we still drive within ... and what can we do for ourselves to overcome that 'cause I'm gonna tell you there's nothing like come within the bank overcome racism that may not just the ... that's the truth you know\nI'm I Am following I'm I'm a part of you know boards walking and I think that he had it right you know yeah we can talk about all the ills and the justices now agree with that\nAnd again you know you're not my political stand but by the same token also look at baseball practical standpoint and we've got to remove you know can you are going up there and meeting with ... you know ... one of the meat will make meal he went to his trial I don't know whether it could be just a follow up and let me just say that I'll grant you that it is a political move yes he wants to get\nPeople on the side no different than Hillary bring a Jay Z and Beyonce to try to get the black vote I mean everybody played this political politics politics\nBut you know what happens let me say wants a little different with Trump's frog skilled more so than others\nOr he's willing to do it at a higher level than other politicians that is to exploit the individual he's meeting with so when you leave that meeting who really want they know all they really want let let me let me ask you from it let me ask you that this who has really want\nWhen you get exploited by Trump so\nI don't really know see I don't really know anything that's quantifiable that you could say\nOkay well he did or didn't do this I Know they said that he didn't do the H. B. C. U. thing and I you know now\nThey say so he didn't that's that's not an issue of argument that's the statement of fact\nBut let me ask you this question okay do you believe you honestly believe in this day and time that ... access to education being what it is if somebody wants to go you can literally go to school on your phone\nDo you really think that that even if he had that you really think that that's helping a lot of people\nLet me tell you why does help okay federal money that goes into programs like the federal trio program which includes educational talent search then it comes up what bound\nThose programs when put in the hands on H. B. C. use creates a conduit to the local community and that conduit recruits first\n... to seven zero degrees all good though I'm here for zero for you not to do seven zero three\n\nDoes it go to the callers I got I ... a lot of good they welcome\nCookies or there was a lot to remind you ... ... ... ... ...\nFrom day to get that thing you know this last one to kill you got blissful yes ma'am I have a political question for you and I have a free you to give\nA gift for ... for what you would call ...\nOr ... ... like me ever if you buy that too much on please do it would be up to work you file for the rest\nOf your eternity OK okay and what in the digital too that I wanted to ask you questions and I want to share with you I don't know what do you what you do you know about ... the historical like a ...\nAnd I want to share with you I don't know what are you eating meat do you know about ... being the historical lecture on the steering ... million Man March\nSay that again do you speak can is the celebration or the a historical me along the arch ... in like no\nNo I wouldn't miss I get your phone is is breaking enough\nJust to get you know and that is that a hundred\nAnd please Google you can you hear me this man you\nCan you go you know I for a um you know time since the time because I I wanted to ask you what would you would you do in Twenty years ago but I'm going to skip that said that I wanted to say to you can help me\nTo encourage minutes Louis Farrakhan to modify that ...\nI said my Thirteen year old son Twenty years ago he's forty nine now but I Want to modify that plane play it's a political\nInterests meant to be more spiritual form\nCan actually lives in ... you got to be quickness I got all the callers\n[laughter] [noise] [noise] yeah let's see now that we want you to ... when you didn't listen to that video ... ... what's the difference between you and domination and white supremacy alright yep yep good we can't hotel\nFor zero for eight\nNot due to seven zero three John West their job well hey how you doing good how are you\nPretty good let me say this on the\nCompetition with the other radio station yeah the contest hey okay and yourself have already want you know the reality of it is those stations have advertising all over the city yeah\n... ... a okay doesn't have any advertising on buses or anything\nAnd you all are competing you already won irregardless of what happened you've already want them out of an owner and also a maybe a little here to\nManagement away okay yeah I Know we might need to get some bus pitches in modern fishes and therefore it's [laughter]\nI possibly are saying that signal to that's a conversation with you there\nAre there and they also are very well let me let me I I was disturbed by caller you had earlier and he was talking about racism and how we were all racist because you know to be honest sometimes we talk about what\nYou remember that he did modify that one side yeah push back a little bit you know he didn't want to find a\nModified and but you can also do out there that he said something about money cures racism and I was wondering whether or not she remember when Bill Cosby attracted by NBC when Oprah was over in the\nThe uh uh Europe shopping yeah and I said are sold racism operate on different levels you on some summer\nAdrienne how are you completely there are some cases where money\nDid perches white a white person would have received in that situation you looked at the case of O.

later on today so\nLater on today so make sure you you stay tuned after Missouri Alabama or let's get into some I've got five games to watch this weekend five\nI'm ... and yes I Do have a team I hear that has not won a game that I and as I told you guys for the last hour and forty five minutes train wrecks are fun bad car crashes are as long as nobody's dead\nOr severely injured we all rubber neck nice I'm going to tune into one of these games to one specific game tomorrow or even though the the teams collectively\nHave two wins because it's a train wreck and train wrecks are fun to listen to this ah my my football games to make sure you watch the speaking number five Colorado is they take on a U.S see\nA ... you know you look at USC right now or their foreign to\nTheir to losses to Stanford into Texas what what is that for the Texas both have in common they are both ranked\nA you look at ... and I think is I think Helms future depends a lot on what happens later on today or versus Colorado Colorado comes in a rank what nine seats in the country this is Colorado's first true road test\nUm again can Todd helped and pull the upset at home or with us ... is a welcome in Colorado I don't know uh but that is my number five game of the week to watch yes there's not a whole lot on top are coming in at number four\nAgain that I have particular interest in Texas A M goes to Columbia South Carolina to take on the game ... at the upside down cockroach\nI'm doing ... it's actually a and M. finally broke the top twenty five\nTherefore into their two losses Alabama and Clemson\nNot so into law says the sheer protecting them this is the south Carolina game is going to be very very big protects them to see if if they're actually on tracking where some people think they are\nYeah I mean obviously for for ... purposes I Need them to win a because well it makes sense and looked out much better but it'll be interesting to see what happens in South Carolina you know all we heard all off season out of Colombia was\nYou know this was their year they were going to contend with Georgia they were and then all of a sudden they get you know they lose the Georgia and they they ... they had to come back and last week they kicked what the game when he feel go at Missouri was like Fifteen seconds left\nJake Bentley goes from being a first round draft pick to all of a sudden now he's fighting for his job South Carolina is just a mess\nIs jumbo fish are able to get it done at Texas a and M. in his first year not necessarily be that he's not going to beat Alabama or or he's not going to unseat Alabama we know that\nBut they're still looking for a a big win it and not necessarily this will be a big win but to go on the road and the SEC a is a statement for him and would serve touching them a lot of\n... it would help them out tremendously ... is it going to the back half of their season for sure um and you know for South Carolina's opportunity for them to write their ship this is an opportunity for them to to make a statement at home a top when versus a team in the top twenty five right now\nThis could be a confidence booster for them is they go in and they still gets well they already lost Kentucky they already lost the Georgia but you still got other big games coming up a tendency for to a vendor built so you still got some games coming up that that I mean a lot of the season and it starts with this one ...\nNumber three the number three T a game that I've got this week of my top five football games to watch this weekend\n[noise] these two teams have a collective oh two wins between them [noise] yeah\nAbout Nebraska at Northwestern worst starts in in Nebraska history where they owed five or six or northwestern coming off a heartbreaking loss to Michigan there are two and four as I said train wrecks are fun to watch\nI ... I think Scott fosters eventually going to get it done I was clearly wrong on Nebraska though one I didn't realize it they were going to chase out all the talk like twelve quarterbacks from last year\nUm but I think this is going to be a game if there was ever again it was going to be entertaining between\nUh teams that have a combined two wins this is it ... some point in northwestern I mean at some point in Nebraska has to win a game or you don't northwestern had a lot of they had a lot of expectations coming into this year you know a new football operations facility and you're training for ... excuse me new training facility\nTheir expectations coming off of off of last year and to be two and four is not something that they envision happening\nAgain a heartbreaking loss last week to Michigan\nI can they get it you know can they get back in the one calling this week we're seeing the ... of course the ... no wins I thought this is the ... he would have I I don't know eight nine wins I thought they would contend I thought they were going to put up a bigger fight than they have and you know Scott ... is not a guy who likes to lose he didn't lose in college he hasn't lost the coach\nYou know has has a national championship from central Florida\nKelly ... junior or who also worry Supreme sleep on his late last weekend um after the fashion house partnered with Nike was asked to change it might seem equipment personnel manager after running it was an NBA rules violation\nAnd here's what he said he didn't realize because it had the NBA logo and the Nike logo on it he thought it would be okay so apparently you have to have a contract with the team first\nYou know like the uh share care has the hawks then whoever has the Lakers or whatever else it is ah but yeah so long to his how'd you play with tape covering that big ball or brand tattoo\nI Love I talked to man I'm not covered them up or anybody matter of fact I did a good time to ours because I got to get like my sleeve done I got a lot of stuff like that I've done I got to have all my other stuff we done that my sleeve from finished\nThey had really good tattoo artist I'm not somebody I knew somebody that can actually do like cover ups and stuff though they're not not not you know hey man I've been working on my my best friends you know number six months and that's what people okay I Will look let's talk then you're not going to ask you about this radio show\nI fall on the show coming up or what was your back pocket true false will do what's right here and I joined a game night trying to get back on [noise]\nSports radio Nineteen Ninety again have expressed leaps forward slash for special marketing handling force flash dot com\n...

James wants him three times yeah so are we talking socks are we talking tacos for long like\nWhat I'm hitting him like the ... well well the way I pose the question was get to James ones right so big time but that's not me though are hitting\nHim even more um [noise] yes I even got greedy joined us not playing um [noise]\nI I think you you're going to get to James multiple ways I ... and yes I think that they hit him or sat Kim a combined five times as game so I'm going to say true that gets him at least three times\nOkay alright Calvin Ridley we'll have another multiple multiple touchdown game\nI'm so Kevin release actually second in our second or third in the NFL right now in total touchdowns\n[noise] um [noise] look I think he has at least one I don't know if he has two but I'll tell you who does have a touchdown tonight or Sunday who ... who the jumps okay Julio Jones\nWill have this first starts out of the year I think he has a nother monster ... which he's known to do\nSo I think both he and Kevin really a lot of the opposite he says I think they all have one matter of fact I think Mohammed knew joys of fun and I think he hasn't touched on as well so I you know the salad earlier I don't know if you heard it or not but the the falcons have had Thirteen red zone opportunities at home the score to eleven touchdowns in those sorts and opportunities I think they put up a lot of points this weekend\nSeamus twins then he's going to turn the ball over once or twice maybe three times I the magic number was Amos is forty if he thought it was about forty of more times\nTemporarily wins the game that's when we got to be able to stop the run make him throw the football I think you get two and a handful of times I said yes I think the hit him at least three times if not more\nSo I'm going to ask this true false question even though you kind of answered it and then once you you can expand a little bit more on it up there will be a force turnover due to our secondary\nOh we have one [laughter] hey\nWas that was that was the question do as a second there are there are secondary so look I I think that when you look at James\nHe's going to spend up all over at least once most of the time he's going to turn over two or three times that's just who he is the only thing he doesn't feel more turnovers crab legs I ethic\n[laughter] right I I he's going to have some turnovers a Desmond ... will have an interception ... will have an essential so I think we get two of them from him this week or so yeah she's got to the ball over I think our secondary has through those turnovers\nI I think that this is going to be the game that that the falcons finally show up despite the injuries again no grading Jared know devise a Freeman\nUm who else somebody else is out its tack out or ... their Shelby is out there you go so despite those guys may not obviously I on top of the you know count O'Neill Indiana Jones and and\nI'm proud of Ireland Ricardo Allen\nYou got six guys that are out I think guys finally step up this week they do when a home game we improve the two and four\nThey turned James over a couple of times I think the certain secondary has a lot to do with that I and I also think we get pressure upfront\nAll right All right let's see I think I think we will see the falcons team tonight that we've been hoping to see the first five weeks All right I mean some\nSome right yes so All right now go to the running him you know Smith intended Coleman will combine for one hundred and sixty Seventy hours on the ground\nIs he going Ito yeah there we go see Cal Ito sounds like some good food yeah man may have the ... last night and the ... and and you know I'm just saying like it sounds like a good food yeah I'm starving right now by the way\nUm [noise] although I in fact um [laughter]\nBut I combine one sixty seven that would be a really good to underground for this football team given the office of mind I don't know if that's possible and and you look at the diva divine\nThis game has to feature a lot of passing because that's what they don't the bucks do not defend the pass well at all they're liable to give up six hundred yards through the air and not give up but it's on the ground I mean they're very good upfront\nI said I'm going to say no on that one I'll be surprised that the stock inside more than a hundred and fifty yards rushing total and I even think that as a stretch\nUm I I think you're probably closer to the hundred yard mark between the two running backs and met Ryan adding to that\nAll right um do you think I'm Kevin really gets involved in that at all\nIn the Russian game yeah and like that you gave her a couple of years ago yeah no because these are cases not that not that intelligent okay and I don't mean that negatively but there's still a lot that that that seems like he has to learn about the NFL game it and I don't know how comfortable he feels just shut\nA

I think coming you can see that most people expected that to be the Yankees as as you know Boston move on from the July ... they bring in ... you know go on and they do they win a hundred and eight games it is how shocking was what Boston did in jail used\nVery shocking because I I fully expect that the Yankees to do with the red Sox did because they're very young team they had the exciting pieces they didn't go out and spend a lot of it I Know they got drunk all of them but there was it that typical Yankees offseason when they go out and they load up on every single superstar who's ever played the game\nYou hadn't organically you know culture a young roster and that was exciting and that was a team after what we saw that during the playoffs last year\nWas supposed to deal with the red Fox so and the Yankees still had a phenomenal season I mean they ran away they were any other division they would have run away with it so that's how good the red Sox too surprising because\nAdults caught first year manager comes from Houston you know everybody knows his playing days is he going to be able to take over and he got into the pitching staff of the question mark that worked out office of the defense of weight they probably have the American league MVP on their team the red socks that was shocking it was expected that they were going to be good\nBut it's kind of like you know the Braves the aged day just exceeded expectations such a degree that it was really fun to watch that lets the end of the season when maybe they were going to get a hundred and Seventy

off\nYou are thinking okay the brewers they got out they get the victory after the Dodgers are hit the the ... the home run by Machado to make one on the second then after that it looked like this is gonna be the brewers game and the brewers are going to cruise to victory especially in the third and fourth were they going to find one\nAnd you have the bread the rough homerun who's a relief pitcher the third relief picture that had a home run in postseason history you guys are Santana you got brown was RBI singles and for the Dodgers written doll was that disaster\nAnd I know you can get on her show for allowing a home run to a pitcher especially a relief pitcher any pitcher but he did not get help from his defense Gordon Dahl behind the dish was absolutely atrocious\nTo pass balls to errors and a catcher's interference so things are not get off to a pretty start for the LA Dodgers game on\nThe brewers go on to tack on an additional run on a home run they make it six to one and when I'm driving into get ready for the show I'm hearing the announcers on the radio or broadcast say oh the brewers are setting up the bullpen nicely and hate or go deep into the game and they gave me a three innings but they're setting up\nThe bullpen nicely where they could save some arms for the game that would end up coming up later today for game number to excess\nYou had the Dodgers that started to chip away\nAt the sweet and it went from oh the Dodgers are putting the brewers in in a position where now they have to start using some of that bullpen and again that you didn't think they were going to have to ... oh my goodness the Dodgers may actually tie up this game\n'cause in the eighth you get the Machado RBI single Kemp gets a single as well that makes it six four freeze up at the dish he strikes out to end the eighth inning so you go into the nine with some guy that you didn't order they already have to use and you go into the ninth\nAnd the Dodgers then have an opportunity to tied the game where Chris Taylor triples now Lorenzo came should've ended the game I Know it's a tough catch the ball is in the Web of your glove\nAnd you have to catch it even though he was close up

popcorn for me to say but I Will tell you if you're a fan of the brewers and you're in the area\nYou may get some burgers coming your way guys I think we should take a a road trip or hop on a plane and we should be in Milwaukee on Thursday from two to six PM I don't know if you guys saw this story but there is a burger chain out in Wisconsin called\nA George ... and the original owner back in Nineteen forty eight made a prediction the brewers at the time or a minor league team\nAnd he said when the brewers when twelve straight games I'm going to give everyone free burgers so it never ended up happening and so all the way until Nineteen eighty seven where they want twelve games in a row\nAnd they gave out over a hundred and sixty eight thousand hamburgers so the restaurant and selling their new ownership they have continued the tradition and last night the Milwaukee Brewers won twelve games in a row\nThey're planning on giving out\nA hundred and Seventy thousand Parker coming up on Thursday from two to six PM fat ass\nI I that's fine I'll go have a few burgers out\nIn Milwaukee\nLet me ask you this ban Horwitz 'cause I think you will have an astute observation and you know a thing or two about burgers you get fat as they're going to be given out they plan on a hundred and Seventy thousand burgers how many buttons you think they've already ordered\nIf they're giving out a hundred and Seventy thousand burgers then that would be three hundred and forty wall that's three hundred and forty thousand tops and bottoms that would be a hundred and Seventy thousand for one reason on counter tops and bottoms is 'cause I was debating last week was what McDonald's\nDoes not their Big Mac that's right I remember that shoe bottom by [laughter] the now whenever I think burgers I think in terms of the bottom\nYeah that'd be a hundred and Seventy thousand buttons they were around they order two hundred thousand burger button in case in case they screw it up a little too much catch up on a button you never know is it out or maybe in your plan to give it a hundred and Seventy thousand maybe at the end up giving out some more burgers\nWell apparently they're only giving out its limit one per person sure which stinks who eats just one burger I got to be honest it in fast food wise\nYou go to regular wise no you go to a regular Weiner one yeah and one burger right fast foodie you can't just do you want to be fair I don't know the sides of the burger at George even if it's a fast food joint in ain't that big\nBut you gotta order extra bunt because I'm sure their idea of the promotion is yeah we'll give out a bunch of free burgers its good publicity but\nAll the fat asked is out there like Ben James and Zach are going to come in they'll get their free burger and then order another to\nDo things as will end up going you think you'll make the trip because he's been traveling the world that eating a lot they were just in Idaho\nI don't think so ... what's the date that they're doing this Thursday 'cause I Know he's going to Atlanta this we know nomad made out of Milwaukee\nKnow\nBy the way I did you watch the most recent nomad that da ... did it was actually\nThe one at a choice Boise yeah it was great morass by the way reminds me of Peter Griffin and one of the ah [noise] and one of the Clinton there were long as they're walking past actually a tailgate and\nFor some reason there's all these dogs added tailgate and murder has just goes gets a husky take it up [laughter]\nThat's what my headset in the video and all that food right now are you one more thing on the burger trivia how many pounds of beef do you think they've ordered\nOh so it's a hundred and Seventy thousand ... let's do some quick Matt probably about a quarter pound per burger right of the science you have on this so\nI'm going to say seven hundred and cause I'm accounting for a little more burgers seven hundred thirty thousand pounds of beef three hundred thousand so four hundred thousand pounds of beef fat so dancing those are big burgers and now the that's half the fast food burger I give them credit\nSo maybe you only need to give out one person\nNot even then yeah and a half pound before cooking which means it probably goes down to a third pound yeah you you can crush too easy\nYou know one fact about myself by the way a job I had when I was in high school I was a fry cook at five guys that you know that\nNo I didn't but now I really want some fries\nYeah yeah and when you were trained there they taught you to over packed the bag with fries that was\nHow 'bout that over packed ... that's the type of value in my early ... yeah that's how it should be\nWhen we went to orientation you know what they did they showed us how it should be done they had the entire staff there and they said we're going to cook up this\nBill in less than Fifteen minutes and they started the entire staff and less than fifty minutes that's impressive I won't have a chicken breast holds a chicken\nNugget chicken is five guys well of course after you play that sounds route\nI Will have a chicken breast holds a chicken\nYou're not the most petite person in the world you're telling me getting chicken if you've got to find that I don't even know if they have chicken on the ... I don't either\nThis is what I thought it was funny that this is what happens when I'm not in charge of the jobs that is sexual innuendo for those of you out there on their own with over ... down your window in that thanks James way to ruin the\nI Will have a chicken breast faulted chicken [laughter]\nIf there's one thing that we have a thousand drops for Its Food there's fat drops who'd involved in this ... or drop out of all the ones you pick that was probably the worse\nBy the way my first day on the job at five guys they make you it's one of those discussing things you have to clean out the grease traps every few hours because there's so much grease in these burgers I dropped the Greek bucket oh no first day on the job or are you afraid we're going to get fired\nBut everyone's

cubs fan he disappointed he wishes team was in the spotted the brewers are in right now which my simple response was\nThen you shouldn't have under Jim this year and when you add Milwaukee right in front of your face\nYou should have beat them in game one sixty three and then when you watch them and gave one sixty three you should have been able to\nOne of the wild card up against Colorado Rockies but that didn't occur and that's why the cubs have been golfing a little bit sooner than what they thought are a lot sooner than what they thought they would be going into the year so it made me think\nHow many teams this year and the M. O. B.\nDid you look at and expectations for and you thought they under achieved going in to the year and what happened at the end of the year\nThe Yankees are one now I don't kill them because they won a hundred games in Boston then you've got to take their kept them because they want to buckle eight but with what the Yankees did last year getting to an ale the ads and then getting rid of their manager\nYeah they did on your achieve this year because you would have thought they would have still been playing but they ran into an animal Boston which beat them up in the division and then ended up\nBeing I'm up in the postseason especially in games to reinforce that but the Yankees and the under achieving category don't kill them because they have good just Boston was but with what you thought they were going then you wouldn't have thought they would have been ... back in the division and be out in the first round the postseason\nLook around the rest of the baseball I'll put the angels as a team that under achieve we talked about them is potentially being a playoff team eighty and eighty two and they're just wasting my trout right now my trout is the best player in baseball or one of the best players in baseball on the best player in baseball\nAnd two games under five hundred and you have a situation where I think he's been the post season one time you know that the team that's under chief nationals under\nCheapest you're eighty to eighty everyone thought they were gonna run away with that division they ended up losing division bike games they were terrible now CEO of

you would have told me before the year that the cubs would have lost the division I wouldn't have believed it and if you would have told me that they'd be not able to get out of a wild card around I Would not believe that either\nSo the cubs under cheese looking around the rest of the baseball I guess there's one other team\nAnd I would say it's the Arizona Diamondbacks wondered she's eighty to eighty you got to be better than that and they just were not do it in the second half so those are the teams under chief three baseball this\nYear the diamond backs the cubs the nationals\nThe

with a nice job just no reason for a little white [laughter]\nJust no reason whatsoever for little way to be there and it's done the giants are no good at the back of them are no good and the giants right now the last two years they continue to be a laughing stock a lot of laughing going up the way of the blue right now and\nHey we'll see where it goes from here and this is a bad football team will see when they eventually pulled the plug on the line manning Ben let me ask you this because I Know you're a big giant fan\nUm you don't they don't go to la vida until the final what four games\nMay be of the season before they even consider it money that they'll they'll consider ...\nThey can consider before just to see what they have in house because of the season continue like this you're dropping quarterback so the question is you know what ... what is ... because if you drop the quarterback he's never going to get a chance to see the field\nBut\nYou'll see him before he's the tanning do I think that it's highly likely no\nOkay so you don't go into a plant all this year I think\nYear I think that there's a chance but again this notion that they're going to you know hand the reins over to Kyle a letter the truth is that he has no future here if the teams as bad as what people think that they're going to be fair I Would like to see him for the final four you'll you'll see him appear\nDo I think that he's going to start for games I don't know about which is fair but if you if you're that far out of it why not at this point just by in the final four games\nBecause it's the same thing with the situation last year if they would have went the Davis led I think that's such a way she is totally different than what happened last year\nBut again that could do was in ready just to go you know sit you lie down reportedly what you know they wanted to do\nWas well you give us the best chance to win but if we're not in a game at half time then we'll take a look yeah it was a terrible situation right how ... so this notion that you know base support communicator we knew that what they needed to do was get Web into a game at some point\nBut the way they went about it wasn't right because if you want to see whether we knew what you know Smith well any stinks\nYeah and he's a moron [laughter] does not if you\nNow ... got punched in the jaw ... lost his playbook last year oh yeah I saw Karl bay say this on the fan in New York\nHe lost his playbook last year it was like too afraid to ask for a new one right is that all year lawsuit in training camp and Ben horrid says you know the inside information on New York football giants and your sauces sources of sauces sources\nUh say that that is a true story it was confirmed by two sauces [laughter] wow so to sauces those sources that lives on your sauce of some kinds of source\nSaid that they couldn't find what Carl bank said where\nHe lost his playbook for what the entire year was or lost the train again virtually the entire year quarterback how do you lose your playbook you're all lose their everything\nNow is done digitally you know there is no play book yeah life everything's on the digital so he lost his AIPAC yes so in this coral banks pointed out the coaches have the ability to go in and see how much time you're spending a lot of them all\nSo two things the like lose it in the airport or something or again I maybe someone take it because they couldn't stand I cannot\nGet into the details of it I can just confirmed that the story is that\nSo you can tune from that he lost his eye pad yes but maybe there could have been some conspiracy or someone just didn't like him and they may be talking\nTo make him look I'm not going to dignify that and make people think either way I'm just going to say that is that a good guess though by myself again I'm not going to dignify that\nI can just tell you now we're going to do what they do in radio all the time that actually\nThe question

little bit about an AMC north match up coming up this weekend between the Steelers and the bangles bangles coming off the victory twenty seven to Seventeen over the Miami Dolphins let's welcome in\nOne of the defense of lime and that of course is Carlos ... was kind enough to join us right now on CBS Sports radio college thanks for your time how are you\nOn the gray area\nClub doing fantastic what a win last weekend down Seventeen nothing Seventy three headed into the fourth year defense get some touchdown do you make a big play and you guys just put it into an extra gear twenty four nothing in that fourth quarter how 'bout that\nYeah it was ... or one of those ones her lifetime type deals were to deal with ... percent rather than the game\nAnd you guys have an opportunity to continue to distance the gap in the AFC North at a forum on start you got Pittsburgh coming in this weekend there are fence it's been up and down throughout the started this season just what type often see expect the Steelers to bring on Sunday\nOr I mean we're you know as far as competitive game will repay them they want to bring their you know turf running game and no better go and get the water before and the Jews you and his checked out or extend players coming Pittsburgh football you know as it always is willing for them as the north\nAnd I'll tell you the first thing that crossed my mind when I thought about this match up I thought about the defensive lineman because big band is a bigger quarterback and you know it's almost impossible to hit the quarterback now in this league even though you guys have found a way to do it how do you approach trying to tackle Big Bend with the emphasis on now in the past are now\nOr you take the norm or approach you know just once you get there you got to be mindful of the rules um uh you know sadly that's the difficult part that we're in right now with this late but\nUm that's not going to stop us from getting there and we're not going to think about it um as a mindset for for getting there are you know our mindset is to get their first once we get there make sure you're secure in a way it won't be or whether they can take it away from you\nTalking a Carlos done lap right now and CBS Sports radio oh what's the new emphasis on not putting your body weight on a quarterback you've been taught to play football a certain way your entire life just how frustrating is that right now when if you even these on the quarterback the referee throws a flag for Fifteen Years\n[noise] um it's very difficult [noise] um you know it's just one of those things that you know the leave took a stand on so we have to adjust his players and\nAs you see a guy trying to adjust to it I'm not really in favor for players but I guess is in favor for them so we just got to you know respect and Jeff\nBut what a coach's tell ya in trying to adjust to it or even referees what insight did they give you an how you should approach it ah\nHow you should approach it or just you know once you're secure the quarterback and tackle try to fall off to the side don't don't put your body weight or if you can't keep from falling off the side to brace yourself\nPut your hands on the ground and uh you know hopefully their social mores\nOr you know how much of an emotional game that says that when you make a big play and then it gets called back I Know you've got called for this and the Colts game earlier in the year how do you just put it behind you and not let it really eat at you and it affects you the rest of the law\nOr you got to take a deep breath reset and um go get it right back you know like you said on the coast game it was a huge critical pray for\nA but you know how to let it fester it might have kept me from regular

I think the defense is the difference maker and this one I'll tick Miami lion six and a half par with ...\nI agree with you which isn't a good thing problem [laughter] I think the difference in the game it's a deep and Miami defensive line it's been incredible they're forcing take away and the truth is is that Virginia\nHasn't done a good job of keeping you know\nMiami's defensive line it's been incredible they're forcing takeaways and the truth is is that Virginia\nHasn't done a good job of keeping you know top pass rushes out of their back I think that causes a lot of problems for Virginia forgive me Miami minus six and a half I think they wouldn't\nBe the number set for an interesting position he could try to narrow the gap here just to be different for what he go with what he's actually feeling on the skin Rousseff but what you got to really vote\nIt's both I'm going to take her junior I feel like they've had a while here for to prepare for the game I Know Miami just is better up front on both sides of the ball but I think the uh cats keep a close\nEye ... takes the Cavaliers plus the sex and a half let's get to the next game in them but to Texas and I'm coming off the victory up against Kentucky which was one of the worst defeat the gambling that you will ever say Kentucky had a field\nGoal and it's the cross bar for cell phone I on the wrong hands once again because then a an animal they needed was a field goal they get a touchdown they win by sex and they cover\nWhich was just such a bad loss as Kentucky was five and a half points on that one that really really hurts that it's the reason my car with such a big relief\nAnd and the at South Carolina and two and a half points favorites and I was only two last is this your Alabama constantly played pumps and really tight and they played Alabama as tight as you can so far for what Alabama has been this you're under a save it into something up by law\nThere's a difference of the game for me it's the rushing attack and the ...\nAnd and the sheer has two hundred and twenty six yards on the ground [noise]\nSouth Carolina is averaging allowing a hundred and Ninety four on the ground so and I'm should be able to run the football running all day on the flip side South Carolina have been able to run the football hundred and sixty nine points to yards per game but Amazon may allow eighty two and a half yards ... yards per game on the ground\nSo a better rushing attack Birmingham and a better on defense for and um I like getting them to run their way to a victory even though they're on the road give me and I'm a lion two and a half par with what you got\nI really really hate agreeing [laughter] because what you're going to be the week you lose\nYeah and and that's why I'm a little nervous about the book and I also\nAgree with most severe rationale so we disagree a little bit a little bit on the life not terribly as much as we were disagreeing and a few segments ago but now we're agreeing and all the pets\nYeah hey hey your picture on the decline that that might be the case if I'm agreeing with you\nThese kept increasing and we just didn't want to deal with it anymore it was not anything like what they showed us when we bought the timeshare\nTime shares are today as a lake there all catch and release unless you talked to resort release we can release you from that time share legally and permanently painless rated by the bb a one hundred percent money back guarantee that our clients five star\nReviews tell the story you get different foreign internal drew never anything hidden absolutely wonderful near the one that got away before twenty Nineteen maintenance fees or do call now for a free consultation ... a thrill waves fifty nine fifty five eight eight eight three ... thirty nine fifty five four resort and release dot com\nThey catch we release resort release\nEight eight eight three oh eight fifty nine fifty five eight eight eight thrill eight fifty nine fifty five or resorting release dot com call now [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nHe's believed to have you with view this as the sec guild show\nMaybe as a Super Bowl season does continue with a fantastic double header person intense AFC North battle in Pittsburgh collide Cincinnati\nThan the NFL stopped\nDefense the Jacksonville Jaguars head to Dallas to take on the cowboys the day kicks off with the NFL today power by ram truck at\nTwelve eastern on CBS also this is very important please help people affected by hurricane Michael ...

um at South Carolina George at LSU let me go through another of these are top twenty five games you have the highest state of Minnesota fun coach match up Egypt like an urban Meyer but a higher state yeah they should to win the football game and when the big the way that Dwayne Haskins is playing football\nYou wonder what a team like Florida is now to fourteenth the nation does after a big win last weekend\nUp against LSU how they do respond the following week and maybe they have let down game up against Vanderbilt advantage of by ... votes three and three on the year\nFlorida should win the game\nNotre Dame and Pittsburgh Police next Notre Dame should win this and they should win it going away and plays down to the competition for the rest of your the only the only person they have to blame or is themself Washington Oregon\nI cannot wait for this game I'm so happy it's not one of these late late games at three thirty pm eastern yet to see Herbert you get the browning you get to see miles Gaskins\nI this is a game I didn't put it on the packs usually we enjoy picking these really tough games Washington land three and a half\nI have no clue what the scams going to end up on Oregon had that brutal wants to Stamford again they should have one and they choke did away Washington undefeated for the most part this year ... you know besides that one game they have one more suddenly or\nAre they playing great football for most weeks but last year that wasn't lost the opera in the beginning of the year to getting that could have won in the red zone they could have been undefeated but they're not this is this is all the makings for great pack to a game with a ton of scoring\nAnd it's going to come down to which team's going to be able to make a stop light but a whole lot of all things should be and that's when it should be a ton of fun to watch a Eugene Oregon is the home game of course for Oregon a and this is just supposed to be a just a fun football game Washington they'll lay in a three and a half\nA on the road Penn State and Michigan Penn State one last year was choked job to Ohio State of twelve and the fourth\nThis Penn State have a let down up against a Michigan State we shall see Baylor and taxes these coaches know each other going back to the American athletic conference Tom Herman when he was a Houston and that rule when he was at Baylor Baylor's fence has been good this year taxes or fourteen point favorite maybe not rule has an upset broom with Texas Texas\nHad a tremendous victory and a great victory last week up against Oklahoma let's see if they can continue rolling at now five and a one\nHow 'bout that ever since they lost the Maryland they have\nHave not been concerned ever since Texas is they have run the ... the rest of the way I'll tell you if you want to see a sense I think the over under the eighty one eighty two points you got what you see at the Memphis UCF undefeated once again top ten team in the country Memphis\nIs always all fenced off insolvent UCF as a ton of often they should be a high scoring game I politic passing game definitely tuning in three thirty pm eastern or either ABC or ESPN two\nA ton of all fence there should be a high scoring game I prolific passing game definitely tuning in three thirty pm eastern or either ABC or ESPN two depending on where you do lie and now that is UCF and Memphis we did Texas A M South Carolina or Alabama plays Missouri\nCome on how they can get help him out of this year and so they go down not picking against\nThem if you want to watch will Greer maybe do a little scouting he does play Iowa State that is that seven pm eastern here's a tough game it's a really tough game\nAnd the question is do you trust Jim hardball or not that's when it comes down to for me I trusted ... earlier in the Europe against\nNotre Dame Michigan threw up on themselves ... we had such a terrible attack offensively to start out here ever since then Michigan is five until after that loss Wisconsin is four and one this year the one last to BYU\nWhere Michigan's beat western Michigan then they defeated um\nSMU Nebraska north western and also Maryland this is a huge test\nAnd I mean an enormous task for miss the harbor because if he loses another big game and now you're playing at the big house\nMan that would be a rough one now this one was interesting it opens up about a touchdown six and a half and is sky rocketed up to ten point\nSo that means the money is being put on Michigan so do you follow the money or do you go the other way this is the game I Would not touch I Want no business touching it I'm looking at\nSome of the numbers right now Wisconsin this year as one in four against the spread\nMichigan's three and three\nThis this game that either machine's gonna blow 'em out or it's going to be a dog fight and they're going to crawl right to the finish line\nESPN as Michigan projected at a Seventy three point eight percent chance\nTo win this game CSPAN thinks it's almost Seventy five percent of a chance that Michigan is going to beat Wisconsin\nI have questions about Michigan they're often appears to be rolling after the Notre Dame\nLaws and I don't know what was confidence because Wisconsin the thing that sticks out to me is that lost the BYU ... twenty four and a Twenty one I was ... this is once again I damn I just wouldn't touch\nHorowitz let me ask you since you are very clear voice as I'll give you a little credit to make your ego even bigger and bigger and bigger than it already is if I put Wisconsin and Michigan\nOn the schedule and we were picking them Horowitz where would you go in Wisconsin and Michigan but ... the line is now\nTen by the way at ten I'm probably taking Wisconsin I think Michigan runs this game but I certainly am not trusting Jim orb on that program with ten points against ranked opponent and a lot of the money is all but on Michigan\nIt shows you and actually our people are trusting horrible and I don't get it hold on the money meaning on the spread or the money's on the money why 'cause I'll take the money right now I'm going to write I Will start at six and a half\nI don't get a hold on the money meaning on the spread or the money is on the money 'cause I'll take 'em all the money right now I'm going to write I Will start at six and a half now with the potential\nThat means people put the money on Michigan early\nAt six and a half yeah but I I even then I don't know if I'm trust in at ten points no land point no chance but I I mean\nLook it with my own money\nI don't touch this you know not as a federal is if you're asking me to picket a handicap it that's what I'm telling you there is no way that you can trust your more but I think Michigan wins the game but I I think it's going to be a little bit closer now about\nOne more Washington and Oregon your future quarterbacks Mr Herbert you're going to be watching uh Oregon and Washington but uh I'll be here but yes I'm going to be watching it for thirty pm that you're going to be ...\nWell I'm assuming just because it's out west or no then I'll be a worry on the show I only spent like three times yeah 'cause I'm paying a pattern that tactic and it was like literally\nI think sometimes we maybe get caught up in the completion percentage maybe a little too much too much and I was probably part of that but the more you watch him play you just he has his own special category when it comes to quarterback because\nWe haven't seen somebody of sheer size in stature a play the position\nGoing into the year ... looked at the center of the south and they thought it was the breed team raised with the Panthers the saying send the falcons after the falcon ... I Know it's early and it looks like this going to be a duty Marines what do you think it comes down to between saint Panthers\nWell last year the um the Panthers lost three times to the same um\nAnd and I'll be very honest with you the Panthers fans actually did finding those games there was the secondary of Carolina which struggle mightily against Drew Brees and company I'm certainly look I think I'm surprised as anyone else about Atlanta I really thought this was a theme that was going to make a run now granted they've had some\nSome very tough injuries to overcome on the defensive side of the football uh they've lost a couple of games vine at the end this year that it could have gone either way\nBut um you know the same offense simply Drew Brees like we all saw the historic night Monday Night\nBut that's every week I mean the precision and he plays what he plays within the passing game\nAnd they just attack you in so many different ways and then getting a marking on back it certainly looks like they're going to be on a collision course the windows division I think there'll be battle tested um you know I think\nPlaying indoors helps the saints so having a very good record of teams have to go to New Orleans because I think they play different on the grass than they do indoors whereas the Carolina\nUh having a quarterback like Pam and a defense the way they do I truly don't believe they have the carrier a carry than whether with them their their their color or whether proof so to speak\nGoing on two things you said with the falcons who leaving Jones who can't get into the end zone and then we Drew Brees he's thirty nine he's still dominating the game that must be fun to watch for yourself\nWell I'm a store with Julio first um\nI just think that really kid as reaping the benefits of Julio being so good to be very honest with you ... and send new and tied in and\nI just think things are so worried about a really all that is opening up for some of these other guys so I think that will come um but that's just the issue that they're having and back to drew\nI'm at his age and he takes care of himself obviously very well but I like I mentioned earlier the ... fish into the passing game\nEverybody has to make sure that they are they're correct yeah\nAnd that correct angle on their route because the ball is coming out it's coming out and indeed you listen to the receivers that played with him they say you won't see him half the time because of his stature you're just going to see the ball coming out of a ... a a bunch of men from the from the line of scrimmage\nAnd that's where I drew is so good you know I think we get caught up in these are P. O. than some of the new little trick some teams are doing in the NFL well Sean Payton and Drew Brees have been running the same place as two thousand and six\nAnd they've had the same success so it's about it's about precision and getting the ball out because they run in the same place\nTwo thousand and six and they've had the same success so it's about it's about precision and getting the ball out because they run in the same place they haven't changed much and he and through is still on fire like he has been since two thousand and six\nDon't get to the former NFL quarterback ... show on CBS Sports radio and they had a brief staying Cleveland but let me get to one of your other former teams in the browns maker may build and brought a new level excitement to Cleveland also with some of the younger players in ... and also miles Garrett\nWell I was only in in Cleveland for one year and truly you felt for the fans you wanted to give that team a winner are fortunately it was the end of the career and the body was breaking down all these started four games there but I Want to see them have success\nAnd I truly believe they will and I think it starts in the front office or they have a guy they finally have a football guy in charge and John Dorsey and this goes back to when I was there it was it was such a fractured organization from the top down but now that they have a true football guy and\nI guess Dorsey is pretty good because that team he left behind in Kansas City has a little bit of talent on it I Would say that\nBut a Baker may feel I think he's brought a\nAnd I'm using this term it and and I truly think in a good way he's\nBrought a ... and it's that listen we're going to win we're going to fight to the whistle and we're going to play to the end of the game and he's helping change that culture and they've added some guys in there I think the Jarvis land resigning was obviously very big um but they're getting guys in there that\nThey're going to change that culture and that seems to have more than just a couple of when they really and truly should\nBut Baker very impressed with him keeping his eyes down the field a feeling that Russia really a very very well and not looking just run out of the pockets and its accuracy he's really really doing a good job very a very happy to see that\nYou talked about Dorsey you talked about the homes as a quarterback you got to be ... match up coming up on Sunday night on Fox borrow between the homes with the cheats and also breeding in the past\nYeah absolutely I I think you know a thousand the gold standard for so long and ah and I just this New England team and I don't know what's gonna happen Sunday night but ... ... jobs Gordon can just give them a little bit\nI mean when they start lining up and this weather's going to start getting bad and Brady is going to be at his best and and you're going to line up and you're going to have\nYou know Josh Gore and we're going ... Edelman Hogan and in the ... the little running back um ... it's a it's a matchup problem they're going to start to see New England I think start to really start to move a little bit in the next couple of months and and that's\nThat's kind of par for the course for them and certainly in my home what they're doing in Kansas City that is very fun to watch I watch this kid playing college\nThey play LSU I Believe in a ballgame one time and he was a young kid and LSU just always loaded with Palin defensively and this kid singlehandedly kept Texas Tech in the game you knew his the special care and certainly his aunt talent is pretty dark spectacular and the way you can kind of move it move in the ... in the pocket\nAnd a and move around and make place it's certainly fun to watch\nWhat is it like for you obviously I Know you want it to be on the winning side of Super Bowl thirty eight but that didn't happen is the patch did defeat your Panthers but just to be a part of one of those Super Bowl that breed he did playing\nAnd you look back at that match it was a high scoring affair late and a very good on fence again but it didn't start out that way as it was defensive dominating early\nWell the first and third quarter were obviously very boring and only a defensive player or defensive coach would have enjoyed it because there was two defenses that would\nWell the first and third quarter were obviously very boring and only a defensive player or defensive coach would have enjoyed it because there were two defenses that would just stalemate in both ... and back then that's the old for Super Bowl o three season\nIf you go back and look at statistics lay that New England defense was one of the greatest statistical defenses of all time\nThey didn't allow much of a passing game running game of points allowed that year at all so we knew we were up against that um but yeah I think both teams just kind of the old cliche kept chopping wood oh and then play started happening in the next thing you know and ended up being a firework show so to speak\nUm and good old Tom was able to get the ball last and steady all out of military was able to kick it throws so but I just still marvel at times age and the consistency that he's still playing with to this day\nThey do such a great job and no one talks about okay yeah ballet ballot checking Brady and if they're obviously hall of famers there that the cream of the crop\nBut that office of law and what Dante scala next year a year in and year out\nUm where would that office of line that is truly amazing to me I think that's the true MVP of that team and for years I've been saying that he does what some of the guys that he works with or without the office of line it gets so overlooked and I just don't think he gets enough credit for what he truly does\nNo doubt about it on screen but he's been to the patriots coaching staff I Want to ask you about the giants Eli Manning he doesn't get a whole lot of time from the sense of line but\nWhen you get that time it just seems like it checked down university for big blue you look at and also oh Delbanco means do an interview with little Wayne um by his side just how about the giants right now the state of that team and also Eli Manning is it looks like his career is coming to include sooner rather than later with the giants\nWell certainly that wasn't fun to watch the last like it'd be very honest I'm you know ill I very simple he didn't have any time to do anything first and foremost I Want to bring in Carolina last week\nAnd then they throw the ball down the field some and he made some pretty good passes but they're struggling so much an essay on Barkley\nThe release haven't highlight film runs is because there's no lanes to run thrown is creating its own lanes with his jumped cuts and jumping over people and running around people and throw people are struggling up front you know and\nThat needs to be rectified but it certainly doesn't look good there and with the whole interview and things like that and in that market in the New York market are you kidding me I mean this is just\nThis is just so much feels that fire so it doesn't look like a things are kind of going in the right direction to say the least and that's unfortunate for the I Know as a as a fellow quarterback it's a\nWhen you see things like that start to unravel you just kind of hope that things can pull it together but it doesn't look too promising\nRadio Ninety nine to a game for saying this is Brian Jordan joined me and I need to know and the game and my

today he got Washington and Oregon you of course have\nOr LSU an action as the LSU game to me it's it's going to be so interesting to see what happens between George at LSU\nAs Ellis use a team that leads to Florida last\nWeek of the ... place to place had two other really good wins this year that should be fun and I met South Carolina Miami and for Gen yeah just to name a few and you got a little Michigan hosting Wisconsin and we could see if I'm Mr Harbaugh a finds a way to get a one of these are big victories as if he loses this one\nIt's going to be a bad book especially when a lot of people expect him to win is that line opened up in about six and a half now ten depending where you look so\nThis should be an interesting time college football when we first started said and I'm really excited that much for the slate of games but on the week goes on you got some good match if there is do no doubt about that so I Hope that George Allen's you lives up to the hype I picked Ga land the seven so\nAnd I'm starting to jump off a little bit of the LSU a train that I've been on for most of the way but you never know what could happen to make the top twenty five so fun each and every week if teams they never expect to go down and end up going down like we would have predicted that Wisconsin would've lost to BYU this year\nTo put it to the ... even predicted that\nMost people not pretentious someone out there saying yeah I pick BYU I Want that to BYU to beat\nWisconsin but I happen to him when it happened and\nThen there's always these these top twenty five games which are always a whole lot of fun let's go to Dallas we talked to see their next step CBS Sports writing ... how are you\nGoing on that doing great my brother what's up\nMan I just want to talk to them a full season baseball which man go ahead no you know and I saw I was watching a walk in charge of secular or last night I fell asleep midway through the you know thinking Milwaukee has gone Cruz right through\nThe exciting part of the game then\nYeah yeah you know I wake up wake up you know to go to work\nAnd uh I wake up to go to work and I look at the final and fixed as far as you know going out going down the box score and all the stats and everything that was like wow you know I miss I miss the most exciting part you know I think I think the Dodgers have all the momentum going into\nThe game to the way they finish the game was I think that was that when game to game three go ... go back to Milwaukee when a and and finish it off the hook up there but what what you think about the\nThing came to is going to be very telling Caesar um but here's the problem\nYou may have meant to be able to do late but you still lost the game like the Yankees are examples in game on and it was very similar up against the red Sox same situation they were getting beat early they tried to make the comeback they fall just short\nAnd ended up losing the series\nNow the Yankees did win game too so maybe that momentum carries over for the Dodgers in game number two and you try to stay up at one of the peace but\nIn the series now the Yankees did win game too so maybe that momentum carries over for the Dodgers endgame number two and you try to stay up at one of the peace but if the Dodgers go down to low with the way Milwaukee is one\nTwelve you're in a row and now everyone's going to be getting burgers on Thursday a and Milwaukee from that promotion and they didn't really make a hundred and Seventy thousand burgers high it's going to be tough to go then have\nTo win for up against Milwaukee if you're already in a a to a whole\nAnother thing I thought you know I didn't I didn't know Milwaukee had the best regular American\nAnd they looked at the yeah the bar\nOr yesterday told me you know until the ... uh it seems right and I was like wow you know I thought I thought dodge lay out a better record but there were four game better than the Dodgers\nNah yeah and and that's why they came out and that's why these games are a Milwaukee but it's a good point because for most of the year a lot of people discredit Milwaukee 'cause we thought that the cubs are going to win this division\nAnd then the last week of the season Milwaukee did what they did to start really getting this wrong going and they beat the cubs in game one sixty three we know the cubs go on to lose to the Rockies at Wrigley in the wild card round in the next thing you know Milwaukee is the best team in the you know\nA on a record standpoint going into this postseason the Dodgers had they went to the world series last year they lost in a very tough fashion at the end does not surprise me that they were as dominant as when people would have thought going into the air\nYeah and you know what I mean we talked about the American league you know what they want to go away and then you know even though there are all you know you you know they're feeding off from from what they say that that that\nHave nothing better than what they were last year ...\nOr ... times better me starting pitchers better me and you know they have a private company pitching\nI I mean I'm not I ain't going to be paid maybe right man he's going to be pitching buddy better showman actually\nPaying fees or I appreciate the phone call has but that's the beauty of baseball that's the beauty of all sports how many times you look at the NFL game like for example last year she tied in\nTennessee what it was the game and you got a gay and even when the chiefs are up all those points you never got Tennessee was going to have a tendency came back to when the game and baseball same thing\nI bought some a hundred and eight games this past year I mean a whole nother capable of winning for more games to get to the world series but you just looked at this juncture not\nThat is used in right now and you look at them and you say how do you beat them\nHow do you meet them\nAnd that's what bar sitting there starting pitchers have to come up there at the ... and starting pitching of Houston they're gonna have to match the starting pitcher gives Houston and it's tough because you're selling game on you

A. okay as well as your involvement through the community and through all of the activities that you do as a journalist\nI remember you telling me that you are originally from Columbus, Georgia I also remember you telling me that when you were in high school you're asked what you want it to do and you said what\nSaid I Want it to be a reporter because we had a stations there and I would say I'm Maria Boynton reporting and um every with each honor and I'm On social media there was a young lady named Carol and we're on the ... corps together and high school\nAnd she always says to me you always said you want it to be a reporter\nMedia there was a young lady named Carol and we're on flat core together and high school\nAnd she always says to me you always said you want it to be a reporter\nAnd that's how my life has had moved has um\nTranscended into the life of a reporter\nI'm Maria Boynton I um\nFeel honored to be allowed to do that because I feel that my purpose is that a public service and in my job I'm able to report I'm able to get to know others in my reporting and to allow others to get to know others as well\nSo your dream started out in high school\nYes I I Would say my dream started out actually when I was even younger than that because I had the television and um I Would sit there and I would watch the TV and then that of course helped me realize that there were things that a little black girl can do on the television\nAnd but I spent most of my time listening to the radio\nThe radio was what mood my life that's what we listen to we listened to the radio\nThe local radio station there had news persons on them and then of course the music was another thing I Am a country music fan\nAnd so we had a a gentleman by the name of cousin Allen my home town\nAnd I have to tell you I Would listen to cause an al his delivery how he was set up the music how they would go to the news and how informative every bit of it was and I fell in love with it\nWell that's a very evident and the news has fallen in love with us well now I Know you said that you knew what you wanted to do in high school\nWere you involved in any journalistic clubs where are you a news anchor for your school how did you express that desire\nWell actually one of the local radio stations there had a scholarship and I went and applied and then when I got home there was a gentleman visiting my my grandmother's home and he says I Know you don't want to be a DJ\nSo I kind of made me think well maybe I don't want to do it and so then I went off to school and lo and behold there was an audition for someone to read the news or southwest Georgia I was a student at Albany State University Albany state college at the time it was known as\nAnd so I went in and I auditioned and I got it\nAnd I'm so that was how you can say I was thrust\nInto my career of journalism and it was great to come into the dining hall and people's hey I just heard you on the news\nI just heard you do in the news so it was interesting and then I'm Dr James Hill who was one of the deans at our college or he called me into his office one day and said I have an internship possibility for you and so I guess we can say the rest is history I started in turning at a local station there and one or two weeks and they hired me\nThat said hey I've got some I didn't want to wants to talk to you know I was like who could this be and so low and behold it was Mr Reggie rouse\nFrom um the one oh three which is known as CBS Atlanta back then just a few years ago and dumb he said you are a very hard lady to get in touch with and so um you know weeks and months to a\nYou know happened and I ended up being here at the one oh three it hasn't been a great experience because there's so many dynamics\nThere's so many characters here so many co workers with so many different personalities and I comment each day which is new I think the lord for that\nOr allow me to wake up each and every day and to have a grand new day and I'm to be able to where the people that I work with and when you talk about Amanda the difference I guess in the stories that we do while\nOn the local level there's so many stories in so many details that are available to you they're not one day goes by that there isn't a story\nAnd Amanda there are so many amazing local stories I mean we can talk about a police brutality we can talk about protesting Mercedes Benz at Mercedes Benz stadium\nWe can talk about taking a knee in front of Piedmont Park blocking the street or we can talk about a little baby born without kidneys who all they want as a kidney but the system seems to be blocking it for some reason we can talk about\nUh the mother who wonders why her son was shot so many times so many times and still cannot get answers there are so many stories out there for instance in South Fulton where the judicial system it's comprised of African American women take and black girl magic\nThese stories out there for instance in South Fulton where the judicial system it's comprised of African American women take and black girl magic to the extreme or we can talk about ... bottom being elected Atlanta sixtieth mayor\nOr we can talk about Georgia having the possibility of making history with the first black female governor\nThere are so many stories out there that you want to tell you can talk about whether it's news weather is sport whether you're talking about the environment even whatever you're talking about it can be a story it is a story\nAnd there's someone out there that wants to hear about it\nI agree with one thing that I Love that you do is go stories too big or too small you know a lot of times when we talk about journalism and coverage for most people take which trendy and oftentimes you bake what's trending\nI remember you said one day you answered the phone in the newsroom which you don't have to do but you do when that phone rings you answer\nYou said there was a young man on the other side talking about his girlfriend\nHad just been arrested because she saw for defending her home yes and south Fulton\nAnd you encourage them to come in not only did you encourage them to come in and get a story you actually reached out to an on air personality and had him have him on a show and from there the gentleman was able to get connected with other resources in the community to help him and his girlfriend and because of that\nHe was able to get his voice heard to get his story out just a young man trying to be the voice for his girlfriend who was wrongfully he felt was wrongfully incarcerated over something that that should not have been but he we were there for them you were there for the people in a community waffle house\nFor instance every time I look and see your protests icy Maria winds in on the scene and the community and you're getting in there [laughter]\nI get in there and your journalistic current and journey has definitely been one of commitment and determination to truly be the best at what you love to do how do you feel\nAbout the current trend of journalism with alternative facts with a lot of the opinionated stories that we hear more so nowadays I mean take news fake news how do you feel about fake news\nWell I have to tell you I'm\nI focus myself myself who I can control I focus myself on\nTrying to be as factual as I can be what's the source of of my news I think it's less complicated for me because my primary focus is what's happening in Atlanta where I can make a phone call or or or whatever\nI don't have to make it up there so much going on here I don't have to make it up um there are so many very well respected people here that I can talk to there are so many people here in Atlanta who have stories to tell we don't have to make it up these people they feel the pain they feel the sorrow we don't have to make that up\nSo that's the reason when I say is less cumbersome for me in that respect because there are so many valid stories on the local level now when we talk about\nThe alternatives to news and the the fake news have to tell you my interest is more so in those\nWho give their opinions in the news more so than the fake news because fake news is not something that I worry about\nMurray I just want to thank you so much for coming in sharing your story for\nLetting us on are you with and just shine extra light on this wonderful resolution that you receive from the state house of representatives like I said to me this is probably even more special to you being born and bred here in Georgia yes and it's just a wonderful acknowledgement from peers and people who\nSay that to me this is probably even more special to you being born and bred here in Georgia yes and it's just a wonderful acknowledgement from peers and people who love you who respect what you do and who honor the work that you have done and are still doing\nOur listeners who might be young journalists out there I have an idea had that dream that you did when you were in high school what what is your best advice for them\nPursue it pursue it a first and foremost when it comes to uh whether you should get into it or not\nI talked to some who are doing what you think you might like to do but also understand that the world is ever changing this is a huge business that we live in whether you're behind them might in front of the Mike\nWhether you're in the sales department whatever you want to do\nAbout it if you have a a a niche for wanting to be a journalist which also like the law there is a niche for you you can become a legal enlist you never know you could go get that law degree and then come back to journalism whatever you want to do if it's connected to journalism\nIt can happen for you you know Amanda I M approached by\nPeople all the time who will say always wanted to do that and I don't mean to sound crass or anything when I see it but I see you're not dead yet\nYou're not dead yet so not only did that for them but as for me as well there is so much more that can be done that we hope to do where you where are you going next to Maria I cannot even tell you the navy I Do not know\nWhether the verdict is still out and you still have a lot more work to do here so would you like to thank Maria our knowledge before we enter show\nMy grandmother miss Jesse or she has passed on and um we we were like two peas in a pod you know when I was a little girl\nAnd I remember speaking at her services and I and I talked about that and when I say we were like two peas in a pot every one of the church or a man\nYou know because we were and my mother Mary I mean she's always been supportive my sister Valerie has always been supportive and state representative Calvin ... who is the dean of the Georgia house of representatives he\nHas always been there for me always been pushing along with state senator at harvest and who has a matter of fact was a former boss of mine he was my former news director and Columbus, Georgia who decided to step into politics and and he's still in it and he loves to\nTell people I talk I taught that young lady everything that she knows so um to those persons into of course our heavenly father I just say thank you so much\nWell Maria we want to say thank you for all that you've given to us\nOr informing us in the morning for inspiring us in the afternoon and for giving us something to think about at night so for myself and all of the listeners any entire staff your intercom radio Atlanta we honor you Maria your soul

violence symposium resource fair building bridges making connections to call to action is a public event schedule for Wednesday October Seventy from eight in the morning until twelve thirty in the afternoon at the manual Maloof auditorium located at Thirteen hundred ... indicator do people need to register\nThey do not need to register um although if you would like to attend you can email\nOur office at a a Riley at DeKalb County Ga dot Gov but you do not have to register to calm\nOkay we're talking to a DeKalb County district attorney Sherry Boston it's great to have you in Studio with us today talking about turning the spotlight on domestic violence it is your eighth annual domestic violence symposium why do you do it\nWe continue to do it because we get such a great response from not only our community partners but the folks that show up every year\nEveryone wants to know we're going to continue to do it we have people that come every single year and then we get new people in the room and as long as there is this problem with domestic violence will continue to bring awareness to it in any way we can\nSo you get the support of the county to put these on\nAbsolutely I'm grateful for the support of CEOs Thurman and our board of commission who routinely come out to show their face because they know that this is a problem in our community and I feel grateful to have their support\nAnd I ask you do the teachers come because in the schools there's abuse there but you also have an event to that target teen dating an abuse right\nYes their teen dating violence is I'm\nAlso an epidemic but we have to address it in a different way um because there are so many of our teams that are just entering into their first intimate partner were dating relationships and so they don't always understand what a relationship should look like\nBecause they've never had a relationship before so we know with our teens fifty seven percent of teens know someone who has been physically sexually or verbally abusive and a dating relationship\nAnd only thirty three percent of those dating abuse victims ever told anyone about it it is an epidemic of massive\nProportions with our young people and so many of our parents and guardians teachers and family members don't even realize that it's an issue because as we know teens don't like to share her they don't like to share their coming and going let alone\nProblems that they may be facing in a dating relationship\nNot to mention some people may be dating without permission right mhm uh they may not be allowed to date they may be keeping a relationship secret just because it's not allowed in the household\nImagine if that relationship that secret relationship were also in abusive relationship they certainly aren't going to share that with her family so it's a real problem\nFrom the legal standpoint how difficult is it then to prosecute when you have the source of cases versus those adult cases\nI Would say it's equally challenging in both cases because it whether you\nThe source of cases versus those adult cases\nI Would say it's equally challenging in both cases because it whether you are a teen or you\nAre an adult I'm or a wife or a mother or twenty five years or these relationships are emotional and it's scary um and it can be intimidating\nI'm so we we we face the same challenges in teen relationships as we do in adult relationships\nYou talked about teens not wanting to share how have you determine that a matter is eventually brought about is it because someone finally shared something someone in the relationship shared or because someone witnessed something and they came forward\nIt it's a combination of instances but I Will tell you there are many family members that don't learn that their teen is involved in a dating relationship and tell their dad unfortunately uh we we have seen also across the nation an uptick in homicides\nI'm among youth and then ... and these young dating relationships and there are so I I hear mothers and fathers saying I had no idea that this was going on not only in my house but with my with my daughter my child and they're devastated\nUm and that's certainly not how we want this to come to light but unfortunately sometimes in these relationships that's when we're learning when there's a death\nHow important is it to not remain quiet\nIt's important to speak up and speak out and that's what we want to encourage our young people because what we do know is although a young person may not confide in a mother or father\nThey may confide in a a best friend appear someone that they trust and so we feel like if we can educate young people then maybe that best friend\nAh in the group will lend the support to that friend to get them to speak up\nYou have that event coming up your teen dating event coming up in February right\nYes it's coming up on Saturday February twenty third that'll be in two thousand and Nineteen\nWe're going to have our third annual love around it is a five K. and the proceeds go to the women's resource center to and domestic violence\nBut more importantly we want to raise awareness around teen dating violence and we hold out in February every year because we know that February ... Valentine's Day and we want people when they're thinking about\nValentine's Day to think about being unhealthy relationships and what that should look like and that's what our love front is all about\nAnd if folks want more information about that what should they do\nThey can go to our website and we'll be promoting that information that said WWW dot the cab da da da and it's also on our Facebook page and our Twitter page Jerry\nBoston is the DeKalb County district attorney she's been the district attorney now for a quick two years went by really really fast of course you were solicitor general before that let's get in to be young on domestic violence this is talk some matters beyond domestic violence\nProgressive prosecution that's the topic a term that tends to come out of your office that I'm hearing out of your office is ... is it your approach to prosecution says that we're talking about\nIs in it I didn't even know there was a time for and the more people started saying oh you're one of the progressive prosecutors across the United states I mean these were ideas that had already been working on um as solicitor and issues that Iran on as district attorney\nDick uterus across the United states I mean these were ideas that had already been working on um as solicitor and issues that I ran on as district attorney um but people refer to it as progressive um I like to call it innovative are smart um we have to make some tough choices in our criminal justice system\nUm and we need to make sure that we're spending our resources in a way that makes sense for our community which is holding our violent offenders accountable\nAnd keeping our community safe from violent offenders but at the same time we have to offer opportunities and second chances for people in our community that can be rehabilitated that have substance abuse issues they've done it honestly just made genuine mistakes along the way\nBut are gonna come back into our community and deserved to come back into our community and I think that's what progressive prosecution is all about\nThe Boston when you talk about those who just simply made a mistake we discuss cash bail reform folks who are in jail needed a hundred dollars just to make bail and can't what's DeKalb County doing about that\nWell at DeKalb County has been on the forefront of these types of issues and as solicitor general I was proud to be a part of reforming our recorders court at the time was responsible for dealing with these types of low level traffic ordinance type offenses where we saw\nPeople being held in jail not because they were a danger but simply because they couldn't come up with a few hundred dollars to post a bond um and so we see cash bail reform being discussed not just in Atlanta all over the United states because the last thing we want is our prisons to become debtors prisons\nWe certainly don't want folks being in jail because they can't afford to come out of jail it does not help our families that doesn't help our community\nWhat is your office doing when it comes to helping folks who have been in the system who have been incarcerated get that second chance\nWell I'm proud to say that we created and when I became district attorney a unit in our office called the ... unit diversion and community alternative programs and under that umbrella we do all of our accountability courts but then the court system whether it's mental health court\nDrug court veterans' court\nBut we also offer diversion programs where we as prosecutors take certain offensive and say these are the type of upset the fences that we feel uh we can divert outside of the traditional criminal justice system and where we want people to complete certain programs\nUm and do certain things whether it's getting their GED or counseling\nAnd therefore if they complete that we will not prosecute them and saddle them with a felony conviction that we know will hinder their ability to

Seventy thousand postcards to homeowners informing them up this upcoming phase out\nA note virtue that we realize that we needed to go into what we call the educational mode yeah desert to teach homeowners and informed them that if your system is ten years or older or if it's non functional route dated\nA there now is a time for you to consider a change an hour from a freon based system the what's known as our four to in a system\nAnd that's that's amazing and let me tell you why because the truth is I promise you Mr park's if I got that postcard in the mail I Would say up someone trying to sell something that I Would go so education\nIs key because that personally affects me yes I Need to get mine out of there and I've had that wing over my head for about a year year and a half\nEver since I've had to have it service and you know new free on it that had my guys this young guy who's just started out and he's like you're gonna I'm having a hard time it's expensive right the old free on now\nRight right ... years is three or four times as much because we're going towards the end of the phase out right so a number of contractors they're specialized more so in terms of a free on as opposed to service because there's so much money in it\nRight now can make a ton of money exactly right right\nWe but we are more so on the edge it's got its casual side mhm and informing homeowners about the change out in how you can really save money by by changing our systems now because of the money you save a ... on on the on on this on these new systems for instance you average of twenty euro system\nYou're losing probably sixty cents on the dollar terms\nSo I have a ... on on the on on the on these new systems for instance ... euro system you're losing probably sixty so sort of dollar terms energy frisked right really easily sixty cents on the dollar I was talking to my my my cousin last night and we we brought him on board right a stranger either system he lives in South west Atlanta\nAre all homeless paid for a systems wouldn't homes twenty five years\nAnd he just didn't want to change out and I said that we talked to was this older system is what we call a uh a sewer system cold right now Mary starts at fourteen seer for for for for energy in your ... okay so he was really behind the ... the system that he had in his own better we make ... anymore\nSo uh you know by virtue of upgrading to a new energy for his version system the money that he's going to say when his utility bill will pay for the calls the monthly payments words new society we are so critical\nThat's crazy yeah you know the truth is is that when you and I'm so thankful that you're here to talk about this because I'm really thankful that you bring education and information to it that you've partner with W lay okay to bring the listeners right real truth and real information about things like that because I\nI Know how to do this I Know how to work something into the sale of the home call me I'll be happy to tell you had to do it I'll be happy to put you in touch with\nMr Brooks we will give out all of his contact information you can certainly contact him directly\nBut ... sometimes and this is true that this is a little sidebar\nSometimes I get agents economy who listen to the show and say okay now I have this problem how do I worked at the end and so then I Try to help them figure out how to get in whatever they want to get into the contract so let's get back to this this is this is I'm great information so there's\nA ton of different\nCompanies out there that have HVAC system you partnered with good men to bring us a good deal now before the show I said well okay what about ... what is the other one's brain drain\nBrian ... you're right\nThat you gave me a really interesting statistic that I didn't know about good men you want to share that\nThe Goodman has a forty seven percent of the market share in the metro Atlanta market that is mind boggling grain right and that that's that's\n... it's because of your for the building and pricing or the number of contractors that's absurd that provide their products and easy a sustainable parts should there be a problem\nBased on the junior managing director Wharton exactly it's like buying an American made car so you can get [laughter] exactly [laughter] Goodman ... has a ten year manufactured guardian parts oh wrong\nWith the system so and also be you know there's an American base company based in in in Houston, Texas a is easy you know ... it's almost like having universal parts marry my if you need something to change out for parts\nYou get older the park than twenty four hours it could be a the ... the contractor can ordered it can be a within a distributorship supply house within twenty four hours\nThat's amazing though is interesting about that ... they put this in context they have forty percent forty seven percent Shia that's almost fifty percent ... everybody else has to divide up the rats exactly exactly it's alright talk about\nThe installation\nTalk about the program that you have going on the plan that you've laid out for everybody so that they can make it affordable\nThis is what we've done we've hit that we've been to a threshold\nOf of selling five thousand systems right mhm so we're we're considered it up a premium distributor in the metro letter market in with the ... some of some muscle if you will a whereby we we get calls on the red color from finance companies wanting us to use your pharmacy product\nAnd and we tell them we're we're still and we're still working was homeowners that are recovering from the housing recession of away exactly right and and and we let them know that how this has impacted certain ethnic groups across the metro area eighty five Ninety percent of our clients are female homeowners\nWow any ... or more you know and that shocked as we did we did a partnership with government in DeKalb County on the local community newspapers and I'm within six weeks we sold over four hundred systems\nAnd we were in an in eighty five percent as as I mentioned were female homeowners in Suffolk County in from that point where we realized that we need to take this message across\nTo a broader gr brought it to the audience right so we started advertising on Sunday Morning praised alerted Lee ... and a a ... a Freeman who was a rip mhm he showed us how we how we should ever gator uproar platform to use a W A L K as well right so we\nWe we decided we needed to\nGator proper a platform to use a W A L K as well right so we\nWe we decided we needed to focus more so on advertising and we call the grassroots level if you will yeah just a matter of the message about the phase out and the number of systems that were installing in the metro Atlanta area of the entire metro Atlanta area for home for FEMA homeowners now a lot of our homeowner's\nOr through this new will be caught up on this call him a moderate financing program easy pay we're homeowners will be caught up with a moderate credit score and score of five thirty\nSix twenty oh yeah that that can can receive financing\nWill be what we call this marry or F ha program yeah they had it sounds I mean we tried to try to stick close to the effigy guidelines where you you typically for the qualify for it every ... every day known as a five eighty applied eighty hit in the door so we figured that we needed to be within the same platform\nTo provide H racy financing to our clients now in energy industry standards says that\nOn anything under six forty is considered poor credit\nNow we tell them look we we were dealing with a number of homeowners as I mentioned that are still recovering from the housing recession away so we're talking about homeowners who may have been making sixty Seventy eighty thousand dollars\nBut now they've been bumped down to forty thousand dollars that ... that's our market that's our market that's our that's our sweet spot so to say mhm so being that this is a national phase out we had to make sure that we had a a financing platform finance the model\nThat weakest sail towards your towards your not charging up to our general public in our in our viewing audience so\nWe talked a multiple clients ... muscle finance companies ever causes said well Mr Brooks we can provide you this week abroad you that I says well we can't afford to pay thirty thirty five forty percent interest rates for these brought\nHim no no no no we just like the thing died right right right right so\nWe told them ideally will be like to do is up a financing product that's based the look taken effect to homeowners utility bill payment\nTheir electric bill payment the gas bill payment in order to build payment\nAnd lift of ownership in their home if they've been in home five years or longer we called them lifers in the industry ... number one at home maybe upside down in terms of their mortgage so they're not going to go any place because of that fact alone\nAnd now their income is increasing whereby they can afford to do so well because some home maintenance products right and so the debt your income ratio that they have it it it allows them to have to purchase systems\nNow something very unique about the metro Atlanta area that we forget some time the metro Atlanta area has the largest African American homeless you break in the country oh wow the Seventeen counties that comprise and mentioned on an area\nIs the largest African American homeownership break in the country you can't go any place else\nIn the country or in the world can see the home ownership rate did you see an image from that area and with that comes the largest need for home improvement products as well home improvement financing mhm HVAC leading lick the number one leader in that in the platform so\nWe were we we we fought tooth and nail to for now\nTrying to find the best financing platform for our clients\nWho needed to upgrade rates racist system a Tracy systems over ten years older and it would be impacted by this phase out\nSo we're to companies step up and he said well they said Percy we will give your company enough money to do twelve thousand installations\nThroughout the Richmond area so quite naturally we can't do that by herself so we said we're gonna we're gonna partner with other contractors\nThey may have clients in in the city of Atlanta like Sonia East Point College Park software and counting Stone Mountain Clayton County ... contractors ... homeowners that have been they've been used to working with their contractors in the past and they they have that\nDowning Stone Mountain Clayton County ... contractors ... homeowners that have been they've been used to working with their contractors in the past and they they have that that camaraderie if we'll we can we can provide that contract with finance the right to do your installation and we can count towards our numbers in the grand scheme of things\nDo to be clear threshold is twelve thousand for this for this for this round here okay All right cool cool All right I'm gonna hold you over the next spring we had to take a break let me come back at one time you get into that by Hitler's sure an installation and financing Becky thank you very much at both for eight and I just I mean there are three
