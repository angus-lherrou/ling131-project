anything about people that want to do with their credit or bring that up because my cousin just got by somebody that hold them your doctor your credit repair this and that you got the for a couple of hundred bucks but I Know like maybe you that if somebody said our credit\nFor actually we've had ... just like you know this year we had a husband and wife team\nAnd they got the truth okay we had

own franchises in JR crickets and a few other things\nThey have a great lifestyle and they went through the process themselves they didn't take some course and then try to say oh you want it they actually went through the process\nI started the process personally about two years ago and by the grace of God my traded isn't really really good shape today so it doesn't take on a long time but there are some practical things you need to know I'm a brother or if you would man\nEmailed me that request so I can get you of vetted organization that I can trust\nOkay that'll work Archie got my email but if\nA rich E. R. I. C. H. E.

it comes to the game you know that\nExcellent Ritchie through the scene yup All right thank you so fed\nYour brother appreciate your call saw that your cousin got ripped off for zero for now to do seven zero three that gives you the conversation and let's go to Doug in Atlanta dug a day\nYes it's a this is Doug Doug what's happening I wanted to I Want to tell you about this this or that thing where are you talking about the um the cemetery where that whatever whatever right guy and they never did a study on\nThe same say that again\nIt was out in the city was I'll tell you this do to what the cemetery where they were when what they what they are we talking about Camilla\nCamilla right right it was a good report censored thing but the thing was I never heard to tell him that we don't care about being buried with white folk and use a new system but don't don't fight against their head they had put in little to\nKeep black folks at once I Am white folks that are that are willing to to kill a shoot painted black coal we don't care about being ...\nLet me help you understand that wasn't the point and say here's why hold up here's one or one that never wants to point the point was this one of the city on cemetery which meant that the Seventy percent of black residents were paying for all\nOf the cemetery grounds number one number two it right the city this was a city owned cemetery oh so you're paying taxes\nSo that it right the Seventy percent of African American population was paying for the whole cemetery in addition to that the fence that separated the white side and the black side if you looked at my documentary which is on peach tree television and CBS forty six news\nThe documentary clearly shows that the black side of the cemetery is not kept it all is a delay\nForty six news that documentary clearly shows that the black side of the cemetery is not kept it all\nIs a dilapidated falling apart or the tombstones are broken and know the white side as well maintain however once again Seventy percent of the black folks that are who are paying taxes are paying to upkeep the white side but they're not up keeping the blacks and so that was the issue\nUnderstanding yes I\nYou know it's a good point because when it comes to my federal dollars in my city my city money uh\nYou needed to be fair you needed to me say this is your money your band\nThat need to be fair I told a group which yes but my point is oh no no no opt to paved now okay well\nJust flip that on in a unique to slip and then let them know that really don't care but when it comes to win but when it comes to be with life or we don't care\nIs obvious you drink beer sir\nFor the real point now too to seven zero three I've got carried and rubber they're tearing good they welcome\nAverage shot how are you great Karen how are you\nHappy Friday to you let me turn my radio down okay so I think really that he is not going to be confirmed I don't think it I don't see it happening\nYou think the women the female Republican or maybe Jeff Flake\nThose women those women Republican senators are not going to be able to confirm they're not going to be able to vote yes they had a\nWhole of attorneys go see one of them yesterday and these were attorneys across the aisle democratic and Republican ... attorney female attorney came to office I think in ... they said it was so many of them they had the scheduling into different meeting\n'em and they had\nClosed door sessions with her I think this was the one is from Alaska and they told her that if she votes no then they get her for her election she cannot afford to go in there and not and and not\nUm adhere to their commands and enter and their demands and there's a justice on this situation she definitely the one and I left that she's not going to vote yet\nI don't see it happening and can you still hear me we're yes\nOkay so and the other thing is I think that more than anything\nYou've got to look at the whole\nThe whole situation the big picture of this lady vote this women vote 'em it's just devastating for the Republicans for them to put this guy in that office it's not going to happen for now even the ones that were like Lindsey Graham and the rest of 'em and Lindsey Graham said something last week and I thought was very telling he said that this vote\nIs not how you vote the vault determines how what their future is going to be like in the Senate\nLike they already know that whatever they however they vote that's what their constituency is going to look at as to end the term of whether or not they get reelected and\nThey have downsize the woman vote so much the old white I'm Republican it that they don't see the value of it did you see that um click on the other senator that within the elevator not um flight but the other one no um\nWhere he told the told the girl the ... the woman to grow up and he wages hanner like get out of\nMy no ... yeah yes I saw that and there was another incident afterwards was really an infant and it was Mitch McConnell basically defending that US Senator saying\nAll of these people who to remind people my members\nOr we will not be swayed\nRight yeah they don't they don't they don't understand that they don't appreciate the magnitude of this situation it's going to really\nThey don't appreciate the Marlins pitcher and they don't like it a marker see they really don't watch it\nAnd the last thing I Want to say 'cause I Know you have a lot of college but the other dangerous piece of is that people don't understand is if you keep moving the bar as to what our laws are you we're gonna end up in a situation the consequences of that ... is that we'll have a society\nThat says well since you don't follow the laws I don't have to follow the law does that you\nYou cannot ... this is a very dangerous place for us to be because you cannot keep moving to scale over to see what's right for you when these laws of what we've you still are bad you know just to keep law in this country right so if you if it's good for you to just say I don't want to do it and I'm not going to do it and I can do it this way\nTo keep law in this country right now if you if it's good for you to say\nI don't want to do it and I'm not going to do it this way then the rest of the world is like the rest of the country will do it as well so I'm hoping that we get this right\nThank you thank you for taking my call I appreciate\nIt I appreciate your call I've said this many times and fractions only as strong as enforcement\n\nSomeone commits an infraction\nNothing will happen to that person if there's no real to enforce the rule of law\nSo what you write\nAs policy protocol or law means absolutely nothing without men and women who are in place\nTo enforce it\nAnd willing to do so the infraction is only as strong as enforcement for zero for eight nine to two seven zero three let's go to get again in Atlanta Gideon good they welcome\n... ... ... ... ... ... to ... to you or do you uh same here you are you know you've got to keep a job you've got to keep a roof over your head\nWell I'm going to do that sir no matter what 'cause I bet on me\nYes sir that's a understood\nRight but you know it sounds like this whole don't run before you continue it sounds as if you are seeing you waiting that I'm saying something out of the need of money\nSo let's go back to that point is that what you're saying no I Am\nSaying that I Do you understand I got to keep a roof over my head I got it so what does that mean what are you talking about what was your point that if I\nCan relate to call and we'll go ahead I show you talked about this a document called the constitution\n... to bury document that was used to slave your ancestors that will use\nThe euro and therefore in Wales rather they will your ancestors too sir right exactly\nOur ancestors Yes sir that was ... I was used to\nCommit genocide cake land and just devastate your and my ancestors are called man after I called in and show clearly\nThat it is a law when they talked about all the NBA created equal and use it it\nJust so I don't disagree with any of that I've also said that the constitution the founders the frame of state and write the constitution for people that look like you or not this was not a country founded on the principles of democracy this was a country founded on founded on the principles principles of rich white\nMen should rule the world that's why you were a white man\nWho own property you were the only person who could actually both white men that did not own property couldn't even vote you have to own property you had to be influential affluent rich that's what they want it so it was a written as a democracy it was written as their democracy because they controlled the pen\nBecause it's a farce and it always has been\nLet's do this I Know you've got more to say and then the other hand I Know you've got more to say we'll come back to the other side of the break\nAll right for the role for eight nine to two seven zero three anything goes friday rulers man on radio\nThis theory ... district attorney of Henry county and when I Want to get real I listen to a real tough with ...

know\nA little bit about who's going to be your field moving forward for this year who is surprise you who's impressed you and it was also disappointed you you got the NHL season starting the other day you got the NBA season right around the corner but some big matchups early\nAnd you also got college football which has already now six weeks it so you got a ton of games you got all the major sports participating in something\nAnd that's why they got ... the best month when\nYou could still go to a football game I was at the Patriot game on Thursday night and Fox furlough patriots colds\nPatriots now make it to a narrow after the two game losing streak and I was able to wear shorts and a T shirt to the game in October usually that does then I get to happen so he has something

start the show because you had four games yesterday\nAnd if you want to separate them by the league\nAnd the only one game and on each side with the AOL so you can't say that either team has done yet\nBut the scale you have some real juicy entertaining matchups with the Yankees and the red Sox in the first time in the postseason since two thousand and four where as they don't want our mind bent Horwitz but the Yankees were up three not thing and then\nWe all know what happened in games four or five six seven or the bloody sock with Curt Schilling endgame sex and then just the disaster of a game seven in Yankee Stadium so the Yankees they do fall to the Boston Red Sox last night Red Sox up one nothing\nAnd with the actors in the Indians they shouldn't be a fun series you since you got to be one topped out but the Indians have very good starting pitching their players that have been there and done that before so the AOL you're entertained as those series there only one nothing but today later today is going to be very telling because of the Yankees go down\nTo I Know they were down to last year to the Indians and they came back\nBut you don't feel great about the Yankees they follow the oh two and then at the Indians go to and they fall into two deficit even though they go back home even though I feel great about that either so if you are I Am a baseball fan that is

nail it's one thing with both those theories just getting starting yesterday\nI understand sometimes you have to play a little bit more games than you would like on a given day react to throw up or matchups yesterday but as a baseball fan it's just so tough to watch it it really is\nI like it more when and how it's set up for today and also Sunday where you got the ... games with the Indians and the Astros the Yankees at the red Sox and then on Sunday you got Milwaukee a Colorado Los Angeles at Atlanta when you have to ask a baseball fan\nAnd it's just when you can maybe when some of the younger generation over when you ask gay young\nFan or even maybe an older person I get it there's baseball a traditional once they were gonna watch every game got to watch every pitch sit there with the beer that peanuts their cracker Jack\nAnd ... and I love the post season\nWhen you ask a ban yesterday and I'm coming from a Mets fan perspective let's say someone with with the dog that don't have a dog in a fight\nIs not being Indian than actual Santa Rockies fan brewers fan Yankees Red Sox that lantern dodge\nWith the dog now does have a dog in a fight this is not being an Indian Santa Astros fan or Rockies fan brewers fan Yankees Red Sox that lantern Dodgers where you're going to watch your team play and maybe some of the other match ups as well\nBut if you're talking to someone like myself that doesn't have\nA dog in this race and you just want to watch\nThese games to ask a fan to make a board game commitment in one day it's just too much baseball\nI watch to baseball games a day but when you asked me to watch who you might use than than Colorado in Milwaukee Yankees Red Sox and Atlanta\nAt all I it's just too much and one day and all the odds are listening audience I watched a little bit of Cleveland I use them I caught maybe a few at bats at Colorado Milwaukee I watch the entire Yankees Red Sox game\nAnd maybe I saw happening of Atlanta at a law but if you want to\nPut on a schedule and we don't want the season going into mid November but if you put on a schedule like you did today and tomorrow\nObviously wants is college football but uh we were not used to know the whole way on a computer when the Yankees were the red socks off it up the whole why don't mix in my college football there but when you ask a band to make that commitment for four games and you're not going to do that especially when you're trying to win over a younger generation\nWe're baseball I've been fading in some parts and what what's the problem with people my age and younger we all have short attention spans\nOur attention spans thank Charles Barkley was terrible man they are but that's a bad to make that commitment for four games that are doing that come on\nYou agree or disagree well like when he was very anymore written you really did you watch all these four games that I\nKnow because I had work but if you're a fan you're going to watch regardless and you just mentioned they're trying to market to a younger generation well what better time than on a friday when nothing else is going on\nAnd you still the spotlight you know for the entire day you're complaining about four games in one day I don't know how to handle an NFL Sunday or better yet are you going to handle a college football Saturday tomorrow when you've got wall to wall games greater intrigued more excitement\nI'm not saying baseball postseason as an exciting because it is very much but NFL that's to me I'm used to and that's what I'm program that's my religion on Sunday I get off the chips I get out the food\nSit on the couch I make my small bats I lose my money and I watch football from start to finish them locked him with my fantasy team locked him with my team and that's what I Am accustomed to and that's what I Do all the time and baseball and I'd get during the regular see job on seven eight nine ten eleven twelve Thirteen game tonight\nBut in the regular semi watch it all those games I watch my team and then maybe what the big national match up is on Sunday night or what what's a Fox game on a Sunday afternoon but in a post season and it's only one day we had the foreign and for in a row and usually they do a good job and to peace but that that than to make that commitment for four games\nCurious what the numbers were for those four games I really am I didn't get a chance to see him I don't know if they're out yet because the games just ended but for four games a commitment that just to money when you're not going out\nEvery than to sit there for all four games they're not the goal is to make every market be able to tune in to their teams game without being distracted by something else so if I'm a Yankee fan yeah I'm getting jacked up for seven thirty\nBe able to tune in to their teams game without being distracted by something else\nSo if I'm a Yankee fan yeah I'm getting jacked up for seven third whatever to play a Yankees Red Sox and prime time all the time right sooner brain but he regardless if another teams you know a fan of another team up on the end of the Astros let's say I'm locked into my teams game and then maybe I'm In ... later at the seven thirty\nThey're not trying to get everyone to watch every single game they're trying to get each team's market locked in onto their game where they don't have to be distracted and you don't have multiple games going simultaneously sue the baseball fan that isn't working and the baseball fan that cares can watch multiple let me ask\nYou this though let's say if they would've just scheduled two games apiece\nYou're more likely to watch Colorado at Milwaukee if you were available to watch than if you are in a four game stretch what is the industry to make the commitment to Colorado Milwaukee for Ben Horwitz an east coast guy out when you have to you have\nThe Indians Asher is also available Yankees Red Sox at length that the Dodgers in the same given day what's the injury and even for the series still at the same question given\nDay intrigues I'm a baseball fan and I want to watch the sport if they're on at the same time I have no interest unlocked in

start\nWith the titans to kick off the two thousand Eighteen football season a quarter of the way in but let's go out to the phone lines right now they backed by two on two for CBS and we've got things going in New Jersey with our friend Bobby first up is that gap on CBS Sports radio what's happened in body\nYou know I'm I'm Wondering why ah why ... why some picked up by the Yankees mid season\nNo because the Yankees they didn't want to part with Miguel and do our org labor tours and the Mets are going to ask for a king's ransom\nFrom the Yankees for Jacob do ground because eat maybe they would have been open to trying to the ground but to trade into the Yankees is a whole different component and the Mets would have wanted more than what they were asking because you don't want to hand someone over to someone\nIn your own state and then have them when the world series and also the Yankees have control for him for two years is the way the grounds contractors set up so\nDid you want to give up tours ... or and do our\nYeah take their Yankees be up for one nothing right now if a ...\nI don't think the pitching and half was not good last night and the problem was was flying you'd probably get a classic between the ground and sale\nBut if the grounds on the Yankees that's not the big takeaway for me from last night it was in effect in the seventh inning when you've got him back in the game you have the bags full twice tourists going to get a base said and then John Carlos stand in the lucrative player you know gets paid a lot of money he strikes out four times when he was up ...\nThat was my next question what do you think about than I was just\nWas terrible I think it's a good deal yeah no it's it's a no brainer for what you gave up or the lack of what you gave up it's it's a no brainer and he's going to get criticized for it and the way that he's played is going to get criticized but here's the beauty baseball you play again you play today and you better show up\nBut you're not going to play around them in the wild card game when it hits home run\nYour it shouldn't be complain about and for most of the regular season there's been some stretches where he was called but John Carlos stand and there's a baseball player but I'd be\nIt shouldn't be complain about him for most of the regular season there's been some stretches where he was called but John Carlos stand and there's a lack of baseball player one of the big drag them would want him on a different team from Yankee fan I Would still watch I'm going to stand on my team but he got to be better

better produced in a big way on Saturday Night it's not just going to get worse and worse and worse for John Carlin no see boy so far less than that you got to show up at your him and he did it last night in the red Sox benefit from it\nBut that Boston team as great as they are with Martina is Ben Ben attendee and a new one with pneumonia is and all the players they have tremendous sitting deem have good starting pitching David Price a concern going into tonight though\nAnd will know very early on what David Price you have and then also that bullpen might've kimbrell it's it's a concern and the Yankees K through the series and it's going to determinant can they put runs up on the board and can they capitalized in big spots\nWhen you get to start at the game and you're waiting for chemical to come on\nLast night they got three runs but they could have got more and because they did not get more is the reason they lost the game not you know Jacob the problem is the Yankee or not you can't get everyone on the Yankees yeah you can have the the all star team of the Yankees broadcast\nBut it's done a tremendous job would judge was standing with your Dorey as a with Darren Hicks who got hurt last night ... boys and two heart towards you have a great team\nSo I don't want to hear about that oh it's got the grounds you got to know your back seat to show up in the bathroom and

CBS Sports radio three in a row for the Tennessee Titans winds up against the Texans jaguars and last week in up against the Philadelphia Eagles which was\nA thrilling come from behind victory now joining us as a quarterback\nFor the Tennessee Titans it gets set to face the bills coming up Sunday at one PM eastern in Buffalo and that of course is Logan Ryan is kind enough to join us right now on CBS Sports radio Logan thanks for the time and how are ya\nI'm good how about you know\nWhile I'm doing fantastic and that was some football game last Sunday when you guys are down Seventeen to three I did count you out of the football game and I was the one that ended up looking stupid for that how did you guys turnaround up against Philly in which was a great effort by your football team\nI don't think you're the only one that uh looks better [laughter] and I found this out\nOf them as we did it and then the other players and coaches rather matter when it comes on Sundays\nAnd uh we just stuck to it man we got a little more aggressive we started against him stops on defense and obviously a quarterback mark is quite a great game and core Davis and often wherever they make those costs Tom equation for a quarter and then over time to um you know cars to victory we just try to\nUh stop which played better eventually was shut down and we did but we just did it better when it when the pressure was on\nYou mentioned your quarterback I saw a statistic yesterday seven game winning drives in his last sixteen games you guys convert fourth and fifth genes for four and then obviously the fourth in to on a way to a touchdown for a victory just watch it on the sideline what is it like to watch the markets Mario to operate it all fence especially in ...\nI mean it's it's awesome you kind of ... and is able to do something about two minutes he's able to put someone\nIn jobs together and we know either later this team we know we're often you know he's one of our best players\nAnd a and B the parents are Quebec or reason and you know labor made a good point you know three weeks ago or San Marcus is no good and and you know we're no good and now they're part of the week you know that's how this works\nYou got to try to ignore the noise that you can believe in yourself which markets always does and I and I do personally and stick with the process and you know both opportunities coming up ...\nYou gotta love what channel on how to say after the game how he thinks the titans deserve more respect especially with you guys taking down the Superbowl champs and the jaguars and back to back weeks do you feel that a lack of respect that you guys get nationally and and how much does that motivate you guys\nDon't everybody has to have a chip on his show a partially wherever they're drafted wherever wherever team skipped the um national media picked again you know everyone picked against us I mean there is\nKept them um national media\nPicked again you know everyone picked against us I mean there's\nThere's W motivational factors you could definitely use that uh but you know respect as are and and I think we're starting to earn it uh with you know all this you know new media attention I Would say but um you know we've got to keep it doesn't matter if we don't win this we gotta we gotta keep her role and we've got to take a take on buffalo you saw they did the Minnesota\nI'm so we got to keep her own and all that stuff will come and do time\nYet to lump channel does it make you can be four games running around after games with the titans flag and you must be some character inside that locker room\nMate passionate that's what makes them into one of the best in the game is as passionate as well for the game he believes it all out there and and people know ... and he talked to the game but he backs that up too so uh you know that that just saying that you know generally Hammond is greater than ... great TV I'm sure I have a cat or shown to\nLogan rhyme with this right now and CBS Sports radio so you got started on the year up against the dolphins in a game that are literally with like never ending with all the lightning delays and all that you guys end up losing that game especially with all that was being said about you and the off season then you lose tackles left and right\nA quarterback goes down with an injury for a little bit\nHow did you block out all the noise to get this team to where they have to be on a three game winning streak\nStuck with it man stuck with it were blue collar two weeks later a lot of close games Miami game was a close game for seven hours um we we just we just take away that we're not afraid to play for corridors ah we run the ball would play good defense we play good special teams and I were a bunch of other dogs\nA bunch of guys with chips on their shoulders Ron afraid to get dirty and and do what it takes the blame them and uh we're driving off that with the ugly wins we're thriving off that stuff right now I'm actually exciting football when he watches because you never know how to learn to do it but we'll find ways to do it and people are stepping up\nIt is exciting football and I think the message or coach you send my brain balloons and come applying the national football league that message is really resonating with you guys just take me through you know what the biggest differences with him your number one is the head coach of National Football league in what you've been seeing\nFormer player you understand that he understands how the media where she understands the highs and lows of the ... he's a good job of staying pretty neutral through that and we keep our eyes on the ... he puts his hand in the dirt and he and he goes out there and he does want a ones that are often tobacco\nHe says are linebackers how to do some things so he's not afraid to to get physical and parents have go out there and practicing and rapid and show you exactly what he wanted but he does a good job of telling you what he wants done showing what he was gone and expecting it to be done and I think um\nEverybody's you know trying to get to that feeling of you know doing their job and doing it well understands that team scored and I think being a a former turn that have been on good terms and trying to bring that to this thing\nLogan if you watch your coach play when he was with the New England patriots everyone knows his ability to make a great open field tackle but he also caught some big catches ... and his career does he ever talk it up a little bit of the fence to give him his expertise on his back catching abilities\nI mean you could catch up I don't think he made his hey at the time he was wind it up on whatever ones\nMeanwhile the home runs on the LA side made in China would chew on shot he has money ... shots Dodgers beat the brains of three ...\nAnd again LA leads the series two games to none meanwhile the other division series in the national league\nIt's been all brewers they beat the Rockies for announcing now Milwaukee leads that series two games to none Julie ... seem to five innings three it's no runs three strike out\nAnd again the brewers and Rocky's will head back to Denver with Milwaukee leading Colorado\nTwo games to none meanwhile the American league both division series get underway on friday Red Sox hang on to beat the Yankees five four it was fine nothing yanks claw their way back to a single run Aaron Judge in a home run in the ninth inning of Craig kimbrell\nBut that's as close as the yanks would get Judy Martinez a three run shot crew sales\nFive and a third to weren't a case he earns the wind kimbro gets the final four ounce for the same again Red Sox have a one hour series leave\nThe defending champions also eh but one of those series lead ... to just in Berlin or five at a third to warn seven caves Maldonado with al ...

insurance spending now junior going to join us in about Fifteen minutes the junior running back from Kentucky and our picks this week we will pick the Kentucky game and we will do our picks for college football right now or three games right now let's see if that means you present them [noise]\n\n\nAnother week in the college football season all states standing at the end of the segment has to do some quick math and sometimes that takes a whole lot longer than I think but I Do believe bent Horowitz is still in the lead and has a little bit of room to Michael and feel a little bit comfort\nIt's a whole lot longer than I think but I Do believe Ben Horowitz is still in the lead and has a little bit of room to Michael and feel a little bit comfortable but we shall see it as we continue this ... in the college football season let's get to the games will start things off\nWith Texas Oklahoma Oklahoma is a seven point favorite\nHere's an interesting nugget\nTodd Orlando who is the D.C taxes has had a lot of success up against Lincoln Riley\nIn two thousand and six years on the eastern saps that did shut down Oklahoma and got the victory and then last year the only team in the nation's hold Oklahoma to under thirty points just at twenty nine but so under thirty this is a game where\nI'm probably going to hate myself for land the seven points with Oklahoma for most of the white because I think Texas is a little bit competitiveness competitive and maybe they could even take the lead and this ball game but right now\nI just have a tough time picking again Tyler Murray and what he's been able to do for this Oklahoma team of fun match up\nSeven versus Nineteen and Oklahoma and Texas and give credit to Tom permanent got off to start this year was hearing a lot of noise and the the the way that his team has bounced back\nIs a good effort at a nice job after what happened with Marilyn there on a a little bit of a win streak four straight games they beat us the they'd be TCU I just think Oklahoma's the different animal and they'll have some fun\nFun at the end of the day Lincoln Riley and column or you have more fun give me Oklahoma laying the seven points hard with what you got\nLove that you took Oklahoma because I'm going to go the other way jackass\nThe sooner had been just fine without making me feel that your thanks as you pointed out to the red hot started ...\nWith the talent the sooner than I've often there should be some big place to be hot however belong or in the sense has surprised that we're holding us see see see you and Kansas State all and shy\nLittle nugget for you how about that over the chicken nuggets over the last four meetings between these two teams every time it's been decided by seven or fewer points\nAnd with Oklahoma's big playoff inside expect taxes to leading the climate possession which would allow them to mitigate some of what Oklahoma dolphins is capable of former wins they can protect the keeps a close enough I'll take the long weren't was seven\nFigure twenty eight twenty four it just broke my heart out right now or a step I Know you're taking Oklahoma\nYou're wrong jak taking taxes yeah\nOne of us are going to be one of us are going to be right that's true one of us will be wrong so that was\nMore likely to be using me as a gimme gimme Texas or like Ben said history is on the long horn side a week when you take a spreading into account and the sooner we just had a history of keeping people in game so far this year so you mean the only one\nVery go getting number one in the book scan number to throw a little curve ball here to try to get some good mojo going and maybe just try to break a street could get a little superstitious year LSU at Florida\nLSU a to point favorite Horowitz go first [noise]\nLet's see if you you know show us what your will react I Love your like I'm going to throw a little wrinkle what that means is I don't know where I'm going no no no no I'm going to react on Saturday where I'm going to have the uh the Picard you've written Daryl halls icy or write anything with your pet I'm going to call yeah I'm doing some at them and we all\nKnow how filthy Florida defense is and that's really the only way to put their third and turnover margin that fit in takeaways\nAll know how filthy Florida as defense is and that's really the only way to put their third and turnover margin and sit and take away is in the nation we know that Florida is often isn't going to explode against the LSU defense\nWho helped a couple of guys that are going to be playing in the NFL very short that means that joke rural won't have to take too many chances and he still has yet to throw an interception I could see borough managing a low scoring game and being able to do enough late just to squeak by so I like LSU to win\nViolate field goal give me a list of your mind is to\nBan harvest by the way with a four game lead on myself and also receptors for cell phone I have\nHad the same record this year and then we got all the help from Brian jak with him but for credit Ben for the expertise so far ... from what you got\nTaken LSU I Can't believe I'm going to say this but I'm going to depend on LSU often and it and an eight or drawn off and to make more pleasing somebody else the meal is if\nI go tigers I Love LSU in this law in\nFlorida the way they win this game as the environment and the swamp and making jokes borrow turn over the football LSU just has a better defense LSU to me it's just the better team and borrow has not turned over the football with interceptions this year LSU\nI think that they win this game I think they may be winning by ten plots\nBut this is the start of a very tough run for al as you were we will learn a lot about this football team as you have Florida you have Georgia Mississippi State whose fading when they play a big teams and you have Alabama a top four games stretch\nYou don't want to start it off with an el up against Florida\nI don't think they're looking ahead to Georgia Florida that's a tough environment if you look ahead you'll get creamed in this game but I like LSU to win this game you got to go with that and that or is there on so go tigers we will take LSU\nAlright get number three that means we're all analysis you means if you're in Tallahassee, Florida because the three of us of profit the wrong a good number three that's one of seven pm eastern Kentucky and then ... junior going to join us in a few moments from now we'll talk to him get his thoughts that I Am and\nWhat they're able to do the first few weeks of the college football season at five and I would open up at six and a half\nI seen it go down to four and a half the line I'm seeing right now though is that five and a half\nWill go to great set folks first Kentucky I Am\nCollege Station Kentucky is a five and a half point under dog the am team five and a half point favorites what'd you got for Saffo\nI'm taking the Wildcats they have to be one of the best stories of college football they're undefeated as you've said they they're undefeated as underdogs against the spread give me the Wildcats miss the harlot\nI Know that now coming on the shows that don't don't annoy him know and he's been terrific to is basically the entire up and it's on his back and we all know that\nBought Texas saying then is the best in the FCC against Iran\nAnd the question I asked is what is Kentucky do if they're not able to establish the world do you trust Terry Wilson to put the office on his back\nIdol I Would expect them to shut a a snow down but not completely wow they'll do just enough to be able to win the game guinea Texans saying them to cover twenty\nSeventy impressed by what they did up against ... and then also a little bit up against Alabama [noise] I was writing Mississippi State\nImpressed by what they did up against ... and then also a little bit up against Alabama [noise]\nI was writing Mississippi State when they play Kentucky I mentioned the defense of statistics we all know Benny now ended up going for a hundred and sixty five yards and not one not to not three but four rushing touchdown this'll be a close game I think it's a toss up on who wins it\nBut Kentucky as an underdog they'd been disrespected the entire year and there's still five in oh I like Benny ... junior I'm not going to tell that guy no\nGive me Kentucky to stay within five and a half so I Will take them getting a five and a half points so to recap these games real quickly as we have some disagreement again which so far it's gone in the favor Mr ... Horowitz Alice you in Florida we're all\nOn LSU land the to the games we disagree on Kentucky ad and um you just heard it myself ...\nThere and that would be very well thanks\nDoing good man thank you for having me\nWell thanks for coming on and we appreciate it so I Want to start five now or this team is not only winning games but you're dominating your opponent just what it is it like right now to be around what is such a special group and it's great I could see\nWho are getting better every day you know the um the vibe to outline now now the fans of showing a bunch of them left and the um in our society you know we've came that far but we we haven't released on for a temp job yet so we've got we've got a lot left in this\nWhat this team and we all saw the victory up against Florida where are you guys snap that thirty one game losing streak\nAnd then a few weeks later you're back it up against Mississippi State and to me that victory up against the Mississippi State or the most impressive because it displayed to me that you guys weren't satisfied with the a quick start and that this group still has a whole lot of hungry football sell the show to the rest of the nation\nYou know it's very definitely starting off with the port again you know just prior years before that you know we were just so close\nYou know we were just we were just got the ads and we weren't able to fitness and you know we were beating are serving like a bone headed today or you know like they will come away with the room going forward we remember it with ... like\n... in especially leave women who are waiting for his was\nAnd we were covered in their environment a big environment exposing them and we were away we just wanted to focus on clinical testing football um especially standard technique term and we were able to predict the guarantee them stronger and that would be going into the study that was a big opponent\nYou know great competition and we were going to be war from the start putting and\nAll I could really say that to a girl that he could get an incredible job getting a bar in our pockets of murdered a great job\nOr if they're going to run that great a practical but we could come in at the pool\nAnd the seven\nAnd I caught the interview that you did with the FCC network after the Mississippi State victory and you said hey everyone's been doubting us I'm really proud of my team and I want to keep on proven people wrong it makes me wonder and ask you where did you think this team was going to be when you guys wearing camping getting ready for the season\nI think this is what I expected it to me I really expected good um since last year you know I could do that the team this year is different\nEvery body floating on a plan of wanting to get better here and there are no ... there's a lotta out All right you know in the\n... um you know what ... what are their dog schools provide we both get as you move to the drift in a run over or I made it clear cut a program and got very clear around here that that's not the case you\nKnow going going forward it could have said that the ... that we're going to be a powerhouse in what we're making a turnaround now and what we don't want to be under governor more because on the game that we would quote quote I'm going to get so close and we would make a mistake to this losing the game so\nBeing able to finish I happened to credit line and that's how the company and me being in the good things to cook that's where we need to be so I'm excited\nYou look from your freshman year and you've always had success personally act Kentucky to see where this program has grown in the way that you've grown now what's different from when you came in and two thousand and six team to where we currently sit in the year two thousand Eighteen with\nIt's grown in the way that you've grown at what's different from when you came in and two thousand and sixteen to where\nWe currently sit in the year two thousand Eighteen with you know once you learn what you've seen from this program\nI could see the war I could see I could see the ... the grind of a lot more players when they're not have my first one\nI could send me my I'm prior years you know are we used to have those teams now fires you know that they would they would take it would take the life out of the team go into the practice you're going in the gang and you know it was bringing it will bring some of the guy down sort of the teams are\nNow going going into this year after Lehman lady\nUh especially with um the ... the feared right now with the guys always wonder will get better guy who spend extra time in ... outside of ...\nI'm I'm I have questions for things could be could pass questions for an author and so we're constantly getting better when making each other better every single day because you can only get work or you can get better every day and around here to protect you got to get better every day so\nIt's a great thing um how we grown grown so much especially more from our old acidity students got the million dollars could have looked for Seventy so they were just on the on the upper hand or\nTalking about any snow junior right now the Kentucky Wildcats running back on CBS Sports radio\nWhy did you go to Kentucky I understand that you were someone that were overlooked and the recruiting process but why was Kentucky the right school for you\nThat the Kentucky was perfect for me because I I Know I Know what it was like ... ... ... and\nUm when when looking at Kentucky when when I was getting recruited\nIt wasn't they weren't on they weren't on the top level that they could be you know I could see that we're getting better than your breath when I when I came here and they included a good start my family right away\nAnd when I was able to sit down with coast to coast where are you know who could have I Would I was so into the Clinton right away that they would have been like this turn around and as he he\nYou know and I know that I Would go with what my son off to be able to get a position and be able to play on the moon so it was all appeal for dinner and you know especially with the the new for charity I'm\nGone for this cat and who you know God to my class that we are just so ... so and\nWe made it clear in straight like this is what we're going to do we know we can do it so it was a time executed\nAnd this is why I Love the most about college football when you get guys that are under dogs and that they're going out to the football field than they are in everything and they're not given something and you see your story you know you were a three star recruit\nA yeah help lead your your prep school to to Ohio capital conference titles are three straight division one playoff appearances\nBio says overall record in high school thirty five insects and your senior year\nYou went for over a hundred yards and twenty nine touchdowns you just look back at that resume that I just gave you a from where you were in high school and prep school\nAnd you say how did you not go to a bigger program how did you use being overlooked and how did you deal with the recruiting process at the time and not let it really get a gym make the best out of the situation\nSure you know I'm I could just going to say I love I Love football like home 'cause love gambling in our in our cars record true like when my heart so whenever I'm at a camp or you're going to give them all I'm not dropping no balls\nAnd when and I and I just love your true like when my heart so whenever I'm at a camp\nOr I'm going to give them all I'm not dropping no balls I'm I'm always first in line and I was either my all at the camp and they were still given the ... if you'd be it really just awkward really found that they were just taking to the to some of the game out of it like\nJust in just in just over thinking about that like I just know that if my all every single time I stuck between the white line and that's all I Know\nAnd it's all it all comes from passing your heart right\nI just got a couple of up with it then so no matter no matter what they call them ... weren't store or whatever I Know ... who an unnoticed who who do that again and\nAll that has caught the eye and this guy is not lie film will always always you know it's a two person and a true our troops troop player on on the field so you know I all I Know all of that was the play hard knows full well we're never find the time so I was good folks with that\nI Would have to imagine you're a competitive nature we talk to your football coach march due to a few weeks ago is very contagious in that facility and you're all about hard work and you probably practice just as hard as you playing the games it does anyone you know practice harder than you did that the team made a viewers like what's your practice is like\nA a occupy a um I Know about\nThat one [laughter] I go I go hard every day they shot on the map Choctaw [laughter] I'd have to talk to them but you know they were asking you made is ugly guy the guy the guy tried our you know they get a caller in on back\nThere so it just makes everyone better on the team and if it is a good thing definitely a good thing\nOr the recognition for Kentucky football's been great to see this year it's we're talking ... junior or what does it mean to you had your name even thrown into the conversation even though it's early for the Heisman Trophy\nOh it's definitely a blessing ... it'd be happy\nAnd it will be a long time coming

attention especially where I'm at and where does seem that and how well window but I could just I\nCan't say that you know I'm blessed of course but it's kinda late\nYou know they're they're saying hires magnetized than that now because we're winning but my numbers have always been there that that's the thing so it could it it's a good thing I'm I'm happy about it but you have we have way more

the way but you heard him Peters update a lot about baseball as this this time of the year I think October is the best sports month\nOut of the twelve on the calendar because you had the baseball playoffs yeah the NHL just getting started you got the NBA right around the corner you gotta NFL football already a quarter of the way in as we're now in week five so you start to get a feel and get a sense of who is and who are the teams that\nAre really starting to look like contenders and who are the teams that are still trying to show themselves and the teams that are in the gutter right now the orange wants to be the gutter how will they play out the rest of the way\nAnd then we also have college football with a good play the games not great but a good play the games are coming up later

Notre Dame Virginia Tech you get Trevor Lawrence coming back\nFor concern up against Wake Forest so you got some okay games on the schedule Wake Forest clubs and shouldn't be close\nBut there's some intrigued there with Lawrence coming back and the other games you want to see like a team of LSU that's been very good this year and then you're going to Florida and get a victory\nOr Kentucky going to College Station and get a victory continue their winning ways and then can Notre Dame they new quarterback who's played well go take down Virginia Tech who did lose the Old Dominion\nBy Virginia Tech is better than the team that they did but on the football field when they did lose to Old Dominion so that\nCan can be a little bit closer than what people could thing but for Notre Dame you've gotta went out to get into the college football playoff and each and every week the pressure is going to be on them because they're going to be favorite the rest of the ... but we do have baseball I mean for games yesterday which for me is way too much for games\nAnd I have to pay attention to all these games I didn't watch all these games for full nine innings yesterday I watched the entire Yankees Red Sox game\nI watch most of the used in Cleveland Indians game\nThe Dodgers game up against the Braves are then it gets that much of it's all a little bit of it\nThe brewers and Colorado watched a few innings but for me it's just too much baseball and someone that I don't have a dog in this fight and I want to tune in I Want to watch games like later today\nWhere you had that bizarre start timing for thirty seven pm eastern and then if a team which is fine but I don't know why and sign up for thirty seven just start thinking for thirty for crying out loud\nI'm by those two games on Saturday I watch them in of course I watched both those games with the college football on Sunday when you got two games\nBut those two games on Saturday I watch them in of course I watched both those games with the college football on Sunday when you've got two games more than fun to watch both of them but when you ask the baseball fan to watch for games at a day it's just way too many\nIt's too much baseball especially when you're trying to get the attention and garner the attention of the younger fans who have short attention spans that's up to make a four game commitment\nAnd it's just too many games a postseason when you would love love to watch all of them but you just can't get lots of nine innings another ... another ... and then another nine and just too many games but we did have some good baseball yesterday\nAnd that's about baseball in the national\nLeague it's been too disappointing series\nWhere you look at the Dodgers and the Braves the brace haven't shown up offensively and the Dodgers\nThey've shown up with pitching and also what their back there were three oh winter's yesterday they go to own the series ...

with this guy what are you arguing about I'm not reading this all the arguments done he was finally like yeah you're right\nOkay well what was it about nothing he started off about ... ... it was your tweet in response to somebody was somehow I got thrown into it because about the giants and you know I Can't resist [laughter] so he\nSo he says\nThe way the giants are playing now make that a pot on the board a little bit louder next time you replace out dropped or is that far right [laughter] right where it needs to be geez I just got woken up for not loudness All right\nHe said the way the giants are playing now and with the NFC East being a competitive division early\nEarly being the key word I don't see them turning it around anytime soon that was in her apply to you but I guess I was in the threat\nAnd I just said back\nUnderstand what you mean by the NFC East being competitive early you have one team in the division\nAnd I just said back I don't understand what you mean by the NFC East being competitive early you have one team in the division over five hundred\nYeah and you've got the eagles at two and two and the cowboys attuned to write which\nAgain the giants are winning the at a feast but this notion that giants are making the playoffs nine and seven can make the playoffs\nThat you'd think the giants are gonna when nine games you're still riding the strain I don't think it I think it's possible I understand they get a little bit easier schedule you know ... years ear bud schedule but if the back of his questioning their heart\nYou think that this heart will be there after they go through a little bit of losing stretch which it I don't see them turn you think they're gonna be Carolina this week\nI don't but let me ask you what happens if they do\nAnd they do they have to show to me two weeks in a row I said the same thing after the Texans game if they'd be Carolina give him around the applause nice job because I don't think it's going to happen but then you better back it up the next week they beat the taxes and they didn't even ... on the bar you beat\nCarolina and now you're looking at a home game\nAgainst the Philadelphia Eagles who we can all admit or not living up to and playing up to expectations right now either and I know you're on I Know you do you and I sometimes I say that I think that you're a little too overconfident eagles because I'm just looking at what they put on on the field I think they're the best team in the ...\nPeriod bar none but what they put on the field and what they put on tape so far ... has not been good\n... and those that are in the secondary it's been a problem and the ... has been a problem and you don't want a whole lot of games and your second there is a problem in our fence lines of problem tell me about I think the ... yeah I Know some preaching the choir for you because you're you're secondary stinks in Europe and salons terrible\nUm but with the eagles I think they get the offensive line going the secondaries a problem and you need you need a good pass Russian eagles happened to pass rush but I already saw Burnett was ruled out for the game up against Minnesota and then uh in LA not as questionable for the game but as can be a tough one Vikings an eagles is a tough tough tough\nGame I I Would stay away from that actually right now I lean towards the biking and\nAnd let's say you lean towards the Vikings two and three there are two and three the giants win on Sunday there are two and three and now you've got two teams going at each other on in prime time at metlife stadium on Thursday both teams season then kind of hangs in the balance\nBut like I mentioned the giants second half gets easier you set it on the air I've said it all the prognosticators have said that if the giants can get through the first half of their season at five hundred ... they're in good shape\nParents during knows her and I understand that we don't look too far ahead because he didn't get to the games you know coming up yet for this weekend if that was an eagle giant game right now I take the eagles just because two things he goes through and I shall up against the run\nAnd I think they're going to get some success but you didn't have to go off to win in my opinion and then had to the giants block the eagles front which you would assume would be healthy by that and even without this on a lot of names and not defensive front\nThey don't but as you mentioned the eagles offensive line is struggling by that point they should have a giants get a pass Rochelle Olivier Vernon who hasn't played yet back by that Thursday game and that changes a lot of things because I don't think the eagles will be able to run the ball and the\n... now I just got a tweet from I guess he's your friend I vote gee uh he says Eli Manning over the hill agree disagree where you add on your you lie manning radar\nOver the hill is ridiculous [noise] I think that he lied played very poorly last Sunday against the states\nJoining radar over the hill is ridiculous [noise]\nI think that he lied played\nVery poorly last Sunday against the saints and it was evident even from the stance where normally you don't see everything that he was missing opportunities down the field\nMy fear is that as the season goes on he's going to get beaten and battered and turn into what\nHappened to a a David Carr with Houston which is happening to the show I'm watching right now by the right where you just get so beaten and battered you have the ability to play but your first instinct is I Need to go to the check down rather than look for my guys down the field\nThat's what I worry but can you make the throws yes if he's still more than capable of doing all this pre snap breeds reading the defense absolutely\nThat's my concern with him over the hill is ridiculous\nBefore I Will ever believe and the giants this year they got to show me to an around we'll see if they're able to do that you gotta you gotta start off with one and we'll see what happens after that are coming up tonight you got Carlos ... go and gather coal that's all Indians are going up against the ash\nRose that's for thirty seven pm eastern I'm hoping the Indians when the game the square things up at one apiece this Houston team those tough to pick against right now a very tough I think this is a toss up and\nYou got to knock them price you're the numbers on Antarctica seven fifty eight year a verse Boston this year he struggled as late as last year's starts\nFlashing the post season in ... point nine zero and three starts a twenty innings pitched last year so I trust knocking the postseason but there are some questions with them and then David Price five oh three poll\nSeizing the IRA and the Yankees as Pedro Martinez would say are David prices daddy has the Yankees have dominated David Price in his career eventually prices due to beat the Yankees right you have to think\nBoehner is your daddy aim it'd be tough to pick against the Yankees and the sun and it'd be tough\nEven feel greatly confidence in the Yankees in this one the Yankees missed an opportunity last night and the six and seven productive upon tore it's going to come through John Carlos Stanton couldn't come through but we shall see what happens if the Yankees go down to I don't think they'll come back this time around Peter Schwartz is here in\nThe morning Peter how are you I'm doing well how are you sir Yankees win\nTonight uh yeah I think so I think they'll show no level of concern for me oh I don't consider myself actually met when a lot of my life and your ... your islanders right which I'm looking forward\nTo your around yeah I'm looked I wanted to talk to you so you've\nGot ya oh let's just forget about the October baseball or Indians an Asher city like the Astros are going to sweep the sure why all now our bosses a march or not you know the right it's wherever that yes [laughter] so how about that I I'm real quickly I got about twenty\nSeconds that'll get Eric what'll too much baseball yesterday before games yeah forests too much in one day they could spread it out a little bit yeah I didn't like that either just too much that baseball fans have your kids aren't going to sit through for games and they didn't they didn't sit through any of\nI started a couple of years ago that you know I wanted each year you try to sacrifice a little bit and try to change or to do a little more to help out whether it's your individual player just for the team and I was like throughout the week I won't eat desserts or sugar for that matter and then if we win all\nStuffed my faith full of ice cream and candy and and just you know\nMake myself sick 'cause you know you earn it throughout the week you sacrifice a little bit to enjoy those wins and it's kind of ah you know turned into a phenomena of just people love it they want to see what I'm going to do every week and I like it too because it's just I get I get to do what I Love which is when football games and eat some ice cream\nNumber likes to pick out especially after a big football victory when you go home is it just you say a lot of the family then go right to the fridge and just had been there and to the ice cream bowl\nWell usually are on the way home I stopped by the store and I'll go to the local grocery store and get a bunch of items and\nAdd ons and different ice creams and then we'll come home as a family and the kids get a get a a big in as well they make their little bowls and and their toppings and\nI never really know what I Want a so after the game in until I get a good feel walking through the aisles of what I'm feeling a ice cream wise in topping so it's it's always a changing week to week\nTalking Eric went All right now in the ... show on CBS Sports radio the last two weeks you've said that these aren't the same ravens and you guys have backed it up what makes this team different this year\nJust this is a resilient tough group and it starts with our head coach and you know why he preaches and the weight pushes us\nI just this is a resilient tough group and it starts with our head coach and\nYou know what he preaches and the weight pushes us and the way we compete and this is a this is a unique group ah we're very close\nWe push each other and and and it's one single ... single minded and that's when each week a win the day when the play\nAnd those struggles we've had over the last few years really have molded our character in our in our toughness that virtually fit in and had to go through as a built this team up to where we are now that we feel we can get three in a situation and\nYou know we're gonna make a tough on teams that face us is going to be sixty minutes and and we're going to grind out burned out wins and and play racket ball\nBefore the year started I thought you guys were playoff team but I was curious to see how some of the players and coaches would respond with a lot of those guys back up against the wall you mentioned your coach in a ... you know Joe Flaco to these are big years for both these fliers is the attitude they bring a little bit contagious or in your facility right now\nWell I think it's just a steady a confident a blue collar work hard ah type attitude I think it's for everyone I mean it may include it like look if we if we don't play well individually and collect those teams and then everyone isn't going to be back so it's\nIt's not just those two guys it's it's everyone that you play a lot of years in his league you have to play well and you have to win games for to stick around so I think everyone just came in with the right attitude of of\nOne looking at yourself to get better to learn from our mistakes over the years and then three push each other that that have we've never been pushed\nA as far as as we can in and look what look what you can get and\nShoot 'em and Joe is healthy or off into weapons that we've added off into coordinator being here for the third year for Joe I mean a lot of things that have happened that the reasons why we're playing well that a lot of people have taken notice but it's definitely been a team effort and are are the first quarter the season\nI don't know if he ever get over it but how long did it take to put aside how last year finished up against the bangles in that tough week Seventeen last they kept you guys out of the post season and did you sense a little bit of a some extra motivation and training camp a leading up to the started this season\nI mean I I look at myself as one of the you know I'm motivated each year and I I don't need or people say or think or plays I Want to be the best and the and I want to win so regardless of what happened my motivation is always clear\nAnd you know as you get older you tend to deal with losses differently per se is as a young buck that they are a hangs onto each game I got a wife and four kids that that I Love dearly and and they need that at home and can't be moping around and\nAnd not doing my job at home so uh I'll always remember the play or that help us out but it doesn't affect who I Am and how I live my daily life um I'm going to go out and be me and and play my best and live with the results\nYou mentioned the family component of it you had to totally just changed coast when you went from San Diego to Baltimore and it was you know he's not a tough\nUh you know it's very tough and to to your situation and a franchise that you played so many years for just how 'bout the adjustment now being your number three going from San Diego to Baltimore and still having success on the football field does well after the charges basically told you you weren't good enough\nYeah yeah it's been it's been a great ah three years here I mean we moved here we got up sold our house in San Diego and moved here full time and our our kids have enjoyed it living on the east coast it's\nFor years here I mean we moved here we got up sold our house in San Diego and moved here full time\nAnd our our kids have enjoyed it living on the east coast it's a it's a great city it's a football town the city the people are amazing it's a different diversity different a cultural so living here the last two years have been have been amazing for us and it's nothing nothing\nA means more than being happy and being part of a organization that that uh once you and and believe in years so it makes me go the extra mile to to do my best for them\nAnd we look at so many situations now around the league players in the final year of their contract I Love the battle is won in ... and that is right and center you see the unfortunate injury to Earl Thomas who elected to come back and play I you know that situation being in it in your last year in San Diego and they didn't treat your right with\nYou and I are when you said you were healthy with what McCoys at the at the end of the year and then of course what happened with the find which was just in my opinion not really a ridiculous just take this or a little bit of that perspective the business side of it and what may be a lot of the Delano Thomas have been through this year\nYeah I mean every everyone wants to look at look at the situations that the player is always the bad guy in these situations and it's\nIt's just it's it's disappointing for me to hear that 'cause how many times every year hundreds of guys get cut before their contract is up so uh when that guy is playing at such a high level like those guys are and want to be\nGet an extension look Earl just wanted extension I don't know the numbers I don't know anything about that but talking to him and being there for him he just wanted to retire the odd like me wanting to retire charger and when you don't\nFeel that they want that and they just want to use you and get you out of there and how you supposed to go to work everyday how you supposed to go into that building knowing that they don't want you around they just want to use you in in a movie it move on so\nI feel bad for those guys man and I feel bad for all of the situation has put in\nA going back looking back in my situation I Wish I Would ask for a trade or just not come until the end of the season 'cause it was miserable every day and I'm sure it was little rover him and and they'll come out and say those things and it's just hard on the players are they give everything for the team the team the team and then comes down to it and\nYou don't feel the same knowledge went back from organization so\nStuff man and stuff as players but you live you learn and move on and hopefully those guys or\nGet on their feet and and ended up in a spot where there are appreciating\nExcellent some talking are going on right now and CBS Sports radio let's get back to last weekend that second half Pittsburgh right before the end of the first half gets to score they type things out and then the second\nHalf you make them ... four times they turn the ball over on down and then you guys get a pack or they only had six plays max on a given drive out for the Pittsburgh Steelers and the second half just what clicks so well defensively for you guys unit in that second half\nWell I think combination of of a lot of things are calls\nFrom our our defense coordinator wink a called a great game are kept them kept the Steelers off balance and then you know Ben missed a couple of throws whether it's from our looks the pressure uh you know the timing being off whatever the case may be you\nKnow those those are keenly too you know a few three now and then you get the momentum and are often on the ball and the and they're often just sitting there waiting to get back on the field and\nUh it was a great team team effort an all three phases to get that job done on the road and the one of the toughest places to play so uh we uh obviously\nBasis to get that job done on the road and the one\nOf the toughest places the place so uh we uh obviously it was a huge win for us and now we've got to build off that and get ready for a tough really good Cleveland's team that you know records show and they could easily have three or four ones right now\nHow is wing and Don Martin Dale made this defense even better and you're one is at the defensive coordinator\nI you know his personality he's very open and honest I mean throughout training camp or once or twice a week he would he would put on the board of the players numbers and where they stood on the debt chart where they stood as a ... on our defense\nWhat we needed to get better at individually and when you know where you stand in you have a defense corner that\nIs about the defense it's about us a as a group it's not about individual you just have a good core belief and core group to to your defense so I just think guys that really gravitated towards that and and we work for we worked as one we worked\nFor the ultimate goal of just trying to win games and being the best defense possible not about any individuals so when you're ... coordinator is like that in an expresses his love and honesty to you as a player you can appreciate that as a player and know what you need to work on and know what you need to do to get on the field\nTo retire [noise]\nReserved and sacrifice

GB in community helping people deal with issues that a lot of people don't like about introduce yourself and tell us who you are and how you all became involved with this organization we'll start with Eugene\nOkay so again my name is ... cofounder of his intimate foundation alongside my husband wants malls\nAnd really be determined foundation started because we were passionate about\nUm affecting does that look like us\nSo they don't they have to experience the same issues we did growing up so I experienced a lot of issues with my sexuality just kind of figuring that out what does that really mean for me\nIn in a society is not very ah forgiving of anything that is not the norm um you tend to suppress those things so that took me down a path\nOf a lot of decisions that affected my life in ways that you know shouldn't have and so now that I'm On the other side I'm\nI'm very passionate about reaching people with the same story or the or the same um life that I have in maybe helping them to make the decision\nHi my name is run over as I'm best known as the public relations director for Atlanta black cried I'm also a really great friends who do smoke every year or with the gentleman's foundation I've helped with therapy are marketing for several years now and I'm I'm just happy to be here\nI Would say work in general what the hell to secure our community is important to me because I'm a strong believer that love wins whatever that looks like wherever you live wherever you are I'm I'm a lover of love and I'm a ... people and I've definitely been affected by the worked in the journal is foundation has been doing\nOver the years I'm also a former on her way from the gentleman's ball like I said I Love people and I love to see people reach\nAnd the work than the gentleman's foundation has been doing over the years I'm also a former ... from the gentleman's ball like I said I I Love people and I love to see people reach their full potential I Love to be able to give back to young girls would be the people I've struggled with growing up with self esteem and sometimes I still do but I mostly struggle with self identity\nAnd I loved that I've come to a place in my life now that I fully understand who I Am not perfect\nAnd I definitely have a journey to go but I I Love being able to empower young people\nTo also find and discover who they are and know that they can be all that got called them to be\nThat's amazing and the one and only missed Sophie it tell us how important this organization if you\nWell I met G and won a while back and they were part of another organization that are a part of and that is ... so it's been like one years I was one and Gina's ... stepped away and they're doing their own thing so then they started doing the gentleman's balls today and I found out what the generals ball was and\nIt has grown and grown and grown and I'm you know I Am so proud of them and then that the the work that they are doing in one of my things is about to be a positive image for our community and that's the same thing that they want they want positive envy just for our community and they say if you don't see that there you have to become there I\nAm honored to be honored by the gentleman's ball being positive images and just doing positive states in the community is wide G and want are doing what they're doing and why\nI Try to be a positive image while I'm In the limelight just where you see\nWhy why on earth and Joanna that's\nBeing honored because why missile fear is I'm a great character that we love at the core evidence Joe Taylor who was doing all of this work\nAnd and I like to just to piggyback on that word for it and she just said a many years ago I had the opportunity to do the missile field alive I was new to Atlanta and I went through the Monday Night direction I had no idea what I was going but all I Know is that missile fear performed a gospel number\nAnd I understood that God can fill love me even though I'm gay [laughter] thank you for that I'll never forget that that's why the work we're doing is important and that's why the gentleman's ball the gentleman's foundation is important and that's why shows like this are important\nThat's why the foundation actually started was because of the gentleman's ball back in twenty eleven after my husband and I got married after being in a closet for so long after being married to my ex wife in being on the DL an incoming on the other side of that and now I'm being married to a man I was very\nWe're very proud of that love and there wasn't very many images amend that look like us in the media and so we said let's have a second chance prom so people that\nWeren't on a you know out of the closet in high school had a second chance to go with and be proud of the closet were outstanding individuals we are productive citizens in society where and not just a stereotype that you see on TV or whatever the case may be so that's why the gentleman's ball was born in from the organically turn it to the foundation\nWell let's talk more about this because what I Love that each and every one of you are saying is it's like a new it's like a rebirth ... it's a way for people to express themselves and get the recognition and love from the community that is so unless when you talk about coming out of the closet when you talk about suicide believe\nThose are a lot of the things that the gentleman foundations mission is I have read on your website he says is to promote and winning I Love is\nThe huddle escaped yes development mind body and all of our economic ... most you know social and spiritual realm\nOf gay bisexual and transgender men of color yes which I think speaks volumes because a lot of times when we talk about the L G Beatty community you only\nYour men of color yes which I think speaks volumes because a lot of times when we talk about\nL G Beatty community you only hear it from a Caucasian person that absolutely and I think it is with us being here in Atlanta which is the second largest population of gay black men in the nation\nIs another earthquake [laughter] where's the fires I Believe in DC is different I don't I I [laughter] but you're right [laughter] you know and I checked\nIt was the second and I think that it's time that we as a community and we as a people talk more about that because it specially an African American community tell us how your organization work with people to help them understand them that'll let me so far south we're\nChanging the language of Vietnam mission statement and that is going to read black men not of color because I feel off than in the black community only the black community we tried to be inclusive of all the time of color but you don't\nGo to the Asian organizations and they don't say a caller notes that Asian organization because they are focused on building their community and it's one of the things we need to do is continue to focus on the black community and build us up before we can even be inclusive of others that's not to say where against other groups but no we need to love in the form out cells before we have that to give out\nI'm so with that being said some of our programs um one thing that we're very passionate about his mental health\nAnd so we have a mental health program called a circle of trust support groups\nAnd we have a weekly support group I'm One that is focused on men deal with the general general depression anxiety coming out of the closet loving themselves acceptance being comfortable with themselves\nOr we also have a group that is focused on trains men because trends men are also a further marginalize a sector of our community so we have a support group that focuses on that\nWe also have a support group for youth\nBowls a twenty five and under that led actually at the Morehouse campus and lastly we have a support group for men living with HIV we know the HIV is a serious issue in our community and we believe that I mean we're living with HIV can still thriving be than\nBestseller so let's go through is when you said the circle of trust yes I Love that\nI was in the movie where Robert Deniro I Believe my time came up with that and they are and it really is about\nTrusting each other yeah yeah yeah a little bit about that and how it has impacted your clients like\nWell we actually launched the circle of trust program after my husband\nIf you will came out of the closet with his depression ... and so the fourth and your gentleman's ball which was three years ago so he stood on stage he talked about he how he dealt with depression and there were so much outpour of people basically saying me too you know not to come off the hash tag me too but basically everybody was saying I feel the same way so we knew that it was important\nWell you know it's interesting because when you say like minded people positive people\nThose are the attributes for any positive environment and yeah regardless if you're gay straight and whatever and I think that it's important that programs that you offer a new organization really do give people that understand it doesn't matter who you are ... love\nLove is love and\nYou know positivity is the core and love is the core that can out ... any type of hey absolutely now the next program that you have that um that I think this is a huge is men with HIV living with HIV uh-huh I Know there are a lot of problems in Atlanta that help men with HIV how does your program to help them\nWell we have to recognize that you know men living with the HIV are dealing with a set of issues that we just don't and so we have a a therapist that is also living with HIV and he's specializes with counseling with men with HIV and so\nAfter ... let's say after after a man contracts HIV\nThere's a whole nother coming out process that you have to do with that there's a whole nother level of being comfortable with that especially with the stigma\nThat is attached to living with HIV and that's one of the things that we focus on as well is releasing the stigma um and I think what one of the ways in which you do that is again showing those positive images of men that are thriving that are living with HIV and so I think that's one of the things that make\nA our group different is that there is no secret behind that\nIs a thriving group of men that just happened to be the other one HIV\n[laughter] I Know some groups um helped me learn more about preventive medicine like perhaps a little bit about ...\nAbsolutely so prep is actually a pill that you take once a day\nHelped me learn more about preventive medicine like perhaps a little bit of a threat\nAbsolutely so ... is actually a pill that you take once a day that prevents HIV is Ninety nine point nine percent effective in preventing HIV so\nThese programs out there available to receive those medications and you live alone time you come back and your tests undetectable so that's a status\nPositive undetectable yes I'm HIV positive\nBut I'm undid undetectable you taking them I Can't pass it on\nIf you're on your image you can't pass HIV on a lot of people don't know that because they just have a lack of education even with unprotected sex unprotected sex I mean if you're undetectable you're controlling your immune system you cannot there is a very small chance you can pass HIV on most of the people who passed HIV do not know their status and they are not on that\nDo you offer free HIV screenings\nWe'd offer or for our services so yeah so we have we have plenty of 'em\nAre relationships with other community based organizations we don't do testing ourselves because we focus more on the middle but we have relationships refer refer people and we also do events we have HIV testing we also do um life forms we discuss prep in all of these HIV prevention and treatment options\nSo when we talk about your program which is specifically for black men mhm if I was a black male and I was in El GDP community how can I be a part of your organization to register online is and how does how does one get involved with from the programs all of that so [laughter]\nUh if you want to be involved in any of our program is legitimate foundation dot org and aside from the mental health groups we just talked about are we also have a scholarship program I'm In a scholarship program is welcome to anybody pursuing post high school education it doesn't matter it was college\nDoesn't matter if it's real estate school doesn't matter if it's cosmetology school and it doesn't matter your age so we try to enable and push everybody Ford also anybody can apply for that um you can also show up to any of our of ants we have a huge a fundraising weekend called the gentleman's ball weekend that's coming up on October fifty seven\nAnd we will start that up on friday a without welcome reception in scholarship ceremony the Saturday morning we will have an empowerment series this year's theme is unapologetically black\nWe thought it was important to remind the community\nThat were black first before the elder GDP to see where black first and all the time sitting at the intersection of black and eligibility we get lost re marginalized sometimes in the black community and we go into the algae beauty community it's ... it's white mainstream community so we're marginalized even further so that empowerment series Saturday morning is\nGoing to empower everybody to show up unapologetically black wherever they go and we're going to be discussing\nReligion and spirituality we're going to be discussing how do you create change in politics and activism we're going to talk about physical fitness and we're also going to talk about being walk\nAnd would that really means is I'm really excited about the apartments days\nUm that evening we had the gentleman's ball which is our annual affair where we celebrate men and women and the community that are creating social change and we also celebrate our allies were\nHonoring the fabulous no Sophia this year we're honoring Jesse ... we're honoring Alicia Garza where ah honoring governor elect Stacey Abrams so please go vote and we're honoring a host of other so please come out in on that Sunday we will be closing it out with the Sunday day party\nThe impression that it was just all about the gentleman's fall but this was a conference oh it is it\nGrows every year and it really is a weekend of empowerment an affirmation\nSo one thing you talked about is you're going to be talking about spirituality religion yes when you talk about religion and being gay\nI think he talked about is you're going to be talking about spirituality ... religion yes when you talk about religion and being gay it seems that that is a huge controversy especially in our community ... you know if someone was to ask you does God love gay black men when you tell them\nYes [laughter] God of\nEverybody black gay man however you identify God loves you um ... we can move in places with that Dona from us and so it's all about moving and loving spaces that are from us and it doesn't matter where that is no God is everywhere love is love well\n... I'm I'm happy that organization is is here it's available the gentleman's foundation you had a fundraising event coming up the gentleman's fall October the ... and uh if people want it to register do they have to register for the whole conference okay just register per day how does that\n... ah Fridays oven is free anybody can show up Saturday mornings also for anybody can show up if you want tickets to the gentleman's ball or the brunch that's the next day if the gentleman foundation dot org when to fire\nA missile feel on vine would you like to say some ... some wisdom for maybe young people or just you know anybody in general that's dealing with the struggles of being gate\nI Would like to encourage all of our listeners to just be brave\nHave the courage to stand up for what you believe in how the bravery to be yourself it doesn't matter who you are doesn't matter where you come from personal that God loves you and that whatever you want whenever you desire you can achieve it it doesn't matter where you come from doesn't matter who you are\nJust be brave and when you're brave you'll be surprised who needed you to be brave so that they can be very in together we can all change the world\nBy just like for people to know that you are stronger than you really think you are you're never know how strong you are until you have to go through something to prove how strong you are\nAnd I also like for people to know that we go through things not for ourselves God put us through the so that we can minister to other people who go through the same thing in one day you'll be able to tell somebody you know what\nI understand what you're going through I was there at one point in my life and look at me today and just like he brought me through he can bring you through but you have to love yourself and you know to be able to love somebody else this is true\nWell less than ... like I said thank you so much ... than ...

know difficult that is a non profit to cover all the volunteers for a day deaths\nYou say booked up yes young have booked up do you know difficult that is a non profit to cover all the volunteers for a day gas which book volunteers for three science yes that's ... that's correct is amazing\nSo I I'm I'm sitting here flabbergasted when you were talking about all of the different services that you offer because\nWhen I think of homeless shelter I think of shelter and that's what you're providing shelter and food but Nicholas house it goes over and beyond in a city where they've closed down homeless shelters in the city which has caused more people to live on the streets\nHounded Nicholas how survive one of the reasons\nWhy Nicholas house was able to survive is it's close connection with community partners\nWe have fabulous of volunteers that have been with us the average volunteer a volunteer ... with us for a minimum of ten years\nWe have people on our board that have served with us for Seventeen we have one lady that comes every Monday and has done for over twenty seven years\nSo partners like that volunteers like that have provided the initial resources and tools needed to sustain our operations and to ensure that our programs are available and accessible to the community\nWe've been also fortunate to work with the city of Atlanta\nA Fulton County as well as to cap county to help sustain valuable operations in various communities that make up those areas as well we've been very fortunate but I Will say that it's really come on at the hands of individuals like you and I\nThat want to become involved and remain involved long term\nWhen we talk about homeless and when we talk about long term needs I read a report recently that said that the land a homeless population has dropped at least thirty percent but it's still they still have concerns about it is this true\nThat it has slightly dropped the the homeless population in general has dropped but what we're seeing is an increase in homeless families for example in DeKalb County the population of homelessness fifty one percent are homeless families\nIn DeKalb County a country ah that's forty one percent so at a I'm Sorry I had it backwards that's DeKalb County fifty one percent Fulton County forty seven percent and those numbers are staggering and that's the entire population of homeless people\nWhen you look at that entire population to know that that many are families that are homeless it's staggering so I work continues our goal is to ensure that family homelessness is rare brief\nAnd non recurring by twenty twenty we know that that's an aggressive goal we know that that's a huge undertaking\nBut we want to ensure that families or any brief state of homelessness we want to make sure that they're not we occurring into crisis mode again and want to make sure that we're as affected as possible\nAnd I think that that is important to know because even though it says it is slightly drop it limits your rights number for for the neediest city in regards to homelessness in America so we we most certainly do have an issue in a problem here in our in our state as well as in our city\nWhen are we talk about homelessness I think a lot of people\nDon't really\nConnect to the journey which in in actuality I Know one of your volunteers is on the freaking want a morning show today and I heard her say that anybody\nTo the journey which in actuality\nI Know one of your volunteers is on the freaking one morning show today and I heard her say that anybody could be homeless we're just one paycheck away yeah and that is so true\nOne issue that comes up is in regards to children is school mhm so when a family has some some unfortunate incidents that occur in their lives\nThey can't afford their home anymore they're ... they are living in their car they go to your shelter and they have children that are still in school [laughter] I I've heard people say that they can't use the address when it comes to the homeless shelter I Know some children have been\nDenied access to education because they don't have a permanent address is their services that they can use their to give them a permanent address where the children could continue their education\nYes yes um well ah families are in our shelter they actually use our address that their\nUm by law if a family is homeless\nAnd they want to keep their children in the same school zone they must have that opportunity however it's complicated if transportation uh is not available or if it creates such a toll on the family to get up hours in advance to go back\nTo that original a school system so what we're seeing a at Nicholas house is at many of the families that were able to place in housing actually stay in the zone where Nicholas house is not only do we have great schools but it provides the consistency and the uh\nThe the uh required\nUm ah just consistency that children need a that security for them and knowing that they can meet friends and established those relationships and perform well academically because they're gonna be there they're going to be stable they're going to be secure in that spot until the family is able to move or transition\nTo another point and usually we usually counseling it binds them to at least allow them to transition out of that particular\nA phase of schools that they're in for example if it's K. through five at least until they're able to move\nTo middle school or in middle school until they can transition to high school and so on and so forth earlier when we talk to recede out you were telling me about the length of time that families are allowed there you said some are a hundred and twenty days some are a little longer it just depends on their needs\nThat trust me more about that the average time or that her family is they're typically the goal is Ninety Days and that number is driver that length of time to ride on the uh the time that it takes to connect them to in many cases employment and other community services or to ensure that they are self sufficient\nBut there are a number of extenuating circumstances that could impact that length of time it could extend to a hundred and twenty days are beyond it could be short and to a thirty or sixty days it just depends on the needs of the family\nAnd when you say transition out of out of Nicholas house I'm assuming you are partnered with other non profit organizations that can help them with housing affordable housing as you mentioned earlier that can help them with job placement from some of the resources that had been offered at Nicholas house is that\nThat's true we work with um a group of about sixty different partners throughout Atlanta we had a memorandum of understanding with all of them\nSo if there is a particular focus area or need that we can address and Nicholas house we refer the family to that particular organization\nA focus area or need that we can address and Nicholas house we refer the family to that particular\nOrganization for direct assistance something that like to also mentioned Amanda is it in addition to emergency assistance the shelter per se\nThat Nicholas house managers and operates um Monday through friday seventies wait twenty four seven is it we also work to prevent homelessness for families so for families that are right there on the brink of losing their housing\nA due to the action or foreclosure we're there to provide financial assistance to assist these families by up paying the amount that inner ears and then we work with them regarding budgeting and financial literacy to ensure that they're not in crisis mode again\nWe also work with the working poor these are people that are working every day but there are struggling to be able to afford their housing and that respect we work with them to raise their income potential\nAnd we also until that is able to happen\nWe subsidize a portion of their housing they pay thirty percent\nWe pay Seventy percent and then as families are able to earn more money and that's through direct and very who's involvement with their case manager\nTo assume one hundred percent of their housing at the end of that one year term or whatever is agreed upon as part of their individual plan with their case manager\nI Am blown away mhm that's incredible yes ... that's that's\nUnheard of mhm I've never heard of an ... a a homeless shelter doing anything to that extent mhm and I'm not an\nAmendment let me there is is how we work\nAlso with

many people that still losing their eyesight many people are losing their eyes like\nHaving your legs cut off and all of these uh these kinds of things simply because of high blood and high sugar\nTwo of the most devastating type of diseases that you can have there there's no question about that and then these are the two major diseases\nThat leads to the number one killer of people all around the

situation here here in Georgia and your son is in Michigan by himself with\nNo family members nobody there no one would ever want to be in that position with their child and then do there was probably severe state of panic on your part\nKind of just talk about that those few moments of emotion that you had and again to listeners that we're telling the story because we want you to result of this we want you to go and talk to your families\nAbout say driving in Georgia because this is a very catastrophic event that can happen so kind of tell us about that a little bit what you went through in those first few minutes after Chris' told you the news\nThe first few minutes I just felt helpless I'm like I couldn't do anything but pray and hope that he would still be alive you know when we got to his side\nUm when we got all the information about the accident he was you know a jet that from the vehicle the car the driver I fell asleep at the wheel um he was a back seat passenger and he was a jet that from the vehicle as it flipped multiple times I'm of course here in that\nYou don't know what you're going to face when you get to the area where you have to go to see what's going on with your child ...\nUm someone we got there you know it ... well before we laugh a we found out it would be hours before we get a flight from Atlanta to Michigan rite rug that even made it a little worse because the anticipation of\nYou know just the weight period\nI remember I remember the phone call you and I actually have the uh the phone call together on on trying to figure out how we could get you to Michigan quickly but you know um and it was a normal Saturday for your son to he was leaving to go\nI actually had that had that phone call together on on trying to figure out how we could get you to Michigan quickly but you know um and it was a normal Saturday for your son to he was leaving to go to a job site early in the morning with you know with his co workers and this is what happened yes so um\nYou got to Michigan that evening and tell us what happened then when you got to the hospital because I Know that you probably had the biggest lump in your throat ever walking into that hospital um tells tells what you went through there\nYeah slowly around at the hospital um he was telling surgery a we had to stay on the doctor to come out and it was about an hour before the ... came to speak but that's because they were finishing up\nWhen he got out he said uh you got a lot of bad news forty mhm that think that there's nothing that I can tell you and this is something that I hate to talk to any family about price on your son may never walk again\nHe broke his neck and he's paralyzed\nAnd he broke from what I remember it was levels of a civil is there's a C. five and sees sex which is in in the lower part of your neck\nSo I'm Jean son was ejected from the vehicle and\nI'm from what I remember you saying he was he was thrown it was at least a hundred feet from the vehicle from what I remember it so he ... his vertebrae was airlifted to the emergency room up in up in a hospital in Michigan so the doctor tells you that\nThe news is bad and your son may never walk again\nI don't think anybody knows what type of motion they would express at that point if this happened to any one of our loved ones but from that point tell us you know kind of what what you had to do to yourself 'cause I Know that I Know that type of person that you are you're strong in your face\nIs a strong personality individual but you have to hold it together for your family and your son\nBut I'm sure that you had your moments obviously so\nOn and tell us what you went through there after the doctor shared this news with you up in Michigan\nMy husband and I as you say that we share a strong faith and we had to pull it together and be strong for our son and ourselves our family and um we just\nPrayed and and held on to each other and just fate strong in may the best decisions that we made a regarding his care we had to make so quick decisions I thought that they could take care of him in a manner that they needed to take care of him so we we we have time we cried we\nYou know collapse basically our minds collapse at some point in the situation because we ... this is a first time we never been through this before right first time Hatton and first time dealing with anything to the fence so we\nJust had to pull it together and and you know just stand strong\nAnd not only for you for you and your husband but you know you also have another son who you had to

home here in Georgia to to tend to his needs and to ten with just the the sheer insurance situation of trying to find out okay what do we have in front of us here\nOn this has been a life changing for you because there's many more facets to your story that continue on to this day that you know we've talked about many times and you know we're not going to be able to to cover all this and and this

Howard everybody we've\nGot a lot to cover a lot to cover and you know but\nYou're not cognizant of in on the other side of the radio is that we really try to cram in this information in the short period of time that we have we have seven minute segments generally speaking between\nCommercials the news and things like that so the information that I Try to push to you I have to really be specific in hard hitting on it so that you get it in a time period that we have a lot of people say hey three hours that's a lot of time that is not a lotta time\nI can barely get to you the information I Want to get to you within that period of time deal of the decade I didn't mentioned before is in Fulton County and one in Cobb interestingly enough one is new construction ones resale right near San trust park\nReally really really good deal I'm telling you you got to get in on those while you can and the markets changing lightly that will work to your benefit and I'll tell you why when we go into the deal the decade at one o'clock\nOkay how are your sister Murray\nReading I Hope for question about a home that I Want to buy it's all relative home but over the years they have added on and they said they were not permit it\nWould you say that it would be better to help them to get a permit it or go ahead and have them tell them all for up or it's you\nKnow so let me ask you this where they structure\nWill they are they are and what ... what is it what did they add\nThey actually um added um apart from the route to make 'em an upstairs oh and then also an extra room on the back and it's a pretty large sun Rhone type All right\nIs it in a subdivision that has come in at some restrictions\nNo it's in um it's on a private property alright at Fulton County\nWhat I Would do if you really want this property I Would say listen we're going to have to have a county\nOut and look at this okay you know what I'm saying\nYou know what I'm saying and that way the county to county what they really care about is square footage I'm just going to tell you now do they really care about how it was constructed whether or not it meets code or they will say they do and\nThat's the pretense on under which they come out the true reason is because if you're adding square footage you're adding\nA more tax money more tax dollars that you owe the municipalities\nMhm and see what I'm saying so I say All right um\nThe truth is they may already know somewhat because\nNeighbors call you know when they lie and I was thinking about what Ariel they must have aerial view\nWhat they've done a new assessment they may have aerial views and they may actually be taxing on the news square footage even though they don't know really how much it is sometimes they get if I look in these tax records and I'm thinking that person has does not have that amount of square footage so sometimes I guess but I Would just\nCalled the county and ask them some questions and say if someone has done some work and it's not permitted and I want to buy it what's my safe is Ruth\nOh that's great I thank you for information I'm not going to hold you up I Know you have a lot of snow that thank you for your call that's really important good information thank you I have a good day you off so\nAll right for oh four eight nine to two seven zero three yes I Do have a lot to cover however I Do want to tell you that this is your show you hear ... Bozeman you hear all of us said this the sisters in law this is your radio station that's the one thing we pride ourselves here at W. A. okay that this radio stations\nAlong the listening audience you make us you break um tell us what you want and we do comply we\nAre really cater to our listening audience so call and if you have any questions because that's the purpose of the show is to get you the answers that you need I Love love love it when people call me during the week and they say hey I've got this problem or can you help me out with this situation\nSometimes they are huge\nLike really huge and then sometimes it\nJust something I could really like this past week it was so heartwarming\nThis gentleman came in he made an appointment came in he brought his paperwork I said bring this spring all your paperwork he brought it we sat down I looked at it and my sister your good to go you have no problems\nHere's why X Y Z boom boom boom these are all recorded with the county you are golden and I explained to him why and what they all meant and he left happy and his mind was that peace and\nHe's like again he was like what do I owe you appreciate that I said nothing but I tell you what you can do\nAnd then I'm going to tell you why I say this fall you agents out there you know this but it's really good for the listening audience and others as well I say\nIt's better if you go ahead and ... make a contribution to a nonprofit organization for the time that we spent here so I encouraged him to go to Jose it helps that's the one I help that's the one I support and make a contribution based upon whatever you feel disappointment was worth\nAnd he did did how great was that let me tell you why\nDon't take money unless I've done a substantial amount of work and you pay me because I have to filter it through the brokerage company and sometimes it's just not worth doing that I mean I have worked on huge commercial deals I've gotten like Fifteen hundred two thousand\nLike why are you doing this after the fact why do we just have a little bit of foresight\nRight what they'd do like they recently just started one of the subdivisions that ... years ago and they stopped now that now they just go first house in there my wife does robot a couple of days ago and so you know their house up down there now but you know cost of a\nSudden vision they put a little to walk you know outside subdivision for just a little you know little stretch of the road but um I see they're redoing the bridge and that kind of stuff now because you're getting ready to do the whole street\nSo\nThe city or county whomever is coming to you with this um\nWill have a formula\nOkay and the formula was going to be based upon however much of the front edge of your property that they need to have access to okay\nWhat I always want to know is what are you giving everybody yeah right right so at least that strip on that street who had an email me or send me\nIt's not a secret what they're planning other people so I Need to know that because I don't want to get shortchanged\nIn short changed okay and you know I can take advantage of me I Want to know I'm getting getting what everybody else is getting or more\nOkay and um once you find out what everybody else is getting\nThen you will be in a better position to know whether or not you can ask for more but um I still have questions in reference to them not no\nLonger quote unquote needing a portion of your property because here's the thing mistakes happen all the time and they could come and encroach upon your property at least even a half a foot or but\nAnd then ultimately ten Fifteen Twenty years down the line you no longer possessed that property because they've taken that property by means of adverse possession and well we've opened in ... used this property for Twenty years it's now it now belongs to the county\nCooker\nSo and and then of course that's been the same will also apply to everybody else on the street [noise] but hey we can't worry about them which enough to where we just have to worry about you\nKnow well I mean I mean that gives them more cautious you know ... ... ... ... what are you giving everybody oh\nI don't know that you're asking the questions I'm really thankful because so many times we'll just sit back and take whatever anybody says does\nAs the truth and it's ... not always the truth somebody knows that they may be ultimately encroaching upon your property if in fact that does happen\nOr you never happens by mistake without anybody knowing at your survey will show that occur and then you go back and say hold on your point is concrete on my property now I'm really going to need to get paid\nPoker okay go ahead and proceed with a\nSurvey out on them or I think I don't think they're going to start ... a year now what about all the different group called the property or whatever that it will want to go to mark whatever mhm\nThat'll give me like you know where to start from them so you're sort of a girl what everybody else is getting or whatever and [noise] go ...\nAnd pleased when you get your survey make sure it's with a company who has been working in and around the metro Atlanta area for a long period of time ... let me tell you while you know they'd been we I\nI went back to a survey that one of my clients had to look on it for a specific reason we had to go try to find that company that companies out of business\nAnd so they're out of business there's just no recourse there's nobody who can substantiate the fact that these are the actual lines that were drawn when if in fact somehow they may\nUm contradict another drawing you see what I'm saying so just make sure they're long established ... in Atlanta\nOkay well I'm not a good account of you in an apartment I walked in county and we've used the bottom of the profit out of Walter generally mhm so they've been in business for over Thirty years I think father passed away in the last couple of years but the sun is taking over the whole\nYeah that's beautiful let me know you even if you call me like during the week on my cell phone I sometimes I get these calls are people in come to my office and then I just have this like a ... it's ... I don't have closure\nIn my head and I don't think about you know like I Wonder what ever happened to go on that but anyway we're up to no okay okay\nOkay All right thanks rack like alright alright thank you better have a good day or you could buy\nA four point eight nine to to seven zero three that was great yeah that was great they see the I Love that because now get wrecks not only had that knowledge an answer but so does everybody else's listening right\nAnd they know what to do\nEncroachment a survey is\nAll right near the doctor ...
