for eight nine to five to seven\nZero three that gives you end the conversation today Boise were not true to seven zero three do indoors meant matter in politics God Knows\nWe were inundated with celebrity endorsements during president rock Obama's campaign I mean he had a lot of celebrity endorsements you know we had more Hillary Clinton\nAnd it didn't really work out now granted put it in proper context she did win the popular vote\nMeaning she maximized in various democratic states but that's not the idea in winning the presidency then winning the presidency you fight and you\nCount for the electoral college vote\nThat's how you win four zero for\nEight nine to two seven zero three they get you into conversation today\nOr some people are very excited that Taylor Swift is taking a stand for something I don't know if this helps or hurts Democrats typically typically when you have pop stars I'm supporting you\nThat's not always a great look I actually think when Jay Z Beyonce when all of them performed\nIn support of Hillary I don't think that helped Hillary not Julia let me get a young Julian on the microphone yeah something like this burning on the inside of his so\nSo this would almost say man what you're going to say man Taylor Swift has a different type of pop star though\nShe's almost iconic in the in real time with her with\n... with her ... huge so I don't want you to actually is real nice to man real nice lady you know good looking but I I I'm about ... you know I'm ... that's your cup of tea brother not necessarily but [laughter]\nBut I think it's important that you don't underestimate how big Taylor Swift is to her\nBut we know that because we see people are passing out crying when she comes and shake their hand so it was almost like this is Michael Jackson effect to a young white girls\nEssentially I was on Twitter this morning and you can just see like how many people were like hey I'm registered to vote and if you if you check out um a few articles you'll see that the numbers sky rocketed and people who are actually register to vote\nBecause of technical sweat and today's last day actually to everybody out there at today's October night the final day to register to vote in our midterms in November\nStuff young Julian for zero for eight died due to seven zero three let's go to Sam Sam good they welcome\nWhat's going on our

update I Am right now hey I'm number three huh I'm number three best Atlanta radio talk radio personality yes\nI Am I'm an avid listener too I Love her so I just ... right now with the um pharmaceutical sales confident there that don't know if you're if you got to France and other drugs out of the Carter he's not alone or you know\nThere's a pharmaceutical kind of semi was sixty minutes and that's all I\nAbout a quarter he sellout or you\nKnow to keep it it's a pharmaceutical company was out of the sixty minutes and and so on hundred and fifty that you're you're locked up an artsy kind forgive people let us is like sixty feel that day\nYeah those are going pain clinics where doctors basically not doctoring simply prescribing narcotics\nYeah and so I saw them you know but that gift kickback to the doctors are pushing their product and so now to the doctor can kick back there first and then I got thrown out of the class 'cause the pharmaceutical companies pay the uh pilots his ... all those party for the forms to fill out the what did you let all\nAnd so now actually caught and has become a separate but because it's it's affected the way all the college age their community their bills and bills and the African American community wants the epidemic but now that is in the cage and wealthy environment it's a it's America's problem\nIt's like to see it or it's a it's they are all the talk of the ... the ... with a pharmaceutical company got out of it it's harder for it and that's what they put me on they put me on the ...\nBecause I went to the ... the first part body weight right now I don't know what's going on and I that's what you know it's out of ...\nIf we started fifty then that's pretty bad\nTaylor Swift\nOn Instagram this\nI'm writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November ... and which I'll be voting in the state of Tennessee\nIn the past I've been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years I feel very differently about that now I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight\nFor the human rights I Believe we all deserve in this country\nI Believe in the fight for el ... rights and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is wrong I Believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying sickening and prevalent\nI cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for all Americans no matter the skin color or gender or who they love\nRunning for Senate in the state of Tennessee\nIs a woman named Marsha Blackburn\nAs much as I have in the past\nAnd would like to continue voting for women and all of his I cannot support Marsha Blackburn her voting record in Congress a pause and terrifies me\nShe voted against equal pay for women she voted against the reauthorization of the violence against women act which attempts to protect women front domestic violence dog and the date right she believes businesses have a right to refuse service the gay couples should also believe they should not have the right to marry\nThese are not mind tendency values I Will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for a house of representatives please please educate yourself on the Kennedy's running your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values\nAnd it goes on and on there's actually a well thought out letter and and that's why I said it's conciliatory it's not abrasive it's a really good letter okay really good letter\nBut the question is does that translate into actual votes sometimes these celebrity endorsements have a way of translating into dollars\nNow where you have a John Legend during a fundraiser for you well that's money\nWe can take money and we can translate money into votes why because messaging is free but to deliver the message to distribute the message costs money that's why you get mailers that's why you see commercials on TV and radio that's why you also see billboards\nDid robocalls have door knock earth's come to your whole we called them canvassers all of that costs money and all of that is to distribute one thing the candidates message\nSo yes in a sense if the candidate is willing to give money or raise money or come to an event and you pay to be at that event yes ladies and gentlemen that is a plus that as a win because that is money and money can be used to deliver a ...\nAnd they all come to an event and you pay to be at that event yes ladies and gentlemen that is a plus that is a win because that is money and money can be used to deliver a message\nNow would be a great thing if money was completely out of politics but it is not\nAnd yes it costs money to deliver any message in politics some people have been very crafty at avoiding paying a lot of money as a matter of fact President Trump\nProbably did it the best\nBecause he had millions of dollars of earned media while he was running for president what does that mean that means President Trump kept saying crazy and sensational things every day because he\nKnew people would report it he knew citizens would consume it\nSo he didn't have to pay a bunch of money on political ads he didn't do that that was not his way as a matter of fact he didn't raise a tremendous amount of money either that for a presidential campaign\nBut he was given earned media credits every single week in the millions that as a matter of fact CNN broke it down in one story what they've said basically in one week Trump has had the equivalent of thirty eight million dollars\nWorth of air time and he didn't pay opinion\nYeah he changed again the question is can anybody else to do like that and I don't know when President Obama ran the change the game in another way he utilize social media like nobody else did before he also utilized his campaign ads heap if if people remember this\nPresident Obama when he was running he actually purchased an infomercial I don't know people remember this but they actually purchased twenty five minute block on TV\nYeah they purchased a twenty five minute block and when Obama Senate then Senator Obama was asked somebody said well listen basically\nBasically is an infomercial and I want you to get to know me and get to know my bags and get to know what I represent and you know what at work and work quite well nobody had ever done that before and nobody has done that states but he understood that people did not feel as if they knew him they liked him\nBetter was a good thought it was smart well educated but they didn't know him so he took opportunities like that to increase his connectivity to those who voted for four zero for eight now too to seven zero three\nFour zero for eight nine to\nTwo seven zero three that get you to conversation\nToday [noise] right now there's a battle but there is a ...

A. okay some ...\n... and that I could say or do some talk Thirteen eighty double you feel [noise]\n\nUsing the switch to lose ... to\nMake movies with all the time of the pluses emotions with your muscles Mack was passed in music\nOff because yeah what's happened to walk back when I just really in class and my college class I had a student asked me about the origin of why are we having class on Christopher Columbus day\nAnd I said well the only Christopher I recognize as Wallace rest in peace the Tories ... and I wrote it on the board I did for the wrong for not due to seven zero three that gives you an a conversation today let's go to Jason in bucket Jason good they welcome\nThere was no good rather how are you\nUm are and I did talk with you again\nSaying to comment on this topic yes I'd know dear brother where I Am interested to know where you're staying over there [laughter]\nAh but so my question is I I just er to go through all the stats and all that yes and so we're so my question is and this is what ... what what are you suggesting we do do you think we just just keep letting people run amok\nLet me tell you one practical solution because I spoke with an executive or law enforcement they had this big conference in Chicago and he said it was shot you won't believe how Chicago PD police they basically do not serve solve murders\nIf the murders stay in South Chicago he said the real job of south the real job of Chicago PD is to keep south Chicago separate from North Chicago he said hey no everything they know who's the killer\nThey know who's about to get killed they know everyone who sales dope they noticed shot called as they know everything but they didn't\nThe killer they know who's about to get killed they know everyone who sales dope they noticed shot cause they know everything but they do not enforce at the same level of knowledge so that's the problem\nWhy do you think that is though\nMay be ingrained in the culture\nAnd that caused you may have deep roots and couldn't activity\nTo law enforcement so we're talking about are we talking about mobsters we're talking about gangsters which I'm a real banks and that just came bankers were talking about people that you call shops have relationships with people who are inside of the actual law enforcement agency also there are dirty cops in Chicago\nOr during the past but what's interesting is that you never really hear about the dirty cops why don't you hear about dirty cops when we know they are they're well because the culture protects them\nWell you're you're absolutely right and I and I don't disagree that there's a problem with elements with other things going on and by the same token you know a lot of people don't realize you know I my ... I was sixteen year old son to Chicago\nNorth Chicago south Chicago he's actually about man okay fortunately\nI've been an old different show we're going back and forth with his mom but I'm kind of you know trying to get him outcry man and spent a lot of money and that but\nThat's a different show but I Will tell you that man you know one of the things that most people don't realize you're talking about this issue of Chicago where crime is very segregated other city it just it just got an older section got black section of the ... primarily on the south and west side you have a yard Hispanics section is over kind of like you're going to the north side like Humboldt park and all that\nUh I I just I feel the same man at the end of the day we have got to do a better job amongst ourselves and not get caught up in these\nThese pitfalls and and and treat back they tried to get us to be successful susceptible to and I and I know that it is easier said than done but I Do know personally programs on the ground up there that are really trying to get in there and do it but the problem is meant a lot of these kids are just not late and they don't want to do no better\nWhen you got to realize that there are other now when you say they're knuckleheads understand a few things happening so so everything that happens must be explained through the social context of that era\nNow where did the gang violence really hit an all time high it was when rama manual the mayor of Chicago decided to allow\nUh public schools to merge basically to to close okay you're so now you had vice lowered having to go to school with gangster disciples and let decision or from the government created a few elements number one it increased tensions amongst rival gangs\nTwo it also for some of the students who had real beef with rival says to simply drop out and not continue their education because the government wasn't thoughtful about the merging element and what that would actually do as a ripple effect\nTo the local community so that was one thing and then in addition to that you created an education drought\nSo once you create the education drought\nThe whole notion of education and higher education becomes distant that's a psychological effect as well so had these problems working together and then the ... already of the Chicago Mayor is not south Chicago it's no Chicago you know that\nYeah yeah well they're going you know look they're gonna they're gonna change of the who butter and ... that just\nYeah it's an unfortunate reality of politics but let me ask you this stop and frisk okay that means that you could stop me and frisk me even if you don't think I've done anything wrong how was that right in any context\nIt's really not exactly\nBecause there are a lot of big brother I said this and let you respond\nWrong how was that right in any context\nIt's really not\nExactly because there are a lot of things and brother I said this let you respond there are a lot of things we can do that unconstitutional that would work okay let me tell you what would work putting a United States military official at every public school\nIn the United states we have the authority now we have the ability to do that but if we don't have the constitutional authority to do that but it would work it would help stop\nIt would help stop school terrorism okay you're employed now is unconstitutional now do you read the constitution in order to do that\nMan you know what that is like our bodies you know our body going across the state of of tension with one another and it's a delicate balance to be healthy\nAnd that's where we are and honestly man that's what I'll do I'm a concerted that we're we're struggling with right now like how much of the the ... you know the constitution as it was originally\nA practical in today's times given today's uh just the technology technology makes things so different so you're absolutely right after the course that I Can't answer man if his\nBut see that's honest that's odd because on one side if you say we need to change the constitution then you have people who believe like you ideologically who said the constitution is pure but you know there is something wrong when we feel that the constitution is static\nAnd it is not effective in today's social environment\nIt is it is that we have I mean just just by virtue of the fact that we have access to the technology that we have right it changes things like big time like you do in the ... and that's the slippery slope but I just don't know but I just think that at a certain point we got to find a way\nTo figure that out and because I mean we can be so\nGreat as ever civilization man yes you know if we could work out no I'm just trying to Scott but\nNot ... not everything you're saying to ruin a he was really important question did you go off for me for the best of radio personality in Atlanta\nBecause right now I'm Sorry I'm not calling again number two by

that we can't have that you have to have people on the outside with their hands in the money pile ... that's what this is about I I just get so upset because somehow we couldn't catch the public behind those teachers that images were so negatively portrayed\nThat we just couldn't get enough public support for them so many blacks have so many negative that I'm a\nExperiences with black teachers these days that was not my experience but that is what is that happening to our public schools education and so I I goodness gracious you've done is just so horribly and\nI and I just get it hurts my heart because education is so important to us you know um it's paramount to us excess at every level\nI I'm I'm Beverly Hall had a very close friend who had sent a French teacher at Washington high and later became the principal and because I'm losing some memory I cannot remember her name right now but I certainly hope somebody will call in and get it for her\nAnd I don't know whether she's still around town of ... but um it would be so good if people could talk about this or laws of experiences\nWhen the Atlanta public schools is doing better than is doing now I also

public school because all it does is what our public funds\nInto the hands of a bunch of private tears who are committed to building their own separate school systems and taking the money\nRather than building and perpetuating what is needed a National Public school system we all have to have to get behind that concept\nOr we're just going to have nothing get too many black parents who see charter schools\nAs a solution to the education of chips and I asked them right now how would you measure the academic progress of your children your children don't have to be tested\nIn a in a charter school system the teacher's competence\nDon't have to be measured if you are black parents we've been consistently advocating for charter schools charter schools I ask you look at the law educational

tens of millions of dollars to the charter she said well no for the first\nFew years they're going to just keep the same standard that said well why would we make a change if we don't have any expectation that they're going to be any better\n\nYou mean you have no expectation that any of the indices that suggest that students are learning or going to get any better she like no\n\nI said

or it just means that I have watched the evolution of the city as a young man even my own neighborhood change and transform\nI was elected to the city council and it helped that transformation but I

midtown tooling company which is not in midtown but don't offer Jonesboro road if you are willing to take all of the local store we got on every corner\nA then I'd be willing to say that we don't need

way\nTo stop the libel landfill absolute that has been a long time ago ... ah yeah I was Nineteen Ninety One Ninety to Ninety three\nBack and neither one of us would like to you were working for did

that guarantee they live vote land for peace will close and the people will get it out they visit but demand so somebody asked me about that recently I weigh it out or whatever you're that gas mask [laughter]\nWe've forgotten that took the little piece that looked courage opposes that jobs or you can breathe so anyway but with another great victory\nSo we've faults um it'd been a diet or David and Goliath battle and this is it this is a the quintessential David and Goliath you know absolute won't come back we'll let them in their own\nFor years it took two thirds majority to appoint settle any federal judge and then they relax the rules to allow a simple majority for most federal judge it except for the Supreme Court\nAnd then within the last two years they relax roof further to allow for a simple majority vote even for the highest court in the land because they see the majority slipping away from them they see the\nMargin you know there's only a couple of boat in the Senate so it is um\nIt's a very difficult situation but I was intrigued by your other suggestion is that whether Kavanaugh could be shamed into resigning and I think only if\nThe GOP feel that there is sufficient evidence against him in the public arena that jeopardizes the twenty twenty presidential election would start on January the first one that's the only way I see that playing out if there was such overwhelming\nCorroborate shouldn't other evidence and if there was evidence that the White House improperly intervene to limit the FBI investigation than you might see some reversal but I don't think impeachment were I think I got to be a political question\nYou're absolutely right as I was hoping by the time twenty twenty rolled around that I'm I'm young gentleman that's in the White House or what have convicted him a ... mouth season changes in the whole bunch of other things where we in Florida\nI'm young gentleman that's in the White House or what have convicted him a ... hour with a mob cases chasing them a whole bunch of other things where we employ a rocket ride that's for sure\n... and it seems to me that in recent history by attacking that I'm ... and lady Mrs by Dr\nBlocks of oil and if you're a lousy for this\nBecause he already knew somebody told them what they were going to doing it seemed like he already knew what the outcome of the FBI investigation so he just went and started acting like even\nYou know because uh two or three days before that he was so impressed with what she had to say well soon as they gave him the green light and saying no we want to get this through and he just went on after that his you know south\nWell the investigation was hamstring by the White House it was just a show it was a\nA cursory investigation they didn't interview people who had already come out with accusations against a camera no they didn't want to talk about it they know he's the lead they just don't care and I tell you something else they have calculated it was as Janice mention is a political issue\nThey calculated that white women are still going to vote for Trump and Trump is people\nEven yeah they disrespect them publicly and openly and shame them uh for knowing and being victims of what we all know women are victims are\nWe to sexual abuse\nOh Brent Kavanaugh was worse acts would not the axe to Dr Blass it forward talked about even though those were bad they are a whole lot of accusations against him but they wouldn't interview those people they want to talk about it they were accusations that came up to the nineties but they didn't want to talk about that um he's withdrawn\nHe's a liar 'cause he proved that he does not have the temperament to be the judge that he was in the uh\nThe appeals court was it appeals court even though I'm a record of appeals court of appeals\nHe's biased which was a very great concern to me 'cause if any case involving sexual abuse of believing that a woman was sexually abused he's going to be extremely biased all involved Democrat or involves Democrats or has anything to do with the person who supported Clinton he's going to be extremely biased and he would\nHe should in any cases like that recused himself so it's as if he's not even there can't even do his job because of his biased\nOr they knew that all of that stuff they just didn't care\nAnd Trump can't they trumpeting calculate with somebody calculated tell him when we got the votes so you can say what you want to say now because he was acting all most humans when he was saying that her testimony was credible and what I what I Would like for the Republicans to explain\nIs why this lady who had some very distinct memories and who also passed a polygraph tests in August\nWhy her testimony plus a polygraph test will be disbelief and somebody who gets mad and it's not since snaps at people and ask nasty question is would be believe out on the other hand I'm telling you he couldn't make it on a jury in a traffic case\nThe other factor in this that they hadn't talked to a whole lot about is judge Kavanaugh's view of presidential power and what President\nOr exit from which is prosecution in his view and that plays a role in the G O P desire to protect him and give them hope political cover for making his boat yeah\nSo a whole lot I liked your questions I'm Glad you hung up because she raised some stuff you know I said I Want to talk about it but I'm Glad we did talk about it\nWe're not a question if if you would know that that you are very well\nBecause you've raised and stuff you know I said I Want to talk about it but I'm Glad we did talk about it\nAnd we're not a question if if you would know that that you are very well written and sang or is it is it true that a that this man might belong to a quote unquote is calling bombs group\nAnd um and different types of political pressure and are we going to be able to understand are we able to be able to see or is it anything and the type that would take the money out of these elections because\nIf these elected officials already bought and paid for by the time that did get to Washington DC when then it doesn't make any difference uh it's

your Thirteen eight ... okay [noise]\n\nYou know\nAll about the news into Thirteen aided there'd be okay it is always good to have somebody looking at these deals from the inside out\nA Julian been they did I get it right yes I'm tell us a little bit about Julian how did you come to even be invited everybody don't get invited to\nThis kind of powerful board give us your curriculum detail what did you come from it yeah well so I've lived here for Thirty years in Atlanta and um\nI'm a management consultant a so I have my MBA from all the uh did economics and politics at Oxford so I guess they were impressed by the\nOver educated but um and they overlook the fact that I had already raised questions about um whether these tanks allocation districts were in the public's interest that let's step back who put you on the ... so I was a council appointee a and a you know cancel has to\nA member of the public good points and one council member of the ... the car and a member for a of the council on the board of ... and so when did you go on to the border and invest and land so I went on in twenty eight twenty ten and I've served eight years and uh\nAnd the uh the mayor mayor Reed said oh it's a two hundred million dollar deal is the best deal struck in the country and I said is not two hundred million is five hundred million\nWe were both wrong and seven hundred million is probably going to be more by the time it's finished but that's the hotel motel tax piece that goes into that stadium so walk us through the earliest\nMemory that you have as a board member now um because this\nSeemed to just came up three weeks ago the Gulch yeah adult you did\nBut have you had any discussion prior to the release of the six hundred page document on a Saturday to the city council about three weeks ago has this been bubbling up inside invested ... did you have any knowledge it it was coming or this did this\nCome out of nowhere doing your\nTerm services as well I ... it was not discussed um at the investment aboard atoll that's pretty typical of the ... what kind of gets things at the very last minute\nI'm it's already been kinda signed sealed and delivered um and I'm the one thing I Would say is that I did notice\nWhen a mayor Reed was handing over a hundred and forty two million dollars or some of that was Turner Field proceeds for selling that\nUh some of that was the car rental taxi resigning that over the the uh uh Tony wrestler who runs the whole um to pay for most of the\nUm refurbish spitting out of Philip Snow a State Farm arena and um that was not a deal to invest the land I had to uh having do but I did follow it because I thought here we go again massive amounts of public money going\nAt that time mayor Reed said oh but ... the way came across to me anyway but don't worry yeah we're giving a ton of money to this billionaire owner of the hawks but that's all right because his brother is a big time developer and he wants to do some great stuff in downtown Atlanta and I\nI don't consider myself particularly naive I've been around the block consulting with big corporations and all of them vessel ana\nBut I naively thought okay well a little bit of offset if he does something good it didn't occur to me that we were going to wind up paying for half the Don development which is the way on this thing goes over I Walk us through that we are limited amount of\nTime and I won't get to Tanya and I'm going to get to a whole bunch of questions from our audience\nWalk us through what this deal is we have heard numbers of three big in up to five begins right we have heard one point seven five billion in tax incentives as the deal that you looked at in his six hundred page document\nTell us as best you can what is in this deal and then tell us what's in this deal that bothers you the most\nYeah I mean and it's really the same onset of both questions it is hugely expensive in terms of the public tax revenues that will be lost by this deal so\nUm\nI've got to have all the ... start with senator for it I got as you're older you all the same question\nThe you know\n'cause I have a tendency to just talk just Frank I don't know no other way to do and I still don't know I've tried to flowery language and all of that but when I I just can't do it\nI'm most\nOver for what is really behind his deal what are we looking at what does this deal really about well\nWhen you have ... we know what's been going on a sort of hope for the last eight years the corruption that's been going on at city hall\nIndictments opponent indictment a I Believe that we need to be very careful how we deal with this issue the Gulch\nFive billion dollars came a five billion dollar deal came to city hall\nAnd at the same time they were still in at the airport watershed a diverted see snow contracts it'd be the same people didn't try to get in this deal uh that's why the\nThird party audit that was being discussed was so important um you because ... and that's why when these six council members voted against it I said to myself man what do they got to hide what a city hall have the heart\nI don't know what exactly is going on but I Do know that they've already\nMyself man what are they got to hide what a city hall have to hide I don't know what exactly is going on but I Do know that they've already designated certain people to get rich off of this who uh the ten percent equity minority partner\nIs grant hill from what I've heard I don't know that to be fat but no one ever disputed it without FedEx grant hill works for the hawks former basketball player there going it's a seven hundred million dollars worth of equity\nSo overnight [laughter] grand he'll go be Seventy million dollars richer so uh there's a lot of money in this deal uh it I just don't want to be ten years from now\nA U.S attorney you say that this is a problem because somebody's got to this deal and didn't do the right thing I think that's what we have to be careful about\nI won't come back Julian or when they\nWant you to hear from what you said your numbers man\nOxford Harvard all those degrees and economists and looking at numbers\nLooking at the numbers who stand to lose the most here and who stand to gain the most um tell us about ... mentioned is ten percent equity deals\nUm that would be like hitting one of the biggest and Jack ... is that the mega million at the Georgia Lottery offer a\nWelt depending if they have to pay for it or if they don't have to pay for it it surely would be illegal I mean it it ... so I'm not a lawyer but ah that I got the cutting some of them would not be I Will come back we'll let you tell us that in the town you for what you said as as\nA mother and a community person you bought your house you didn't buy you have to buy\nInto you know this kind of struggle now or in a city that you love professor here and um for what you said what did you think you're looking at and what message do all the

K\nLosing talks Thirteen Haiti W A L K Thirteen aided W. have adult [noise]\nIt is been um [noise]\nThe vein of some folks exist as a\nFamily and uh it uh this saying stop the goats red light it um the counter a narrative is the green like the goes there's a hole in our city that needs to be feel would one point seven billion dollars in tax payer money\nAnd I'm a ... been a a served on the board and you you didn't numbers man they said look the all just don't understand is is a complex deal and the average person who just don't have the capacity to understand how these deals are put together\nUm and uh same coast accent for why why what what is driving this from where you sit and put you been able to analyze\nI Do think that these deals get put together in a way that it's very hard for a focused on this and uh I think that's pretty deliver\nA because actually is rather simple you're saying hey guys you don't have to pay taxes in this a development for Thirty years that is a phenomenal loss of revenue for the city and the schools and that ends up either\nThe residents get worse services and they should have had\nOr they had to pay higher taxes I mean there's there's no two ways right is so huge is twenty thousand dollars\nFor every family of four is what this is going to cost so this is not chump change people just need to understand\nThey are being ripped off you know to put it in very simple terms you're being ripped off by billionaires when billionaires come to town you need to watch your wallet real closely because billionaires are good at taking other people's money away that's how they got that way okay so let's not fool ourselves they are not here\nThey don't care about your affordable housing they don't care about anything except making the maximum amount of money and that's what they're doing\nSo they have everything to gain from it the people that they are paying as for their public relations for their legal and all the rest of it they of course have something to we had a couple of people down\nAt the city speaking for the college uh this off new they didn't announce their conflict of interests but one was an engineer who's being paid to design the platform and the couch and another one is working from Norfolk sudden\nUm Norfolk Southern stands to make a fortune at the moment land they own than there is worthless because it would cost a lot to develop it\nThat's why it's not been developed it's expensive to put a platform up there you can buy land a lot cheaper and midtown in downtown than than putting a platform everything else that you know if you let the market do its thing or you're not going to develop the goals for another I guess in Twenty years um and\nPeople talk about holding on to the land that they will be a whole and knowledge of Atlanta we vote for this there'll be a hole in our heads too is\nUm and people talk about the whole and all of a line that they will be a hole in all of Atlanta where you vote for this there'll be a hole in our heads to if we're stupid and and the whole than um pockets and a massive holding our partners so I think um hold on to your wallet\nTalk about because they talk about attacks allocation district and we're going to take this couple of minutes to break it down\nAnd so basically the basic concept is that they will build this five this twelve million square feet of a building\nThat the wants the improvements made as the improvements of being made the tax revenue that would be generated from the taxable I'm real estate there\nDoes not do just like your property taxes your house in mind it goes into the general fund some mogul fused and go to great in some go to fool to counter to the public schools and a little bit goes to the city\nOr all of their money is going to stay in that area in those forty some acres to continue to fund it for the development so roughly that is one of the skim addicts for this yeah I mean it's\nIt's actually that's where it does get complicated ah my belief is that the billionaire is going to figure out how to get almost all of it into their own pockets it will pay for this platform\nWe need to do\nIs ... ... every resident of the city of Atlanta has\nOne two\nThree four five six people that they can call you can call your district council member right you can call the three as large council members the three large are who my ... I'm ... and ...\nAnd you can call the mayor right and the president and city council but the ... a priority ought to be those\nThree those are for members who can vote your district council member and those three city wide at four four\nThree three zero six zero three zero yeah it's not as ... office at about ... ... everyone who's listening that wants to do something to call them by saying five o'clock tomorrow afternoon your district council member and your\nThree city wide council members and tell them do not vote for this deal that my most important\nThing called the mayor's office at three four four three three zero sixty one hundred that rings at the mayor's office Kesha Lance bottoms off of them is a bad deal to stop the deal or until they can be a vet it are considerably and just stop the\nDeal or tell just walk away and you you know when when does this bad so the band and make good that you can't make it a good deal exactly a Center for when the biggest here the cost is fifty five times what the benefits are worth the little benefits that\nThe mayor kind of ... ah over the over the last few weeks to try to get ... on board\nAnd I would say let's not beat up on the fence all too badly they there's a bunch of them that don't want this deal so they need to be reinforced yeah and that that's always saying but I can\nTell you I've been down there right\nThis is more money than any deal that I was involved in and I can tell you the level of arm twisting that comes with is from the chamber of commerce they all going to receive a call let me tell you how this goes down but it's been a so you see the inside baseball I remember we had some big deal similar to this\nFirst thing I get a call from chamber of commerce well\nI've represented where I Lived and I said if I Can't get elected by the people I don't need to be elected or they want to know why were they start calling people jobs most city council people have a second job\nAnd I told him looking at my house in my car pay for so that that ain't gonna work right okay I remember one councilmember they call this from\nRight and uh when he got through like man they you know and we will talk so they call you a job where you were a they put excruciating pressure yup\nOr on the city council people and so that's you standing you you're talking about eight members standing between them and about uh\nIt used to live through not billion dollars you would have the dominant news so now you're absolutely a Supreme joker will hit you in the head for fifty dollars yeah yeah it was two and a half billion\nAnd a half two and a half billion dollars you would have lead you down and then you don't have to live here in the ... the joker will hit you in the head for fifty dollars yeah\nYeah it was two and a half of them and they use them and they love me up stories they build a neighbor that got him on you miss it yeah okay let's just be very real this this is a serious and that's why\nAnd that's why we have to give a counterbalance people have to know that their constituents right you know our arms so that's why I call your district council member those that's for telephone call that everybody is so ...\nIt down is done it and then you can show up one is the next ... member that knows how many have met this week then they announce on ... executive\nCommittee meeting tomorrow but this\nWhole city council meets we're really asking people to turn out on Monday October Fifteen this coming Monday\nOr for the city council being with people who get there by well the meetings have

your small person against all these big money like al said earlier David and Goliath\nAnd and and brother fought I saw him at a limb to street Baptist church and it brought back memories to me of a one of my mentor brother Jose away I spent about four or five months of my life when I was about Nineteen or Twenty years ago\nWith Jose and he he he told me some things and showed me from saying then when I listened to brother benefit\nIt reminds me of that spirit a a fighting for the people and women that are willing to give up what what whatever\nPeople think you should have in your life because you're so smart so educated or are so blessed willing to give it up for your people and that and that was that was Jose he told me he said brother frame\nDon't you really mess with them politics

Astros division series games were in the afternoon now does that stop people from showing up at the ballpark absolutely not what it does do is keep them out of prime time\nAnd potentially the opportunity for more eyeballs around the country to see them\nIt also in his opinion is a slight because the Astros are the chance\nFirst world series championship and history went through Los Angeles courtesy of game seven and a lot of the personnel is the same including the young core Jose all to bay Carlos Korea Redmond himself George Springer who now has ten postseason home runs\nThese guys are

exciting I maybe not the best person to tell you what to watch because I can find the excitement anywhere\nBut I Will say this when you're up against the red Sox Yankees\nYou're probably gonna lose most times for a couple of reasons number one this is the first time we've seen these do franchises New York and Boston against each other in the playoffs since two thousand four they've got a long and storied rivalry\n\nWith a lot of moments that people still recognize even though it's been that long they're obviously division rivals their games\nBecause they're on national TV maybe a chicken and egg type of thing but because they're on national TV\nMore people know them you've\nGot potential and VP candidates ... you've got Aaron Judge who is in my opinion is the best ambassador that baseball has to offer right now\nAnd you've got proof\nYeah you got Aaron Judge who is in my opinion is the best ambassador that baseball has to offer right now\n\nAnd you've got proof that people will tune in to watch these games they routinely do well in the ratings and major league baseball has struggled with its ratings lately\nBaseball become much more regional where you get huge numbers in the home markets of the two teams that are playing but national broadcast during the regular season\nThe ratings are miniscule compared to say the NFL or even an NBA playoff game baseball does not rate well\nOn TV much anymore again thinking nationally not local markets is after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio going back to a game one of the division series between gangs and red socks\nOn TV yeah so this is cable not your over the air network came on was fifty nine percent in viewership from cubs nationals a year ago\nSo we're talking about the Chicago Cubs here we're not talking about a slouch we're talking about the cubs\nWho've gotten more people on the bandwagon and more young superstars then one for age I should have\nBut socks off up fifty nine percent\nA cubs broadcast from two thousand Seventeen and how about a hundred\nAnd fifty eight percent endures you ever do that\nThe sixteen that's just one game\nCompared to the Yankees division theories against Cleveland last year how about a different comparison New York's division series opener against the Indians a year ago which actually was a Thursday night not a friday Thursday night is one of the most watched\nNights on TV\nOf the entire week friday and Saturday So notoriously difficult nights for TV networks because people don't stay home and watch TV on friday and Saturday a lot of people go out

Chris\nSays got the Mike and his questions from you started off with rich Amy who wants to know with Halloween coming up what was your favorite costume as a kid\n\nI've no idea I don't really remember dressing up much I did do the cow girls taking a couple of times um I don't know that was so much when I was a kid it was a couple of costume parties that I went to my favorite Halloween costume most of all time was an encyclopedia\nBagel cardboard box it was a Halloween roller skating party and I went as an encyclopedia or a dictionary it was one of the other regardless there was a giant book made out of a a cardboard box colored on both sides and I folded up and it had my\nArms you know how to our holes in it and have my arm sticky outside\nIt was a bit awkward to do the whole couples skate thing but you know when you're in sixth grade I guess stuff I fifth or sixth grade that couple skaters and all that important in the grand scheme of things\nHowever that with my most memorable Halloween costume I'm sure right when it's when Star Wars characters I Want is daisy Duke once but my mom would not let me where the short short ... obvious reasons and she also wouldn't she didn't allow me to wear high heels\nBut it was it was a sort of precarious\nSo yes they do guy did Wonder Woman I did once I had to wonder when under ruse\nAs when I'd much much much much much younger so those were some of my Halloween costumes but most memorable was roller skating with\nA cardboard box this guy\nDisguised as a dictionary or an encyclopedia I'm so glad there are no pictures of that although\nMy might have some I'm not actually sure I've never gone back to dig through the old picture there might actually be some photos out there might have to be a question that Isaac brings up during asked him and his mom anything [laughter] I was doing oh Dr moms terrible remembering things I'm not sure she would but we can ask her\nI think will definitely have to look into that David wants to know are you an anti fan of any team meaning as their team that for whatever reason you just can't help but root against\nNot anymore Michele I'm kind of beat it out I mean certainly there were teams that I couldn't stand when I was younger and I'm not going to reveal those because that's not fair then people will start to call me a hater and and now that I Do this job for a living\nAnd then I don't have a choice but to cover every team out there it's not like I pick and choose that comes with the territory when you're a network host\nUm I that that's kind of go on for me I Will say this one it was more of an individual one than anything but when I first became a NASCAR fan\nI was such a passionate Dale Earnhardt supporter but I used to I hate it of course his rivals and so I used to root for a passion and a window passion excuse me that that Jeff Gordon would crash so\nI Would roots as much for Jeff Gordon too well and to to wipe out as I Would for Dale too when\nI'm so that's just one individual what I ... my favorite all time tennis player so of course I was rooting for her rivals to lose a Monica Seles used to annoy me doesn't anymore obviously um but yeah I think the ones that are not going to I'm not going to give you\n[laughter] you know the teams that I root for it's pretty easy to figure it out because it's generally the rivals\nUm but yeah it's not the same anymore because I'm looking for storylines I'm looking for and drama\nAnd I actually have to pay attention to all of them and I think when you get to know the guys in the clubhouse or you get to know where they come from how hard they work to get there the adversity and the obstacles they've overcome you naturally lose that hate 'cause there's no way you could not appreciate what they've done and what they've accomplished\nSo Nick has two suggestions for earlier in the show you had mentioned Tuesday motivation is hash tag and you were looking for something with a liberation he came up with two suggestions and kind of like either these either tenacious Tuesday for turning up Tuesday\n[laughter] I like turn it up Tuesday today's it's just fun but it's it's I don't know that it it's kind of benign what it actually lead you to anything you can be tenacious any day but what is being tenacious it's not it doesn't lead you anywhere\nOn Twitter I mean a so turn it up Tuesday I like it 'cause that's an option let's do that let's turn it up Tuesday we already have touched down Tuesday in toys alert Tuesday I'm I just I was\nYeah I was looking for something to replace Tuesday

probably by the the\nI don't know the first hour being done then between Red Sox and Yankees in it felt like the Yankees weren't going to be able to get anything going with their bats ah they\nWere

bats\nAs responsive in New York and is Aaron Boone mentioned the entire goal of the red Sox pitching was to keep them from leaving the yard was to keep them in the ballpark and I definitely did happen\nBut the the starter for the Yankees\nIt had been precarious for them anyway in the second half of the season from Louis ... we saw that come back to bite him in game three a CSA ... hoping for one more glorious moment in pinch stripes it didn't happen for him and then even going back to Jay happen the opener he'd been somebody that a lot of success\nAgainst the red Sox but it didn't happen for him either and\nCredit goes to the red Sox they've got a couple of MVP candidates on the roster and they've got a pitching staff\nThey've got a pitching staff that well it wasn't perfect I mean think about the David Price game\nSometimes things go according to the old cliches are according to the old patterns and they also had issues with their bullpen so going back to the opener they allow the Yankees to get within striking distance and then\nAgain with Craig kimbrell he was really the only guy from the bullpen who wasn't able to shut it down Chris Sale actually came out of the bullpen to which was interesting\nUm but for kimbrell it was his rough outing in the night that made this one close so not perfect\nBut for the Yankees that was really their major issue and it was a big question mark going into this postseason [noise]\nSo they need to address the pitching staff to be sure and one of those questions that they have to answer is about the ... so he was in trouble from the start left the bases loaded and the first so managed to regal off of that book but only survived the three innings as short as postseason outing he's older obviously and he's on a free\nAgent so

pharmaceutical kind of tell me was how does that sound sixty minutes and that's all eyes on hundred and fifty thousand is locked up in the car and forgive me we'll let us is like sixty feel that day\nYeah those are going pain clinics where doctors basically not doctoring they are simply prescribing narcotics\nYeah and so I saw them you know but that gift kickbacks to the doctors were pushing their product and so that it is that there's got to kick back they close it and then I got thrown out of the ... the pharmaceutical companies pay the uh pilots is I'd say oh don't fight it for the forms to fill out the what the jail at all\nAnd so now I caught it has become a separate debit because it's it's affected the wealthy college age their community their bills and bills are not African American community wants the epidemic but now that is in the cage and wealthy environment it's a it's a very powerful\nFor what's happening welcome back for zero for eight nine to two seven zero three four zero for eight nine to two seven zero three breaking news of the day\nNikki Haley has resigned as the United nations ambassador she's no more we are waiting for the details\nOf that resignation nobody saw this coming this was not something speculated a lot of resignations in fire rings that have happened in this White House everybody's all coming everybody saw coming we talked about it right before it happened\nSometimes President Trump denied that there's any issue at all I actually thought Jeff Sessions would go before Nikki Haley I really believed that Jeff Sessions you can disagree with his politics and his accent and general appearance\n\nBut you cannot deny but he is one tough little man he's a tough little guy okay for zero point not to to seven zero three let's go to Joseph in Boston, Massachusetts should be interesting Joseph\nJoseph while you're there let's just wait and see Joseph\nWhen it comes to voting elections coming up very soon let's hear from Trump\n...\nJust tremendous woman or just just matter [noise] and then I like ... percent less\nYeah our President Trump that he likes to lose about twenty five percent less now\nOnly twenty five percent drop old age twenty five percent say we don't know exactly what that means because he did not give us the starting number see we need to know the starting number is if a starting number was one hundred then that means that Seventy five percent feel passing\nStill a majority\nIf we started fifty then that's pretty bad\nTaylor Swift\nOn Instagram vis\nI'm writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November six and which I'll be voting in the state of Tennessee in the past I've been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years I feel very differently about that now\nI always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect them fight for the human rights I Believe we all deserve in this country\nI Believe in the fight for el GB GQ rights and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is wrong I Believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying sickening and prevalent\nI cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for all Americans no matter their skin color or gender or who they love running for Senate\nThe state of Tennessee is a woman named Marsha Blackburn\nAs much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women and all of his I cannot support Marsha Blackburn her voting record in Congress a pause and terrifies me\nShe voted against equal pay for women she voted against the reauthorization of the violence against women act which attempt to protect women for domestic violence dog inundate right she believes businesses have a right to refuse service the gay couples should also believe they should not have the right to marry\nThese are not mind tendency values I Will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for a house of representatives please please educate yourself on the Kennedy's running your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values\nAnd it goes on and on is actually a well thought out letter and and that's why I said it's conciliatory it's not abrasive it's a really good letter okay really good letter\nBut the question is does that translate into actual votes sometimes these celebrity endorsements have a way of translating into dollars\nNow where you have a John Legend during a fundraiser for you well that's money\nWould you take money and we can translate money to devote why because messaging is free but to deliver the message to distribute the message costs money that's why you get mailers that's why you see commercials on TV and radio that's why you also see billboards get rubble\nDid robocalls have door and knock or it's come to your whole recall them canvassers all of that costs money and all of that is to distribute one thing the candidate's message\nSo yes in a sense if a candidate is willing to give money or raise money or come to an event and you pay to be at that event yes ladies and gentlemen that is a plus that as a win because that is money and money can be used\nTo deliver a message\nNow would be a great thing if money was completely out of politics but it is not and yes it costs money to\nDeliver any message in politics some people have been very crafty at avoiding paying a lot of money as a matter of fact President Trump\nProbably did it the best\nBecause he had millions of dollars\nOf earned media why he was running for president what does that mean that means President Trump kept saying crazy and sensational things every day because he\nKnew people would report it he knew citizens would consume it\nSo he didn't have to pay a bunch of money on political ads he didn't do that that was not his white as a matter of fact he didn't raise a tremendous amount of money either natural presidential campaign\nBut he was given earned media credits every single week in the millions that as a matter of fact CNN broke it down in one story whether they've said basically in one week Trump has had the equivalent of thirty eight million dollars\nWorth of airtime and he didn't pay opinion\nYeah you change the game the question is can anybody else to do it like that and I don't know when President Obama ran he changed the game and another way he utilize social media like nobody else did before he also utilized his campaign ads he if if people remember this\nPresident Obama when he was running he actually purchased an infomercial I don't know people remember this but they actually purchased twenty five minute block\nOn TV yeah they purchase a twenty five minute block and when Obama Senate then Senator Obama was asked somebody said well listen basically\nBasically is an infomercial\nAnd I want you to get to know me and get to know my bags and get to know what I represent and you know what it worked and worked quite well nobody had ever done that before and nobody has done that since but he understood that people did not feel as if they knew him they liked him\nBetter was a good thought it was smart well educated but they didn't know him so he took opportunities like that to increase his connectivity\nTo those who

black people who salt alternative\nWays of being a in this country\nUm\nTo be sure probably the majority of black people have taken the position of I'm going along to get along just attempting to survive\nOver there were some for whom a survival was not enough\nThey wanted to live in and flourish a hundred their own since self uh\nSelf a sense of self\nAgency a sense of uh liberty\nUm\nSome black folks just couldn't deal with how things work [laughter] and so there's a whole culture of people who existed who are our ancestors who will call\nGo go your way for all for that to to seven zero three\nIs the number All right um\nSo what can we learn from our more room and sisters\nAre first I thought I find it interesting we talk about ... first of all let's let me just define the term what rooms were African people\nWho escaped from being in slave or and many mixed with indigenous peoples of the Americas and for independence settlement\nOr throughout the Americas from North America are all the way down to um oh throughout South America Central America or in the Caribbean particularly oh\nSo it's a word that comes from some folks that come from the Spanish word similar on\nA similar role in the short version is you know it also oh you're going for that it comes from the or walking language oh our walking Indians or the title people but at any rate\nOh\nRooms were people who see it and you know cannot accept being\nThey wanted to find ways to get back to Africa or but because they couldn't make it back to Africa they eked out a survival mode existence matter of fact some of the even were able to be with city\nNorth America Central America South America Caribbean a\n... that they were also groups of uh unskilled glaze over his slaves persons who had been on a plantation for awhile and they escaped you know they could not deal with the brutality that couldn't deal with the abuse\nAnd so they ran away and then all still others were killed in slave persons formulas lay person who said\nWe moving out because my ideal\nMy sense of self will not allow me to do so and I know that we have the skills to build our own form of forty two two seven zero three and so what can we learn\nFrom our ... ancestors is because to me I see promoted the degree\nThat yeah you got it correctly how you doing to Florida I Will rubber how you feel\nThe taste I'm doing fantastic nobody that I took a breath is funding it out alive um that I've decided that there is a beautiful thing or bad forget about that you know what that um [noise] the question you asked this money back but found that by the fact that like it\nRuins who took off in the early stages up the pressure in my opinion are the ones who have not been totally not connect you with the venom from white supremacy\nAnd they're still had a strong settled identity and then you who they were\n... so what did they run away they did not\nHave to figure out why they're going to do what you had to do and today I think that\nPeople are so effective but just by the fed them that they're not even thinking like the number one when thinking that they can again it's like you know catching the flue if you're already\nIf it takes over your body you have to wait to get the right thing you know that's just how I look at it so I don't know if if there's anything we can really learn from them\nWith the state of mind that that we are and right now you know independence day you know white supremacy you know\nThat's just my take on it I don't know I mean yes I Know the end of the pockets of us who don't have that with this mentality happening yawning to learn about stuff that I talked to the ... ... after ten minutes\nBut I don't know about it it's a very challenging\nInteresting I Will reserve

me do this now let me let us let us which I thought you get back to the Marines they get back to ... and let's get to the book\nSo hey look you your protagonist in the novel I ... when he was not fly and you got him going through some ... everything\nThat he does go through to get this kind of in the styles and kept it out of the uh and\nIt's just certain you know vote chiefs to to find an ethic where the protagonists a main character goes away in this case he doing away from the plantation he runs away\nIn in in in the time she goes to a lot of experiences you know a lot of ... experiences that helped to develop his\nCharacter or the intellect inches spirit\nYou or I Want to ask you another question but I Need to take another call okay okay let me remind me of a say in my [noise]\nYes

there the first time they go All right Tara [noise]\nOkay soon sit in the world the movement room [noise]\nWith some of those are\nTwo people you don't they All right whatever whatever go get what you don't ...\nI just wanted to make a comment All right that's my hands and I'm a black man that's ... year old black man educated black man I don't think that religion is our problem as a race I think that economics is\nWays that we can show our appreciation for each other particularly oh when I was this has been broken up within the hard work or to be on the show mastery and expertise I'm In the areas that\nAre upper tape to go forward movement in advance with a black people one of the things that we missed I think is that\nUh we're in the midst of what's that called for season or it's important for us to be able to look back\nTo glean some of those tendencies and practices that were used by our people to achieve liberation in times past\nAnd begin to implement implement those are in the here and now both our main thing for the day what can we learn from our ... and stuff just I don't want you to get away without a addressing that particular question which is our main thing for the day\nYes um I think what we get from a loan ancestors is a lot of freedom\nAnd the meaning of freedom and I think we also say encourage and most importantly not to the\nGas and not to fear because\nThey had to be in the state of mind where they did not death in order to take the risk that they took\nThe free because they were constantly\nYou know are\nUnder siege Cindy patrols the militias\nWere you know you know looking for them to bring them back to kill them\nTo bring them back to kill them too and they're you know many times they they did where did catch him don't find them a little camp\nAnd in the movies will harm but quite often uh they were able to find refuge in usually get a sense of all places where they were able to live for decades maybe for their entire life\nBut I think that again what we gain some of them are rules and not only that there was also a certain\nType of spiritual consciousness\n... a a kind of almost like a mysticism write many of them are rules\nOr many of the nineteenth century inflamed Africans and those who for years well had still had knowledge of the metaphysical systems that had come from Africa\nYes what I mean by metaphysical system I mean in the way the way nobles defined it as\nThe science of spirit yes so they know how to enter into the spirit world and they knew how to do a lot of things than the twenty century African Americans no longer had knowledge\nNow or you know they could call will the power to amp up there we were to be sure the system or their their their bones or book bones in our midst than in circles and would you travel\nOr who are able to call for that same kind of a weird thing um ... ... in the here and now we just um I don't know if you interview that oh\nWe've been do you do your normal ring the value of it\nExactly you know many of us don't don't believe that we don't believe that a person could be\nIn New York City and be in Miami within a few seconds\nYeah it's called the thing is that going to movement\nAmong some of them were rules and you find that in every country where you had more rooms and including Louisiana where again the difference in Louisiana because in each areas you know you had to kind of different manifestation of mine ... ship\nWith the some of those they were the major fighting the rooms with the great dismal swamp which was northern or southern and southeastern Virginia and north eastern North Carolina large area to thousands of square miles you had ... we were able to take cover and we're on touched\nBy army the militia the patrols could not touch them I don't know what they had going for them\nNow and they make a big reasons like uh when we could drain the swamp would be can drain the swamp down why couldn't they drained it thin right there was something else happening same thing in Louisiana and really\nWho had come to help people who practice\nAnd yeah no I'm Sorry I\nKnow the other hand you know the the Haitians they were they had already shown like people are on the bottom you knew it was ... or ... or world how ...\nHow to get free and what I learned about the Haitian Revolution and the whole idea of food do because I Know we\nKind of think of it as religion on unfortunately today it's just almost use anonymously and sorcery\nConflated immediately it with some type of evil right what three rather than a religion but it is really moved on the religious we're done or should they they did do one\nRather than a religion but ... don't the religion does or should they will do more than what it\nWas more so than it was it was more of a metaphysical system\nAnd this mumble priest was telling me that\nIt during the Haitian Revolution a devoted to was really a combination of fifty one different\nMetaphor physical systems ... from fifty one different nations wow hope for example you would have the shanty ... devoted to ward off the root cause of the show him saying bring\nIt home and go home and on on the road it all together in concentrated my God this is a source of liberation\nThat's the same way it was used in Louisiana rumors have learned about the brutal quiz let me let me let me just fell this this fall Smith I call it fall Smith cause myth that from the whole subject of the highest form of truth in that that's another thing okay\nSo that's what the false myth of Marie Lu full who was the greatest queens and how again to white and I think the people who are powerful they have to white nights them so most checks on these mini ...\nWritten about vote even a Jew a tougher road to do
