way before now but here it is later the gentleman basically Megan\nKelly said that she doesn't she doesn't see anything wrong with wearing black face\nWhat's the big deal\nHer show was in trouble or she is exerting believed that\nShe's hired a new law for him I think that I think the old from just dumped her\nBut she's going to have to fight she will have to fight\nNBC\nThis drama comes after the host of ... days nine o'clock hour defended blackface during a segment about Halloween costumes claiming that the that the practice\nWhich really has roots in the nineteenth century minstrel show there was really really insane and we broke it down on the show a couple of months ago\nShe said it was acceptable and she said it was acceptable what she was a kid the online reaction was immediate\n\nHollywood figures came out criticizing her\nImmediately\nAnd then when she gets back on the air she apologizes and she just\nWill\nImmediately and then once you get back on the air she apologizes and she just will you go [noise]\nShow I'm Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\nYou may have heard that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes and that conversation turned or whether it is ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another a black person making their face later or a white person making their darker to make a costume complete\nI defended the idea saying as long as it as it was a respectful and part of a Halloween costume it seemed okay\nWell I was wrong and I am sorry\nOne of the great parts of sitting in this chair each day is getting to discuss different points of view sometimes I talk and sometimes I listen and yesterday I learned\nI learned that given the history of blackface being used in awful ways by racist in this country it is not okay for that to be part of any costume Halloween or otherwise\nI have never been a PC kind of person but I Do understand the value and being sensitive to our history the chicken early on race and ethnicity\nThis past year has been so painful for many people of color the country feels so divided and I have no wish to add to that pain and the fence\nI Believe is is it time for more understanding more love more sensitivity and honor and I want to be part of that\nThank you for listening and for helping me listen to [noise]\n\nUm ... who I Want to say two words\nI'm Sorry no you argue about to lose their paycheck man and we understand exactly what you're sorry about\n\nI Wonder is Megan Kelly sorry for\nThe comments she made on Fox News now on Fox News she said some ... things some things that were quite insane and showed her stance\n\nOn issues of historical race because she did proclaim that Jesus was actually a white man\nOn Fox News you were playing but she also proclaimed that Santa Claus was a white man and she said you know children that just is what it is either white men Santa is white center is fictional\n\nBoys he wrote for eight nine due to seven\nZero three but I got to tell you\nShe gets a team effort because she hung in there much longer than I thought you would but maybe it did you apologize for this\nAnd sleep they have a piece on dot com and Santa Claus should not be a white man anymore yet another person claiming\nIt's racist to have a white Santa you know and by the way for all your kids watching at home Senate and just is white but this person is just arguing that maybe we should we should also have a black Santa Santa is what is and just so you know we're just debating this because someone wrote about a kid\nBut first of all Americans just show came on at ten o'clock at night what child is watching your program I mean goodness that's child abuse and she pauses just to say\nGraham I mean goodness that's child abuse\nAnd she pauses justice say kids wait a minute children that has gone too far I'm standing out on my ten o'clock show on Fox News talk of the children Santa is that white man it is what it is really Megan\nReally\nMegan you do know he's for play play you do understand Santa comes from a place known as la la land and make believe\nBut she needed to make sure that children understood that this was a good white man that they're trying to make black a main appalling and here's what was interesting about that entire show I remember the show I was watching it in disbelief\nShe had three or four of the people on the program with her\nAnd none of them stopped to say wait a minute Megan Santa clauses whatever people wanted to be\nBecause they just want to be on television people who refused to stand up to ridiculous news on TV or people that simply want to be on TV\nThey don't want to rock the boat they won't get invited back oh television insane she went on to say in that same bit that Jesus is a white man too that's how she ended it\nWhere Trump speaks a when he says that you know media and even your daughter you know it was all do it but I got I got a\nCall ... brother was let's talk about an open up\nOh yeah oh yeah well it seems very very clearly an definitively stay to what he meant by his sense of nationalism matter of fact I may be wrong I think that the ... nationalism was not even something that the news I think\nThat maybe the reporter all of the question like do what you were like the position that you're taking it out of a national you believe it or not she felt that well if that's the case then if I'm about putting America First Republican\nWhere you are so Jason let me correct you are incorrect on that note because he was given a stump speech and in the stump speech he said I Am a nationalist now he did attempt to protect your lives\nThan he means America First and that's why I played the entire clip the day on the set it up because I wanted people to understand his attempt at a context but then my question is to his attempt and context\nWhen he says I'm speaking of America First well which America are you referring to it we know this in the United states of America\nThis is a country this is a nation\nContains multiple nations that is what it is and I'm listed\nAs an African American there's another person listed as a Latino American somebody else is an Asian American Hispanic American so the question becomes what America is he referring to because we adopted the word rightfully so\nWe adopted the word patriotism\nRather than nationalism he has now adopted the word nationalism over patriotism that's ...\n... and I understand that that line of thinking but in all fairness\nIn every circle that mission when you even get into the work patriotism there are people that buy their critics that find that or even to be somewhere there than there are because they feel as though that just the cohort were for you know that you know a necklace basically\nSo yeah and I and I get your own that people do but I I Believe that liberals progressives do to promote the ideals of America and those who challenge the ideals of America are just as patriotic as the other I Believe that\nNo I agree and and listen and we and and we people of color and all the other callers have fought and died for this nation and have given more so now that my ... and then I understand it but I truly think that it's dangerous man when you were\nAn area where the ... the mass it and I think to be quite honest with you I Would say now twenty five percent of the heap praise on himself you know with with his tone and you know some of the way that he does this thing but\nA lot of it this day and age of ... has to do it this way and like they're being twisted in his\nImagine if George W. Bush would've said I'm a nationalist\nThey hated the\nMagic stone I didn't like his politics I actually I said many times I ... I thought he was a really decent person but I did like some of his politics\nBut just imagine so and I didn't like his politics I actually I said many times I ... I thought he was a really decent person but I didn't like some of his politics but imagine if you would have said that if he would have said that he would suffer the same ridicule is Trump\nMan when ... when Bush was in office especially even though it is so funny how things come back circle full circle but with ... you know that was ...\nI Know everybody everybody loved times and the black community not we had it on a regular and let them know drowning Katrina you know come on man like [laughter]\nBut you but you understand that errors in society are interpreted different because the men and women behavior their behavior has changed Kanye has an absolute change behavior so people would respond differently\nAnd it's not like George Bush with the guy that was among the community to\nCome no 'cause they're not all agree let me ask you this man let me ask you this yesterday\nI'm looking for leadership from the president of the United states on this whole package thing this device our thing right and the head of providing immediate leadership he decides to take that opportunity\nTo ... one marginalize the people who've received a bomb because he referred to them as high ranking government officials ... these are former presidents of the United states of America he did not refer to them is that he said former high ranking\nGovernment officials that's how he was ...\nI think I probably was aware of incompetent you know people like the Congress man I think holder within\n... but he but he could he could say is floating he could have been so he's a smart that right you believe he's a smart guy he could've said including to you a form of United States president but in addition to that he then decided to once again ... due to a vilified those in the media\nRather than calling this an act of domestic terrorism instead of saying that he decided\nTo make CNN a villain in this entire\nNarrative explained that to me\nHere's here's my question my question is this and this is just ... original point okay that would get bored\nI'm telling you that I don't believe that is\nI think this is all a game that was concocted because I truly believe that with\nAll these people can eat things that science how some of 'em by courier some of them didn't even come through the some of them you know\nWait a minute okay a scheme concocted by ...\nBy the by the left\nAre you serious right now yeah and then my theory is right now sir yes what evidence do you have this\nMe out just hear me okay area understand we totally disagree on right and I and I'm not even a ten or ... guys but I Do need to be one now no no no\nI think that I think that the Democrat and the liberals have they're pushing all their ... into the middle of the table on these these ...\nBecause it's just a lot hanging and about what you got the whole situation with them on to impeach trial you got the cabin all day so that they I truly believe in listening I feel I've given credit you're smart I think the cabinet thing with the part I think this whole thing with the with the people\nSaid what do you think about these devices\nI'm saying that if ... if it was somebody that really wants to hurt someone a lot of these devices for what they're saying didn't even have a a triggering mechanisms on it was just to give the chair and the dog to that hey\nWe are the attack and all these people who are calm after who basically have criticized Trump openly are the ones getting need\nYou need a pack and so they could point back to him\nUnder attack and all these people will come after ... basically have criticized Trump openly one getting need\nYou need packing do to make a point backgammon exactly what's happening because people are saying this is all across all I'm just simply saying man you know you you and none of them said no no no no nobody else in all all around the same time I mean it did who would be the motivation for some right we're going to do that\nBecause Trump let all these people are evil yeah but it's close to the election you you asked what what could be the motivation that could be a motivation would you not agree that Trump calling them actual personified is possibly a motivation\nThere will be but if you're that you're that politically or you know that they would also note that old ... at Berkeley affect your your interest in who you know if you want

tuning in happy all those friday to you and I wish this was the weekend we turned back our clock but I don't think it's this weekend I think it's not until the first weekend in November\nBut very soon there will be a weekend night with an extra hour of sleep\nI Will not be wasting it\nSo here we sit all the costs of the weekend I got some yard work done pretty excited about that it just it's it struck me like a wild hair I have no idea why I got over walking the dog it was sunny was windy\nBut I wanted to put this bag of debris out on the curbs which they only pick up on friday so I had one half\nFull in my garage for the last two weeks or two weeks ago it was the last time I did yard work and if it's it's too long\nTo the bottom of the paper bag it gets too wet and then it gets to hold it do you go to pick it up and this has happened to me recently the grass and the leaves and the debris just fall right out into the garage in which case I might have said a swear word or two\nThen so I was worried about that whole bag of lawn clippings debris sitting in my garage any longer and so I decided that I Would do some yard work and still the bag and then put it out of the curve that I could pick it up on friday\nI don't know why can't put a half full bag out there I guess because I paid for the bag so I feel like I Need to use them and fill them before I put them out there I Am frugal I Will tell you that\nSo I decided I pick up six because we've had a bunch of really windy days in my neighborhood in the past couple of weeks in there it's a pretty big stick that were laying around the back yard once you actually had to step on and break multiple times before you could put them in the bag\nAnd I don't know what got in to me I picked up all the states and I thought you know\nAnd there were a few leaves on the ground now completely covered but some leave so I took my lawnmower out and I mode and then most of course\nBecause there were leaves and so they ended up lawnmower ended up serving as I'm older and I'm very proud\nOf myself and uh that was how I thought\nOK I'll get a jump on the weekends 'cause actually it's supposed to do pouring down rain and crazy winds are in my neck of the woods over the weekend there is a coastal storm Atlantic coastal storm as opposed to affect a good portion of the mid Atlantic and the northeast so it doesn't really feel

draft picks will play out\nSo it it's it's not you want to look at the age it's not a good investment if the guy that you're obtaining wouldn't be retiring and you're still giving up those draft

part of the games for the process um\nYou know we feel like we're all from such a toll on the phones ... throughout the course of the day\nOr you can say that again are often takes a toll on a defense over the course of the game yeah you can't let down for even a second as for Mike Zimmer well\nSomeone asked him to the question of why a Peyton Manning Drew Brees off as is so potent why they're so productive\nSo anything anytime Carl anything second ... such a [noise] ... shots on their first and possession or some other formations movements personnel groupings um [noise] they don't carry it on

talking about both they don't care what the situation as they are going to call anything at any time and they're going to take advantage of what they can\nSee and what they're facing and how they can read those defenses it's obviously something that takes time the more you do it the better you get\nAnd and that's one of the things that young quarterbacks tend to struggle with jak Prescott he struggled a bit with reading defenses but when you get to the age the experience\nThe number of snaps logged by a guy like\nDrew Brees or Tom Brady or Ben Roethlisberger Aaron Rodgers\nMean then is there anything on the football field you haven't seen you know and your brain knows how to read this stuff\nEspecially if you're as gifted as they are\nAs for the the Vikings themselves right now they're twenty first in the league when it comes to scoring and the red zone this touchdowns in the red zone they're fifty percent twenty first in the league so that's one area that they need to improve\nIts been weak the weak I think last week we were\nTwo other foreign original movie and I mean it's it's a point of emphasis for us we have to do better than regime we get in there I mean you know we'd like to be\nYou know a hundred percent but you know we've been fairly good defense in the red zone and so you know that that that's one of our areas there were always working on with the entire football team you know often she's touched on percentage and third down conversions in ...\nWhen we all like to be one hundred percent all the time that is the goal\nIt's after hours here on

last championship of two thousand Eighteen thing about it we've\nGone through and I'm naming the highest profile ones are of course college championships in every sport but going back to the college football playoff and the super bowl\nAnd then the NBA and the NHL\nCollege World Series allowed you get excited about that march\nMadness national championship in both men's and women's hoops and it's\nBeen a long run since then and now here we are approaching Halloween which would be the night of game seven though it it will take major feet by the Dodgers to push it to a game seven it's

show got two hours left until we hit the weekend we're asking you\nIn light of this report that the Houston Rockets offered not are offering or would like to offer or plan to offer but have offered\nFor first round draft picks the Minnesota timber wolves for Jimmy Butler [noise] now the idea for Houston is that they're one of the top teams in the west right now they expect to make the playoffs they expect to be contending for championships they really\nAre trying to unseat the Golden State warriors in the west and then also as NBA chance so the idea would be the these are lower draft picks right we're not talking about one two three four unless something goes drastically wrong\nFor not talking about threes we're talking about theoretically a team that would add to Jimmy Butler and then their first round draft picks would end up being\nTwenty five twenty six twenty seven somewhere in there maybe even thirty\n\nAnd so that's kind of the idea is if you're stacking your team and you're adding a Jimmy Butler well then he's draft picks that you're giving up aren't going to be the top flight rookies coming out of college hoops or out of Europe\nBut there's no way to gauge that there is no way to know for sure we don't know who these young men will be we just do right now\nBut they would be a\nDraft picks that would represent the opportunity to ask you to your roster and start to build or transition\nTo the next generation so it it's a ... and the the real concept but the idea would be that Houston would be so good that these draft picks will be lower in the first round still if Jimmy Butler leaves after one year which he's indicated that he wants to test the free agent market\nAre you really prepared to give up for first round draft picks to rent\nA player for a season people are freaking out over one first round draft pick in the NFL for mark Cooper so our question tonight is which athletes out there\nWould you be willing to trade for first

making there's darker to make a costume complete I defended the idea\nSaying as long as it as it was a respectful and part of a Halloween costume it seemed okay\nWell I was wrong and I am sorry\nOne of the great parts of sitting in this chair each day is getting to discuss different points of view sometimes I talk and sometimes I listen and yesterday I learned\nI learned that given the history of blackface being used in awful ways by racist in this country it is not okay for that to be part of any costume Halloween or otherwise\nI have never been a PC kind of person but I Do understand the value and being sensitive to our history the chicken early on race and ethnicity\nThis past year has been so painful for many people of color the country feels so divided and I have no wish to add to

because someone wrote about a kid\nBut first of all ... to your show came on at ten o'clock at night what child is watching your program\nOr just debating this because someone wrote about cats\nBut first of all American your show came on at ten o'clock at night what child is watching your program I mean goodness that's child abuse and she pauses\nJustice say kids wait a minute children now that's that's gone too far I'm standing up on my ten o'clock show on Fox News talk of the children Santa is a white man it is what it is really Megan\nReally Megan you do know he's for play play you do understand\nSanta comes from a place known as la la land and make believe but she needed to make sure that children understood that this was a good white man that they're trying to make black a main appalling and here's what was interesting about that entire show I remember the show I was watching it in disbelief\nShe had three or four of the people on the program with her and none of them stopped to say wait a minute Megan Santa clauses whatever people wanting to be\nBecause they just want to be on television people who refuse to stand up to ridiculous news on TV or people that simply want to be on TV\nThey don't want to rock the boat they won't get invited back oh television insane she went on to say in that same bit that Jesus is a white man too that's how she ended it\nWhy patriotism like nationalism shares of pride and belief in one's own country or values it doesn't include the idea of promoting your values and culture as inherently superior to those around you\nIn the historical context of nationalism it primarily conjures too close associations Nazi Islam and white nationalism these other routes ladies and gentlemen up Adolf Hitler\n\nHe built an emphasis on this extreme notion of nationalism the idea that the only way Germany could be great again wants to seize until the superiority of the German people and dry about those across Europe who refuse to acknowledge that very same superiority\nWhite nationalism which reared its head due in Charlottesville\nIt's similar it promotes a superior platform\nSaying that the society to order starts with white man and goes down from there\n\nIt also claims that the agenda of whites need to be recognized as priority in this country\n\nFor zero for you not to to seven zero three we got a lot of calls let's go to Jason and Bucky adjacent good they welcome\nService or Hawaii um great Jason how are you\nOh man I'm All right man so first I Want to say about each other saying she's absolutely ridiculous man like I you know your take on that is I don't even know why why folks still trying to get away with you know these low key and I look I'm a conservative and and of course you know my position up there but then there's\nA lot you know what I got to give her some credit Jason because I promise you that day she got that job I think she's going to blow up with something racially insensitive and I said that and I said that on air because your history would say in Santa Claus is white a ... white and all of that this is willing to wait longer than I thought\nYeah well and and that that's ridiculous when I got I got a call and about man my original call was going to be about the packages but I Want to just respond to something that you just pick up a kind of ties into that okay man this whole\nThing about nationalism fame man and this is where Trump pizza when he said that you know media and even your daughter you know I Know it was all but I got I got a\nCall ... brother was let's talk about an open up\nA yeah well it seems very very clearly an definitively stated what he meant by that some national matter of fact I may be wrong I think that there were nationalism with not even stop and actually use I think that maybe the reporter all of the question\nHis sense of nationalism matter of fact I may be wrong I think that the ... nationalism was not even something that the news I think that made it a reporter all of the question like so what you're basically like the position that you're taking it out of a national you believe it or not to say okay well if that hey there if I'm about putting America First becomes ...\nWhere you are so Jason let me correct you are incorrect on that note because he was given a stump speech and and the stump speech he said I Am a nationalist now he did attempt to conjecture lives\nThan he means America First and that's why I played the entire clip the day and he said because I wanted people to understand his attempt at a context but then my question is to his attempt at context\nWhen he says I'm speaking of a miracle first well which America are you referring to it we know this in the United states of America\nThis is a country this is a nation that contains multiple nations that is what it is and I'm listed\nAs an African American there's another person listed as a Latino American somebody else is an Asian American Hispanic American so the question becomes what America is he referring to because we adopted the word rightfully so\nWe adopted the word patriotism\nRather than nationalism he has now adopted the word nationalism over patriotism that's ...\n... and I understand that that line of thinking but in all fairness\nIn every circle that mission when you even get into the work patriotism there are people that fire their critics that find that or even to be somewhere there than there are because they feel as though that just the cohort were for you know that you know a necklace basically\nSo yeah and I and I get you on that and people do but I I Believe that liberals progressives do to promote the ideals of America and those who challenge the ideals of America are just as patriotic as the other I Believe that\nNo I agree and and listen and we and and we people of color and all the other callers have fought and died for this nation and I've given more so now that might have and then I understand it but I truly think that it's dangerous man when you were an air were the ... the mass it and I think it'd be quite honest with you I Would say\nNow twenty five percent of the heap praise on himself you know with with its tone and you know some of the way that he does this thing but\nA lot of it this day and age ... have to do it this way and like they're being hoisted in his\nImagine if George W. Bush would've said I'm a nationalist hated but just the magic sorry sorry I didn't like it was nice like I said many times I ... I thought he was a really decent person but I didn't like some of his politics but imagine if you would have said that if he would have said that he would suffer the same ridicule is Trump\nMan with Trump when Bush was in office it's badly even though it is so funny how things come back circle full circle but with ... you know that was\nI Know everybody everybody loved times and the black community not we hate or [laughter] just let them know drowning Katrina you know come on man light and [laughter] but you but you understand\nThat errors in society are interpreted different because the men and women behavior their behavior has changed Kanye has an absolute change behavior so people would respond differently\nThan I did not like George Bush with the guy that was among the community to\nNo 'cause they're not all agree let me ask you this man let me ask you this yesterday I'm looking for leadership from the president of the United states on this whole package thing this device or thing right and it's kind of providing immediate leadership he decides to take that out\nLeadership from the president of the United states on this whole package thing this device our thing right and it's kind of providing immediate leadership he decides to take that opportunity\nTo ... one marginalize the people who received a bomb because he referred to them as high ranking government officials ... these are former presidents of the United states of America he did not refer to them is that he said former high ranking\nGovernment officials that's how he learned that\nI think I probably was aware of incompetent you know people like the Congress man I think holder within\n... but he but he could say he could say including he could advance and so he's a smart that right you believe he's a smart guy he could've said including to you a former United States president but in addition to that he'd been decided to once again ... due to a vilified those in the media\nRather than calling this an act of domestic terrorism instead of saying that he decided to make CNN a villain in this entire narrative explained to me\nHere's here's my question my question is this and this has this look original point okay\nI'm telling you that\nI Do believe that this I think this is all a game that was the topic because I truly believe that with all these people can eat things that science how some of 'em by courier\nSome of them didn't even comforted some of them you know wait a minute okay a scheme concocted by who bought bought the left are you serious right now yeah and then my theory is right now sir yes what evidence do you have of this\nHere me out let's hear me okay area understand we totally disagree on right and I and I'm not even a ten or ... guys but I Do\nThe ... the body one now no no no\nI think that I think that the Democrat and the liberals have they're pushing all their ... into the middle of the table on these these mentor\nBecause it's just a lot hanging in the ... if you got the whole situation with them one to impeach trauma you got the cabin all day so let's say they I truly believe and looked and I feel I've given credit yes well I think the cabinet are playing with the part I think this whole thing with the with the people\nMay say what do you think about these devices\nI'm saying that it\nThough if it was somebody that really want us to hurt someone a lot of these devices for what they're saying didn't even have a a triggering mechanisms on it was just to give the chair and the dog to that hey we are under attack and all these people who come after you basically have criticized Trump openly\nAutumn was getting need you need packed and so they could\nPoint back to him and it's that what's happening because people are saying that this is all across all I'm just simply saying man you know you you know none of 'em and she doesn't have that none of them ... nobody else and all this all around the same time you know I mean it did to what would be the motivation for some white we're going to do this year though\nBecause Trump's let all these people are evil yeah but this close to the election you you asked ... what could be the motivation that could be a motivation would you not agree that try calling them actual personified is possibly a motivation\nNow do you feel there are actually shows should be in jeopardy after those\n'cause you never should have that show and let me tell you why should never should have that show because she said so many in St Louis ridiculous things on Fox News about race\nNot only did she say things like Jesus is a white man Santa Claus is a white man she also picked vibes from\nHer meaty a pool pit or just people like Reverend Al Sharpton river Jesse Jackson Dyson and others because\nShe knew that if she could throw red meat to the Fox News' audience she will always remain a mainstay she even went after women here's here's why she never should have got that show Megan Kelly herself\nWent after women who proclaimed that they were supported by powerful white men fast forward a little bit we live\nWho proclaimed that they were sorted by powerful white men\nFast forward a little bit we realize the mega killer herself was under the same assault as she left Fox News because of it and got paid I got paid right\nBut while she's bus merging women across this country for speaking their true see herself as hot and the fact\nThat she's a victim of the same reality for that reason alone she should've never received ... whether they would do anyway indeed my final question\nTo you is if you said something on this radio program that receive backlash such as the backlash that making Kelly receipt would you then issue an apology or would you stick to your guns\nYou'd ... feel about it so if I feel\nAre truly repairs and I would like I Would say I'm Sorry I said I Apologize on this program what you're saying you\nKnow there are many ways to hear from those he ate my\nRadio dot com clinic for W.

expecting her to just throw in thinking she would change I I pretty much less like an office to my head in Santa Fe worse\nOkay you're shocked by the U.S right now a lot of five and I want to tell you I'm interested in doing this story because I think it's a teachable moment and not for sensationalistic\nShock value because of some of the outrageous things that she says I don't think she's doing them to get attention\nI think she's doing 'cause this is how she actually feels and believes you agree yes I Do she says she's white right from a very early age do you think she's delusional without doubt I mean so is she delusional in other areas are just as serious assets area okay now when she showed up the other day and she met\nOne of our very stable producers\nUm which she discovered on meeting her I guess you talked to on the phone but on meeting her that she was in fact black yes um she was\nVery taken aback very awkward reluctant to even shake her hand while they've got a ... yeah well this is Christian achieve a myth in and worked with here\nShe says things like I should say in cages they're mocking south of us are extreme to say the least an extremely tense if\nYou've ever explain to treasure in the past that she\nIs not Caucasian how does she respond when you tell her that she flew into a rage and telling me I'm white\nHow would you handle that how would you handle that now I Do not believe any child is born this way nine I Do not believe it I think there's a background here\nThat has caused this child to hate herself\nIf you saw the back and forth between the mother and ... and I encourage you I encourage you to look at these yourself but if you see the back and forth the mother is almost\nBeing playful with her child when the child is calling the KKK on speed dial\nA the Ku Klux Klan clowns\nWell the child is calling them the mothers like\nOoh that's just so bad that's just that's just so bad what what's a smack on the face I almost like a smile as if this is cute\nFor zero point now due to seven zero three you see the thing goes friday\nOr let's go to Daryl in Atlanta Darryl welcome\nWalk or shot liquor rather how your everyday Benjamin great and I love yeah pretty said all they do love you back I have a couple of comments made 'em briefly on the young lady there\nThat you were just speaking about I think shades laws identity identity and there are so\nShe doesn't know that she comes from ... in this world I blame partially mother because what a child learns is running to be getting when they come into this world is what's your parents allow you to learn and what they cheat shoot so\nLet's just say let's see like that that's part of parents have a lot to do with that said that they lived in the middle class white suburban neighborhood and all of that they should've been\nWhat's that saying that they lived in the middle class white suburban neighborhood and all of that they should have been pitched in our history as well as her identity\nYou know I feel and brother before you go to the next point\nI felt a little bit of why this child feels the way she feels from the mother because the mother basically saying we were having a great life when we stayed around white people\nAnd then they had to move around black people because I couldn't afford it and it was almost as if she was projecting that same ideology to her child even in her own narrative\nThat is such a point but I'm getting too yeah I'm a little bit right\nUm the subject is a mom and saying I'm I feel that first of all the questionnaire max how are these are all getting the addresses of leaves permanent people um matter of political um\nTo listen to the politics\nI address aren't open up to the public like that where you can just get in the long after him well\nTechnically hand is is not is not classified and it's not top secret or you can hear it\nArtful coordination of propaganda and how it affects the masses and this is what he's good at but as far as providing moral clarity\nHe's completely\nAnd capable of doing that and provide and true leadership well he can't do that either not in a unified way\nSo I Do I don't expect that from him what I expect from him is to just not say anything and let the White House correspondents or the White House communication say it all just let the wrong people released statements and said something not Trump Trump gets in the way of times like this\nMost definitely now transitioned into our second topic that we were talking about somebody on the real talk with rich shot Ritchie Facebook page said\nSo are we to blame the parents of transgendered people she sees herself as white and identifies herself as such just as a transgender one person does with their sex\nNo these are let's say the difference and that's a fair question let me tell you the difference typically every transgender individual that I have interviewed they don't hate\nPeople who are not transgender\nIt's not because this individual says she is tranche race is because the sixteen year old girl actually hates black people that is a psychology beyond self identity and it goes into delusion remember she's not simply saying\nI'd disassociate myself or identify myself in this particular matter she goes beyond that and she says black people are ugly they opt fact [laughter] and they are rude\nAnd she hates them generally uh to the point where she doesn't even like to touch their skin or be around them I have conversations with them well that's a different that is a completely different\nA diagnosis than simply somebody being transgender and so I Do not conflate the two ah I Believe a person if they choose to\nBe transgender I'll Try and sexual gay lesbian that's their choice I have no issue with that no ... whatsoever or this woman uh this young lady the sixteen year old actually he's black people that she happens to be black that's the problem and I don't think any child is born that way I Believe this is rooted in how this mother\nHas dealt with it and possibly some issues beyond that\nSo my final question to you on this topic is how much of a role if any do you think her not having her father and her last has played in the way that she views\nBlack people will never know for sure but I ... I suspect significantly significantly\nUm I was at the APEX Museum two days ago or a ... and many other people man or Dan a more a very good people I was at this museum first time stepping foot inside\nAnd I saw this great African history right and I said there's something on the show I anytime a curriculum against black history which slavery you need to run out of that classroom because they they are already starting on the premise of a lot\nThat's ... that's the American history that's not black history\nBlack history goes well beyond the slave era if they teach you during black history month I'm black people\nBlack history goes well beyond the slave era if they teach you during black history month I'm black people\nOnly black people who invented things you need to run away from that curriculum because they are sanitizing the true contributions of black Americans in addition to inventions a black folk in America\nAlso where no the capitalist we've all banks the lights but we don't talk about those individuals so\nI saw this display at the APEX Museum that takes our history all the way back to Africa and I remember the director the brother told me\nHe said never allowed them to teach black history starting from the era of slavery and I said brother I said the exact same thing because what really happens in the true education of who you are there's a sense of pride\nThat comes with being African in America and here's what really happens mad you've heard people say I don't want to be classified as Africa right they don't like titles I remember celebrity said this one day she said I don't I don't like title I'm just an American I had to remind her that American is the title\nShe doesn't want to be known as African American and there's a hyphen between African American and what does the hype and really mean that hype and is an interruption\nSo when you say you're African American what you're saying is the American part is the interruption of your African journey\nAnd the highest in the American you read the identify with the American and slice off the African and African its origin you rather be identified with the interruption of your journey than the roots of your journey so you don't want to be known as African anything wife there because they told you that African exactly\nThey taught you that they unsophisticated that they got barbarians that has been a lie from the beginning but I Believe some of that lie has permeated to the confines of the sixteen year olds mind somehow\nThat's it for zero for eight nine to two seven
