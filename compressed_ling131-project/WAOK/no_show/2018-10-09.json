people who are deaf first talk directly to the deaf person and not to the sign language interpreter second if the debt person speaks and you don't understand don't pretend that you know what he said instead\nInside of private corporation and he also believes that companies are people I have a fundamental problem with that and he is rude in that state every single time that he believes companies people\nJust as Mitt Romney doesn't hear the root of that one that\nMyself but go ahead I'm listening [laughter] yeah\nSo those are just a couple of the things that stick out to me about Brett Kavanaugh and his record as a as a federal judge and some of the other issues are my new show I I don't care as much about 'em but is big when you can't\nSeparate your political bias and conservative agenda inside of a court of law\nAnd that is what scares me about him as a justice is that he's completely part of it without the ability to swing if you can swing vote that means that you actually looking at the law and you're trying to look at it from the legal standpoint rather than understanding every interpretation of the constitution from a political buys\nI'm fairly confident the guy's going to be decent I Am going I it hadn't said on the air I Am going to take the time out to at least look in the somewhere between three and five of the cases that he judged on his previously now vacated seat so maybe maybe on this something on a soon to know all that there is to know but I\nThink he's more like Kennedy hit me All right\nNow what makes you think he's more like Kennedy\nHe clerked with Kennedy Kennedy Kennedy was Kennedy was favorable of him\nSome reports that Iran as far as I'm being a possible selection and I've I've heard him speak before I've heard him speak on things separate from court separate from court issues I Know some people\nThat he taught and I kind of thinking I get the feeling that he's more like like right there where Kennedy is but I you know\nMy ... but there was nothing to his judicial record that would indicate he's anything micro Kennedy as a matter of fact there are other cases so you know the Hobby Lobby case was the was what we call the religious liberty case that is true okay he has sided\nOwned the religious liberties are basically saying that if you have any particular faith and you work in private corporate America your faith can be protected to the degree of you being allowed to discriminate against another person he has rude universally\nFor those inserting the religious right or religious affiliation in order to change\nHow they can be allowed to discriminate against other people not knowing the Hobby Lobby case we wouldn't call that discrimination traditionally but it is discrimination is discrimination against females because males cannot be included in that group it's discrimination against females and then is restricting of what the females can actually have access to\n[noise] wasn't the Hobby Lobby case primarily focused and all female um contraceptives\nDirect woman but bottom but by\nVirtue of that to save that a company to do this one thing against women and I understand your point your point is it can't be for men to granted that means that the court should have never gotten involved in creating a caviar for the law\nIt can't be for men to granted that means\nThat the court should have never gotten involved in creating a caviar for the law through case law but Kavanaugh decided to stand against women to stand against in my opinion common sense and just stand against uh many of the Supreme Court justices we currently have\nA really wasn't standing against women as much as it was standing against some\nSome policy that would would help somebody in ways that weren't even really directly directly related to their job or their ability to get insurance to get it on their own in the first place I don't think I was really standing against when\nI get the impression that they do and that's why I said like Kenny\nG somebody he's kind of knew you were like a strict constitutional is and I get the impression that Kavanaugh is too and in that regard there's a lot of room for him to do the right thing when the right thing is available to be done and a little bit of role for him to do the wrong thing just to just to be rich\nFollowing me okay so I'm I'm not convinced but I'm a ... I I'm just not going on I'm just not going to do\nThem and I want you to do this as well because of being on the appellate he's actually had some dissent\nArguments there was one or two thousand and Fifteen even though this did not go into the ruling because he himself was not in the majority if you go to is a case called priest for life\nVersus the United States Department of health P.

go left with a capital\n[noise] about like then\nBe glad it was\n\nKnow\nSo\nIf you will get a good\nWhen you do and I got some mail man\nAbout this is a good one to blame for all of the road you notice like they have like a good to know a couple of making I made a\nShould be trying like well we'll talk about it like they do what she would go back to\nWhat's happening what about what was the real for a doctor to seven zero three that does your conversation or somebody is calling\nDefending low Wayne is Deborah in Atlanta Deborah good they welcome ... are you a good job or how are you\nUm find so I wanted to um I heard what you're talking about first of all let me say this about tied the knot temp care Kennedy to Kevin off I just I thought a cane and I'll stop there was that his comparison\nBut was it I don't see the comparison I'm and I'm Talking about judicial record I don't see the terrorists than non judicial record Kennedy could actually swing vote\nUnity and didn't know where to live the right now [laughter] [laughter] yeah so I don't I don't see how that I don't see how that computers but boy it I'd rather you had an issue with what I said about the way\nI Do I Do think it's more of the victim than anything I don't think he's gay I don't think she's bisexual I think you were caught up in that Rahm yeah and that is part of that lawsuit\nAre so ... and it couldn't be or it could be but there but when I say that that was the tongue in cheek remark in response to Mario saying low wind is gay bashing we all know does that back I don't know where the way back to the day I really don't care my response was a ... remark we do know that he kissed me into the mountains we know that\nWe know each is the one man on the mouse who had control of him that his entire life since he was a young teen and people don't consider that I think\nThat I think that has a lot to do with that eight yeah figure a lawsuit that he fired\nAnd that could be an Deborah that is also\nAn assumption that if you will send you waiting and it's cool we do that in conversation all the time but the issue with me is that I've never seen him really just anti gay I've never seen a little Wayne as an anti gay guy you know who's really anti homosexual\nOr with human deal came about what it's for example not that guy was extremely homophobic in his lyrics\nA homosexual or with him and Neal came out with his for example not that guy was extremely homophobic in his lyrics\n[noise] [noise] yeah he is like you say when you grow your wisdom and you're right you see different things and and and\nIt wouldn't matter to you know why he was gay or bisexual what would it matter\nWhat matters to me is is is is it someone being caught out stuff there's someone at him and his character and and I think it I think with everything going on the world today I have to look at things differently even when I see a gay person I have to give our letter day kind of go through because in fact I'm looking at these um\nCondemn you didn't answer my question if he was gay or bisexual would they'd even matter to you\nI don't sleep with them so now that I like you said you said you would sleep with him I said I don't sleep\nWithout okay gotcha well outside of that Madame ... you're not an even ask you that question but watching it I Do know that it doesn't matter exactly that's\nWhat I Want it doesn't matter I was still download examples did you know how many first of all we all know now\nBased on conversations that have been had and verified through the wives of people we listen to our past all now I'm Talking about some of the classics\nSome of the music some of the songs that many of you will made on\nMore many of many of those listening may babies listening to this means well we know now that some of those men mess with other men some of them were day some of them were bisexual some of them just did a lot of crazy things got hot we know that today the wives have said that children have said they have written it down and other publications\nDoes that change their\nContribution musically no not in my opinion\n[noise] oh wow that's kind of like saying that OK let me tell you something Russia at that time\nLet me ask you how to like say was your day like that none of them just put one of the ...\nWhat he did didn't change him as being assessed\nSupport talking about music metal\nWhat would you know art show Deborah Deborah talking about a person's hair Deborah not being able\nTo listen to do with your character what ... what Jay has nothing to do with your character\nDeborah where you're at and lemon and address and unless they let me ask you if you let me ask you\nA question do you think Luther Vandross was the straight man\n\nOr a risk my case I appreciate your call thank you for zero for now too to seven zero three that gives you the conversation let's go to solve a land to solve a good they welcome\n[laughter] getting on the more than ... how are you\nWith Fred until that last conversation I I kinda I'm kinda with Deborah and some of the stuff I think I could harm to spot but I don't care it's music as music people I mean the people's sexuality is their business numbness listen to me the shot on educating me\nMy business when absolutely as your business is out there is our business when you're on the downloading data\nAnd here's a here's another situation that\nWomen don't like to talk about I Know a lot of brothers going to do you miss the game before a lot of women are right I Can't imagine the mental anguish that women have to go through when the data brother now especially the Atlanta because of this whole narrative about brothers ... here but there are a lot of women on the deal to ...\nAh yeah yeah I get hit by a lot of women I'm just oh my gosh okay is that how you know why do you think they went to hit on Usama\nI kinda cute which I'm countries [laughter] just wish I wish you all for the phone call tonight because I can let me check than [laughter] than I Am I Am very oppose\nThe war I guess that could be it I have a lesbian friend of mine she hung out a lot right and she said oh my God I Can't see that grow with Martin with us\nBut I Am I Am very approachable I guess that could be it I have a lesbian friend of mine she and I have to hang out a lot right\nAnd he said oh my God I Can't see that guy was starting with you and I'm thinking that it doesn't but you know what a lot\nMore subtle let me ask you this have you ever had a lesbian experience\nNo never okay no I I just don't I just don't go that way and I'm not against\nPeople being who they are not against lesbian people okay man I have I have a I haven't seen for gay man I I I just I just\nLike wait a minute hold on that we did and I think they're cool but I tell them\nWhat you just said you have a thing for Damien may have a thing for her use actual attracted to Damien\nNo no no not sexually attractive but I'd like I don't get scared I like when they get that went down the down low because gay men have\nA truly people I've accepted themselves\nHave you I think people who are confident about their ... is always there's always attractive it pulls you to them even if you're not sexual romantic matter to them it is something alluring about a competent person\nAuthenticity it's called authenticity that's what it's called I like anybody who's I think you don't have to be a gay man for me it's like you're like that\nBut why do you think you like gay men so much now what do you think that I\nJust I just think that they're so like it just again I Want to be clear I'm Talking about the ones who owns who they are right just tend to be more in line with my likes to see that I like to do that right they tend to be a lot of them tend to be cultural yet that they they they tend to go to like go to museums like music they like\nJust ... I mean I don't want to sound like I'm\nMaking them exotic either because that can be really in something that's not my client I Hope you guys do not call and say I'm making them like a special category I'm not I'm just telling you what I like what kind of people I hang out with the kind of people that I like to hang out with I mean the school and I'm not bothered by it again as long as you're not on the down low\nDating me and that has happened to me before\nYou're been would have to wait a minute to my voice wait a minute you've been with a brother owned a deal no\nNo no no no no no no no no no no no I've I said I've been approached by men who are on that down\nWell how did you know they were on the down low\nYou know 'cause I was surprised when my son said he I'm concerned about my a gate guard because as a gay man you know something about who is who is not I mean that's my experience with game and I was asking me so that really X. yeah oh yeah and I tell you why and they\nDidn't want to see a publicly man I don't think that's\nWhat it is because I Would be concerned 'cause my as a shock I Would be concerned that he does it\nEnd by the way I personally just when you know I personally don't believe low Wayne today\nMy remark was a ... to Mario's proclamation that his album was homophobic in a way but I Do know that the way has kissed publicly\nBaby in the mouth another grown man and he kissed him the first time ... was really young guy when it first happened\nThat yeah and there's something going on with that particular population of hip hop artist which they're saying that there's an initiation thing that happens when young black boys\nYeah I mean that's all do you do you have other rappers that except that you said is true fair so represents not true fifty cent said that ... to try to do something like that to him a buffet came up to him at a party and said hey I Want to go take your shopping if it was the whole ... I'm a grown man do\nYeah but this situation is beyond negotiation right now this is a real like this is a stop what's that mean why do you think is beyond negotiation\nWhen you put it in the type of money that Lana is talking about putting in and they go in there in Atlanta public schools then you don't come out of there will zero ownership but the money to land will be putting in um you know they they will come out with zero was um\nZero ownership when you look at the ballot line and look at how the impacts on housing may and we own at least thirty percent of the projects they get some sponsors and this and that\nBut the money that we put in we own thirty percent of the project where this ... this weird to see I Am the money that we give them we're walking away not old enough to\nOther projects similar to what we own in in um in let's say these bands\nWe were once oil or something out of Fulton County stadium but now after the will to continue reading they put together we don't own their own completely by break in his family so um that's another thing Russia I don't understand there's some advertising going on about the um\n[noise] about the murder thing I Want to ask you 'cause I Know you\nUh I don't understand there's some advertising going on about the um\n[noise] about tomato thing I Want to ask you because I Know you I Know you have to agree that that transparency in and community engagement is just as important or more important it is voting but how could in twenty Thirteen there was legislation in\nThe state they have um Fulton County had three representatives on a on a I'm On the state transportation board and now we're gonna have only one and then the um knew what happened the last piece of legislation that the mayor of this deal\nUm didn't as far as the um\nFar as far as twenty Seventeen he put he put our legislation that\nTook away a dedicated I see from DeKalb County for the county and um the city of Atlanta the largest mass ...\nIn all the contributors to monitor how they how can we as citizens have represented do we know about that and you know about it and we just finding out about it a couple of weeks ago and then they're not that I had a name out well\nHold on wait a minute wait a minute so for you to understand we talked about on this program we even have members of the transportation union come talk about it on the show a they stood against it they still stand against it\nSure how we as citizens and have representatives not even know that this legislation to place because the arena was mayor he had a very good relationship with the governor has any type of negotiations get get 'em get acne ... how do they upheld agreement with that a lot of public know in that when I have\nYeah I don't do well above ... wait a minute that's all subjective they were members of the public who wore where there was some members who were not aware I cannot answer for everybody else's platform and I can handle this platform\nThat we not only highlighted the issue we brought on chairman rock pitch to talk about it from four to county we brought on to ... to ... from the transportation you talk about it we brought on him to discuss these items\nLet me ask you this was this discussion before the state media who I was before okay well I'm I'll tell you I just I just ...\nYeah I understand that brother and so that's why the fair when you say the public was on the where that is subjective\nWell okay but we know cause you know you being a new being you know knowledgeable about it you know that the majority of citizens did not know\nYeah I agree and that's why we that's why we work to make sure people knew about it in addition to that they held town hall meetings they had email blast they had digital advertisement on social media they talked about it they're still talking about it we talked about it before it happened we talked about it after it happened we're talking about it now\nUntil you this right well I'll tell you this right here on Mr ... commissioner spit rather than better last meeting and I'm the one who kind of spend a lot of time in those meetings and I remember when it first came out and we raised our horses put this said that the governor actually signed off on it\nIs to look past me but I Would just hope that um we can have more engagement and I'll take my hat off your ... your first call or second call and when you add I'm Mr Jones easily on here the man is eighty one years old and still think it's enough for him as a citizen to come downtown at city hall they raised his voice against\nImminent domain that you're going to recognize the name of park after the Indian that was asked or sell out and not only a sell out but he wasn't even a pot or try in Atlanta he

well today how you doing today those last\nDay of my life now did you have the day off or you retired or what it does you're you're celebrating Columbus Day of what\nNo I was making a lot about how to bake was today I had to go in and work today as well\nAnd I I Will live it would just regular Monday for us then what's on your mind ...\nAll one thing you know how we often hear that if you don't know history that it will repeat itself yeah that's what they say\nOkay so I got to thinking about they always ask this question about black on black crime and I think that in this country black on black crime probably originally started as\nIndian on India crimes yeah being agitated by the white man who gives both sides weapons and drugs and stand back and said look at these people in every population of color that the white man happy\nGive us both sides weapons and drugs and their stand back and say look at these people in every population of color with at the white man have counted they employ just this tactic of their strategy and we sit back and act like it's something new you know\nNow now I I listen to last week when we talk about cause they bought the actors that we've seen is twenty times in our life in the last Thirty years\nWhere they go out and get a prosperous black man and we buy into the narrative in fate into it and next thing you know we're all on board with their with their shenanigans but we have to learn to do that\nYeah I hear you loud and clear I mean I think again this is a nomenclature this language we've been given his purpose of the given to us as well as a subliminal suggestions\nAh the fact that you call yourself a minority when you out number the of a Caucasian twelve to one all across the planet um and so there are many things that we sometimes call ourselves a subconsciously without knowing that words have power\nAnd I'm so of course were given a certain narrative it is in cultivated in every facet of your life in order to make you believe that one uh people is the period you are in Syria and um sometime it becomes a self\nPerpetuating Kansas thing um but uh you know I agree with you all the way up to The Cosby issue now um because I Believe that that brother did everything they said he did and unfortunately\nNow well did the punishment should be the same uh you know we never got equal justice\nHere but one of the also want us to be very cognizant of\nIt just because they don't apply a standard to themselves don't mean that we should have we should not have a stand for our own actions and behavior\nI agree with you and lastly let me lady with this I I firmly believe that it's all black people seek out the guy that they worship before they stole it into captivity ... and it goes back to that will never be blessed as a people we accept it and go ahead I'm Sorry\nWe we we basically except it was given to us into that this was God and you will get out happiness and there after the after world and all these things but\nIt would require people in this country that that fake too deeply to think about it just changed everything you've ever been taught about religion in this culture in this society here and that's a lot of hard work for a lot of people so that if I don't think that'll ever come to pass you know what\nDo you believe out there what is your religious affiliation identification\nAll I Would say to myself to be spiritual panhandler I mean I'll I'll take the best of what works for me from all different types of faith because\nOf that that seems to work for me or whether the the the discipline that the that the Muslims display or the austerity that the Buddhist undergo and it takes a whole bunch not just one particular thing because we have people who have been praying for years and years and still suffering and justice in this society\nThat high but the thing of all we're always run into when we began to try to delve into this thing of religion is your interpretation of it because some people do black Christian natural is they believe has hit ... McNeil turn and said that God is a black man and he's on the side of the press\nOr he ain't God at all it becomes liberating for us not in slave in force\nSo I think we have always leave room for people to believe but they believe to be spiritual panhandler somebody ... some some among us may say use spiritually cat atomic but if it works for you then fine\nSo long as you live by the golden rule treat people the way that you want to be treated and I don't think you want to be treated like no do pig a rat\nOr be timing courteous to folks\nPeople the way that you want to be treated and I don't think you want to be treated like no do pig a rat or be tired and courteous the folks and are generally you'll be okay you know and if I get to heaven and don't see you because of what my belief was then more power to you [noise]\nYou know so I don't agree with what people say they believe that they truly believe that but at the end of the day you'll religious should look something like what you said the deity that you try to act like so if you are Christian but your actions don't line up with Christ then you've got to be something else\nIf you a Buddhist and you don't have the kinds of spiritual peace\nUh you know or that boot ahead then something gotta be wrong with your practice that tell people all the time I Wish I had missed Christ long before the Christians you know I Wish I met ... uh Mohammed known before I met most of them\nBecause some of you all the bad replica\nWith these little joke was don't care who they robbed now\nAnd uh so if we don't push back in stand up and then they'll take over\nThe only thing it takes ... to exist as for good men and women to sit back and do nothing so doing nothing is not an option so grateful to minister Sharif to ten thousand feel is for standing up and I'm taking a stance against or what is happening over there\nLet's go back to our phones for the phone lines if you're sitting at home what you've been doing all day you can take it easy let us know and um you know if you had the day off today in the parking lot downstairs\nExempt is a lot of people are missing from the various offices that comprise ... there's a a place down here so I Know a lot of you although at home today always measure what's happening in the city about how park and how many parking spaces I can take when I pull in\nMy uh my pinto good and I can almost put it in a way I Want to downsize their\nFull for eight nine to two seven zero three let's go to a lease on line two in Atlanta simply\nThat Harry capital sequel day\nHappy as people data you to say [laughter]\nAnd tell a lie a march out sugar like fall apart they would I say\nAll right [laughter] so why I actually had a quick question so with a loaded registration get like how how fast ... if I go out and do any voter registration back but ...

fourth championship series in six seasons\nBut there'll be on the road at this year they do not have a home field advantage there'll be on the road in Milwaukee to take on the brewers who haven't been there since two thousand eleven many Machado with a three year run home run as you hear Charlie Steiner say\nOn the Dodgers radio network his signature moment since the Dodgers traded for him with the Orioles before the deadline David Freese I mean this guy the postseason killer he's oppose even giant\nAh and he comes through with a big hit as well so between the two of them a and a pitching staff\nWell it wasn't perfect did the job against the Braves abetting but not break kind of thing rich hill was the starter Ryan match that actually got the when\nPedro by as we saw came to my eat a a in a non said situation we saw can lead chance and all these guys getting their work and I'm not sure David Roberts could have drawn up any better it wasn't a sweep like we saw with the brewers over the Rockies\nBut it certainly was a series in which you again solve the home runs because that's what the Dodgers do they set a National League record for most home runs in a single season in two thousand Eighteen\nAnd I think it's a culmination of a season that\nDidn't actually come easy for that I'm not sure if you'll remember at the beginning of the year they were talking about a World Series hangover and they were talking about being nervous and recognizing ... was at stake and how if they didn't get back to\nThe world series it would be a disappointment it all of that pressure on them at the beginning they didn't respond well then they lost Corey Seeger they're all star shortstop and Justin Turner was out for what the the first month and a half or so a Clinton courage shah was

dozen games in a row or something I mean they they weren't nine games back on may first I Believe nine games back on may first and it took them until game one sixty three to be able to win\nThat west division but have you back up even to the final three weeks of the season\nThere was a chance they were going to miss the playoffs altogether because of how hot the St Louis cardinals were and how well the Colorado Rockies were playing and so this is a different type of uh see that but still great preparation for now I'm a match up with a brewers Tina Turner eleven consecutive games\nWe took a

children [noise] I'm just I'm just so where [noise] of how fortunate\nSo that these children are or to our future they are actually the future walking around um and uh it's sometimes have become so when I see them coming\nIt becomes overwhelming because I Know that y'all are going to do some great great things and if you don't we ain't got no changes you know it's really it's really up to ... to make the corrections oh because the reality is is that the average young black child\nIs not learning about themselves at all\nSo y'all go have to be the leaders because other folks you know\nOur other folks are being trained to be followers you'd be educated to become leaders\nIn a goal\nThat fact that you get that right so the responsibility as real as we'll I so I I've been to have been able to have let let me read lighten up a little bit\nAnd the it get it to our conversation today always enjoy of today not see let me show you how this works I got a script they don't have a script right when I got a script because I'm old\nAnd uh I don't I Can't take the\nOther day I got Josh and alone um and um go here to introduce ... who you are you Josh what's your claim to fame\nWell my name's John [laughter] I'm In the age of ... to Kevin Adamy\nYou graduating eighth grader yeah OK alone there were so claim to fame\nLining up on the eighth grade and the academy\nWhen so y'all claim to fame is it's all about to graduate that it okay cool\nI did so let's go ahead on this conversation okay in light of the u._s. open controversy with the arena Williams many issues came forth of that for our students found interesting\nStudents looked at the specific issues of sexism and women's equality in sports so let's quickly go over the event that sparked this discussion what happened to Serena at the U.S open alone\nAt the U.S open sign us so we know Ryan were seen multiple penalties and violations\nThe first one was a ... violation but she argued that had cats are just trying to get her ... that ... the second one was a racket it'd be a violation because she smashed Iraq on the ground at rush into racket would ruin feelings was hurt really bad you know ...\nAnd that that one was a verbal abuse violation for telling the courage to apologize and ... the ... point right\nHer point right Mm she probably could have had even more choice words for him but she was too much of a lady for that or at any weight at any rate that's what happened so we got the groundwork\nSo uh do you think that what she experienced with sexist\nAgain why because sexism is prejudice stereotyping or discrimination based on gender\n... men usually when men curse at ... when they argue with the umpire or they snatched their racket they\nDon't get penalize like Serena Williams did mhm like for instance in two thousand sixteen Gregory debt metros nasty rackets and got off with a warning mhm and the two thousand nine Federer\nHe cursed at an empire and then get penalize\nRight right so those are a couple of examples and that's how you oh that's how you deconstruct their argument their argument was okay she was disrespectful she was out of orders was but really what what we're looking at is she was not perceived to be an equal\nAnd so her behavior was inappropriate to them because she was perceived to\nBe less than them to see how that works mhm yeah and that's and that's\nYou know one of the Islam is you know sexism racism classes and all of those work off the same principle one person or group of people assuming or that they have more value the other people in a book to be paid and you are to obey feel\nAnd um [noise]\nThat's what my mom was used to call\nOn my case it on the radio anyway um\nSo do you agree with these issues well let me see well let's first first worthless to this this briefly discuss your opinions on women's equality in sports from your research what are some of the issues that are still prevalent in regards to women's equality in sports\nWell there are several um problems in between women and men as sport\nUh one is the wage gap for example an\nAverage MBA player makes five million dollars why average WNBA play only make Seventy two thousand dollars right per year per year or so is the author of media coverage although when they make forty percent uh sports people there when they switch to only ... only um cover\nBetween six eight percent on TV ... and then\nYou know the show to show the beach volleyball but there's a whole new stores go ahead\n[laughter]\nAll right I'm Sorry [laughter] but that's exciting for I'd like to ask for\nMy goodness what is wrong with Joe y'all y'all are terrible [laughter] you know just not you know I don't agree with you I like bad children that there may or [laughter]\nYou have to view the children to get them right or [laughter] your your your response to learn a little gray with these issues\nI agree that the large gap is an issue because usually you won't see women's basketball advertise or on TV so I thought that was greatly impact they're not in ... you know what\nI get my ... [laughter] good\nFor you not to do several zero three of them over whether it was a lot of your brother ah\nAnd um [noise] okay [noise] so y'all let me do it with a woman\nSo this though right here in this right to be able to may ...\nAnd I would do a little holes in the world for humans\nIn the world through in about fourteen no not yet everybody Thursday right [noise] that's all I was ... when when World War II and I do think that we were there were a ...\nIt's time to get blessed by the vocal styling or the spoken word styling oh the ambassadors of ... academy\nWill hit us in the ... the old ... ... you\nA little demands data and advocate you know my God they had no last July so gang up by ... by now that he's out there that out\nYeah I Try to find a pattern environment very young age we can't let this yard ... extra added to my body outnumber the outhouse mentioning you know I like to add to every day we see the moment when I looked at\n... am I ... ... again I just back in ...

in the conversation today\nOr some people are very excited that Taylor Swift is taking a stand for something I don't know if this helps or hurts Democrats typically typically when you have pop stars I'm supporting you\nThat's not always a great look I actually think when Jay Z Beyonce when all of them performed\nIn support of Hillary I don't think that helped Hillary not Julia let me get a young Julian on the microphone yeah something like this burning on the inside of his soul\nSo this would almost say man what you're going to say man Taylor Swift has a different type of pop star though\nShe's almost iconic in the in real time with her with her\nWith her ... huge so I don't want you to actually is real nice to man real nice lady you know good looking but I\nI'm about ... you know I'm ... that's your cup of tea brother not necessarily but [laughter] but I think it's important that you don't underestimate how big Taylor Swift is to her\nBut we know that because we see people are passing out are crying when she comes and shake their hand so it was almost like this is Michael Jackson effect to a young white girls\nEssentially I was on Twitter this morning and you can just see like how many people were like hey I'm registered to vote and if you if you check out um a few articles you'll see that the numbers skyrocketed and people who are actually registered to vote\nBut it's also Taylor Swift and today's last it actually to everybody out there today is October night the final day to register to vote in our midterms in November\nStuff young Julian for zero for eight nine to two seven zero three let's go to Sam Sam good they walk them\nHey what's going on which uh this is my home is Sammy\nHuh Yes sir talk to me\nA marriage that I Love the topic I Will be voted for your ...\nYour brother that actually are so let me let me give you an update I Am right now hey I'm number three huh I'm number three best Atlanta radio talk radio personality\nYes sir I I'm an avid listener too I Love the show I concern right now it was a pharmaceutical sales confidence there the new things is if you don't know if you're if you've got to France and other drugs on the court and he's not alone or it's you know a lot of the king fifth that's a pharmaceutical company\nWas at its best on sixty minutes and then so I when I heard during their faith is that your guest locked up selling oxycontin forgive me what what's your guess is like sixty feel that day\nYeah those are gone pain clinics where doctors are basically not doctoring they simply prescribing narcotics\nYeah and so I saw them you know but that gift kickbacks to the doctors are pushing their product and so that it is that it's got kicked back they first and then that got thrown out of their first 'cause the pharmaceutical companies pay the uh pilots his I'd say oh don't fight it for the forms to fill out the what the jail at all\nFor the human rights I Believe we all deserve in this country I Believe in the fight for AOL GB GQ rights and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is wrong I Believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying\nSickening and prevalent I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for all Americans no matter the skin color or gender or who they love running for Senate in the state of Tennessee is a woman named Marsha Blackburn\nAs much as I have in the past and would like to continue voted for women and all of his I cannot support Marsha Blackburn her voting record in Congress a pause and terrifies me\nShe voted against equal pay for women she voted against the reauthorization of the bottles against women act which attempt to protect women from domestic violence stock inundate right she believes businesses have a right to refuse service the gay couples should also believes they should not have the right to marry\nThese are not my tendency values I Will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for a house of representatives please please educate yourself\nOn the Kennedy's running your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values and it goes on and on is actually a well thought out letter and and that's why I said it's conciliatory\nWell I said it's conciliatory it's not abrasive it's a really good letter okay really good letter\nBut the question is does that translate into actual votes sometimes these celebrity endorsements have a way of translating into dollars\nNow where you have a John Legend during a fundraiser for you that's money\nWe can take money and we can translate money uh devotes why because messaging is free but to deliver the message to distribute the message costs money that's why you get mailers that's why you see commercials on TV and radio that's why you also see billboards\nDid robocalls have door knock earth's come to your home we called them canvassers all of that costs money and all of that is to distribute one thing the candidates message\nSo yes in a sense if a candidate is willing to give money or raise money or come to an event and you pay to be at that event yes ladies and gentlemen that is a plus that is a win because that is money and money can be used\nTo deliver a message\nNow would be a great thing if money was completely out of politics but it is not\nYes it costs money to deliver any message in politics some people have been very crafty at avoiding paying a lot of money as a matter of fact President Trump\nProbably did it the best because he had millions of dollars of earned media why he was running for president what does that mean that means President Trump kept saying crazy and sensational things every day\nBecause he knew people would report it he knew citizens would consume it\nSo he didn't have to pay a bunch of money on political ads he didn't do that that was not his way as a matter of fact he didn't raise a tremendous amount of money either that for a presidential campaign\nBut he was given earned media credits every single week in the millions that as a matter of fact CNN broke it down in one story where they've said basically in one week Trump has had the equivalent of thirty eight million dollars\nWorth of air time\nAnd he didn't pay a penny\nYeah he's changed the game the question is can anybody else to do like that and I don't know when President Obama ran he changed the game in another way he utilize social media like nobody else did before he also utilized his campaign ads he if if people remember this\nPresident Obama when he was running he actually purchased an infomercial I don't know people remember this but they actually purchased twenty five minute block on TV\nYeah they purchase a twenty five minute block and when Obama Senate then Senator Obama was asked somebody said well listen basically\nBasically is an infomercial and I want you to get to know me and get to know my bags and get to know what I represent and you know what at work and work quite well nobody had ever done that before and nobody has done that states but he understood that people did not feel as if they knew him they liked him better was a big gap thought it was smart well\nEducated but they didn't know him so he took opportunities like that to increase his connectivity to those who voted for four zero for eight now too\nNow to to seven zero three [noise] for the role for eight nine to two seven zero three that get you in the conversation today [noise]\nRight now there's a battle but there

E. okay\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] ... so he was in the woods Lin allow me to lose\n... who recently moved with all the moms that the president of the moon is what you're talking about one who's bomb Mack was passed in music\nOff because yeah what's happened to walk back yesterday in class and my college class I had a student ask me\nAbout the origin why are we having class on Christopher Columbus day and I said well known the Christopher I recognize as Wallace\nToday let's go to Jason in bucket Jason good they welcome\nThought it was good brother how are you um are and I just saw Richard in St Paul in on this topic\nYes I Know dear brother went and got out of it just didn't know where you stand on there [laughter]\nAh but so my question is I\nI just heard to go through all the stats and all that yes and so forth so my question is and this is what I was asking what what do you suggest we do do you think we're just supposed to just keep letting people run amok\nWell let me tell you one practical solution because I spoke with an executive with law enforcement they had this big conference in Chicago and he said was shot you won't believe how Chicago PD\nPolice they basically do not ... solve murders if the murders stay in South Chicago he's a real job of south the real job of Chicago PD is the key south Chicago separate from North Chicago he said hey no everything they know who's the killer\nThey know who's about to get killed they know everyone who sales adult they notice shot college they know everything\nBut they do not enforce at the same level of knowledge so that's a problem\nWhy do you think that is though\nIt may be ingrained in the culture\nAnd that caused you may have deep roots and cutting activity\nTo law enforcement so we're talking about are we talking about mobsters we're talking about gangsters which I'm a real ... and not just gang bangers we're talking about people that you call the shots have relationships with people who are inside of the actual law enforcement agency also there are dirty cops in Chicago\nOr during the past but what's interesting is that you never really hear about the dirty cops why don't you hear about dirty cops when we know they are they're well because the culture protects them\nWell you're you're absolutely right and I and I don't disagree that there's probably elements with other things going on and by the same token you know a lot of people don't realize you know I my started as a sixteen year old son to Chicago\nNorth Chicago south Chicago\nHe's actually about man around Fort Lee I've been a whole different show but going back and forth with his mom but I'm kind of you know trying to get him outcry man and spent a lot of money and there but\nThat's a different show but I Will tell you that man you know one of the things that most people don't realize you're talking about this issue of Chicago a crime is very segregated other city it just it just got an older section\n... black section of the ... primarily on the south and west side you have a yard Hispanic section is over kind of like you're going to the north side like Humboldt park and all that\nUh I I just I I still say man at the end of the day we have got to do a better job amongst ourselves and not get caught up in these\nThese pitfalls and and and treat back they tried to get us to be successful susceptible to and I and I know that it is easier said than done but I Do know personally programs on the ground up there that are really trying to get in there and do it but the problem is meant a lot of these kids are just not late and they don't want to do no better\nYou got to realize there are other now when you say they're knuckleheads understand a few things happen so so everything that happens must be explained through the social contacts of that era now where did the gang violence really hit an all time high it was when rama manual the mayor of Chicago decided to allow\nUh public schools to merge basically took to close okay so now you had vice lowered having to go to school with gangsta disciples and let decision\nOr from the government created a few elements number one increase tensions among ths rival gangs number two it also for some of the students who had real beef with rival says to simply drop out\nIf they drop out and not continue their education because the government wasn't thoughtful about the merging element and what that would actually do as a ripple effect to the local community so that was one thing and then in addition to that you created an education drought\nSo once you create the education drought\nThe whole notion of education and higher education becomes distant that's a psychological effect as well so have these problems working together and then the ... already of the Chicago Mayor is not south Chicago it's no Chicago you know that\nYeah yeah well they're going you know look they're gonna they're gonna change of the who butter and ... that just\nYeah it's an unfortunate reality of politics but let me ask you this stop and frisk okay that means that you could stop and frisk me even if you don't think I've done anything wrong how was that right in any context\n[laughter] really not\nExactly because there are a lot of things and brother I said this and let you respond there are a lot of things we can do that unconstitutional that would work okay let me tell you what would work putting a United States military official at every public school\nIn the United states we have the authority now we have the ability to do that but if we don't have the constitutional authority to do that but it would work it would help stop\nIt would help stop school terrorism okay you know it would now is unconstitutional now do you read the constitution in order to do that\nMan you know what that is like our bodies you know how to do it in a constant state of of tension with one another and it's a delicate balance to be healthy\nAnd that's where we are and honestly man that's what although I'm a conservative that we're we're struggling with right now like how much of the ... you know the constitution as it was originally a practical in today's time given today's\nUh just the technology technology makes things so different so you're absolutely right after the course I Can't answer man it is\nBut that's honest that's on him because on one side if you say we need to change the constitution then you have people who believe like you ideologically who said the constitution is here but you know there is something wrong when we feel that the constitution is static\nAnd it is not effective in today's social environment\nIt is it is that we have I mean just just by virtue of the fact that we have access to the technology that we have right it changes things like big time like ... ... ... ... and that's the slippery slope but I just don't know man I just think that at a certain point we got to find a way\nTo figure that out and because I mean we can be so great as a as a civilization man yes you know if we could work on on just this prime Scott but\nNot ... not everything you're saying is ruined the he was really important question did you go off for me for the best of radio personality\nIn Atlanta because right now I'm Sorry I'm not calling again number to buy her when you're [laughter] I'm gonna I'm gonna do it I'm going to do I go what do I go to do it and let me tell you that\nHe is the easiest way is just go to Google and type in AJC news and talk radio pole and that's it\nOkay just by doing better when it's winter the next a remote man I like chocolate which in you know because you know what will announce it great what Ninety percent of your politics but we I don't I can look at the bigger the bird call I Know you can't if there were probably want the same thing I Want to get there but you know\nYear he said he wants to bring back stop and frisk is may say this is my ...\nProudly shows because they know that that\nYou know what I'm saying they now I'll and I'll say black men and women are up there so I this is day and maybe we should take that into consideration or when they're ... or dramas falcon about\nHe knows the bad stuff tumors in there and they trained policeman was the sky that teenagers or young man a policeman you know\nThat's what they don't they just bring it back to the same thing over and over again\nRight now it's just not present you call yeah All right appreciate that I was able to return about ...\n\nFour zero for eight nine to two seven zero three let's go to Doug just
