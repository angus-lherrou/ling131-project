really been on like this and this\nWas happening welcome back zero for eight nine to two seven zero three legged you up in here for zero for eight nine to two seven zero three\nI'm going to play a clip and I will allow this clip to extend beyond normal parameters because I think it's important to understand context and also understand\nHow the mother is responding to this child's in fifth and that she is actually white even though she's not\nAnd how black people are ugly or to hurt\nPeople try to tell me I'm an African American but\nAfrican Americans are loud rude and obnoxious and just altogether fat and ugly\nIf you asked me my sixteen year old daughter has a very out of control identity crisis she truly believe she's white\nTreasure was five years old I noticed treasure was having issues with her race she wouldn't play with the black children pressure would mail or destroy her black dolls she would cut their heads off pull off their arm she would pretend that they were the white dolls slaves\nBought me a gift for white dogs instead of buying need the ugly big lift black dog\nSo mortified I was a single mom trying to support a family we couldn't afford to stay in our beautiful home we moved from a mostly white affluent neighborhoods to see which was mostly African Americans\nIn the suburbs to them I was not anything like other black people they were all rats and they're all get out and they all act like monkeys for school\nWas predominantly African American she started to say very racist things in public like I have black people's hair they're dirty she would call them the N. word\nAnd made me feel good to put down an African American person because it helps sustain their place all African American kids that I was around ... ugly ... and ... they're all ...\nMy daughter is a racist against her own race what I find the most disturbing is my daughter is consumed with the Ku Klux Klan\nIs just shakes me too much for pleasure have you ever reached out to the KKK\nMust be down call KKK they keep me like current on updated event and I've had a KKK number such as I was like in middle school\nOr not you know the march on Washington [noise] twenty five an hour hour and I'm not sure what all\nIdentify with the Ku Klux Klan because the way they believe is just so smart why does right why if I were\nTo ask if you if you've ever gone to their website That's new you've got to figure to much oh that's just all\nWere only ... that's just all\nMy daughter does spend a lot of time on social media I don't even look at her Facebook page it's too painful\nWhat other people think I'm going to do it\nAs a parent I kept expecting her to just outgrow it and thinking she would change I I pretty much was like an ostrich put my head in the sand is just getting worse\nOkay you're shocked by this right mortified and I want to kill you\nOkay you're shocked by this right now a lot of fights and I want to tell you I'm interested in doing this story because I think it's a teachable moment and not for\nSensationalistic shock value because of some of the outrageous things and she says I don't think she's doing them to get attention\nI think she's doing this this is how she actually feels and believes you agree yes I Do she says she's white right from a very early age do you think she's delusional without doubt I mean so is she delusional in other areas are just this area test that's area okay now when she showed up the other day and she met\nOne of our very stable producers\nUm which she discovered on meeting her I guess you talked to on the phone but on meeting her that she was in fact black yes um she was very taken aback very awkward reluctant to even shake your hand\nWhile they've got a ... yeah well this is Christian achieve a myth in and worked with here\nShe says things like that she's in cages mocking south of us are extreme to say the least an extremely offensive\nThat you explain to treasure in the past that she is not\nCaucasian and how does she respond when you tell her that she flew into a rage and telling me I'm white\nHow would you handle that how would you handle that now I Do not believe any child is born this way nine I Do not believe it I think there's a background here\nThat has caused this child to hate herself\nIf you saw the back and forth between the mother ... and I encourage you I encourage you to look at these\nYourself but if you see the back and forth the mother is almost being playful with her child when the child is calling the KKK on speed dial\nA the Ku Klux Klan clowns\nWith the child is calling them the mothers like ooh that's just so bad that's just that's just so ... what was his mark on the face I almost like a smile as if this was killed\nFour zero point now due to seven zero three is it goes friday or let's go to Daryl in Atlanta Darryl\nWelcome welcome or shot look good rather have your everyday Benjamin great and I I Love yeah pretty said all they do love you back I have a couple\nOf comments made 'em briefly on the young lady there that you were just speaking about\nI think shades laws identity identity\nIn ourselves you know this because for right now\nIn this world I blame partially a mother because what a child learns is run the beginning when they come in for this world is what's your parents allow you to learn and what they cheat shoot so let's just say let's see like that that's part\nOf parents have a lot to do with that said that they lived in the middle class I'm white suburb the neighborhood and all of that they should have been pitched in our history as well as her identity\nKnow I feel and brother before you go to the next point I felt a little bit\nA history as well as her identity\nYou know I feel and brother before you go to the next point\nI felt a little bit of why this child feels the way she feels from the mother because the mother basically said we were having a great life when we stayed around white people\nAnd then we had to move around black people because I couldn't afford it and it was almost as if she was projecting that same ideology to her child even in her own narrative\nThat is precisely the point that I'm getting a little bit right\nUm the subject is a mom and saying I'm I feel that first of all the questionnaire of ... how are these are all getting the addresses of lives prominent people I'm Better in\nA political I'm\nPhyllis Simpson politics\nAddress start opening up to the public like that where you can just get in the long after\nHim well technically hand is is not it is not classified and it's not top secret or you can hear it\nAddresses a to public officials and here's why\nThey are registered to vote the voter registry is a public record it take some doing to get it but it is a public record and there are some states\nThat allow for you to hide your voter registration address if you have been a victim of stalking or domestic violence six cetera so there are some exceptions to that rule\nAre ugly pay off fat [noise] and they are rude\nAnd she hates them generally or to the point where she doesn't even like to touch their skin or be around them I have conversations with their well that's a different that is a completely different\nA diagnosis than simply somebody being transgender and so I Do not conflate the to uh I Believe a person if they choose to\nBe transgender I'll Try and sexual gay lesbian that's their choice I have no issue with that no ... whatsoever or this woman uh this young lady the sixteen year old actually have black people that she happens to be black that's the problem and I don't think any child is born that way I Believe this is rooted in how this mother\nHas dealt with it and possibly some issues beyond that\nSo my final question to you on this topic is how much of a role if any do you think her not having her father\nAnd her last has played\nIn the way that she views black people will never know for sure but I Would suspect significantly significantly um I was at the APEX Museum two days ago\nOr a ... and many other people man or Dan a more a very good people I was at this museum first time stepping foot inside\nAnd I saw this great African history right and I said this often on the show I anytime a curriculum against black history which slavery you need to run out of their classroom because they they are already starting on the premise of a law\nThat Islam that's American history that's not black history black history goes well beyond the slave era if they teach you during black history month I'm black people\nOnly black people who invented things you need to run away from that curriculum because they are sanitizing the true contributions of black Americans in addition to inventions\nA black folk in America also were noted capitalist we've all banks the lights but we don't talk about those individuals so I saw this display at the APEX Museum that takes our history all the way back to Africa\nAnd I remember the director the brother told me he said never allowed them to teach black history starting from the era\nOf slavery and I said brother I said the exact same thing because what really happens in the true education of who you are there's a sense of pride that comes with being African in America and here's what really happens man you've heard people say I don't want to be classified as Africa right\nThey don't like titles I remember celebrities say there's one day she said I don't I don't like title I'm just an American I had to remind her that American is the title she doesn't want to be known as African American and there's a hyphen between African American and what does the hype and really mean that high Finn is an interruption\nSo when you say you're African American what you're saying is\nAnd American and what is the hype and really mean that hype and is an interruption\nSo when you say you're African American what you're saying is the American part is the interruption up you're African journey\nAnd the highest in the American you read the identify with the American and slice off the African and African is the origin you rather be identified with the interruption of your journey than the roots of your journey so you don't want to be known as African it'd they why they because they told you that African exactly\nThey've taught you did they unsophisticated that big of barbarians that has been a lot from the beginning\nBut I Believe some of that lie has permeated to the confines of the sixteen year olds mind\nSomehow that's it\nFor the route for eight nine to two seven zero three that's why I met with the whole thing that's where I'm at with four zero for\nEight nine due to seven zero three maybe you agree maybe you disagree what was the ... not due to seven zero three oh don't forget don't forget you can always watch your brother on CBS forty six news at six o'clock weekdays Monday through friday\nFor zero for eight nine to

I'm hoping that the Dodgers when because it the red Sox go three oh the series is over\nAnd the ratings have not been great for this World Series I'm curious to see what they are after this game which is now well into Saturday morning and maybe it'll go 'til six am eastern when we get off the air which it'd be the longest marathon ever which should really be something but I'm just see what the ratings\nAre but if I'm the I'm I'll be I'm hoping the Dodgers when because of the red Sox got three oh and they win this game in the way that the Dodgers are already down into to a whole it would just be demoralizing for the Dodgers\nAnd at the red Sox don't find a way to win this one it it goes to to one you don't press the panic button but you want to see how they do respond which should be later today now because the only person left in their bullpen sale who's not going to pitch and tolerance\nAnd power it's we have to start tomorrow for the Boston Red Sox are later today for the Boston Red Sox 'cause I don't know if you go to Chris Sale on three days rest\nI I don't know if if you do that maybe you do\nBut you have to think Palmer and who's going to start for the red Sox coming up later today and what would be game for what we got to see a game three dozen first says Turner is up at the play these two for six Justin Turner\nSo as soon as the long run and we'll see how long of all the is only a forty seven pitches is going to be able to last on the mountain\nYou just keep on thrown him down and throwing them until the game's over and you hope because that if you're a Red Sox fan but this has been a great game so in the third to go back to the third which it seems like forever ago and it is forever ago a Peterson hits the home run in the third to make one nothing is so low bless\nYou didn't have any more scoring until the standing but from the third to the gate\nFree called el eight hundred to a seven eighty five fifty eight\nEight hundred to a seven eighty five fifty eight eight hundred to a seven eighty five fifty eight\nDebate was so tempting free trip gifts then you've got hooked by the sales pitch bought some time share and you've regretted it ever since\nAnd maintenance these kept increasing and we just didn't want to deal with it anymore that was not anything like what they showed us when we bought the timeshare\nTime shares or the day of the lake there all catch and release unless you talked to resort relieves we can release you from that time share legally and permanently paid less rated by the BBC be a one hundred percent money back guarantee that our clients five star reviews tell the story you\nGet this and for the entire through you know never anything hidden bombs so wonderful\nYou the one that got away before twenty Nineteen maintenance fees or do call now for a free consultation ... a thrill waves fifty nine fifty five eight eight eight three ... fifty nine fifty five four resort and released dot com\nThey catch we release resort release eight eight eight three oh eight fifty nine fifty five eight eight eight three oh eight fifty nine fifty five or ... release dot com\nCall now the sound\nIt is three oh eight fifty nine fifty five ... fifty nine fifty five or resorting release dot com call now\nThe salvation army is on the ground across the state of Florida and the Gulf Coast serving those impacted by hurricane Michael with generous public support the salvation army can provide immediate relief with things like food hydration shelter hygiene kits and emotional and spiritual care\nTo contribute to the salvation army hurricane disaster relief effort visit Salvation Army dot listening give dot org one hundred percent of the designated gifts will be used in support of those affected by hurricane Michael\nAttention all authors page publishing is looking for authors have you read the book and want to get it published page publishing we'll get your book into bookstores and for sale on line at Amazon apple I do in other outlets\nThey handle all aspects of the publishing process for you bringing ... publicity copyright an editing go eat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine now for your free author ... should get that seat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine for your free author certainly should get\nAgain eight hundred by zero one thirty six eighty nine\nOr you or someone you love one of the nearly one million Americans living with Parkinson's disease there is no known cure\nThat you have the power to help the teams that\nPlayed dissipating in a clinical trial the Michael J.

be no to pitch coming from either but I Will hold off because they can't legally do the play by play and I'll tell you what happened after the use the bumper back of the most of the conversation from last week and the nine thirty am eastern game\nAh the the the titans and chargers which ended up being a crazy finish my ... going for two and not getting it I'm\nActually in in what we were talking about Melvin Gordon I did not plan which is good because he did not playing fantasy but\n\nIn in what we were talking about Melvin Gordon I did not playing which is good because he did not playing fantasy but that messed me up a little bit 'cause I was so focused on the fantasy I forgot to set\nWhat was my survivor pool which\nIs the survivor pool here for WFAN and the CBS Sports radio\nAnd I forgot to send them to fix it on time so how did I lose my to fixing the survivor pool even though at four pm eastern I did send in what would have been the Sunday night game and the Monday Night game they would have hit but the rules of the rules little league and I was wrong so yes I lost by survivor pull off not sending the picks it on time\nNow there's two other host here at the station that at the same thing to bigger names than I Am that also did not do that\nAnd they did not send their picks it on time as well and they were not happy with it I was accepting of it because the rules of the roses you gotta play by the rules and I ended up losing\nMy two survivor picks because of that so the fantasy football did okay with no Melvin Gordon however the survivor pool not so much any guesses by the way on who the to a host star here\nYou guys on the other side of the glass that\nDid not get the survivor pulled picks it on time\nOnce once from CBS Sports radio ones from the fan\nI'm going to say somebody that works in the morning show here jak on what side on the networks that that would be correct the most know would it be the other guy in the show yes pat on the other guy the humans duplex machine\nWell here's the thing some texting Ernie about who runs the league and he goes tasks at the same thing I got to be fed every one I go there I go past could sue ... through a table or something I'll just be nice about it but yes a tax was one of them have been Robert sue without scores best friend was the other so there\nYou go with the latest on the CBS where it's rated WFAN survivor pool where three of the hosts for ... to send their exit on I'm nobody has has and and also avid Roberts [laughter] All right so ... back to to come in\nAs I can give you the play by play the pitch can't do that so uh we'll keep you up to them that it's a first and second with ... on on the mound so\nGetting back to the speed Abraham ... which I find\nIt very very interesting where the socks and Dodgers played in a fourteen innings in game two of the Nineteen sixties World Series at the Sox one to one Babe Ruth when all fourteen I went to baseball\nReference during the break in that fourteen inning game six cents for Brooklyn\nOr seven for the socks and both pitchers actually want as long as they could Sherry Smith he went Thirteen and a third seven head to our and runs\nAnd then Babe Ruth one fourteen six that's\nOnly one earned run and then did what they what was I think it was a walk up single and the bottom of the fourteenth if your scoring at home by the way yes it was a walk a single to left field by the way according to this baseball reference of its wrong blame a baseball reference\nAnd Mickey bets just went down so now he will go to the bottom of the fifteenth with the red Sox and the Dodgers it's just one long game is already well over now six hours and the big thing for me\nIt's no matter how this game turns out and once again you would if you are just stay neutral baseball fan have know rooting allegiances to either the Dodgers are the red Sox you want the Dodgers to win this\nGame because I Want to see this World Series go as long as possible\nSome of those dogs and fight I Want to see this World Series go as long as possible\nYou see this World Series go as long as possible\nAs some of the dog fight I Want to see this World Series go as long as possible\nAnd I I don't think Boston's losing the series I pick them in six before\nThe series that start out the bosses you'll lose the series that they don't go on to many losing streaks the Boston Red Sox this year as you may have realized they won a hundred and ... regular season games and in the postseason they'd been phenomenal only losing to\nOne to the Yankees and one to the Houston Astros which was a game to in the Yankee series\nAnd then it was game one\nIn the series up against the actress but it's the red Sox theme home road doesn't matter as they are undefeated\nOn the road in this postseason being five an hour where they weren't getting three and four up against the yanks than games three four and five up against these the nachos at a minute maid park so we'll\nSee if they do lose one right now as we are in the fifteenth but the big thing for right now that I'm thinking of is who's going to start game for\nFor the Boston Red Sox and Palmer incessant pitch yet maybe they go him\nOr they could go Rodrigues they could for the red Sox as I think you only pitched one batter yeah you only puts one batter so they could go Rodrigues but that's a big decision for Alex Cora and I get it to the game tomorrow\nIt's not a a one PM start so it's it is still a quick turnaround and it affects your bullpen greatly and maybe the red Sox even have to go to an open or type of thing we only looked at the picture go for one inning or maybe you let him go for three or four\nThey handle all aspects of the publishing process for you bringing ...

back to the ... the\nBottom of the team in LA Red Sox two Dodgers to to out to your pitch coming from of all due to Ballenger\nAs if you look at this game and the game I'm offended a Fifteen month the just missed a home run one just\nBalance Jay Berman was very excited about that if you were listening to the update but we thought that a lot from this game as Ballenger to strike out looking and we will head now to the sixteenth\nSo the sixteenth ending this game is going\nAs we're not that far away from this game being seven how old which is just absolutely mindboggling by a we touch with the Peterson I'm running the third\nJackie Bradley junior with two outs of the the tremendous start by Walker view or the era era and the top of the Thirteen to the bottom of Thirteen let's get to some other storylines from this game\nAnd we'll start it off many Machado 'cause Machado if memory serves ready goes back to the sixth inning he had a single too left\nOff the wall it should not have been a single should have been a double he thought he hit it out so he elected not to run hard out of the box well should be no ...\nBeen a single should have been a double he thought he hit it out so he elected\nNot to run hard out of the box well should be no surprise because this was the same baseball player many Machado who said a ... not that long ago few days ago that he's on Johnny how saw him he doesn't ... so he gave you first got to report on himself but it's the world\nSeries for crying out loud came through the world series you're down to oh how old you hustle\nAnd he's so good to get paid a fortune in the off season and I would take him on my baseball team in a second\nBut it's tough\nTo not think if he's going to have this postseason going to affect his contract whatsoever and maybe the team gets skeptical of saying and I'm not going to give them as much as I thought maybe a team that was on the fence about it\nBecause we all know how great of a baseball player is but when you get to see him on national TV in the world series and we're not watching a four hundred plus last team in the Baltimore Orioles you get to see things that probably happens in Baltimore now happening on the biggest stage\nBut how you don't run hard\nAnd you would have just thought oh yeah it's a home run let me just jog casually walk for the bathroom whatever hey I have always said about back flips and always set about players that\nThat don't want to run at the ball goes out no problem if you flip the bat no problem with the uh uh like not to run\nThe ball goes out no problem but at the ball doesn't go out it's a terrible up\nAnd that was a terrible walked in the sixth inning fermenting Machado you have to be running it's the world series now he had saw him on that book where's the wall no one's talking about it but it didn't include also for you to just job to first base yeah it's embarrassing 'cause this is\nJustin relevant game thirty seven on the schedule or game\nSeventy four on the schedule so World Series your teams down to oh so you've got to show some hot\nSo who knows if he gets on how maybe they game ends up being a little bit different who knows how that goes and I know it's tough to play that type of game and and what not\nBut if he's at second\nIt could've been a different part of the ball game and and I got ... made the last I thought that the second so maybe it does it have an effect but you never know how that happens you never know so much out as a storyline Ballenger is also storyline\nBecause in the ninth inning\nOf the baseball game ... first base it's a three to patch with one out David Price was in the game at the time the last the pitcher and Ballenger he went on the first move in price center over they ended up getting Ballenger out but then the resiliency of Ballenger\nWas very key as these in the outfield then the next inning chancellor is on third and kids are the editing by the way he almost got picked off at first that he almost got out a third\nAnd then he tags out\nAnd volunteer makes a good enough throne you get kids learn who is not a good game with the base running problems and then and not be able to get home and the and the good throw by Ballenger on the tag up but then later in the game with tens or in a second base\nYou have\nHim having the potential game winning play defensively and he throws the ball away and that time it up to a piece\nOf all the is on deck so they're not going to take him out of this game obviously is Bogart goes down swing that's his third strike out for\nIs on deck so they're not going to take him out of this game obviously is the guards goes down swing that's his third strike out\nFor Bogart as if you look at Boston let's see the offers for Boston I Believe ... that's ... ... says oh for sex with three strike outs so not the potential MVPs find this moment in this postseason\nA Bogart no hits as well\nMitch moral and had five that that's no ...\nJ. D. Martinez had three at bats know ... ... and his three out that he had no hits as well\nAnd\nFor the people that started the gate and that's where you you go wow that's that's in Bogart one of those games or Boston it's ... it's\nA it's a rare occasion but it's one of those games and that's why the Dodgers have to win this one\nSo much out of bounds every touch also let's talk about Ben intended as\nThat was a move that ended up working out because Jackie Brown the junior hits the home run but I was very compelled to see how the red Sox were going to handle is because we're the talked last week and we brought it up on Sunday when quarter was talking about they were thinking about the possibility\nOf with the d._a. ... out of it and yet the bat the picture of putting maybe ... bats at second\nPutting Bennett tend to be in life Jackie Bradley junior and center and JD Martinez in right now Martinez playing with the bomb angle they stole what would tend to start the game in life they put Jackie Bradley in center ... bats and right and they didn't play badminton easily gotten the game later on\nBut that was a decision that you were thinking maybe they do put bats at second but they elected not to go that way and it's a tough decision for Alex core really as it ended up working forum last night instill into today with this game going on so currently\nTwo two in the top the sixteenth which by the way it's now two outs\nAs ... still on the mound for the Dodgers and you off Ken's lawyer who wouldn't this be the ultimate redemption of cancer can hit a solo shot here into the writer left field bleachers even strayed away the center any any part of part just hit a home run for chancellor with the the way he's been around it and the way that\nHe did throw the ball away\nBut the Ben intended decision was it difficult on and he's been just than say should know better than ten the in this postseason his glove was superb up against the Houston Astros his bad it's been really good had the forehead sing game one of this World Series\nSo I was curious to see what was going to do it sometime jotted down and how it was a talking point going into this World Series we've got to break it down last week on how the lack of da ... for the three games in LA as it does go three games then allied with games through four and five\nHow the red Sox would approach it I'm just yeah they do approach it coming up for a game for as well yeah and I play Ben intended for\nThree games in LA\nOr maybe you go to bed the second maybe said Jackie Bradley junior down for one of these games but it's got continues to get big hits that something else yes now doing some of the world series to tie this came up at one one\nUse credit card debt ruining your life\nNow you can have a large portion of your credit card debt forgiven get relief today wants to give you free information that shows you how this program is proven to work for credit card debt medical bills and department store death thousands of people have used it to have a portion of their credit card debt\nForgiven call now for free information and their consultation we'll give you the secret to this money saving program absolutely free\nGet all your opening information that could save you thousands of dollars a year or a month depending on how much you owe direct the more you over the more you can save all you needed to oh ten thousand dollars or more in credit card debt medical bills or department store debt to qualify so call for free debt\nForgiveness information now at eight hundred to oh seven eighty five fifty eight hundred to oh seven eight [noise]\nOr CDs thanks Katie and will be the first Super Bowl fifty three February third twenty Nineteen [noise]\nPlays share the view of the TV and radio dot com [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n...

E.\nAnd we've got a whole lot to get to of course on all sides and all that but I did see Walker was walking off the mound actor retiring\nFourteen straight batters and ended up pulling him way back in the at the end of the seven so they gave them the ... that he came out of the game and they went to kind of Jansen the eighth before he allowed it to our home run\nTo Jackie Bradley junior I saw the Sandy Koufax was in the crowd and he gave a Walker buell or a standing ovation which by the way with Walker view alert\nThis was someone last year\nOn October twenty fifth when the Dodgers were in the world series tweeted a picture out of him in the stands with the sister\nAnd him and his sister rat the game last year in the world series Dodgers disasters\nAnd then he ended up pitching game three and he was spectacular but when you get into Seventy ... kind of start to forget who were the starters where they will not have a winner or loss in their name in the when last column afterwards is going to be someone else\nSo we'll see how this does play out still a man on first ... brother junior that was at\nThe plate and the top of the seventeenth two outs\nAnd they say wanna count so keep you up to date on that as well give you updates throughout the show on this World Series game three which\nAs they keep on than a thousand times it's just ridiculous this is great\nAs it were in the top of the seventeenth now I Wonder if it's fair to get on fans that have left escaped at that place you can't leave a World Series\nAs are in the top of the seventeenth now I Wonder if it's fair\nTo get on fans that have left this gave it definitely is you can't leave a World Series gave you can't leave a playoff game as that goes it's a little juggler now we will go to the bottom part of the Seventeen but it's really weak\nI must have you have a young child with the uh\nOr or something like that if you're just there with your your lady friend or your boyfriend or you're just there by yourself or you took whoever to the games law gets a little kid that the kids just as being a pain and says I have to go it's just enough crying and all that you\nGot to say at this game how you pay money I don't care if you bring a ticket for freight how you just leave this game as I see some empty seats on television that's just a joke it's a World Series game\nI don't care if you missed the train or whatever the transportation whatever you're concerned about\nAnd I remember the national gains a postseason all the the public transportation is the last ...

walking back into the backyard show right here\nStates are made with clothes on CBS Sports radio [noise]\nWalking back into that show right here on CBS Sports radio ... on Twitter where ... chimes in and he says throwing mellow why not if you are the are rockets and the timber wolf\nAlso ah you have let's see who else uh decided to chime in on this\nDance says rocket you jump on this deal they need butler and T walls can build around towns and ... and they offered it so it's all of the timber wolves will elect to jump on it so we shall see and we'll see with or maybe the rockets more into the temporal they want something more I don't know how much more you get out of four first round pegs\nOr by the way to be a sports radio free money for about two and two for two twenty sevens brought to buy Geico great news this quick way you could save money switch the guy go get a gecko dot com and Fifteen minutes you'd say Fifteen Percent or more in car insurance talking about this possible trained with the timber wolves and then also\nThe Houston Rockets were Jimmy ... there could be on the move for for first round pegs would start things off with Trey in Indiana next up was that go on CBS Sports radio morning trade what's happening\nAs a goal or doing great go into\nA yeah I think that the timber wolves want some sort of prove and play or maybe a veteran player or\nI don't know four or five years in the league type of guy that can help them steal the in the playoffs ... maybe ... bottom see and the bottom of the west\nBecause I think if they trade and we brought her to stay I made and Jimmy ... you're right about Chris Paul aging\nAnd maybe on his way out in a year or two maybe three but and Jimmy Butler still ... shifts to the top five for the west without Chris Paul so those late route for those late first Ralph ...\nI mean what caliber players that you really think they'll be able to draft with those low of ...\n... maybe not for this upcoming year but down the road it could turn out to be something special I I'm not going to say it's good to be better than what happened with the net ... and the Celtics but\nI remember that and that still was made at the time and at the time it wasn't this outrageous trade and now it's one of the worst trades an MBA history without what turned out\nSo here's the deal you know here's the thing Jimmy Butler wants out Jimmy Butler made this public that he wants out he's a two thousand and Nineteen player option so you don't have much room to negotiate so if a team calls yet and gives you for first round picks I think you have to take it because what proven player\nAre you going to get for Jimmy Butler one teams do they have all the power here on the negotiating and negotiating rights in trades and obviously used things are going to be good for many years to come up with an offer for first round Beck's\nI understand but do we do we know the players that were involved in an offer from Miami maybe they could have got some players from Miami I understand for first round picks according to what Miami can offer is a is a significant difference but I mean they they could've still got players\nBut what he does the better they looked at the benefit in the big picture do if you're able to even get on a bond average player\nYou may make a playoff spot but and you should make a playoff spot but you're not going to win more than around you may not even when one round so what good does get an app player but maybe you can help build for the future\nAnd get for first round pick that the typical party and that's the thing I I don't agree with you is what good does getting a player do when\nFor the future and get for first round pick that the typical party and that's the thing I I don't agree with you is what good does getting a player do when you're selling may only be to get to the second round\nMaybe it maybe it's a way of Tom tom tip into trying to save his job he figured if he gets for first round pick he's out of the door as somebody else gets to draft dose for first round\nThe yeah I don't think they're getting rid of a typical I just don't appreciate the phone call the Mike in LA next dumped CBS Sports radio what's up my\n... yeah what's up man I'm to me take my mind the ... ... ... you're in LA are you a Dodger fan yeah more casual casual baseball fan yet but I found in the game right now just wander yeah okay I have it on in the background you got you know when I was there and\nBeing ... I was little theories\nAre to me you make that deal if you're the rockets because you had the war is on the ropes and a fortune Chris Paul\nGot hurt and he breaks down a lot and so you need a guy like Jimmy ... who's a a a all sort of level caliber player and one of the best to eight players in the league and I think he puts them over the top I think although state is ripe for the picking\nI don't see them I think the most likely to give her final but if they if they got you mean by other I don't I think Houston would beat them because you\nKnow really not that much better than Houston yeah because I think she Jimmy Butler puts them over the top as you saw in the playoffs last year I mean they go to say really struggled to to beat them so if you add Jimmy ... and it's far from the timber wolves perspective yeah you have\nTo stay in the ... cousins come back and if he's healthy youth in the markets ... paid the staff play\nIs going to go down the drain mind is going to go down to that big\nThree there the favorites but I don't I don't I think that they could see them are just coming up short this season a move whether if it's a a boss in Toronto maybe possibly even feel if they make a move\nAnd I just see a ... from the dynasties after a certain amount of period they just run out of gas and I could see this this year the worst thing getting knocked up because they're not as deep as they were in that that's the main advantage they had all of a lot of teams over the last couple of years they have to give up their some of the guys it seems to bring in plug in their way over the cap\nSo that's why I see this team coming up short if you're using your right there on the costs but when you travel you make that you and to me there are more he's one of the best GM's on a league and he'll make it work and I don't see Jimmy ... leaving it becomes a Houston because they've got a great culture there and Tony put\nEverybody for all the players rave about the system they get to play in him so what's the downside if you're them I don't you know otherwise\nYou give a forefront round pegs for someone you have to make sure you keep them uh but yeah I'm going to stick with my theory in Alabama with Golden State until someone takes them down I'm not going to be the idiot that picks again so let's go to Mike for this year or let's go to Mike in Boston next on CBS Sports radio what's up Mike\nHow's it going yeah you're right you're mentioned something about the the nets trade and I'm Out on that three picks um actually I think it was three picks but one was\n... I'm a traitor pick\nYeah yeah it was a swamp so it ended up being formed picks but yeah with the ... you have this one\nNow here's an here's the thing about it you know you have Chris fall he's agents you got James Harden block or you got to tell a walked up and you're betting on Jimmy Butler for one year says one hundred percent worse than the nets trade because let me add something\nI was so glad that I called the place for mom my adviser really listen and was truly my partner and finding senior care for my dad he went out of her way to get to know him as a person with all these there whenever

Pittsburgh clash in and I have seen or showdown the jets to Chicago to faith not bears Denver and Kansas City to get out and then they have the west match up back Baltimore will battle the Panthers\nAnd kind of line up and the coal take on the raiders in Oakland the day kicks off with the NFL's today\nAs well be their ninth stepping only on CBS fine let's re chat this world\nSeries game and we'll get to the implications from it and I'm very intrigued to see what Alex score and Dave Roberts will say after the game when they do get to the podium just so we could try to figure out how they're going to\nMake this quick turn around and figure out the situation for later today now as\nA do we have the official time on that game can we see what they I Know it was over seven hours but I didn't look at the clock when the game did end but let's see if we had the official time ... of that game as it was over seven hours total old which is the longest postseason game\nIn a postseason histories this absolutely crazy but\nAnyway let's recap it also ah Peterson hits the home run to right field in the bottom of the third\nAnd you had viewer who was just a stunning the game or tires fourteen straight batters in a row they take him out in the eighth\nKennedy chance it comes in for what was going to be a six out saving a wonderful game on the it was two outs in the in the top of the aid Jansen on the hill and he did um allowing a home\nRun a solo shop the Jackie Brad the junior on two outs the wrong time on the game by the way it was seven hours at twenty minutes which by the way uh maybe you could put that on the DVR hope that did it by a few hours or if you miss that so jak you'd rather junior he goes deep but it's still a blast to right field\nOr in the top of the AIDS then it goes all the way to the thirteenth the red Sox to get around with an hour\nAnd then the bottom of the thirteenth in tens or had the ground ball is hardly hit by HP week\nIt was it was hard it bought by ... and the throw it over to first base that goes wide and\nThat made it to two and then eventually a between there to the by the Eighteenth ... months the almost to the home run to right field just one foul and then the bottom of the tea and\nHe does walk it off with that whole run two left center field to make it three to end the Dodgers got to walk up home run and now it is eight to one series lead in favor of the red Sox we'll talk about what this will mean for game for and what it will mean for the rest of the series but\nWe do at the game winning home run by um by next month to that story just continues to grow and just more positivity as it does increase let's hear what it sounded here's the max\nMuncie game winning walk up I'm wrong\nAll they are free to [noise]\nGot back from the\nIn two thousand cave [noise] and the humble Charlie ...\nHey hey hey ho ho wife\nCharley Steiner of the Dodgers radio network at first I thought it was a network call at first show a little bit more emotional and that you're talking about emotion was calls\nThis a walk go home run the world series they give you some life back in the world series\nAnd the Eighteenth ending nonetheless you got a little more emotion from Charlie Steiner jeeze but something that won't get talked about here\nAnd it shouldn't be talked about so we'll do so right now as the months to stories great but because it's a losing effort above the was brilliant he won six six six\nOnly a three hits and then obviously the wandering around which was to walk up and run\nBut that's something that's going to be lost and all these storylines with the ... stuff we're him getting picked off and then him making the play at the plate Machado not running which that could maybe get forgotten about these the Dodgers win the game you were just at twenty four years old being a started\nSeven strike out seven innings just phenomenal Everytime fourteen straight batters\nAnd then you obviously have everything that happens in the thirteenth and the Jackie Brown the junior home run to the aid but the big fat exclamation point\nIs max Muncie as famous on ESPN right now it's a fourth walk up winning Dodgers World Series says three the first since Nineteen eighty eight how 'bout that\nThat's it's just this is the world series this is baseball this is why you gotta love at this time of the year where you would stick around and invest your time in Eighteen innings and hey if you're a\nFan you were smiling as much as you can be right now and if you're a Red Sox fan you're still up to one but you start to wonder could this be the turning point of this series\nThat's what you start to wonder is this going to be the turning point of the series and that answer really won't be in that question really won't be answered until we see what happens in game for\nAnd we'll see what happens in game for because if you're in Boston\nAnd it's a team that has been dominant has been cooling Tom all year but you wonder how the pressure does affect them in this game for were let me remind you it's going to be very compelling to see\nHow they are and who they elect to handle game foreign who starts\nTo go ... they're not going to the game did you do you go Rodrigues I've I Would doubt they go sail on three days rats\n'cause he pitched a game one on Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and and they gave me on Saturday I Would doubt that they will go sell just with this past year probably just want to save for game five if they're you know you know now that you know that there is going to be a game five but\nWho was number one who the red Sox go with them getting number for how do they approached that and can they quickly put this in the rearview mirror\nOr all this something that lingers and you get a series tied up at two games apiece and the Dodgers could try this up for two games apiece is such an impressive effort especially where\nThe red Sox had him after the first two games of the series and if this series and momentum does change and it goes back to to to later on today and the theories that play\nIn this series and momentum does change and it goes back to to to later on today in the series that play by kittens lawyer is going to be looked at and remember\nNow if you're in Boston and the ... score you should just play this one a day to the other game we obviously want it to one it but that's why you when the first two and now it's too warm you knew they were going to get at least one\nOn there are on their home field that I like even though the red Sox have been on the street at this point in the postseason but\nYou've got to put that quickly behind just show up to the ballpark later today and just getting ready to way\nAnd you got when this game because if you don't\nThen you're very very very much interested how the rest of the series plays out because\nMany people thought this thing was over after it was to nothing and deep down inside I was very very skeptical of the Dodgers can make a comeback but this changes it it does it change is that right now and you're thinking of it\nIf it was three oh you would say without a doubt the series is over Boston is not blowing the thrill lead but now with the being to warn you go into\nWhat does happen in game for\n... game for\nYou will look at and you will see it the Dodgers can carry over momentum\nLike they did in the end of the ads\nWere they were down to one a little bit different on the on the the the standing you know and the series but they were down to one and the I don't see as they wait and game for an actress and they take advantage of game five\nCan they put together to wins in a row like they just don't see it coming off an extra inning game that was Ballenger who had to

it was two games won in Boston by the red Sox game number three rich really felt like games number three and four but it's only counted gained number three when eight teen innings and ...\nMonths the

conference and he got right up out of that chair the mentor the be our first adult it'd be good so I\n... and other interesting tidbit from this game\nThis from the Moby network it was a tough night for the top of the red Sox line up the red Sox batters number one through four compared to five through nine Red Sox batters one through four ... old for twenty eight\nTwelve strike out and to walk\nBy thrown on their seven for twenty nine seven strike out and buy walk so if you want to look back at\nFive through nine and seven for twenty nine\nSeven strike outs in five walk so if you want to look back at why Boston last this game\nIt's two reasons number one\nI think it goes to what happened in the thirteenth\nIf you slow down if you don't stumble if you're Ken's lower end up all over to the first base baggage save us a lot of time\nIn this game from the fourteen Fifteen sixteen Seventeen Eighteen and 'cause they don't happen in the red Sox would be a thrill if you just make a good drove there but he didn't he made a poor throw\nSo Ken ... someone you look at it and then I have a good night and the base pass either almost getting picked off at first base almost get an out at third and then\nWhen he tagged up he was just too slow so ... did not have a good night run the bases are they good night in the field so that's number one and the number two at the top of that order ... bat hey I Love his glove in the postseason\nBut ... says the NBA pay and gave number three was over seven three strike out less five men on base Bogart\nOh great\nLove for men on base more or less than a ball that you can't get on a ... yeah I had to strike as to play parents but he was up at three at some point but more than over five JD Martinez who may also be an MVP if it goes to him or ... depending on which one it goes to he was all for three\nAnd he did walk\nSo one through four for the Boston Red Sox just garbage\nAnd this ball game that started last night and did a rat but not that long ago\nIn seven hours in twenty minutes a very quick moving seven hours of twenty minutes right so and that's the big storyline right there ten four and then also the red Sox sitters one through four going zero for twenty eight and it just shows you still\nHow good of a team Boston Phyllis thinking about this little Red Sox one through four hitters one zero for twenty eight\nThey still could have gotten the game and the thirteenth\nAnd they still could have won this game later on they didn't though\nAnd it shows you how tough it is to beat this team this year that won a hundred and ... regular season games\nShows yeah tapas were you were there hitters goes year for Twenty one through four Dodgers still find a way to get a victory so credit the Dodgers they get it done and it's very

Merrill Hodge because of how long the game last than and I didn't want to short Merrill on time because\nThere's a lot that I Want to delve into with his book\nUh with the about the study of a hundred and ten a hundred ... brains that were studied had C D E and he takes a different approach to it so Merrill is going to join us\nComing up on the Sunday Morning show see I have to wait for that with Merrill Hodge\nAnd then with Casey we should have Casey on tomorrow as well so\nEverything's going to be All right but that's live radio when you have the game that you're expecting going nine or if it goes the extra innings maybe ten eleven twelve and ends up going a teen\nInnings and seven hours and twenty minutes so a little bit change around on the guys who had to go a little Omaha Omaha a little audible but we will survive on this one let's get to some college football here some games coming up later today\nAs this is such a great time of the year in October you got the NBA back you had the NHL back your college football in full swing we are in the midway point of the NFL season and you got the world series\nSo you go from the world series and it's crazy in three\nTo it in tire full slate of college football leading into the next day of an entire full slate with also another baseball game in between and too by the end of Sunday night hopefully maybe it goes to the Monday morning how long these games go\nAnd then you've got NFL it's great now the only thing that I'm concerned about and I don't know how this really works so we have direct TV here at CBS Sports radio now\nWe're supposed to be getting a nor'easter is that correct right there are several you're plugged in with this weather report\nYeah man supposed to really bad really bad you can still go walk home and there's a lot of ... oh what do you take a taxi ... ran you know you're over yeah ride share it but that that may be expensive but the the way and steep especially this time okay so how much you pay for it yeah usually anywhere between like four and like six bucks\nBut we may want to check out on the weather and I don't know maybe it's just because I have this places is set up because one TV right now I Do signal from the direct TV so maybe the weather's bad outside but the other TV is working\nSo I don't I don't get how that works yeah it depends on what channel or watching I think okay yeah the two different channels one has not every cause not everything is direct TV ... ones\nFox and another one is trying to sell you some belts right now that's not to the top three has given your number to try to uh sell some workout bell so some interest and stuff\nAnd a lot of pain with with the workout though he [laughter] he's he's he's strain and\n[laughter] they're selling the belt very well so we get to college football and just the second um let me go to John in San jose next up CBS Sports radio what's up Johnny\nThat the bottom of search and some um my brain which first of all New Years didn't need to fall into the stands but second of all what's in the runner at first when it caught the ball\nYes he was at first they said the ball didn't go out to play though correct\nI well that's that that were never really went through the whole explanation suddenly there was a guy second then we get you know it's a ball and then there was there and the guy scores like like first of all New Years if not be the fall\nNo you know one you didn't oh buddy\nYou know it's a ball and then there was there and the guy scores like like first of all New Year's did not be the fall\nNo you know one you didn't but here's the thing and I know is momentum was taking them into the stands and it looked like yeah and he was trying he was trying to stop and sell from the wall and he fell into the stands by a ...\nYou want to hear the front page of ESPN but going\nBut Johnny either way tens or fields that ball which he did and it makes the queen throat which he did and no one's talking about that that that game to me it's more I Know I don't know how to falling into the into the stands why\nBecause the guys still at first so there's two outs\nBut the but they didn't they didn't put the guy and second do right\nNo I just watch it four times the guys at first I'm\nHanging out and he packed up\nWhat what what does he tag up when he caught the ball and fell into the front row\nBut it's an out okay but he fell in the front row so what what's your point it's still alive ball\nHow is it he fell on the front row ma shuttered goes to second quake hits the ball it's an era and the guy scores a tie to\nGet you get one base\nI'm pretty sure maybe I'm wrong on that but that ... that that's what I was thinking that's that's right you get one base right they\nChange the rule so that now if you catch the ball in fair territory and fall into the stands for and to a dead ball area\nIt's now a dead ball but the runners are awarded one base so like if you watch you know live he turned second thinking they're going to go to third and the umpire points back to back and say no no no dead you only get this base [noise] so that's what it is\nJohnny's behind on the rules in terms of you know yes it's a dead ball but it doesn't mean it's it's dead and he doesn't get second gotcha he gets one base\n[noise] still anyway tens or makes the the plight and no one's talking about that that's why 'cause we have this conversation in the newsroom ... now remember to fully made the conversation newsroom I originally someone came over and they said uh you you don't have to fall into the stands like that why do you got to fall in the stands and if you're doing is\nIf chancellor makes a good throw we're not talking about that\nJust in massachussetts next on CBS Sports radio what's not just the\nBig more than guys um so I could go on for a while about this mass but even before the ... air\n... supposedly gets hurt when he gets taken up by the catcher their Sandy hit the ball deep to right field I think he should've scored on if you put where it's hard to it um I don't think his leg was broken eat dog to third base\nAnyways were up by one next any new ideas catches the ball five feet from this than he did not fall into this than he jumped in trying to make his catch what's remarkable\nUm anyways after that you have kids or not set in his feet if you can't make the throat and don't make the throat keep the guy is third base he throws it a mile from first base and this dude scores a you got the body language of poor after the third after the thirteenth ending looked like he was out of it the only one that deserved to win this game was evolving\nIn Utah that Cora was that if the guy I get to one game that you lost that the guy from Berlin and the whole poses unit the manager wasn't interested in the game\nI I can say this I think he has made some great decisions all posted ads I hate that\nThe guy's been barley and it just for a year how you get on the manager\nWith him I think he's made some great decisions I just think today judging on his post judging on his body language judging on the way our top or or to hit I think he was out of it and I don't think our players a show any hard and what do you mean\nJudging on his body language judging on the way our top or or to hit I think he was out of it and I don't think our players a\nShow any hard and what do you mean you think he was out of it just explain that to me what observations you get sit on your couch saying that he was out of the game just as I I'm here you\nKnow so I I think that he was feeding off the way it's top of the order was hitting a you know them going over twenty or whatever it was if you look at the core it it just didn't seem it didn't seem like all the changes he made it just didn't see on the ... really into\nIt I always has resist change that you have a core and the game just want when you have an Eighteen again once they agree just change um I I don't know about an agreed\nThat can have an answer oh my God you think Cora data they are the guys in is his first world series that as a manager he's up to oh it's Eighteen endings his his his options are limited as they are oh he's out of the game\n[noise] oh [noise] God God\nOh\nGuys got fifty minutes good safety fifty percent or more on motorcycle insurance\nDebate was so tempting free

[noise]\nThe other week\nOf college football we will start things off we have three games to pick as always we'll start off with a twelve pm eastern Texas it's the Spartans of Michigan State\nGoing up against for do let's get to this one will start things off with just the trends of how these teams\nHad been flying as of late for the new boiler makers they started out their seasons one through this getting by the way I miss you can say let me just say that but first started out there your own three and they've won their last four games has a big upset last week at home\nAgainst the Ohio State forty nine so it's one of the off the feed the BCS started at Thirteen sandwiched in between those two games were Nebraska annoyed not ads impressive\nBut this is the producer team the boiler makers after a slow start at one point or oh they're foreign three Michigan State on the other hand they've been cold that as of late\nYes they did beat Penn State but\nThey've also had two other losses and their last three games northwestern and then Michigan where they could not move the ball at all\nBut they've also had two other losses and their last three games northwestern and then Michigan where they could not moved the ball at all and they lost the football game Twenty one to seven I look at this line Michigan State is a one point home favorite\nI just look at the way these two teams are playing right now for do has been consistent Michigan State has been inconsistent I'll role was the scene that's been consistent give me Purdue plus the one\nAt Michigan State they'll take care of the sport is bad but you got this game sneaky tough it seems like Vegas is begging us to take Purdue here and there's reason to do so Jeff from systems work to perfection as of late and you saw that\nLast week against Ohio State was the sporting often hasn't really been anything to write home about\nBut sometimes you have to go with your gut and your instincts when making these back\nAnd I think the Vegas has the line right I think Purdue may be feeling themselves a little bit after they're upset when last weekend and I think being at home in that environment help them a lot in that game against the Buckeye heading into Michigan State now it's by far the toughest road game that they have\nThis season the sport nonsense has done a good job of controlling the clock this year and I think it helps them today it will be close game from Michigan State comes out on top I'll take the Spartans minus one\nFigure twenty seven twenty four and by the way ESPN has Michigan State is a fifty six point eight percent chance to get something interesting here\nTo look at when you look at those percentages what whether they mean or how their calculator you take that for what it's worth alright herself but what you got\nI'm taking the Spartans or they haven't lost back to back games from twenty sixteen that's an nuggets that need to have you guys wrote up a [noise] it seems like it it seems like a ... game for Perdue are just coming off the upset and I think like you said the Spartans have been inconsistent but I think it's an up a week from Michigan State\nFan he likes to make a comment

tell you what side of the line I Am lying on when it comes to\nFive topics of conversations in sports but we do have to start with the baseball which is dominated the majority of this radio program on a Saturday morning because the baseball game was something\nThat we have never seen and that's a seven hour and\nTwenty minute a baseball game in the world series the longest postseason game that there has been\nAnd this is one that you will remember\nFor right now\nBut will you remember it for a long time all that really is going to be determined on how the rest of the series does play out so let's read cat the crazy game from last night just in case if you're a ... to only watch a little bit of it\nOr if you watch the entire thing or if you fell asleep and many people fell asleep with their hands on the remote or maybe their hands in the popcorn bag\nAnd fell asleep watching this game just because your body had enough from the long day of work that you had a few hours before that it's also something to wonder about how many kids even though it was in a school now many kids ended up missing this game regardless\nThere's times to complain the time to be annoyed with the length of a baseball game even though friday and Saturday game three which if you pay the ticket\nAnd ended up by basically got two games for one but it only counts as one game because when they did anything so technically that's to baseball games but it only counts or one because you got to have a result and there was a result after nine there wasn't resolved after ten eleven twelve thirty forty fifty sixty Seventy but there was a result after the walk up by ... so\nWhat if you watched a little bit of it or if you watch the entire thing let's recap it for you right now so and the third inning\nYou had Peterson hit the homerun\nSolo shop Dodgers up one nothing Walker bill was fantastic as the one thirty seven innings retired the last fourteen batter see face on his final pitch\nHe threw the ball Ninety eight miles per hour\nNow some people wanted to second guess day Robert why'd you pull him out of the game and even part of me that even though he's at one of those seven he just do Ninety eight and his last pitch in the seven maybe you're putting them out there\nBut the alternative that they went to was not a bad move you went to Kennedy Jansen or a must win game down to oh to try to get your six out\nHe got the first to that in the top of the aid with two outs to out magic continues for the Boston Red Sox Jackie Bradley junior had say moon shot to right field\nTies it up at one you move on in this game and in the ninth Ballenger gets picked off\nWith one out on first it was three to pet she gets picked off gotta run down that got him out than in the tent Salinger gets the redemption and\nOn first there was a three to pet she gets picked off got in a rundown that got him out that in the tenth Ballenger gets the redemption\nAs being kittens are was on third fly ball center field to balance your cancer tags guns out at the plate\nThen you move into the thirteenth Boston gets to run on an error and then in the fourteen under the bottom of Thirteen you get the Dodgers getting a ... a run on an error as in cancer with two outs gets about to him it was ... very quickly\nIt was nice hard at ball kittens stumbles a little bit can't make to throw\nIt gets past the first base when it was off\nNext thing you know Dodgers get the run across the plate from that play and we get to to to\nIn between the fourteenth the seventies max Muncie\nForget what I think it was exactly but he adds one down the right field line it goes foul just midst of a home run but then even though Nathan involved he was really than the game for the red Sox who was supposed to be the game for started out won't because he won six settings\nAnd was truly my partner and finding senior care for my dad he went out of her way to get to know him as a person was always there whenever I

eight teen\nTo the Dodgers Red Sox still up those two one will get the pulse of Boston right now with Rick next ... be a sports radio what's opera\nWhat's going on but doing great go ahead\nI I'm just calling to say I think tonight the red Sox come out I got fire on all cylinders that get up the hill but then I go off three games to one and the fact is already sitting in Ames out and getting another title Yankees\n[laughter] let me ask you something and I always enjoy the Yankees Red Sox driver\nBut it's the world series and I love what they do afterwards\nOn Fox without a big Papi and and they brought out there in Boston fans going nuts son Alex Rodriguez and Gen you like\nDoing the David Ortiz is it really necessary though in a home playoff game when you're focusing on winning the world series and you're already just just meant the York Yankees in their own ballpark to scream Yankee sucked inside the stadium in a World Series game\nHonestly no I don't think I'm not a fan born and raised a whole life um if I don't think it's wrong or only what playing them all and make\nYou rub it in the Yankees fan bases obviously greatest friends right ever you can't knock that off in Yankees\nNo doubt about it without each other what kind of throw it out to get you know what to do it your way but I definitely think we need and so on a rock bank were just mad rush to Boston that's all it it\nNo I I have no problem with the Arab the nearest thing is fun and I know there's some people that actually care what the product is on TV and they're going to be like all you can understand what the announcers saying because the fans are so loud\nI think it's very entertaining and I think it's great but I just did chuckle the other night when I heard the Yankees sucks chance I think it was in I ... wandered game too\nEntertaining and I think it's great but I just did chuckle the other night when I heard the Yankees sucks chance I think it was then I gave them on their team to when you're playing the world series in just took care of the Yankees like let the Yankees worried about having a golf ball right now right\nAfter you got to hang up there on the broadcast so I guess\nWell no not that after the game but I don't agree with it\nI I don't I don't think we can go in a way it's just one of those things that we're all going to be dead and it's got to be happening [laughter] but\nLike I said go Red Sox LA they ain't going to have enough to come back as one game the red Sox to celebrate in LA and I said it's over\nAnd appreciate the phone call Rick thank you he obviously did not get my point I Try to make it two or three times but Alex Rodriguez says not calling the games on Fox that would be John ah that'd be John ... and Joe Buck\nIran does call them on ESPN for something that baseball with a mad and also Jess but ESPN doesn't have the rights to the world series from a television standpoint so it's after the game and yeah ... ... the big hurt you also have a ride and big Papi where a ride\nGets to hear a lot of those same chance but\nI did a here on the broadcast it was either getting one are getting to the chance of Yankees suck during the game that's what I was going on and I just like like I I get it Boston and the Yankees it was happening during the Yankees game up against the red Sox I Would get it but\nThere I just didn't really understand it but I've also been to a patriot games are randomly the Yankees suck chant will break out as well so just something that crossed\nMy mind and I get its funding the rivalry and everything and it's not like I'm at right about it and yelling\nOr to do so stupid it's\nRidiculous no just if I'm In the world\nSeries and I already beat the New York Yankees not thinking about the New York Yankees anymore maybe when you when the world series ya you rub it in their faces and have some fun at the parade but\nSo I got one more games but I Do tend to lean more towards the color not that it's impossible for the Dodgers to come back there only down one game and there's so many uncertainties we'll have the red Sox are going to approach game number four so sudden possible for the Dodgers to win the series by\nJust in a series like this and I know the\nDodgers got their last year and they're returning and we'll see how that does play out but with the way Boston is played this year they don't go on many losing streaks\nWhen you went on during the regular season games you're the best team for a reason and the red Sox shot the IRS displayed more consistency compared to the Dodgers now that doesn't mean they're going to win the series how many time in sports have we seen a team with day Thirteen and three record\nOr a great record or a team that can be like a hundred and six hundred seven wins and they don't they don't win the whole thing that happens\nIt definitely happens and this Red Sox season is ultimately going to be determined on a thing when the world series or not 'cause if you want a hundred and ... regular season games sure that's great\nBut when you're in a market like Boston when you're in a market like New York\nWhen you were not amount of games you're expected to win the world series that if you don't win the world series\nIt's a season I looked at it and you say wow\nI'm not going to remember the hundred and eight regular season when I'm going to remember the games that we lost in the postseason where if you get maybe into a smaller\nMarket where you don't have that much success and you're not used to this month six\nIn the postseason where if you get maybe into a smaller market where you don't have that much success and you're not used to this much success in Boston\nSince two thousand and four they've won three titles so\nWhen you have a team that's been a successful and you have this many regular season wins yeah when you get into the postseason if he were lost the Yankees are cc look back at but the bad taste in your mouth even though I had a great regular season\nIf they would not\nHave done what they did up against the ashes yeah to see if you look back and you say ...\nCould have been the one that should've been a whole lot better and now once you go to oh you better when the world series but I still lean towards Boston 'cause I think to the better team\nI think from top to bottom dropped the entire rotation of the better starting pitcher I think that the better line up\n\nBullpen yeah I Do like the Dodgers bullpen a little bit more but look out balls he's been used as a bull pen in this post season\nAnd I know it gets lost but I was a heck of a a greedy got any performance out of him but if you're a Boston fan\nYeah you shouldn't be confident right now you should still feel\nEven though you lost this when you're up to one

Jeffrey welcome to the show I'm so excited to have you\nHere today thank you Amanda I'm excited to be here and thank you for your interest in the film and television industry here in Georgia\nWell I think I'm not the only one that's interesting I mean this is just a booming industry\nYou for your interest in the film and television industry here in Georgia well\nI think I'm not the only one that's interesting I mean this is just a booming industry in our state tell us a little bit about the exciting things that are to come in a little bit about how Georgia has truly transformed to be the Hollywood of the south just a little bit can I can I tell you more than a little bit me a little\nI Love talking about this subject well to understand what we're doing here in Georgia and really understand what what we're doing the Georgia film academy you you have to have some contacts me everybody knows her should know by now we have a film and television business here in our great state\nBut to really understand this business let let's let's put some numbers on it let's have some context framework if you will to talk about the Georgia Dome academy what we're doing what we're going to be doing so I always like to start with where we worry about a decade ago in two thousand and seven\nWe had two hundred and forty two million dollars in economic activity here in Georgia [noise]\nDue to film and television production in two thousand and seven not bad\nThe film tax credits um the Georgia\nEntertainment industry investment act passed in two thousand and eight and this past the school year so I'm just last year we had nine point five billion dollars in economic activity here in Georgia do to film and television production you might say that we have a ten billion dollar a year business\nI'm going to go on with these numbers but the point I Want to get across is there is no other story like Georgia's there is no story in any other state and the other territory any other region in the world where you see this kind of dramatic and indeed unprecedented growth\nGeorgia is now number three in the country for film and television production\nWe're actually number five in the world and when you look at major feature films so grossing major feature films\nSeventeen of the top one hundred grossing feature films or rather Seventeen at the top one hundred major feature films when you look at how much they've grossed\nThose Seventeen films were shot here in Georgia more than any other state or territory so we're actually number one in the world when it comes to major feature film production pretty remarkable we had three hundred and twenty film and TV productions here in Georgia last year\nNinety two thousand two hundred Georgians are now working in this film and television industry according to the motion picture association of America so I Hope you're getting the picture film and television we're kind of killing it here in Georgia\n... is not a word we are failing and Jeff ... amazing it is so just to be clear what drove that type of growth from two thousand and seven from two hundred and forty two million ten nine point five billion in twenty Eighteen\nThank you for that that is a great question and I can answer it with ah hopefully some real specificity three things that we looked at a gym really drive a film and television production industry first is as I mentioned the film tax credit we have a great film tax credit easy to use easy to monetize\nNo caps sunset clauses in our state stands behind it\nSo if you're going to come to Georgia and shoot a major feature film production\nYou can feel confident that that film tax credit is here right number two infrastructure\nGeorgia has over a hundred sound stages in the state pretty remarkable we have north America's largest sound stage here in the Atlanta metro region and we actually have the second largest sound stage complex in North America here in Georgia\nSo along with the studios along with the sound stages we have world class inventors support systems anything that you might need from camera rentals to property houses today um the the sauce\nIt is we have world class inventors support systems anything that you might need from camera rentals to property houses today um the the soft um businesses that are associated with this industry from travel agents or to construction\nUm the carpet houses in ... for example are participating in driving what we're seeing in our sets here so a film tax credit and infrastructure and final a crew\nEnough Georgians to do all this work and frankly a few years ago three or four years ago there were some questions about whether George had enough crew to sustain this as I say unprecedented dramatic growth\nAnd that was addressed by the Georgia film academy\nSo that is how the Georgia film academy came to be the gateway for jobs for a lot of people in Georgia let's talk about that I Know I you mentioned infrastructure I Know you mentioned film tax credit and now the earth's crew\nWhen it comes to crew in Georgia jobs I Know that that's kind of tied in with the film tax credit correct let's talk about crew and how the Georgia film academy provides\nThe crew in essence for the the industry because you all are training ground and so to speak for people who are interested in getting into the industry as far as production instance aren't ... tell us a little bit about that\nSure so first you had asked about the film tax credit and um let me I'm explain a little bit more about it\nWhen work is done here in Georgia services are utilized on film and television production companies receive a twenty percent tax credit in addition\nThere is a ten percent up left as we say that has also allowed to be used on top of that twenty percent when the Georgia Peach is put in um the trailer of a a motion picture or a a television production\nSo as I say easy to use easy to monetize and it really works well infrastructure um is the second driver in this industry and number three is crew\nSo again there were questions about whether or not we had enough Georgians to do all this work a few years ago and because this industry is so important to our state we wanted to make sure that when it comes to the film and television industry Georgia is all and so in January of twenty Fifteen governor deal announced\nThe Georgia Dome academy a collaborative effort of the U. S. G. the university system of Georgia and the tea cs gee the technical college system of Georgia simply put we want to make sure that we put Georgians to work\nIn addition I like to say that there's three things broadly speaking that we focus on at the Georgia film academy\nAnd you're not only going to learn a specific trade but you're going to be of value to production\nWhy are we doing it this way the answer is\nWhat's really sort of unique about the entertainment industry is that it requires two different factors in order to go to work one is\nEnough knowledge and training and skills to as I say man to be of value to productions into a foot in the door everybody seems to understand that to go to work in the entertainment business need to put in the door you need a break\nBut before we put you on to a set on one of our I'm a great sound stages here in the in the state before we go to Tyler Perry studios and put you into a production there we want to make sure that you know what you're doing and more specifically Europe value to productions\nSit down and talked to anyone who is a key grip or a cinematographer or a screenwriter or producer and ask him or her how he or she got their start has her start and you will hear stories about how as I'm saying they got a foot in the door they got into a set and they work their way through this process\nI can attest to everything and she said because I had been through the G s a one program\nAnd you're absolutely right it's most definitely a foot in the door in the right direction I think with a booming industry in Georgia a lot of people are being hoodwinked the a lot of people are saying oh you can work with us on this and ... and we'll get in the industry and that's not necessarily the case\nAnd I think that our listeners should definitely visit your website and learn more about which schools they can actually enrolled through and like I said if you are not interested in being a fulltime student that continuing education classes is another alternative one thing that I also like the the college program works\nDid in being a fulltime student the continuing education classes is another alternative one thing that I also like the the college program works with the work development center as well so if you're unemployed if you would transition out of your job and you're looking to re enter into a different career\nThey have the funding and they have the resources available for you\nTo go through one of their development centers you get the financing from them to attend continuing education program or even a college to a different program the G is a is a part of that certification through the college please do not call G s a asking how you can\nGet an application you have to go through one of the educational institutions like you said either the technical or the state colleges correct us right now one thing that I Love about the G. S. A. is the fact that\nYou're instructors are more than overqualified you talked about the experience and I just have\nTo brag a little bit on my instructor his name is Chuck car you know and he was phenomenal here and if you are a slow learner a faster learner a medium alert or it doesn't matter as long as you can just apply which you touch seat and feel and pass the test\nAnd you mentioned about how you're not just stuck in the classroom\nTalk a little bit about the tools and resources that you got to provide for people to learn about how to be successful onset because I don't think a lot of people understand when you say sound stage and when you say a production area you all have the same equipment that they have on set\nThank you Amanda so we're we're not playing around this was in theory this isn't an idea we are literally training a workforce there are no other states have ever done anything even remotely like this why is this important because if you want to be a grip\nAnd you're actually working with grip stands and you know which way the medical on a grip sand goes you're going to get hired by the way up to go to work ... literally a on a production so again we're not going to show your pictures of cables were gonna put actual working cables in front of you and finally the Georgia film academy\nOperates directly with industry so what this means is when you come trained with us as you did Amanda at pine wood at lamb's studios were we operate a school and operate a sixteen thousand square foot sound stage\nSomething that no other school number higher education institutions anywhere in the country probably anywhere in the world has you're going to learn in a in a facility that is exactly like the kind of facility\nThat a few weeks later a few months later years later maybe you're going to be working on this is something that everyone in our state should be proud of\nThey really should be I have to say one of my most exciting moments was when we were walking from the G A fake classes over to the production area we walk past where the grip and electrical putting together the set in construction while putting together to set for ant man [laughter]\nAnd we're all just like why died in ... and just glaring would we leave because we were like wow we're on a real marvel movie set was phenomenal\nAnd our students are working now I'm On the bus yes let's talk about some of the classes I Know we talked about set construction scenic painting lighting and electric grid and regain\nAn introduction to special makeup affects these are some new classes and you've got to a post production film and television added editing digital imagery in her story ... and one way to address that on a boy and a sign up for now a introduction to special makeup effects in production accounting\nThose are different is the need changing\nI'm no so um ... what we're doing is growing\nSpecial makeup effects in production at county no different is the need changing\nI'm no so um what what we're doing is growing what we're doing at the George film academy so before I say anything else\nJob one is in job one as far as I can see will always be putting Georgians to work right now Georgia really doesn't have a film and television industry Georgia has a film and television production industry\nBut we at the Georgia film academy who all share a vision believe that we in Georgia can have what\nLos Angeles has what New York has what bully what has what London has which is the bully ecosystem of a business right some talking ... about production but I'm also talking about content creation\nWhich means screen writing in television writing and I'm also talking about the other end of that pipeline which is post production\nI can talk with more specificity about those but once we start to do that once we start to train people as we are now doing as you've noted in these fields\nRepresentation the agencies will come in financing will come and distribution will come and you had mentioned earlier about how\nYou love the expression y'all he would and you you referenced us being Hollywood at the south which is great those those are fun\nBut you know what we're Georgia and um I Believe as do ah the rest of the team members at the Georgia film academy we have great stories to tell here in Georgia we have the means to tell those stories and the Georgia film academy as deeply committed to making sure that we do just that\nI think that it's fantastic that you guys are coming full circle I see now you're in it seems like maybe face to where you're trying to incorporate the full gamut of everything to do with production post production and maybe maybe in the future pre production\nIf you'll Amish or something personal whether you which I think I'm sort of goes to a what our entire gee if a team feels\n... on the Georgian I grew up here I went to high school here I Love the states so much Amanda I worked in the entertainment industry most of my adult life I have a professorship kind of saw State University but I spent twenty twenty five years working and living in Hollywood mainly writing and producing a television shows\nAnd over the last ten years or so I've been in the story rooms and I've watched this industry grow here in Georgia I can tell you that what your film academies a leadership team feel strongly about is putting Georgians to work but in addition creating an industry here in our state where George and never again\nNever again has to leave to do what I was doing which is content creation or never again has to leave to do any\nKind of field in this business\nOr a bust production industry like we have and are going to continue to grow as well as the whole ecosystem of a business\nI Am so excited for the for the moon is it's really about to take off even bigger isn't and we thought it was really big right now but it's not to get bigger isn't it\nWe believe that the entertainment industry in Georgia can be a legacy for all Georgians peaches peanuts in production\nI Love it teaches peanuts and production but with that said we appreciate your time today in the website is Georgia film academy dot org it was such a pleasure having you here ... thank you Amanda let it take a quick break and we'll be right back with more of Atlanta up close it also\nRemember thinking mom had ice in the back of her head

on offer terms and conditions applied\nEstimates that about one point seven million people have been forcibly displaced just within ... alone um so that's quite a high number what we see there are people without access to health care um people women and children that are often times the most vulnerable who don't have access to basic services\nSo what happened did you get people women who don't have access to prenatal care for example and then has really complicated deliveries um and then can miscarriage\nUm it's really horrible summertime it's what we see\nGive us give us just a daily life as someone on the ground in Nigeria where you just came from because like I said\nOften times when you're not connected to the pain we're not connected to which that struggle when you're not connected to it you're desensitized you don't really get but you get it you've been there you've seen it and I'm sure a lot of the stories that\nCollectively all the people in your organization had helped contribute to the virtual tour tell us a little bit about ... ... how was it like being over the you're seeing these poor people being forced from their homes\nYeah it's a really difficult experience um because we're all human beings\nUm and we all deserve access to basic healthcare so it's really hard to see populations that have been forced from their home and haven't had access to consistent health care and how that affects all aspects of their lives and you know a lot of times we see a lot of mental health trauma as well\nUm one part of the exhibition that we have is a virtual reality that you spoke of so it's actual actual patients that we've had an art projects that are giving their own stories and telling about their journeys that they've experienced along the way so you can hear firsthand from refugees and asylum seekers about the journey that they face\nUm but yeah oftentimes these journeys are very treacherous\nSo what's the difference between a refugee and an asylum seeker because I think a lot of times in the United states we just hear refugees cry a rape murder hey we're all the negative things associated with people who have been forced from their homes\nAnd I have a hard time with that because I'm thinking at one point these people's homes they had lived that could have been me you know what I was forced from my home and I didn't have any\nType of food any type of healthcare just nothing literally just opposing not bad so tell us a little bit about the difference\nYeah sure well first I Want to speak to your point yeah these these people that are leaving their homes they're not doing so because they want to you know their normal life has been disrupted an up ended and these journeys that they're facing are not easy\nUm it's not something that somebody would want to do you know imagine leaving your home leaving your family here in Atlanta and not having you know in the going to the grocery store and not having food to by not being able to buy food\nUm ... that's not a journey that you would want to make a oftentimes along the route you know people are facing violence especially women and children are are more vulnerable to sexual violence\nUm and we see that and many of our projects that we work in\nUm so it's it's very very difficult situation being faced I'm so you you asked about the difference between a refugee in an asylum seeker\nUm so the difference between a refugee an asylum seeker is an important difference so somebody who is seeking asylum is fleeing war persecution and violence and their home country and is applying to the un agency are um which is the un high commissioner for refugees\nTo be resettled in another country um so once somebody has been granted their application for asylum has been granted that's when they will receive the refugee status\nOK so a refugee actually goes through the legal\nAnd their application for asylum has been granted that's when they will receive the refugee status\nOK so a refugee actually goes through the legal process of trying to get permission to be in a country yes in someone who is an asylum seeker is trying to correct goes through the process correct so complicated\nIt is and it's very few people that actually are resettled compared to the amount of number of people that are actually applied for asylum so what happens\nUm well in some cases they're turned back\nUm and they're just being brought back to the very same context in which they're fleeing\nUm for example and Honduras um you know you have a lot of people that are fleeing the gang violence that's happening there I'm trying to make this treacherous journey to reach safer ... safer countries um fleeing gang violence meeting a lot of treacherous journey as along the way\nWhat when I think about what you just said I think about\nMyself and I and I think a lot of times in the news or when we hear reports of refugees and people seeking asylum coming to other countries other countries not wanting them pushing them away is that the country will journey of putting them in makeshift space is\nJust so that they can be separate from other people it saddens my heart because I don't believe that people understand that when you say forced from home it's not like you get a thirty day notice to vacate no\nThese people's doors are kicked in and they are forced to leave with whatever they have correct\nThat is correct I'm oftentimes they are given to notice that they have to leave their fleeing war situation so you could have\nUm your village that was bombed for example by infighting between rebel groups or um\nInner factional fighting whatever it may be and so you sometimes have to leave with what you have on you so you don't have time to grab your documents you don't have if even if you have documents um one thing that we look at an exhibition is like the concept of stateless people and the different rights that they are afforded versus\nA somebody that does have a nationality or does have citizenship\nUm so yeah it often times these people are fleeing within thirty seconds and can just take whatever they have with them stateless what's that yeah so a stateless person is somebody who doesn't have citizenship um and a lot of countries across the globe um women for example and they give birth citizenship isn't automatically granted to their child\nSo um that child is stateless and doesn't necessarily afforded the protections of somebody who does have citizenship\nSo when we talk about the exhibit um about a force from home you said there are different components of it is is that the Georgia world Congress center it's approximately ten thousand square feet yes walk us through what's going on and all of that [laughter]\nThere is a free open to the public outdoor exhibition and were set up outside in West plaza park\nUm when people arrived there actually given an identity card with a new identity that carries them through the entire exhibition experience and so they can either be an IT pie which isn't internally displaced person there can be an asylum seeker or refugees that that identity card stays with you and plays a role throughout your experience through the exhibition\nUm then you meet your guide 'em and you look at the different push factors um that have forced you to flee um then you're asked to choose very quickly um various different items that you would take if you were a force from home yeah\nI'm Still trying to really put people in that mindset in that situation of like okay wow I really only have thirty seconds what am I going to choose my going to choose my family heirlooms am I going to choose my life saving medications that I Need 'em really putting people in that experience um and then you look at various different context that I mentioned um\nAnd it's going to choose my life saving medications that I Need 'em really putting people and that experience on and then you look at various different context that I mentioned I'm brandy Hunter S dot and Syria and Afghanistan um and looking at the different medical complications and vulnerabilities that that refugees and people fleeing the\nEra that sounds absolutely amazing it's like you have a first hand experience of what it's like to be forced from home based off what you describe the exhibit to be well don't take a quick break

A. okay realistic when one a merry go\nSo listen at land as hot you heard your mare bottoms say if you're in Rio three one eight do not sell your property\nAnd I've had calls of older people genuinely saying to me [noise] okay listen I have a house here up in ... in West Atlanta northwest Atlantic Atlanta even east especially eastern Atlanta [noise]\nAnd I don't want to lose it what do I need to do because\nThe city code enforcement\nOddly enough what do you like it or not this is just true is going around in fighting how's it\nFor code violation\n\nHowever\nThe houses that are really run down that are really boarded up that are dangerous\nThey're not fighting those properties because they're typically owned by those investors who came in and bought everything I remember I told you about those\nSo now most of the properties that are for sale in and around it Lana the parameter in the perimeter are primarily investor owned that's true\n[noise] now\nThere's so many disadvantages to that and there's some advantages to that\nIf you're going to buy in Atlanta and you buy from an investor a couple of things might work to your benefit won it might be under price and I say that because a lot of these investors\nHere\nOne it might be under price and I say that because a lot of these investors\nAre not here there in New York the house of my kids but the chefs that investor was in New York we got that house at a hundred thousand dollars\nFive bedrooms for bats in northwest Atlanta three ... three one eight they're going to make a ton of money on that\n\nThe house was under price so real estate agents\nHere\nAre under pricing some of these investor owned property to move them because the truth is you know they got 'em from forty thousand dollar fifty thousand votes they're going to make fifty thousand dollars and move on\nBut they could be making a hunt it could be making a hundred thousand dollars and don't know it might be to your benefit to look at some of these investor owned property and of course I always say the newer construction because they don't have a problem now\nWhat does this have to do with title I'll tell you a lot of the attorneys\nIn and around the metro Atlanta area will not do\nThese closings for these investors and why why is that because when I get in my little database that realtors have access to not open to the general public we can see the history [noise] you\nCould probably see the history on Zillow but a lot of that is just inaccurate anyway we have a more accurate view of the history of the property\nSo I can see that it was sold by ABC Elsie\nXYZ L L C and then XYZ Elsie sold it back a B C L L see I'm not kidding that's true and then ABC's though the ABC sister Elsie and they kept rolling over and over are making money\n\nUsing this house as a cash cow and then you come along now because the last investor has it and you want to buy it and it's got all of these title issues I saw one yesterday\nThe house was conveyed twice in August of by the same seller how do you sell the house two times to do different people in the same month the same house\nThat at tidal problem because\nSomething happen there and I could take a ton of time trying to go down that rabbit hole and figure it out who did what that was wrong go contact them thrown under the bus I could do all of that\nBut the truth is I don't have time I'd rather be helping the lady I help yesterday actually benefit from my help\nRather than running around trying to figure out who\nDid something wrong but this creates a title problem and so attorneys will not touch it because\nAttorneys insure your title on a future purchase when you buy property you will hopefully get title insurance is a one time the you needed desperately\n[noise] now if there's a title problem a title glitch something was conveyed in accurately somebody was missed in it's called the chain of title the chain is\nConveyed ... on and on and on and usually they go back to ... Thirty years\nMissed in it's called the chain of title the chain is can they can make a make they on and on and on and usually they go back twenty Thirty years\nA lot of times here in Atlanta because you got property\nAnd then began doing what your neighbor told you to do and quick claim it here and there and everywhere tea or uncle and your cousin in your brother and sister and all of that you thought you uh fixing a problem you are creating a bigger one has now when you really get ready to sell it you can't do it\nBecause you can dated to your cousin or you can read it to your brother but guess what the sister and mother and other cousin they were entitled to a portion of that property as well but because you think you're the executive director\nOr the court appointed ministry that you can just convey to whoever you want to convey to for whatever reason you can't it creates problems were you down the line and anybody coming after you I Know you don't care about anybody coming after you but if we want to convey\n\nHe never did the probate on the title on the property to have it conveyed back in to\nHimself and his deceased wife is still on title he thought like most of you think that if my spouse passes I automatically get it you don't\nYou do not automatically get that person's portion of the property it does not just passed to you automatically upon someone's death\nThat doesn't happen unless us specifically set it up that way what do we do\nWe ended up rescheduling the closing doing an amendment pushing it out thirty days giving him time\nTo have that property conveyed into himself so he can go ahead and sell it to my buyer we did what's called a temporary occupancy agreement because the trucks were packed\nAnd for a fee\nAnd a temporary occupancy agreement meaning for thirty days while this seller gets is\nTitled together my buyers were able to move into the house until\nWe could actually go through with the purchase and that's what happened we did that's how we solve that problem but that was a title problem [noise] good and clear title could not be conveyed to my buyer because there were unresolved issues with the probate with his ownership of the property\nOkay now the real real nightmare [noise]\nHad two sisters and a cousin come to me and I know the cousins probably listening because he's the one to listen and he brought his aunts to me with\nTheir property because he was an air of the property he\nHad an interest in receiving this property and he knew it which was hugely smart\nNow the aughts the two remaining on older\nI guess maybe my age or a little older who had received the property by means\nOf um their parents passing away\nHad appointed one of the sisters as administrator she went to the court did the paperwork she became the administrator great\nGood job you got that far now you need to administer the estate according\nTo the law according to the law not however you feel like doing it\n\nThere are real laws of distribution in every state sometimes they vary that you need to follow and as administrator of that state you're responsible for carrying that out\nNow [noise] there were fourteen properties\nCan you imagine owning fourteen properties in and around\nThere were fourteen property\nCan you imagine owning fourteen properties in and around the metro Atlanta area inside the perimeter in Atlanta great properties great properties fourteen of that\nSo\nShe decide because she talked to somebody and they told her you can do this and make it real easy she decides then\n\nDo indeed and administrators deed and sell\nThe fourteen properties to her son for five thousand dollar\n\nAnd how would you like that Lacey if you are cousin you're supposed to get part of this property\nAnd yet you're gave it to her son for five thousand dollars fourteen property and your app would you like that okay you wouldn't like it\nAnd neither did this guy this kid's cousin he didn't like it either\nShe went to the court he made a complete because it wasn't\nDone properly he gave all those properties to her son to five thousand dollars by means emitted miniature ... let me come back from the break you were going to never believe what happens\nAfter this young lady went to the court and complain that her aunt was not conveying that prop property properly\n\nAnd what happens to us all the time for\nFor eight
