about today let's start with judge Brett Kavanaugh question by police\n\n\n\n\nKnow\nHappened to walk back for a larger through seven zero three are still refined hall favorite shot where he writes but a lot of the Tom judges interpret the constitution that same a lot of judges may believe that the interpretation\nFrom that time is out data and others say no we should interpret it like the forefathers Mitt for us to a job but it\nWas shot when they wrote it and that's the crux of the argument people who won an updated meaning is what we all do right like to call I did this judges or that they want to put an emotional interpretation of something that is clear\nDo right does it in certain instances but district is interpreter of the constitution as Clarence Thomas and that's why people don't understand him he's going to read the constitution that apply district is interpretation of the constitution to Casey receive\nUm is and that's why people don't understand him he's going to read the constitution and apply the strict as interpretation of the constitution to indicate that he received whether you like it or not and it may be in\nThe outside of anyone at any given time or miss the hall understand your point and\nThere is a fundamental difference between those who believe the constitution is a living breathing document and for those who believe that it is a static document\nI Believe it is a living and breathing document and actually everybody else does too they ... they just don't want to tell you that let me tell you why everybody believes it is actually an evolving document because we have something called amendments to the constitution\nWhat is an amendment to the constitution oh it's a fancy word for correction that's what it is and we have all universally agreed that these men image to the constitution\nAll right and proper and needed to conceptualize our country they have come with the times\nWhich means the original document known as the U.S constitution was written and it was flawed\nIt was an adequate it was inappropriate it was not perfect it needed to evolve\nSo while we can argue went pontificate about the purest constitutional to jeopardize your later the gentleman the fact that the constitution should be messed with has already left the sea\nThat ship has failed late as the gentleman we make amendments we mess with the constitution for zero for you not to do seven zero three let's go to Shirley\nShirley on the line Shirley ... ... ... what else\nIs on I'm just calling to say I am so proud and thanks for the year you

bit later think anybody ever trail headaches rate and yellow passed through Congress there are I think so but you know if it doesn't we have lots of other alternatives but I Do think so I think if

sleek shape he makes this slick\nShade remark and then he realizes he's done it in front of people and he kind of backed away from it he said yeah you never do\nSome very proud of what's happened with the steel industry okay question yeah go ahead sure\n\nShe shocked at a picture that are going to say the show I'm not thinking that I said okay I Know you're not thinking you never do no go

belittling now he treats women this way he treats the disabled\nIn this manner he mocks them and he also treats foreigners that way let me take you back let me take you back maybe about two weeks ago Trump those old even though the press conference\nThis was as a matter of fact not even two weeks ago maybe a week ago he was holding a press conference and he was just renting and calling on people and doing the Trump thing right which is really quite entertaining and that there were there was a guy a Kurdish guy who's a reporter\n\nAnd Trump started talking about how the Kurds are great fighters they're great people the Kurds and when he went to the foreign guy he said hey you you Mr Kurd\n\nRoughly what he called the man Mr heard that this was during his solo news conference in New York\nWritten by nice report another book that you've got to see this guy I don't know what I\nMean I don't remember maybe that's what I said\n\nThat before he is talking about is served couple asking who now works the New York times I think it's the right there he suffers from a chronic condition than in Paris movement of arms\nBut he's a very smart guy but Trump decided to mark his disability by making the movements bend emotions and what happened to the Christian right oh they didn't take on Trump he was wrong they defended Trump\nAnd they allow the lie of Trump to be promoted Trump's though I Know I did a disability oh I didn't know he was very ...\nLadies and gentlemen Trump picks on women\nLadies and gentlemen\nFrom picks on women ... a boat and foreigners\nBecause he had the mentality of a bully\nHe's a small man on the inside and other places according to Stormy Daniels\nBoards he wrote for eight nine to two separate zero protected and reel to reel is mental radio [noise]\n\n\nHey God I see you again as it is and I'm like oh probably about twice a year you rather than in Atlanta [noise]\nI was I was a man of so much habits wherever you are or make them feel so\nA majority of Republicans listed Reagan as the top president with fifty seven percent saying he's the best of their lifetime and by the way\nReagan was not really a Republican I Know he ran as a Republican and he was not really a Republican remember Reagan was the first and only president to actually give amnesty\nTo what conservatives were called illegals secret to them that amnesty they them immunity so we can say he's a Republican but his ideology was contrary to many of the Republican values of the time\nTrump comes in second among Republicans once again another guy who's really not a Republican so the number one and number two according to Republicans as best presidents aren't even really Republican\n\nFor zero forty nine to two seven zero three do you believe president Morocco Obama was the ... was the best president of your lifetime does far or do you think of somebody else\nAnd we're talking about in your lifetime so when we're not saying Abraham Lincoln George Washington we're talking

human rights philosophy to the middle east and they laugh at you\nNot their way now some of our culture has been permeating in their culture for many years and they see that as an attack on their face what we see in a secular society as free thought free living they see as a religion\nThey see it as a religion that attack their religion\nI wrote about this extensively in my dissertation\nAnd you can find it you can Google on the global effect of western religion and politics policy and government you can Google that I wrote about it researched it and it's really interesting how we see this as non religious\nOur secular movement but they see it as a religious movement\nAnd these ideas that we assume our basic and fundamental to the human experience such as equal rights that is far in\nThat is far into most of the world it's not far into the industrialized world all the emerging democratic world but it is for rent\nIt's not far into the industrialized world or the emerging democratic world but it is foreign to many four zero for eight nine to two seven zero three this is going to be time argument to Mario good they walk them\nHey how you doing this morning good sorry you can't complain I just\nWant to start off with saying that uh I completely support the rush possibly act and if you get a chance I Want you to look up a case out of New Jersey\nWish I had this woman's name right now but if it ... me but um [noise] this happened several years ago back when Chris Christie was governor of New Jersey there was a ... a woman who ah she lived in Philly\nAnd uh you know fairly is right or the south Jersey border her husband was across the border I Believe in Camden or somewhere in his car broken down and it was late at night\nShe leaves home to go get her husband like any Good Wife would do and she rose up out of the house with her piece on her she gets pulled over I Believe it was about the uh [noise]\nUh New Jersey state police so I'm not mistaken and uh they find\nThe got it a car she's register gun owner out of Pennsylvania the ... she's legit the whole nine yards you know what they did to this woman a hardworking innocent family woman they arrested her and this woman was given I Believe two or three years in prison it was such a huge outcry behind it\nThat Governor Christie ended up having a part in this woman to let her out of jail ... her life was destroyed while he was just going to pick her husband up from a break down and she ended up going to prison for two or three years so you know you're not\n... how much time did she served before I ...\nI don't know and I'm Sorry I don't have all the details in front of me right now because I wasn't expecting to bring\nThat up short yeah then definitely a miscarriage of justice and that's why I have a lot I have not\nRendered and opinion one way or the other I just made the statement as to report saying well\nListen I understand that certain states are more restrictive gun laws than others I totally get that but there's no reason why you should uh be a licensed legal gun owner and once they you drive right over the border and you go to prison for three years that's ridiculous yeah I agree now\nAnd and so there needs to be some human uniformity to how the gun laws are a administer across the nation\nThe whole purpose for the federal government is to make things uniform this like you can't go to an airport in Atlanta and go through the essay and take your shoes off and then you go to an airport in in Florida and\nYou just walk right through the checkpoint without getting scanned it All right or the work that way and so we\nHave it and by the way mark ... it used to work that way I Do the federal government got involved\nAnd you know what happened we had nine eleven and that's why there's as their standards across the country that cross state lines to prevent certain things like this woman going to prison who never should have been in jail because she had a gun in our car it's it is out of control the last thing because I Do this kind of an odd thing um\nI I think as a parent at this point that the a GOP is doing everything it can they're pulling out all the stops to get this got on the bench they know that if this thing doesn't work the likelihood of them getting another nominee through is slim to none\nTo the other search and every ... every once in a while and I I get a break I have a small business I've been doing it for about Thirteen Years and so I get I get a chance to talk to a lot of great people rather than\nSaying I Want to try to do to say hey we're at the highest paid over ... says he was on hold and it's not work out a lot of other stuff here that it's entertaining it's not as as you know you tell that people say what needs to be said you got people from other side of the party's listen to sell\nThe one colony and every day that's because they live with drought and now they've got plenty of friends is listening and it's not tolerate it will do what I wanted to talk about\nYour brother appreciate the compliment go ahead\nSir Yes sir what I wanted to let you know ... is that I'm I'm just I I see a lotta a lotta development occurring over here in my area and it it does is becoming so so severe it if they want the poor people\nOut what area what area are you in I'm In East Point okay and\nSee it when I come out when I leave out at my house in a behind the market area I'm seeing a white people jogging ups in Asia people jogging\nAnd this this area was worth worth predominantly black top top chef Chris Locklear my entire life so I I see with one of the hedge trees on camp creek and now I I saw with when a major actually gave people\nSince the storm windows put on their windows by the airport I've been here for the low ...\nAnd now I I saw with when a major taxi gave people since the storm windows put on their windows by the airport I've been here for the low calm man and so now I'm seeing how they they're also where\nOh a a public don't count creek parkway they are not taking away they they're written and people out of the apartments across the street from a from a pop led to that um that I work in because it's an old set of apartments it says on the floor of College Park in ... and ... each point\nAnd they say the airport purchases that people are already been evicted that that's one of the highest crime you underwrite instead of sets on apartments within the city\nSo right now I'm seeing all these apartments within each point cause mark hey feel Union City and uh that that are that are\nOwe it to them and run down and it got out of drugs coming out of I'm trying to get out of people's cars I'm high on drugs you know there's a lot of them I said look man if you want to sell drugs I've done that before but the thing is over this area it's a billion dollar project up the street\nThis thing it's not that it's this this developer he will not the gas fields and the crowd to dress in the area so if you take it off the camp reply led a police officer or caused part of that just let it snow is because they felt that it happened at over there and they got it set the tone\nI'm coming down the road and they got out and says I Will fight like yeah\nI didn't realize this is all done in coordination they understand the move and sometimes he was was really interesting sometimes they don't even communicate with each other they understand the move based on the on the mood and so they know how to move as well\nSo yeah you may see increased police presence you may see private grocery chains stopped accepting\nWake you may see a lot of things started to happen and they're all in the same book not necessarily on the same page but in the same book and you could do that when the title story was written for you so you don't have to be on the same page you just got to be in the same book\nAnd that's why we have to be born since you know about being the same page because the book was written for us\nYes it's an old man I'm I it just gets me upset\nWhen I say politicians do out there and we're great people like to sit in Atlanta they are like stadium they ... they passed with it that crowded going around here and there once they're out of houses they throw them away because you're not allowed for useful and like you know the body else to put the resolve and while the pale\nChange that's what's gonna happen and so what are the other thing is a policy that get an office that does that the uh people to support their campaign\nSomebody had their own money to bring their own agendas it to the table as long as you've got to defend a supporter of giving you money okay thank you won't be there are a puppy\nAnd that will end up being it ... it depends I've seen people do it at the local level without having major money back in them but remember\nMoney only does one thing it helps you distribute your message your messages free distribution of the message costs money that's mailers robo calls door knock hers flyers\nBillboards commercials all of that costs money but what does it actually do it at polls your message so if you could figure out a way to get your message out without having to take money from special interest groups\nOr private developers then that is a win and you don't have to run into office owing people your soul I appreciate your

the great physicians about day brothers don't a lot of great things you know a serves on the board of his alma mater at Pitt\nAnd a great father travel all over you know when you get these kids who is this gives him very elite soccer squash so they'd be running all over the country and they'd be playing soccer in Philadelphia\nYou know you got to take your kid way up there and so is it good luck

money we have ten friends with the housing justice linked him was that you have some kind of event coming up on Thursday\n[noise] that's right that's right ah we're we're going to be having a a red light the gold ... town hall meeting at first I Coney church this Thursday at seven o'clock\nAnd tell us about a year now y'all let a red light the Gulch I you know I thought you so you're not with the ... like the goats coalition\nWe're we are now with the green light I go out now with the coalition to give away a few\nBillion dollars taxpayer money is a bunch of rich corporate landlords LA\nUm talk about why this somehow this issue have struck a chord would Atlanta like none that I have seen that you know and\nIs it just the sheer amount of money what do you I mean I Know you've been a activists for some time in a community organizer watch it and they this is brought together a coalition\nOf young old black white latest from bucket and Tim Franklin the end of the ...\nIn a community organizer woods ... this is brought together a coalition of young old black white latest from bucket and damn friends and then it afforded a bunch of people have come together around stopping these this effort why\nWell I think there's two reasons one is that we have just had it's just been a cascade of bad developments deals that really Atlanta loses out on it we just given given away pieces of the city large chunk of money so that rich folks I mean mega rich folks can\nGet richer I mean you look at the falcon stadium deal to one of the richest guys in Atlanta walks into the mayor's office and says hey how about I can I have half a billion dollars to build a stadium known as four\nAnd a two weeks later to press conference to announce we're doing this and so it's that but in addition to that this really is the worst deal in my lifetime and we're talking about could you imagine\nIf a you know somebody wanted you to\nTo give them money or if if if the richest guy you do write hey let's fight that's by a car to gather you put up half the money I'll put up half the money and I'll keep the car I mean ethics essentially what we're doing we're investing\nOver two billion dollars into a five billion dollar development of which we all or nothing\nAnd the only we've added up all the community benefits that come out of this over to point three billion dollar investment and it amounts to help out just slightly over a million bucks\nTwo hundred affordable housing units at eight percent a and by\nThat you know we should be having Eighteen thousand affordable housing units at zero to fifty percent am I for two point three billion dollars so really it's just\nThe biggest transfer of wealth\nFrom our city to people that are already\nSuper rich and the return is so low that this is just there's no fixing the steel there's no making it better we just need to walk away from the ... we got to get ... mind off the gold somehow\nAh what do you say to people the mayor has said look here we're creating thirty five thousand jobs we're getting twenty million dollar willful fought about housing as we are uh are having a ten percent partnership with some unknown a business\nI'm interested in the city um we have a thirty percent minority uh uh uh you know minority participation rate is is is an unprecedented deal in that you all just don't know what you are talking about\n[noise] no I mean it sounds really good but the reality here uh Derek is that we are essentially giving that to point three billion dollars were investing in right or is nine years of development money these John this construction and development it is\nComing to Atlanta regardless why would we create a tax\nShelters tax free zone where these folks that we are losing out on development all around the city so we can have this tax free development and it just it is a great it is not going to create one job well\nYesterday at the city council meeting councilmember Andrew boom\nCouncilmember German Shepherd council member a Marcy over streets council member of the winds low a council member who did I miss a level of the loan or Carlos myth\nAll said look we won't know study we don't need to know what the impact going to be we need to just move forward what do you say to those councilmember\nWe are we we we know that there are these you know boy you know I I I don't necessarily want to go negative here but uh you know we we know how politics works in the ...\nBut we we we know that there are these you know a boy you know I I I don't necessarily want to go negative here but uh you know we we know how politics works in the city there are things that are promised folks that they just will go along with with the mayor\nOr the last mayor really use the bully pulpit that T shirt walking right into\nAnd so a lot of time city council members feel like you know their administrative staff for the mayor and uh you know I think we're at a time with that dynamic needs to change I'm grateful I'm so grateful that we have you know folks like math Westmoreland and Andre ... and a mere broken that are that are ending up to this\nBig gold monster and say no we're not going to give away any more on the city unless we have real return\nI tell tell everybody ten friends and again with the housing justice a league could tell everybody with a meeting is going to be on Thursday\nIt's got to be this Thursday seven o'clock at first I Tony and Baptist church from Orleans avenue right outside of Atlanta village\nWill not saying because the mayor said in her press conference Norfolk Southern is saying they want to relocate to headquarters here but what mysteriously that was missing out of that conversation that see I Am bought the Norfolk Southern building that big fight building that's its own springs\nHaven't bought it so this is why I understand\nThey have bought it and they actually working at it that natural understanding that they're OK\nOkay and I and I may be wrong but I Do know when I talk with north for senator and they have an option on their property\nSo they're not currently can you ask them for me because information I've been able to glean is that the actual owned the building and there may be more or at least ... I'm Talking about the big building okay I don't know are going to say that that's and that they are developing it and they and then now\nDuring preliminary work to convert those the loss\nOkay and that may be true and so ah but they had also the property you know they have the air rights that they're getting older now where the tracks\nAre but if they already own the largest piece of real estate of Norfolk Southern was so interested in relocating their history here why would they feel they're building to see I Am ... I can only\nTell you what I Know and I and I and I'm not I have to clarify whether it's that building or not but I understand the the I Am has an option on the property I Gotcha and Norfolk\nInterest in this deal is it moving forward so that they purchased the property because they like that money from the purchase of that property to help them in their relocating to Atlanta\nTo ... in mid town they're not building in midtown renting since may ... I I don't want to I'm not sure if they're renting here's the thing they make it sound like oh we're about to lose this deal will all you'd losing is a deal to rent some space\nOr they are losing is the money that they would get from selling\n... here's the theory that goes to the bottom of what I'm saying what I'm told they already own see I Am ... owns the building and that they are actually doing work on okay I don't know I don't know that is true or not because if you're just talking about leasing some space as ms use this as a ... ... didn't reason\nFor the we need to move that Norfolk Southern may move somewhere else\nHow ... how do you let me ask you know the ... on this and they were going to move on the ...\nHave they just told you all this is for Amazon and they still monitor your in in that\nI have not heard that it's definitely for Amazon and they've always said that they want to build it whether Amazon comes here and not\nOkay and you believe that\nIt's not a matter of belief I just telling you what I'm told okay for for a night to to seven zero three\nIs all about the gold one point five billion dollars in tax incentives and inter governmental remember what I Want to get back is just so you can unravel inter governmental ... because what the city is pledging is its portion\nOf the increase of the taxable real estate\nOver a period of is it thirty is attorney\nOr say oh they're already in the west side tank and in addition to that any sales tax revenue this generating the enterprise on which is within the task to state allowed to happen for says that will\nGo to the development once they get to retail on on\nThat is where the billion comes in is from the injections for the sales tax\nOver Thirty years well it\nYou know it won't be Thirty years 'cause they gotta building they've gotta get retail in there and they've got to start generating himself right\nWell I you know it won't be Thirty years because they got a building they gotta get retail in there and that kind of generating sales\nRight but I'm saying what is the time period for that to follow\nIt how did that but not only in and I don't know now that one of my head to double check on the in a python but I Do know the ... the ... district as a thirty year\nWhen we come back because what I tried to do is when you hear is kind of really informed my public because when you say tax allocation disregard understand it but they don't\nOkay go as best you can come back I Want to explain what a tax allocation district is and what it does and how does it benefit the city I ...

the atmosphere like they are even\nYou know it was really a lot of funding the it was very different than than hazel team where the where there was a ... I I don't know how to there was a hostility and and the galleries for whatever reason that week but there I didn't I didn't recognize the hostility in the galleries and France it was more of just like a rock AS Party atmosphere almost like a a\nMusic festival they came in costumes and chanted and and it was just it was incredible so he can imagine when the European team won the party was kicked up a few degrees and it was it was really something else\nCool now let's dive into the this guy he said he said type of thing that's been happening so for people who don't know Patrick read up on Sunday night speech to the New York times he identifies himself and he talks about how he's blindsided by the fact that he was it with Jordan speed\nAt of course those two guys had a good an international record he was with tiger they didn't play so well when he ... he doubled down he goes on and he talks about how would the buddy system and it was really kind of exclusive how the decisions were made and then you've got an anonymous teammate who respond and essentially points the finger at ... at\nThe only guy who wasn't on board and that Reagan bay to play with Tiger Woods ... what do you make of all of this back and forth\nI actually ... you may find my answer to be surprising but I think the character of the United states team which everyone was looking at here\nIn the wake of the Ryder Cup loss of twenty Eighteen and saying what made this gene ... ... your particular compared to other teams that perhaps at one or at least got had a closer Ryder Cup even if they had a loss in my contention is is that\nThis thing was the exact same as all the others whether in victory or defeat the seeing the same as all the others what happens is that you know we failure is an orphan and when you lose you you're going to have these stories all of a sudden emerged about strife in the locker room potential fights in the locker room\nPairing that didn't work the the the the final word on\nJordan's fees and Patrick greed is the fact that Jordan partnered with with Justin and there were three in one right that ends the argument that that Perry worked great it was a good decision by the captain whether it was a buddy system decision a team is a buddy system that they're they're all in power to be a part of\nMaking decisions that the bottom line is is that for whatever reason Patrick greed didn't play well\nAnd into surmise that he would have played better just because he was besides Jordan's beings\nI think this is unfair to everybody he just didn't play well we had it about a week and it happens it's not that big a deal frankly just quite well\nThat weekend and it had it had to me has nothing to do with some back room decision that was made it was a decision that the captain made to put these two guys together that had been talking about being Ryder Cup partners since they were little kids and they play well so I just I don't even see there's a big deal\nMatt

has found a fresh tomato his treatment of female reporters author tense exchange of the White House press conference with bombs and look you can tell us all\nThat comes off the back of comments Donald Trump NATO yesterday at a press conference at the White House pets have been to a female reporter said let's just listen to a quick tip of that name and\nLeave a defense so I'm very proud of what's happened with the steel industry okay question yeah go ahead sure\n\nShe shocked that I picked her in the state of shock I'm not thinking and that's okay I Know you're not thinking you never do that no go ahead go ahead\nAnd actually this weekend Mr President you said that is incorrect to say you're limiting the skill of the FBI investigation\nWhat does that have to do is read I don't mind answering the question but you know what I'd like to do the ... with the other headline in the news which is the kind of it and I know but how about talking about trade and then we'll get to that will do that a little bit later think anybody ever trade on average rate Neal will pass through Congress or a I think so but you know if it doesn't we have lots of other alternatives but I Do think so I think if they're fair\nWhich is a big question but if it's fair on both sides are Republicans ...\nWell yeah but we live in I Want to hear that again\nIt's amusing to me because he makes is silly it's called sleek shape he makes these slicks shade remark and then he realizes he's done it in front of people and he kind of backed away from it he said yeah you never do\nSome very proud of what's happened with the steel industry okay question yeah go ahead sure\n\nShe's shocked at a picture of the state of shock [noise] I'm not making\nA question yeah go ahead sure she's shocked at a picture of the state of shock I'm not thinking that that's okay I Know you're not thinking you never do no go ahead\nImagine not we talked to his wife and I wonder is Senator Lindsey Graham clutching just Pearl somewhere say well I Know there is Senator Lindsey Graham\nClutching his pearls in the Senate chambers\nNot doubt it but ladies and gentlemen ask yourself this question does he talks\nTo all female reporter like fat imagine how the man talks to his wife in private\n\nHe's belittling now he treats women this way he treats the disabled\nIn this manner he mocks them and he also treats foreigners that way let me take you back let me take you back maybe about two weeks ago Trump was holding another press conference\nThis was as a matter of fact not even two weeks ago maybe a week ago he was holding a press conference and he was just renting and calling on people and doing the Trump thing right which is really quite entertaining and that there were there was a guy a Kurdish guy who's a reporter\nShows\n\nWhat's that mean for zero for eight nine to two seven zero three I've talked about Trump because I Want to highlight\nA new Pew Research center poll that says Americans rank former president rock Obama higher than any other president when asked about who has done the best job in their lifetimes\nPresident Obama was named best or second best president by forty four percent of Americans in a survey that recently came out thirty one percent rank them as the best president in their lifetimes period\nPresident Donald Trump comes in fourth after President Bill Clinton and president Ronald Reagan which Ninety percent of Americans rank and him as the best the second best in their lifetime while Ninety percent might seem low twenty percent of America's ranked\nPresident Obama as the best for second best president uh two thousand and eleven\nAt a similar point in his first term and the last time you conducted the poll found that rankings change by generations more than sixty percent of millennials view President Obama as the best or second best president\nOf their lifetime at forty six percent name him as the absolute best older Americans baby boomers and the silent generation shows Reagan\nAs the top president during their lifetimes forty two percent of fifty four to seven to two year rose at thirty eight percent of Seventy through the night of euros rank Reagan as the best do second best once again showing the generational connection\nPartisanship also affected this survey\nAmong Democrats or democratic leaning independents Seventy one percent ranked President Obama as the best or second best president while Clinton comes in second at around fifty percent raking him as best as second best\nA majority of Republicans listed Reagan as the top president with fifty seven percent saying he's the best of their lifetime about the white Reagan was not\nReally a Republican I Know he ran as a Republican he was not really a Republican remember Reagan was the first and only president to actually give amnesty\nTo what conservatives will call illegals secret to them that amnesty they them immunity\nSo we can say he's a Republican but his ideology was contrary to many of the Republican values of the time\nTrump comes in second\nAmong Republicans once again another guy who's really not a Republican so the number one number two according to Republicans as best presidents\nAren't even really Republicans\n\nFor zero forty nine to two seven zero three do you believe president Morocco\nAnd really Republicans\nFor zero forty nine due to seven zero three do you believe president Barack Obama was the ... was the best president\nOf your lifetime those four oh do you think of somebody else\nAnd we're talking about in your lifetime so when we're not saying Abraham Lincoln George Washington we're talking about presidents in your lifetime and for some that will be quite different\nI Can't talk to you about Nixon I was born in Nineteen eighty one for zero for eight nine to two seven zero three let's go to to Korea in Maryland to cover your birthday well\nGood morning Michele how you doing I'm great how are you\nOK to answer your question I Would say that that would have to stay in my lifetime Obama was the desk precedent and um basically ah the reason why are the basic element between him and this that we have now\nIf anything I can say it it it had to do with that had a lot to do with that soundbite\nYou just played [laughter] ate the man that\nWas just hate for when I first heard that soundbite this morning I was almost brought to tears that that was just hateful\nOr you know he meant it yeah you know that's how he feels about this well educated woman who's asking him questions he thinks she's dumb\nHe insulted are there any ignored her not mean that that's just that's just me and I I Would have never seen that from President Obama or or better yet any of the other\nCritical or you can ask you a question sure why\nIs it we expect more out of our children than we expect out of President Obama I mean President Trump\nI have no idea and I'm I'm just grateful I don't have to raise any children I wouldn't know how to explain it to a child\nWould you say ... it's almost as if when Trump is doing a press conference if you have children in a room you need to change the channel\nThat's how that's how bad it has gotten what President Obama you wanted your children to be glued to the TV screen to hear this man regardless of what the press conference was about because you knew it was going to be full of respect and decency an honor you knew that\nAnd and that's what I was just telling my mother last week I said mama fit the uh when you saw last Thursday the death of of human decency it it's just out the door now\nAnd what happened last Thursday\nIt with far as the the uh Kavanaugh hearing\nOh right okay yes yes I'm Sorry\nI did the president came out of defended him Kevin himself apologized for getting off the rails right he apologized when he came back to you know what I'm Sorry that was wrong cool here comes the president say no it was\nTough they doubled down on it\nWell see I'm not sure at a at what point you were talking about if you're if you're talking about when he apologized to a senator club which\nAre yeah I heard that yeah that's the part I'm Talking about the values that yeah\nThat that part I wasn't impressed with because then he goes and does the same thing again to the other senators I mean they they this is a basic elements huge ... of of\nOf humanity yeah and and where where did the leadership command if you don't\nHave that yeah August ...\n... ... of humanity yeah and and where where do the leadership and then if you don't and

situation I I Would have lived all kind of jail though that's I Would have reacted I Would have through water by Haslam beer I Would have drawn to the front of all of them [laughter]\nBut I'm also not trying to be a U.S Supreme Court just\nAsking me about what idea what I was Seventeen I was in jail that's wild war\n\nBut God is good see that's what I Would have had to tell the Senate confirmation

what you eat it come right [laughter]\nSo I'm more concerned about your loans right you'll ... you'll kidney but ... but back to this here so\n[laughter] I Know that I have I was put that to protect our brains I'm All right come a little way long time ago to show went back to the Bible angle take it back that far 'cause I I really don't I'm not a religious type of person to type of person right so way back\nRight screw through okay because I feel energy out at times I give you an ... so way back here is that they\nAre I have with street\nBlack people were the first one was on earth\nBut the closest that the sun got to the earth a hair needed to call to protect our brains come on ... do you understand what I'm saying so when when when I when my hair straight I wear my history because I can wear my history and I do not in out in the sun and I don't need to call it all the time so for me is choices\nThey want to look like me I don't want to look like\nNow that's not the public health gr that's that's probably I answer for being in fact the flu clay\nIs built out of the planet [laughter] you know what you know [laughter]\nAnd he would say it but you got to understand that we have transition in our society today today that's you know we we went through a period of course coming off of the slave shifts and being in the massive house than having our citizens and our brother some guy straight here 'cause they the masses kids but my daddy\nWas called the ... line and then I Want it to be the best you know the best one and so we did go through a period\nOf ... closest to wipe out your life because they wouldn't want and got the privileges mine so it wasn't something that we just wanted to do with something that we kinda had to do you know for survival and we wanted to look like that but if we fast forward to the bank or adapt to assure us all the time it's not clear exactly and so if we fast forward\nTo today I think in this generation we've been there before and the seventies we're old enough when we were our own natural curly curly hair and then we decided to straighten it and then we decided to go back into the Jerry girl and then now fast for you know now we're here again with the millennials\nEmbracing their natural curl because they never experienced anything like that before they wanted their natural curls but now we're also seeing that women are going back to straightening their here again\nIt's our mental abilities to men's tennis arts if it gets who we are it's like a woman who wear makeup and that's why she wants to put on weight lifting I'm not trying to look like anybody if I put on a ... lift it it's just that I that's how I feel that maybe trying to look like from out of touch with if you put on the lipstick but okay I made more than [laughter]\nOkay well I think I mean but you know my choices radio [laughter] it'll be read all that much we already\nKnow that I think is really watered down ... really must have known about but anyway who throw that in ... but it was only there actually is rude and white [laughter] it is right but ... is red and white but anyway which is water water down ... but but today we went on natural crown\nAnd I think women are embracing it and then if we decide we want to straighten it it is a woman's choice ... and we have to understand that it's a choice\nWhen we go to a got a couple of

by many who felt that the black college students were not treated fairly and I\nTalk I have meetings with all the presidents of the other campuses morals Allman Morris Brown a land you're Clark Atlanta University and we all try to find some common ground but it was just a very very difficult situation\nBut that was uh in in Nineteen Ninety seven when I ran for a reelection and there was some with drug use as an issue I Want every black freezing and said\nI think it was people understood that while that was a difficult issue that the larger issue of Atlanta in Atlanta as progress and where we really hold ourselves and let me say that\nThere was no city like Atlanta for the African American community all of you know this intuitively but when you travel people believe Atlanta is Nirvana\nSome of blacks in Atlanta unparalleled\nUm the biggest busiest best airport in the world was built and owned and\nOperated by the sixth consecutive African American mayors and that does not go unnoticed across the country and I believe\nYou have to really have an appreciation for African American\nLook at it lands to look on the cover of ebony magazine right now ah and you see that two of the people that are on the cover one is the mayor of Atlanta mayor bottoms and the other is Stacey Abrams who's running for governor was a product that land so I think that gives you some sense about how it man is regarded\nWell said let's go back to the early years you were born in Raleigh North Carolina yeah and your brother your older brother Ralph was\nThe first African American to whole state wide off and and only and only ... nobody ever did it that's what happened to him how did that shaped your perception of politics early well\nA very interesting that you asked that my father was the president of the end up ...\nP A in a way county and um he has a simple ... monitoring and that was voting is the one time when everyone is equal whether you are a billionaire or whether you're homeless you go in and your vote counts just the same\nAnd so when we were young on election day my father took me and my older brother and sister out of school he would take me to a precinct and give me a little paper bag with some fried chicken and a bunch of a little uh pamphlets they hand out to people and that was stay there all day\nAll day long from the time the precinct open until the time the precinct close you combine check on that you okay\nAnd so what that taught me and what we really need to teach all of our children is that voting is the most indispensable tool we have for revolutionary change it is the most important element that we have and in my mind I Will tell you I still struggle\nWith the fact that we only get sometimes one out of five black folks going to the polls I find I I just it's in principle to me I met with Nelson Mandela in South Africa and we were talking about you may remember that when he was elected they had people standing in line that will from miles\nFrom miles they had something like Ninety to Ninety three percent of all the people of South Africa who voted Ninety to Ninety three percent\nAnd if we get twenty percent\nOf African Americans to the polls we think that's a great victory yeah that's actually a target ... twenty eight twenty percent we like celebrating this is something in front of me and I say how can that be and and you asked yourself at this moment when we see the vial racism\nThat is coming from the federal government and we ask ourselves well my goodness how does how it happened because we do do not and will not go to the polls and enough numbers to make the changes that are necessary\nYou made history when you were seven years old and that history has recorded what did you do at seven\n... seven years old an integrated schools of a North Carolina first black first flat and it's interesting a it was actually the first public schools the integrated in the south\nI'm there I had an article I'm In New York times a few months ago ruby bridges some of you may know the story ruby bridges were integrated schools in New Orleans and I guess uh the famous painter or have a lot of ground that was McGrath that was a very um\nUm well documented room are beard and and Norman Rockwell actually I think having a child\nGoing in in school young black girl ruby bridges um she was a a month after I integrated schools in Raleigh North Carolina ... and even though I was a person integrate is really a story of the courage of Ralph in June Campbell\nWho put their seven year old son into that cold spring of racism and hatred somebody you may not know North Carolina had the large ... actually the Ku Klux Klan had the grand dragon\nWas in North Carolina\nThey had a conclave of klansmen you know like a like an omega convention right I'm going to happen to you know make a you know where my time so I Want you appreciate all going to make us who are here and who came right just so we got that so but but here here here's the thing they had like plan convention at the memorial\nAuditorium in Raleigh in like Nineteen sixty two all the clans and so my point being that\nIt took Ralph in June Campbell's courage to say I'm going to put my seven year old son into this no matter how difficult how violent how ugly and they'd be in order for the greater good and and that's what really stands out today because I I Know if you'd asked me and my wife will not put a seven year old son and\nIt it would be very hard to do but they did it\nAnd it was a a very very difficult time for five years I was the only black child in the school I had to have a a a\nWe had a a group of ministers in and um community leaders who would take me to school every day for almost two months and they would have crowds lined up and they would yell and scream and and some would try to spit on me as I was going to schools are very difficult to give them fight in the body\nWell fortunately I didn't you know I was seven so hard to really fight too much at seven and a and it was a ... you may not know that in the elementary school was it was one through six that was which actually believe it's a good system one through six and in junior high seven eight nine and a senior high I I really don't believe that\nKids are younger ought to be with seniors but that's a different issue for a different time but I was in second grade\nAnd so I was just I was tiny\nAnd it was a tough time and these older kids with you know beat me up and not me upside the head and you know as soon as the teacher wasn't looking you're pushed me down and it was a very tough time but I Do or because I understood why it was important and just so that you know it wasn't just going to school for the immigration\nA it was also that every night we marched up and down the streets of Raleigh we were sitting in front of the hotels for all young people you know take all this stuff for granted and you really don't have an appreciation I Know he's oil guys talking about the right stuff again but let me tell you\nYou could not go to a movie theater people now in the movie theater I went out to we went out to the movie the other day a jail everybody's having a good time you know ...\nBut let me just say [laughter] you could not go to a movie theater and the only movie theater in Raleigh that will allow blacks to go we had to go up on the fire escape and sit on the top five rows right and they had it sectioned off you couldn't you could not go down\nSo we couldn't stay in hotels you couldn't either restaurants so we did that sort of demonstration every single day\nSo it was just a part and parcel of what we did I can remember vividly when we are protesting and finally able to go into this public swimming pool you know what's so interesting is they face so many African Americans or drown because we many of us don't know how to swim and\nA powerful as a of the five fingers on the ... as a five fingers on the hand yet work together\nIt was really viewed as the segregation of speech and they loved him he was exhausted right WB do boys who was the greatest black intellectual what outraged and he gathered on many of the black intellectuals together as a result of that speech\nWhen they opened up my parking Eighteen Ninety five and they went and they have a movie called the Niagara movement and from that now every movement in New York\nBecame the N. double ACP and so think about lineage and then one of the great leaders of the N. double ACP was from Atlanta so it is just and then WB the boys came I taught at Atlanta University ... so just look at that rate history of how we\nWere and where we are and what we've been able to accomplish and as I mentioned to a reporter who was asking as landers only city sixth consecutive African American mayors in Atlanta only place in the country right here\nWow Wow Did you feel pressure because you're coming after these political giants\nDid you feel pressured number one number two is there a level of institutional knowledge that they share with the next person when you kind of have to get in there and figure it out\nStory I'm first um\nI'm ... mayor Jackson was so thoughtful and an open and re Gary is I I served as has floor leader in the city council for four years I was a city councilman for twelve years and the last four years when men are came back you know he was mayor from Seventy to eighty one in and they came in I was elected in eighty one\nWhen Andy was elected right and then made up came back\nIn eighty nine and so I served as manners floor leader so I I spent an awful lot of time with meaner\nAnd so I got a lot of institutional knowledge about city of Atlanta where we're from what's expected how we do things this is what's important and and it was it really served as a a training ground for me and I was able to utilize that and of course and the young who has always been open about\nUh giving advice to anybody who will listen and wants to learn so I\nI had these great teachers in the course of my you know I I had so many other people who were trying to help guide me through and and uh make certain that I understood what was important in how to get things done but I lost that say that there was an imperative\nBecause I was elected in ... I took office in January Ninety for the Olympics were coming in Ninety six and so there was no time for a learning curve\nBecause the games were coming in the summer of Ninety six and the city had to be ready and we had to prepare and we had to get all the facilities working in the security and all those issues so it was a really a hit the ground running kind of an endeavor and you did it when we did it and not only that it's so interesting\nUm and I I Will say this\nYou know we must make certain that we write our own history and we tell our own story that many people who've asked me why I'm here today with a ... year it's a view of heights and it is because\nUh we have an obligation to tell her own story if you allow a the white media or white writers\nTo tell our story invariably they have a different take on what black leadership is meant and their story the way they tell it uh is is so skewed\nAs though we're almost witnessed the history and not the people who made history and so when you ask about uh the Olympics or or ... or administration is contributions you know it's funny how there was a a during the last mayor's race a on a a one of the radio stations a public radio station\nA they had a candidate and they they were asking about you know what your philosophy as they say well you know the contributions of a bill Campbell is black reporter\nUh said a ... bill Campbell out what what contribution is a bill got what how can you bring up his name and and you say\nIt's because we are diluted you know and and we let others tell our story and then that means that we take what they write\nA ... and we believe that that's the way the story ought to be told and and when you look at the fact that during our administration and not only that we have the Olympics very successful and ethics by the way\nAre the most ... a female athletes ever the biggest games ever and what many believe in spite of the terrible Olympic Park bombing and the most successful of the games that ever happened we also had a two Super Bowl\nFive World Series or we changed the face of public housing when I took office a public housing was a disgrace\nIn fact the federal government was about to take control of public housing and uh my district I was just in my city council districts we had a third of the city's public housing check what homes for me\nOh for many of you again we're younger don't appreciate how bad check what holds was or or in the homes or Perry I'll listen\nI appreciate how bad it was well let me tell you I was there\nA limit let me tell you let me tell you how bad it was the first year in office a two year old child when Perry homes show doubtful a cockroach\nAnd so when I went out to visit with the family and to commiserate and to try to offer some solace and help there was a Fifteen year old girl who answered the door and that's what I talk to the mother and his job says well I'm the mother to child while an average age of grandmothers at that point with thirty six years old\nIn public housing and the physical structures were a bomb a liberal\nAnd when I took office I sent my most important task is not to get ready for the Olympic Games it was to change the face of public housing\nThe all new radio jak combat is available now it's a totally new experienced it but you're listening at your fingertips we made it easier than ever to access the
