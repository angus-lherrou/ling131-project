really interesting calls that we're going to be made and I think one thing they did is is overall they got 'em right it just took them a little time to figure out by discussing\nYou know what the

the right result and and and there's a discussion between\nBetween the officials to get it right I think where it gets frustrating is one of theirs that conference at all of a sudden apply gets picked up that you know as a file that gets frustrated oh so I thought this crew or they didn't they didn't perform at a fast rate meaning that you're right there with a lot of talking going on during the game\nBut they've got a lot of calls right for instance on the two point play they called us profits of\nPassing her parents but the other thing that's interesting is the guy ... you know said that we didn't break the plane or that suited\nAnd then I saw the replay and realized you know what he didn't and it was great to be the guy on the field got it right and all of us that saw it on on a screen or even I bet you where you were sitting like you would have thought man he got in but he didn't get it so that was a really interesting dynamic because if it had we got and then\nWould have accepted

really oh that's a climactic when you say oh sorry about that I'm so\nToday the we've been trying to dissect a what we learned in what you know what what we got moving forward trying to get ready for the Steeler game so I Will ask you what I've asked to our other guest today and that is where you at this week where what are you thinking about all the injuries in where there's football team is currently\nWell there you know they're already dark place right now no question\nAbout [laughter] my pod cast was um you know what I'm Talking then the one in three sunk in place that was before I knew about grade\nYear and I mean there's not not they're encouraging a guest the three stops then the third quarter or for the defense but are pretty much Andy dog news or\nYou know I'm not one playoff game illegal they would run up or down the ... and he got Robert burger coming up ... um Winston and then he lived in the next three games or before you get a chance to go to a break and get a by reset\nA deep in the ... better and ah but you know they're they're gonna have to get a lot better here for you know they're going to salvage this season\nYou recovered package for a long time a little bit better be AJC with this you know it looked dance can be positive thinking about that shit it's over we're not going to the white flag but I mean these guys get to the quarterback which will McLean would throw it in your jak crop or do we we love with ... but it's almost like you've got to take them attacking clothing for the rest of the de la\n[laughter] yeah I like to move to crop or we asked about Jared go down and who's going to take those snap and you can Crawford the first name but I think it's going to be more dangerous to not uh you know over the long haul and then to real McLean who's always so pleasant to the media and the locker room\nAre a [noise] you know they've got some options and then when you look at those stacks uh on on tape I did a you know did the NASCAR package and they moved tack around it was a tack Grady\nVic in our Crawford and so that was the group that was getting the pressure so now you got put McLean in there or not uh\nPack Grady Vic in Crawford and so that was a group that was good enough pressure so now you've got put McLean in there or not\nA you know in a nickel package and move tack around and uh you know continue to try to get after people southerners Shelby's coming back this week that's going to help from a friend but most of the problems were a solve those they were playing\nA lead and people get too much yards after the kids in there before they got to them and got I'm On the ground you know boy I Want to go back and see his jak he caught a lot of boss shorten and took him off the field on them so they they got to tighten up dead zone that's just come from a\nPlanet more and being out there together more\nWe talked to as a Oliver today by the way through a McLean did say what's up to me um how can we talk to Oliver today he said uh you know last week was a learning experience for him but\nHe said he's grown a lot since obviously being and training camp in where he is because he's been thrown in there and now ... what's your take on as a Oliver because now we're counting on him a lot more than we thought we would actually have two this season\nYeah on on the two plays and it happened really really fast at the end you could see a play he came back knock that fake pattern down second play you realized right away he made a mistake started trying to scramble back to AJ green do laid out and uh you know\nA guy that knows what he's doing is not going to be off on that play the next time around so you could see the physical part of it and he's a shark cat so so he's not going to miss a lot uh so you know more he gets out there the more you see the more it's going to be able to do better I felt real or\nA comfortable with you know what I saw from him moving forward but you know when you put a rookie out there I was like they're going to they don't find it does it for a matter of time and they saved it for the men and and that's a that's where it paid off for the bangles\nWe would go round and round as he led Georgia's your guys live from our studios here at flower branch falcons headquarters if if\nTrue five just hold on to that pick the game's over\nYeah no doubt I saw that on the ... or rewind on the table we went back through it I got up pretty quick I don't think you realize how you know that he had the ball quite frankly it hit him by the time it hits the ground he's like a you know he knew what happened right away\nBut he ran the route better than the receiver I'm like why not look for the ball you know and ah he didn't and ah I'm sure he'll uh I saw him out they're catching passes today trying to get ready for it if it happens for him again\n[noise] um it's the Orlando led better guy she covers the falcons on a daily basis for the AJC AJC dot com check out his podcast at ease up here all the time and on top of things when it comes to our falcon you know we talk about the defense and all the issues there we heard free for the first time today\nWhat does he bring back to this team it and what's his load going to be deemed when as far as carrying the ball this week do you still get most of the case of the judge and Coleman\nYeah I think you want to you know ease him back in I think they do get to carry\nAnd maybe get him up to the quicker in the past ... okay you know get you a mismatch on a boss thicker won them a\nSlow Pittsburgh linebackers and ah you know make some damage that way but yeah let those guys they've been taking the hits let them carry the the run low but uh you know slide him in there on ah some third downs and so forth and use them as a traditional scaled back\nAnd then and easing back on their to easing back into his workload on the run game yeah that's how it played that\nGoing into this a Steeler game\nWhat it's worth saying you were there and the scrambling you know he's he's looked at some of the blocking techniques and like with a line that are doing and how you know and that's something\nGoing into this a Steeler game\nNow for what it's worth saying you were there and the ... you know he's he's looked at some of the blocking techniques and like with a line that are doing and how you know and that's something I think there's been criticized sometimes picking up let's so that's cool their secondary terrible we just talked about that with west drew ... but what about their front seven I mean can they get heat I mean ... so a lot and give them at the time to get the ball out\nYeah he should be okay but now has a he's a traditionally a\nHates this three four he hates it or a you know going all the way back to a ... bone in his second year when they went up there and it was nine and on at the end of regulation or you just never know whether he's come from it's harder to read it and it's hard to uh you know pick up your a secondary in third receiver so\nThere are guys outside good thing is not James hairs anymore no joy Porter crisis a DJ wind bud do three so uh yeah uh\nJake map the use

that's where we plan on being or that's where we had hoped to be but we're one and three okay not not really anything to read between the lines on that right right\nThis is not excuses\nBut reality is reality we've had some very difficult injuries to really good players all three of the players people talking baseball when the middle has to be good your\nCat your pitcher your second baseman than the center fielder so when you lose Allen Neal and Jones those are kind of the middle of that defense so that hurts um I didn't know that Arthur black was arrives dealer\n'cause 'cause I was talking about that last week just kidding I'm just kidding all respect and or in reference to the great Arthur Blank but that's what I've been saying to how are you going to lose your catcher your shortstop with your center fielder and keep stopping the opponent\nSo if they if it's a a uphill battle but they have and I agree with Dan was saying about uh the rally he did play better now I thought he had a ... you put your head around what do you what you made that he made the probably make pack or whatever so they got buried in that situation\nUh did rally he didn't play better now I thought he had to pick six you turn your head around but he ... he made that he made the probably made tackled or whatever so they've got buried in that situation\nYou're acting you're you're young guy you drafted him to step up due to not have to pay more play that we use laser part is year about ... and I think the claims of playing better than I think people will actually give them credit for heating plant will ever be tackled to visit also\nAh being Crawford complain and I just signed this kid a Michael Bennett who's going to have the play Sunday by the way because you know you're you're short as far as uh as far as interior help now the good thing about this Pittsburgh more\nThey went away from a lot of that old Pittsburgh grounded in pounds right at you but you know they ride all run a lot more three wide out more to uh to tie ins with them both detach so they might be fine but getting away with just plain nickel disguise\nInteresting and I do a ... there's more Arthur Blank clubs there that I Want to get to but since you brought up Pittsburgh\nUm and and we did hear a lot of a lot of talk about you know going zone first African since getting shelled you go man demand second half a largely was successful you went away for a man demand and went back to the zone and the tea to green and so it's been a lot of conversation obviously\nAnd Dan Quinn said when John and you ask them about it this morning I it depends on matchups he was encouraged by the man demand defense against Cincinnati or is he said they needed it and he liked how guys stepped up so you've got the Pittsburgh Steelers you've got\nObviously Antonio Brown you've got your ... Schuster you've got the hotshot rookie James Washington you've got the ... the white dude and Ryan Switzer costs seven balls last week bans McDonald Jesse James James Carter\nYou got a lot of weapons so do we saw on that team or do we man that\nTeam 'cause this is why it last week on the way for tailgate show I said I thought they play more zone because I thought that the defense of in for the ... after the attack\nWhich they did when I went back to me and I thought the back of a big impact could dominate the tackles the Bengals and they could just sit back and coverage what seven guys but obviously it'd be work that way they had to go to a man and hold those receivers of just a little bit longer so that so that the password to get home\nI honestly don't know how they play this do you go back to the man to man but you are you put rocket you put him on a I'm not ... the ... or so I'll come rocket you put Robert offered on a on and tell me your brown would help\nYou put 'em a true farther you put them on ... my problem is I I don't like the ... versus ... ha ha I don't I don't like that much about the match up and go with the way they go get killed\nAnd I'm Talking about the falcons costs or they can hold their own\nYou know because what's different about now with Pittsburgh is is that bad that safety can now\nDouble Antonio where was he he had their ... was Antonio gets you out to eat all day now they're putting the safety of their double to even more than he's been the past two years and ... and I think that's why you see a lot of his numbers are down right now is usually is getting that one on one match up he's making the place\nSo in what you're saying it's it's ... for John Michaelson flowery branch of the falcons Wednesday what you're saying is that is the collateral damage of no lady on belt yes\nYou're so we've we've all been trying to make sense of that and what's the difference with the Steelers and you know you look statistically\nAnswer for games last year and three or four games this year lady and bell and James Caan are are almost identical same grabs at Eighteen or in roughly four hundred totally yard but you're telling me that the stats don't tell the whole story and that and that that a beat is being crowded a little bit yeah can we continue that\nAre also lose hope so I mean we know one thing about the leak is ... you see with well how how one team plays a player that you buy the play you try to implement some of those uh some of those strategies that covers or whatever to try to dictate a kind of the same way they do now the other side they pay those guys\nThat you buy the play you try to implement some of those are some of those strategies\nThat covers or whatever to try to dictate a kind of the same way they do now the other side they pay those guys too and they look at the film to what they look well they tried to do this let's do this so it's going to be a chess match and it's gonna be a lot of points scored because effectively they're not that good they're they're really not that good defense but now\nThe leader of a campaign has come out and he's kind of\nChallenge the troops out of the defense will back to these guys going because you don't want to be that team going into Pittsburgh when they're motivated yeah that place is hard to play and when ... when that deep was getting after you back with a with a planner\nA no doubt about it man and a ... you know you mentioned tied into the match up a and we're going to get back to uh to to Arthur Blank and and there's a quote here that I really want to read between the lines on a Randy certainly won't take the bait but we'll try nevertheless\nUm so two weeks ago we see Vance McDonald truck Chris Conti up basically sent him into retirement three two one time he was put on a A R a last week bans McDonald had a big first tap\nDid nothing in the second half and they get five or sixty two in the first half dominating they totally go away from him and his ... I mean Pittsburgh didn't score a point in the second half of all Logan bought ... point okay\nSo uh and obviously you've got Jesse James I'm my read on it as Vance McDonald is more they're down field route runner James More of the under the sea underneath God is sixth often supply men or the underneath guy but\nA talk about you know you're you're you you know all of football but tight industry\nSpecial I talk about these two guys one thing about McDonald he's physical he's a big puzzle guy and he when he got copy and country's been in a lot of people's highlights okay and I said you know I don't like to talk about\nHe's trash she's always been trapped not even when he was a scholar where you have is I was playing when you were saying yeah it did you get you up to a game I gave the flipper even though if I was like the the students just\nYou know ... whatever he's gone now but she's a physical guy who like you said they liked the run up and down the seats and with the falcon defense has been struggling a bit is tied in in the ... looks back that he has a familiar with Jesse because he likes doing little opposite route to Jesse Little drag Ross like you said\nAnd Jeff he does a great job of finding zones in city and that's that's what he's done so far ... Pittsburgh so being a has a comfort level with him as as far as those ... runs\nHigh ranking John or your life from flowery branch Randy Makin for John Michael's today All right so back to what Dan ... here and I love breaking down the access to nose with Randy we're going to do more of that with Dave archer at a at high noon here on the home of the falcon sports radio Ninety tonight the

well I don't know if you guys again uh had to throw hey man that you both um that everybody down there in Atlanta and now do not take the under the skin don't take the under ... the number was just that number for the first half don't take it because this is going to be all points\nFor both teams probably more for Atlanta let's be honest because the Steelers bank how ridiculous is this theme right\nLike their defense they're running their intimidation they stink at doing most everything that I just named there it's unbelievable what I'm watching up here right now\nWow Chris I absolutely love to hear the passion and a ... you know but you guys are used excellent up there in Pittsburgh used was salty defense and it's not you're used to a ... uh it it's just weird and like no point in the second advocates Baltimore like what the hell are but it is\nI mean ... look of course I Do need to remind you you guys want Thirteen games last year and this is not a Thirteen when football club but to me the number one priority for the Steelers and the off season was replacing Ryan shades ear and I told everybody was on popular opinion that they need to caught him\nAnd I know they paid him ... million to come back this year and it's sort of uh uh what do you call it the golden parachute or a severance package or whatever it is\nI'm Sorry I got to use that eight million a ballplayer and uh in in the middle of their defenses has been gutted wishes you're being out why didn't Pittsburgh do a better job of addressing that and the off season\nOr they didn't even have to do what you're describing you know they could have done is made a decision one way or the other only the on sale and use the money that they would have had to pay him out of the act but basically Fifteen million dollars or so and tried to identify players that they could spend more money on\nThe other only beyond bell and use the money that they would have had to pay him out of the bag but basically Fifteen million dollars or so and tried to identify players that they could spend more money on that would help filling better than John Bostic has for Ryan Shays ear\nBut and this is kind of been my contention throughout their Thirteen through last year ... their teeth and a lot of those winds could Boswell was good and so much of it we're finding out now is way beyond ... just being excellent in so many different ways his presence on the field kind of a taking some of the heat off Antonio Brown off than rock was burger off everybody else basically\nAnd they played hardball with him and thought he would blink like everybody else does most everybody else does in his situation and he has and so now here they are for games and\nThey don't have levy on bell pill allegedly we gate they might be one for and won by then let's be real um they don't have until then per his statement to ESPN but he's coming back then\nAnd then they don't have defensive help because they didn't just let him walk in ... quote unquote let him win in that battle so they couldn't use that money elsewhere and they didn't give him what he actually wanted so he would have shown up in the first place they probably never lose the Cleveland game and maybe they find a way to Kansas City so they've butchered\nThe lady on bill situation so totally in so completely\nThat it has trickled down to not only they're often but also what you're describing in the middle of that the fence or they had to go more bargain shopping for guys who are giving them bargain performance or it's just what it is\nChris obviously lady in belle ... a hot button topic for you guys up there it was so much so in the locker room again all sense of linemen talking about um do you feel that him not showing up and the subsequent comments from the office of line earlier on in the year has somehow fractured this team\nI think to a degree it has but most of the people I'm a boost shut are a big Steelers insider with the station up here um and a guy who Tony ... brown color racist and as a great guy and far from a racist the furthest thing from it really had said that a lot of that stuff\nThat got put out there in week one once\nIt I'm like initially happened in got into the news cycle guys kind of felt bad about saying it but there was some damage done there I think for sure fractured\nI I don't know I don't know that that's a convenience sort of thing to say when they're one two and one I think it's just the case of the guy replacing him James Connors is a great story up here and everybody likes them all that stuff\nHe's just not lazy on bell I object as a union member as a guy that that ... all the sides with labor in these situations what are his fellow union members doing siding with management by by talking about his money\nI'd I'm astonished that guys like Ramon Foster the player wrap and more ... pounds he was also in a capacity like that we're talking about levy on bells money and and saying things even if they were emotionally driven about him contractually I mean it was ridiculous to me\nAnd I was glad to see that that players are former players\nAre around the rest of the league did not take the Steelers side in this did not take like the the office of lines pack I bought what they said was was kind of bunk and should have been kept in house and they should've just kind of off the ballot Jackie and no comment that so many patriots players give whenever there is drama there\nChris you're making a ton of ... a ton of sense here of course meal or Ninety three seven the fan in Pittsburgh we are getting to know our enemy here as we approach the Steelers game on Sunday I get everything you just said and I basically agree with everything you just said but\nLady and bell has been a major headache for this football team for years it's been a suspension here it's been an injury there you're in a playoff game he's rolling another soft tissue injury the contracts\nHim for years it's been a suspension here it's been an injury there you're in a playoff game he's rolling another soft tissue injury the contract to contract to hold out the old out it's always something with this guy so I think you up and said why does its role in their hands up going my God you're telling me but\nIt all came out so I think to a point Libyan bell took those guys to the edge where they would say that kinda stuff\nI think that\nThey are frustrated emotionally I can get that and in belle even though it seems to be the clearest headed person about all of this right now his drug things pretty far in the past in so far as he's been on the straight and narrow long enough that I think he understands that there's a ton of money to be last year like people up here have a positive that he's staying away 'cause he\nUm would be testing positive if he were back right now I don't buy that for a second the guy is one thing and I think it's pretty smart when it comes to business and you understand what's at stake for him\nI the emotional stuff for his teammates I get it Ramon Foster who's a great do a great talker and the voice of that room\nDescribed it in a way that I Do think makes sense especially for the down the line type of guys who aren't super stars making superstar money like Ramon than on drafted free agent he said try to come back help us when the super bowl we won the super bowl everybody eats remote and unrestricted free agent coming up this off season bell being here gives him the best chance\nBut but what something's wrong I Know you too well ...

McKeon on the other side of the glass then\nWhen I was driving in to get ready for the show\nI was thinking All right we'll talk on that bell All right we'll talk college football\nWe will squeeze it in the baseball with the Yankees tied up the series up against the red Sox and the Indians going down oh two up against the Houston Astros and I was trying to think what would be the lead a probably college football coming up what was it entertaining college football Saturday\nThen when I was sitting in the newsroom McCune comes up to me he goes we have the fight on in the studio and there was a live show going on outside the cage I was actually I felt it is a great job he was in Las Vegas for the fight and Pete Hoffman one of the coast on the pod cast\nHe was here hosting outside the cage as you are the was coming to close for their latest fight\nAnd we all know what was the lead up with a B been Conor McGregor and I'm not a religious USC watcher I'm not going to pretend to tell you I Know everything about the sport because I don't so am I Can't tell you the fights about to come on and I was interested in\nReligious USC watcher I'm not going to pretend to tell you I Know everything about the sport because I Know so ... tells you the fights about to come on and I was interested in the fight 'cause I was paying attention to the ridiculous there's what the build up and everything that happened with counter McGregor in Brooklyn during the Dolly getting arrested and all that\nSo I come into the studio\nI watch round the one I watch round too and in round two you started to see the fatigue hitting on Conor McGregor and he looked weak in the cage and\nI was someone and it shows yeah when you don't know that much it actually may help young protections goes I I'm not a big fan of Conor McGregor I don't know much about to be ... but I can be was going to win the fight\nAnd then I Know a lot about the NFL and college football I kept picked aims right there so maybe I should just keep on sticking a big boy and with the seat goes eventually Conor McGregor tapped out could be does win but who cares about the actual result of the fight who cares who won\nBecause that's not what is going to be talked about people are not going to be breaking this down we would not be leading with this\nOn a national radio program if could be just wanting to fight in a town of McGregor tapped out we mentioned it and about two hours if what happened after the fight\nNever happened but what happened after the fight is the biggest story and the biggest takeaway from this you have the match between counter McGregor and can beep\nAnd I'm someone that is a let's say casual extremely casual us see fan\nSo I Want to hear from people that are you have the diehards\nI also want to hear from people that are watching it for the first time or people that just may have watched a few fights here and they're\nNow in my old job I had the pleasure of being able to interview a lot of these ah fighters and you have to see a participant so for me I have a little bit of knowledge on the sport but not as much as Peter NYC and guys that covered this thing twenty four seven with the great amount of passion and that's what I was watching the fight with these guys\nBecause they were going bonkers\nSitting around watching it with a Pete and then here and I react through the eye as the end and all that\nThen then Horowitz comes grounds they and he says I got to talk to you for show preparation and actually happen with all the chaos was going on so I missed that chaos live but with Twitter because the pay per view of usa which if you're paying for the fight you would think you got to thinking replay of what actually happened\nBut I guess they don't think it's good for the sports so that's why they didn't show it so you don't see a replay but everything is tracked on Twitter and you get to see the entire thing that did a unfold in Las Vegas so let me just be clear once again I'm not the biggest you're the guy in the world\nBut that was entertaining but that was also a joke what happened after the fight\nAnd I understand with a lot of these build up for example when you look at boxing the build up between may weather\nAnd macgregor was a bunch of hogwash the things that were said before that fight we're just for entertainment value and it absolutely zero meeting zero

McGregor chose not to press charges\nAlso Dana White here we go I told you he was going to act all disappointed I've been doing this for Eighteen years\nAnd the biggest night ever and I couldn't be more disappointed [laughter] you know may I'm usually mad at everything I'm not really mad I'm just\nDisappointed yeah sure you're disappointed that yeah the what now do interviews and lie and say oh don't support to let's be realistic\nThe actions speak louder than what you say right now and ... actually see all this footage over and over and over again\nIt will be hyped up or promoted this way and you'll just tell both guys take don't be idiots and after the fight\nYou know let things go and then you move on from there All right let's talk to you on the phone they bought bought two on two for CBS I Do appreciate you guys holding on so patiently will start things off with Adam in Phoenix, Arizona first stop on CBS Sports radio what's up atom\nHey what's up guys doing great go ahead Adam\nI consider myself a regular person like most of us you know something called the basement waters Tito fingers but I just try to keep a realistic perspective\nWhat I'm trying to wonder is how can anybody even understand what could be then\nGregor do when\nThey punch each other on the face and hurt each other to make a living and expect for that to happen to themselves so it's kind of ironic we ever try to place ourselves in their shoes would that being said we all have Merrill's ethics and believe and we've all had friends and the people who do crazy things just to prove a point\nMaybe that's what I was trying to do he just made his money and he had to prove a point or\nAnother perspective be considered McGregor shows up uninvited and attacked the bus due to beef with forbade and their skirt lawsuits against him from other UFC employees and he's still fighting making some say is fifty to a hundred million show how good a\nIt's against him from other USC employees and he's still fighting making some say is fifty to a hundred million so how could it could be I think he's doing wrong he's not throwing hand trucks and breaking windows\nIt's just a perspective for all of us to think about it so easy to ... from the sidelines but we don't understand what any of those sweaters are doing\n... tell you that some day in a white then 'cause they know white allowed this to happen as he should and he like Conor McGregor get away with what he did he said he was disappointed then we eventually saw the fight happened and guess what would this\nBe is going to get the disappointed talk you know I'm not mad I'm disappointed in yeah Habib but there'll be a rematch the USC would be stupid not to have a rematch with this I Can't\nName a whole lot of fighters I interviewed a view of the ... and you know Mr wonderful er and I interviewed\nDaniel corner me I Can't name a ton of these fighters I can tell you an hour I can name a ... name Connor McGregor and there's great reaction from this so get these ties in an octagon again let's go to Jay in central California next up CBS Sports radio morning how are ya\nHey I'm doing good I'm going to nine or getting them all Irish cream my voice shots at night man at a time watching that fight\nLet's talk about the like first it was a good by you know I think the only around a key didn't fight his fight was the third I think he was just kind of catching his breath for the most part he got McGregor on the ground\nHe'd wrap his legs around him McGregor didn't have an answer for the better fight a war in the fight no question bars\nYeah no question no question um but you know when that third rail macgregor was paying off on and we shall have free\nOr you know it was interesting after the second round we're McGregor got and handed to him\nAnd it just shows you how crazy this guy is and how they're different animals and they're wired a different way than we are and like the caller said we can't relate to them McGregor after getting his brain beat in and the second round the minute when around was over he's smiling he'd smile and he's laughing going into the third round it was unbelievable\nOh yeah but that's his game you know he wants to get because he said that he could be said before the fight and I I think you know\nThat throw disagree with you or because when I looked at her ... been clearly took a lot of things personal with this and that was reflected after the fight where he didn't let it go\nBut when you add the way and and when they were looking at each other and sides in each other up McGregor saying all of his stuff that he always says and how did they don't look scaring whatsoever I made that point yesterday that's why I took a bead\nWin the fight because he didn't show any fear at that way and he just looked at McGregor and basically he gave me a look where he said I'm going to kick your ass and you know it\nOh you're definitely right I agree

I'm pretty sure the phone call okay let's get to the college football and we're gonna have to two segments on this because there's a whole lot of reaction from the college football yesterday let's start with the most entertaining game\nThat was Texas and Oklahoma cotton bowl\nIt was forty five to twenty four\nAnd one Oklahoma's trailing Texas by Twenty one I'm thinking turn out the lights the party's over taxes is going to win the football game at ease and I'm Still thinking that in the fourth quarter when\nThere's ten minutes to play in Texas is still up by Twenty one and I'm Still thinking down as we're approaching the nine minute mark\nAnd Texas is still up by Twenty one but then this is why I Love college football it changes in a snap of finger\nAnd in a few plays Oklahoma who seemed as dead in his over match this could be finds a way to get back into the football game and not only get back into the football game but at one point tired so they get a touchdown and cut it down to fourteen\nThan they make a stop defensively which Oklahoma struggled to make stops but when it mattered up until the final drive they made the stocks that they needed to\nThen Tyler Murray after the stop after they forced upon calamari goes for sixty seven yards and I know people say all the time oh we want the NC double a or football video game back I'm watching that won't happen on saying\nThis is a video game the speed on that kid\nUnbelievable it was great I thought I was playing that inter NC double a 'cause I I thought the the guy to control the television on what the general game was on was plus it burst pressing the fast forward\nButton because the way that he moved was just it was so quick\nI was so energetic and it was so lightening fast so he gets a touchdown that cuts down to seven\nOklahoma forces another point from taxes\nAnd then they got a touchdown and tied the game so when they go down and they cut it for Twenty one to fourteen from down fourteen and on it took four plays to make a fourteen point deficit go to a tie game\nAnd that's just no way that you come back in a situation like that but limited times is that on big place and down the stretch Oklahoma was able to hit on the big place to get back into the football game but it does it and then I Would have wanted the game went over time\nBut the beauty of college football is someone you're not talking about before the game ends up becoming a big story because before the game or talking about Tom Herman before the game or talking about Lincoln Reilly before the game or talking about saying I'll injure before the game or talking about Tyler ...\nWho was talking about Kamron decker ... talking about him sick or the character\nAnd wants when Oklahoma\nA Twenty one point deficit go away and they come back to the game hooked on Texas was wasn't that football game even if you're Texas then when you lose that lead did you think you were winning the game\nAnd there's no way you had a feeling of just a big not in your stomach saying oh they just one of the lead it's not going to happen we're going to lose in overtime\nWe're CBS Sports radio and you can reach out to us

Bones Are five\nSay and unload train as the expert with the academic studies but it really has to come down to something inside that they are driven and they want it for themselves we can certainly stand alongside and and encourage\nBut you cannot make or love someone into seeking recovery it has to come from within so a tree and I\nTalked to his network has a behavioral or mental challenges can place a person on a path toward substance abuse and\nIndividual that has an untreated mental health diagnosis will begin or can begin to utilize substances to mass their feelings thinking that the substances\nAre alleviate in the symptoms of their mental health disorder versus getting the necessary treatment also an individual that's exposed\nTo substances may just are experimenting with them hanging out what friends hanging out what the wrong peer group you may start experimenting with drugs and so from there and may psycho into something where\nAll of a sudden you're craven this drug and that's the difference is when you began to crave for a drug or some type of substance your brain can't think about anything else other than obtaining that substance\nSo Dina what were the issues that have come out now your son now being thirty two years old or what the triggers what caused him to decide to try to mask the pain of something what was it\nNow your son now being thirty two years old or what the triggers what caused him to decide to try to mask the pain of something what was it\nThat's a great question like like a number of individuals going through their teenage years there are social pressures through academic pressures\nAnd certainly those those feelings of um ... will make a me fit in with with whatever your group I Would say that that that started what was what were some normal feelings during that period of time escalated to I'm more of an anxiety for him\nYour course or hearing the voice of Dina she's a mother her son was in prison but he is now in recovery which she says will be forever he started out with alcohol and it progressed from their\nOur next guest is Stephanie Stephanie how you doing I'm good good you were Seventeen when you started going for the hard stuff you were saying yes ma'am and you started out actually at age twelve smoking marijuana yes with your friends\nThat's now and then it just went from there we talked about the the various medicines that you started using when\nYou first started using these particular items do do you use them because you in pain or do you use them because somebody told you you get how would this\nWell really I think why we would just try and stuff I Me and my friends and like I just liked it but you know looking back\nI'm at a young guy is like my mother walked out on me and my sister and she was always an addiction so you know just kind of being like grow up and that type of environment you know what I mean I think that kind of triggered me to think it was\nI guess I like to be more comfortable with it but I Do know like when I tried like pain pills life specifically it was just like something in my mind body and everything just clicked and I felt like I felt amazing and that's the way it really light it went you know I went on from there\nYou're listening to Stephanie she's in recovery bitter recovery now you said for Nineteen months yes now these are going well you got your driver's license got a car you've been rolled in beauty school yes now what would you like to do with yourself a dream is\nTo you know be able to help women this company and broken off the streets I mailed to help like lift them up and just you know 'cause I always I was confused on how it can make that light where it was helping people but I can use you know what I learned a beauty school to help women recovery and women in general\nYou've been a recovery Nineteen months Stephanie what was the personal economic the employment and emotional costs of substance abuse for you\nUm everything it Rob me of everything um I couldn't work you know I lost friends\nIs okay\nFor them [laughter] and I remember my friend had overdosed her mom\nIs the one that brought me to treatment and she said to me was I Wonder is this the place that could have saved my daughter's life and that's what really aspire made so I stay with it because I was dying\nYou know I was like Diane and I'm just losing friends you know it was just like a wake up call\nThe losing the friends help you choose a path toward sobriety what else\nI had been shot with a twelve gauge shotgun trying to Rob somebody to get high and you know at the time I didn't really it didn't really like make me Waco\nTrying to Rob somebody to get high and you know at that time I didn't really it didn't really like\nMake me Waco but looking back you know I mean it was like die like I have a purpose like I'm Still here you know I have a way like I got shot in LA like I can still walk and I'm not there with a shotgun I got shot with\nYou know and I just my mom's husband like he raped me and stuff and she's still stay with you know so I just know that like I Know my story can help people\nBecause of all that you know I never would have thought that I Would get better and light as of today you know I can stand in front of a larger groups and I can hold my head high and I can say to people I did it and you can sue\nOh Stephanie ... you have a story to tell and it's so brave of you to be telling this story the train a foster with Fulton County the director of behavioral health you're a licensed professional counselor when you hear stories such as Stephanie's\nI'm sure you have to treat it with kid gloves you have to be very compassionate but how often is it that we hear these kinds of stories\nSo when you hear these types of stories it actually makes me excited because I began to think\nHere we have another person that will help him pull someone else out of addiction because up here is the best support that you can have out of addiction because this person can share with you I've been where you are I recognize that you have experienced some trauma in your life\nThis addiction that you have is not going to take away that pain that you're experiencing\nBut let me help you through the process and I applaud Stephanie because she is doing this with her life experience helping other people and that's what it's about reaching back in helping someone else through the process so we do not lose another individual\nFrom an overdose dino when you hear stories such as Stephanie and everyone you know as a mom whose son was in prison he's in recovery been a recovery for years he's thirty two now when you hear stories such as Stephanie's and what she went through what do you say\nOh I say it just takes so much courage and I'm proud of her and those who fight every day to to stay clean and sober\nIt's a challenging a prospect to think about for the rest of your life but the alternatives just aren't good I've been to five funerals of beautiful young men\nWho lost their whole future through this disease ... it's not it's not it's not anything you would wish upon anybody but the hope and the joy on the other side when you see someone like her fighting through it and helping others is is just extremely rewarding\nAnd when you go to the funerals what do you think when you look at your son who you're with us\nEvery day is a gift every time I get to speak with him is a gift every meal we have together is a gift\nDina the mother of a son who is in recovery he started out with alcohol and it progressed from there do you tell me how important was at educating yourself on the substance abuse problems that your son was encountering\nWas extremely important as a family member um I was fortunate not to have those same issues as your mother did but um it was extremely important for me to understand certain things were happening within the brain chemistry that were driving certain of the behaviors\nDenial is a big piece of it and at times dishonesty is a huge piece of it what you know\nStreet that were driving certain of the behaviors denial is a big piece of it and at times dishonesty is a huge piece of it\nWhat you know now if you knew it than anything you do different\nYou know one thing I Would put to the side is the guilt\nMy guilt is a mother did not do me any good a second thing I Would do would be to share my story earlier I'm In the process um so I could reach out and and be of assistant to others did you seek support from others absolutely\nI uh there are number support groups in addition to the the addict support groups whether it's a are in a there are parents and family members support groups including families anonymous Al Anon and ... and on I I engaged in those and they're free\nWhy not spend the time to get hopes and recovery in and support from other families\nBack to Stephanie now the young woman who started to smoking marijuana innocent enough I guess at age twelve ... you know but then it progressed\nAnd by age Seventeen full blown addiction if you've been in recovery now for Nineteen month making your life better because you're driven to do that you talked about everything that you've been through\nBeing raped being abandoned being shot losing friends Stephanie how Stephanie what would you tell those who are

accomplish very young Mitt Sophia welcome to the show they knew [laughter] we're talking about a very unique\nOpportunity that your organization provides ... one thing that you really need to it was because you guys are focused on going deep into el GDP community helping people deal with issues that a lot of people don't like them out introduce yourself and tell us who you are and how you all became involved with this organization will start with Eugene\nOkay so again my name is ... co founder of his intimate foundation alongside my husband wants malls and really the ... started because we were passionate about\nUm affecting those that look like us so they don't they have to experience the same issues we did growing up so I experienced a lot of issues with my sexuality just kind of figuring that out what does that really mean for me in in a society there's not very ah forgiving of anything that is not the norm\nUm you tend to suppress those things so that took me down a path of a lot of decisions that affected my life in ways that you know shouldn't have and so now that I'm On the other side I'm I'm very passionate about reaching people with the same story or the or the same um life that I have in the may be helping them to make that decision\nHi my name is run over as I'm best known as the public relations director for Atlanta black pride I'm also a really great friends who gee smiles over here or what the gentleman foundation I've helped with therapy are marketing for several years now and I'm I'm just happy to be here\nI Would say work in general what the hell to ... community is important to me because I'm a strong believer that love wins whatever that looks like wherever you live wherever you are I'm I'm a lover of love and I'm a lot of people and I've definitely been a a affected by the work than the Germans foundation has been doing\nOver the years I'm also a former ... from the gentleman's ball like I said I Love people and I love to see people reach their full potential I Love\nAnd I love that I've come to a place in my life now that I fully understand who I Am not perfect and I definitely have a journey to go but I I Love being able to empower young people who also find and discover who they are and know that they can be all that got called him to be\nThat's amazing and the one and only missed Sophia tell us how important this organization is to you\nWell I met G and won a while back and they were part of another organization that are a part of that is to learn and so it's been like one years I Would want a gene that will want to gene a step away and they're doing their own thing so then they start doing the gentleman's ... hours a day and I found out what the generals ball was and\nIt has grown and grown and grown and I'm telling you you know I'm so proud of them and then that the the work that they are doing and one of my thing is is is I Want to be a positive image for our community and that's the same thing that they want they want positive envy just for our community and they say if you don't see that there you have to be calm down where I\nAm honored to be honored by the gentleman's ball being positive images and just doing positive things in the community is y G and more of your what they're doing and why\nI Try to be a positive image while I'm In the limelight and swear that you see\nWhy why on earth and Joanna that's\nBeing honored because why missile fear is I'm a great character that we love at the core evidence Joe Taylor who is doing all of this work\nAnd and I like to just to piggyback on that word for it and she just said a many years ago I had the opportunity to do the missile field alive I was new to Atlanta and I went to the Monday Night ... had no idea what I was doing but all I Know is that missile fear performed a gospel number\nAnd I understood that God can still love me even though I'm gay thank you for that I'll never forget that that's why the work we are doing is important and that's why the gentleman's ball the gentleman's foundation is important and that's why shows like this are important\nThat's why the foundation actually started was because of the gentleman's ball back and twenty eleven after my husband and I got married after being in a closet for so long after being married to my ex wife in being on the DL an incoming on the other side of that and now I'm being married to a man I was very\nWe're very proud of that love and there wasn't very many images amend that look like us in the media\nAnd so we said let's have a second chance prom so people that\nWeren't on a you know out of the closet in high school have a second chance to go with and be proud of the closet were outstanding individuals we are productive citizens in society we are not just a stereotype that you see on TV or whatever the case may be so that's why the gentleman's ball was born in from the organically it turned into the foundation\nI Do believe we are at a cost if you will but I Believe we are the costs with a lot of things in America right now [laughter] you know it's all really coming to a head which is a great thing because in order to change you had to become really really uncomfortable I mean when you look back during a time where\nYou know it was it's legal for same sex to get married that's huge huge is huge and so when you look back at history for ten ... ten years from now we're going to see\nHow big is really is we have to become uncomfortable\nNow come into the uh I Know gee talked about the struggles that he's had coming out\nAnd some of the things he said to take him another twenty six year even just to get to a better place from where he's he's building upon now ... you're a large personality everybody knows you do you see even as popular and if she does your platform is do you still experienced bullying\nI don't want experienced bullying and the way that are structured anybody has ever attended one of my shows I cut people ... and the reason that my talk is so deadly is because this was my\nThis was my way of striking back at people who are having me so I had ... years and years of experience at attacking people who attacked me so is it ... off the bully I don't have to worry about stuff like that because they are in a does not want you want to mess rare\nBut I mean even just when you're outside when you're living your everyday life right you know you and your partner walking down the street do you experience that even seal\nYes but you know what the thing about me is what I Try to get a lot of people are all the people to understand is\nYou are what you ask them to ... and when somebody that again you are what you ask for two and I could be walking down the streets in mind it might be in a mall or at a grocery store in a restaurant and somebody say something out of the way to me\nI don't respond because they are speaking to what they don't know\nAnd then it's just like if you respond you're giving them exactly what they want but the the the things that they're calling me if I answer to that and that means that I feel like I Am those things you bothered yeah but you know you just I always tell people I'm\nNot going to make somebody else's problem my problem because I have my own problems and I'm not gonna waste time\nTrying to convince somebody that what they're saying about me is wrong yeah\nWell tell us your experience you hadn't spoken much about it tell us about how you feel I Know missiles the A. N. G. has expressed their their the way that they've dealt with bullying and there are a lot have you ever experienced in how you how did you deal with it\nI definitely went through bullying in high school and middle school as well\nYou know I kind of knew at an early age what I wanted to do are my favorite singers brandy and I grew up listening to windy Williams in Russia are and I knew that I wanted to be in communications I knew that I was I thought I was gonna be entertainers at one point but I knew that I was going to be an entertainment period so although I was bullied I just\nI just had my eye on the prize my own the dream I didn't let it gets me I don't think I necessarily internalized that bad or I never had thoughts of suicide and depression over that\nI I just I really knew what I wanted to do and I didn't let anybody or anything to turn me from that and that just kind of road we all the way through I graduated\nIn being an adult because I pretty much surround myself with positive people like Mississippi I enjoy the people that are like minded you know I don't have to deal with that because everybody that is on my team is focused and going where I'm going or the greater to me\nWell you know it's interesting because when you say like minded people positive people\nThose are the attributes for any positive environment and yeah regardless if you're gay straight and whatever and I think that it's important that programs that you offer a new organization really do give people that understand it doesn't matter who you are ... love\nLove is love and you know positivity is the core and love is the core that\nCan out Sean any type of hey absolutely now the next program that you have that um that I think this is a huge is men with HIV men with HIV uh-huh I Know there are a lot of programs in Atlanta that help men with HIV how does your program to help them\nWell we have to recognize that you know men liberal into HIV are dealing with a set of issues that we just don't and so we have a a therapist that is also living with HIV and he's specializes with counseling with men with HIV and so\nAfter ... let's say after after a man contracts HIV\nThere's a whole nother coming out process that you have to do with that there's a whole nother level of being comfortable with that especially with the stigma\nThat is attached to living with HIV and that's one of the things that we focus on as well is releasing the stigma um and I think what one of the ways in which you do that is again showing those positive images of men that are thriving that are living with HIV and so I think that's one of the things that make\nA our group different is that there is no secret behind it this is a thriving group of men that just happened to be living with HIV\nI Know some groups um helped me learn more about preventive medicine like perhaps a little bit of our ...\nAbsolutely so prep is actually a bill that you take once a day that prevents HIV is Ninety nine point nine percent effective in preventing HIV so these programs out there available to receive those medications and you live alone time you come back and your tests undetectable so that's a status\nPositive undetectable yes I'm HIV positive but I'm undid undetectable you taking them I Can't pass it on\nIf you're on your magic can't pass HIV on a lot of people don't know that because they just have a lack of education\nEven with unprotected sex even went unprotected sex I mean if you're undetectable you're controlling\nYour immune system you cannot there is a very small chance you can pass HIV on most of the people who passed HIV do not know their status and they are not on that do you offer free HIV screenings we'd offer were for our services yes so we were we have plenty of um\nI'm a relationship with the community based organizations we don't do testing ourselves because we focus more on the menu but we have relationships we for for for people and we also do advanced we have HIV testing we also do um life forms we discuss prep in all of these HIV prevention and treatment options\nSo when we talk about your program which is specifically for black men mhm if I was a black male and I was in El GDP community how can I be a part of your organization to register online then how does how does one get involved with some of the programs\nAll of that so uh if you want to be involved in any of our program is the gentleman's foundation dot org and aside from the mental health groups we just talked about are we also have a scholarship program I'm In a scholarship program is welcome to anybody pursuing post high school education it doesn't matter if it's college\nDoesn't matter if it's real estate school doesn't matter if it's causing policy school

... ball weekend that's coming up on October fifty seven\nAnd we will start that out on friday\nA without welcome receptionist scholarship ceremony the Saturday morning we will have an empowerment series this year's theme is unapologetically black\nWe thought it was important to remind the community\nThere were black first before the elder GDP to see where black first and all the time sitting at the intersection of black and eligibility we get lost re marginalized sometimes in the black community we go into the ... community it's ... it's white mainstream community so we're marginalized even further so that empowerment series Saturday morning\nIs going to empower everybody to show up unapologetically black wherever they go\nAnd we're going to be discussing religion and spirituality

more of a conference oh it is they are the roads every\nYear and it really is a weekend of empowerment an affirmation\nSo one thing you talked about is you're going to be talking about spirituality religion yes when you talk about religion and being gay it seems that that is a huge controversy specially in our community ... you know if someone was to ask you doesn't God love gay black man when we tell them\nYes [laughter] God of\nEverybody black gay man however you identify God loves you\nUm ... we can move in places with that Dona from us and so it's all about moving and loving spaces that

that\nDo ah Fridays event is free anybody can show up Saturday mornings also for anybody can show up if you want tickets to the gentleman's ball or the brunch that's the next day if the gentleman foundation dot org\nThe United way provided initial funding to renovate that house to serve homeless families and St Nicholas is the patron saint of children bear in mind that over Seventy percent of the children that Nicholas how servers are children\nSo we took the name Nicholas and the fact that that house had been donated and we became Nicholas house now we're no longer affiliated with the church where our own five oh one C. three\nBut uh we are available and accessible to all members of the community that are homeless that need our assistance that's amazing thirty six year yes\nThat's a long time yes for helping people yes one thing when I think of a homeless shelter I guess I have this idea that is just one huge room they have pots they have a kitchen you go and you get your food and you know and then that that they sleep the night and then they go and they release them you know the release the next day\nBut that's not the case with Nicholas house Nicolas house can't possibly have just one huge room they have to have I'm sure separate quarters for almost yeah give us a visual of what what what you're a homeless shelter looks like OK and let me\nUp and mentioned Amanda that a lot of people as they're out and about as part of their daily lives don't see many homeless families\nAnd the families together and the reason for that is that a number of them sleep in their cars and often times this is by preference because they're afraid of going into that open setting shelter\nWith their children are put at risk and any remaining belongings that they have are put at risk also now at Nicholas house this house a has the capacity to us is fifty people on any given night and\nEveryone has their own room and the flexibility to come and go uh as they please with a few restrictions and rules there of course but there is that flexibility of having that own space that they can connect to and for the moment consider as their own\nThere's also a an after school program that's also available on site\nAt Nicholas house so his parents are going to work or looking for work to better their lives there's an opportunity to resist removed that ends id avoidable my child be well I'm looking for work or it will they be in a safe environment we take away that fear for a lot of families\nBy providing you services on site also at the house there's an adult education room where adults can go in and\nUh participate twice a week Tuesdays and Thursdays typically and various uh uplifting and inspiring workshops that help empower them and also help improve their market of ability as they're going back into the workforce\nSo that could cover everything from interviewing skills resume writing we also conduct a computer classes\nAs part of adult education parenting classes many families are looking to continue their education we work with them regarding a path to that\nEverything from GED to a undergraduate studies and then some many are connected to trade of workshops and other resources that are available through Nicholas house also in the space there are several common areas there's the dining hall we encourage families to eat together\nSo every family has an assigned space that a coincides with their room number\nAnd they're able to sit down and have meals together as a family we have a commercial kitchen where they can actually go in prepare meals for their family if they like but we also have a pool of over two thousand\nVolunteers that work with us to provide meals to the family every single night we have a about three months we booked up about three months in advance now of volunteers that are actually coming in to Nicholas house and serving meals to\nThe family if you say booked up yes yeah you have booked up do you know difficult that is a non profit to cover all the volunteers for a day with your book volunteers for three months yes that's ... that's ... amazing\nSo I I I'm sitting here flabbergasted when you were talking about all of the different services that you offer because\nWhen I think of homeless shelter I think of shelter and that's what you're providing shelter and food but Nicholas house it goes over and beyond and a city where they've closed down homeless shelters in the city which has caused more people to live on the streets hounded Nicholas how survive one\nReasons why Nicholas house was able to survive is it's close connection with community partners we have fabulous of volunteers that have been with us the average volunteer a violent chip is with us for a minimum of ten years we have people on uh\nWe have people on our board that have served with us for Seventeen we have one lady that comes every Monday and has done for over twenty seven years\nSo partners like that volunteers like that have provided the initial resources and tools needed to sustain our operations and to ensure that our programs are available and accessible to the community we've been also fortunate to work with the city of Atlanta\nA Fulton County as well as to cap county to help sustain valuable operations in various communities that make up those areas as well we've been very fortunate but I Will say that it's really come on at the hands of individuals like you and I\nThat want to become involved and remain involved long term\nWhen we talk about homeless and when we talk about long term these I read a report recently that said that the land a homeless population has dropped at least thirty percent but it's still they still have concerns about it is true\nThat it has slightly dropped the the homeless population in general has dropped but what we're seeing is an increase in homeless families for example in DeKalb County the population of homelessness fifty one percent are homeless families\nIn DeKalb County a hunter a that's forty one percent so at a I'm Sorry I have it backwards that's the cap county fifty one percent Fulton County forty seven percent and those numbers are staggering and that's the entire population of homeless people\nAnd when you look at that entire population to know that that many are families that are homeless it's staggering so our work continues our goal is to ensure that family homelessness is rare\nBrief and non recurring by twenty twenty we know that that's an aggressive goal we know that that's a huge undertaking but we want to ensure that families or any brief state\nOf homelessness we want to make sure that they're not really occurring into crisis mode again and want to make sure that we're as affected as possible\nAnd I think that that is important to know because even though it says that is slightly dropping limit still writes number for for the neediest city in regards to homelessness in America so we we most certainly do have an issue in a problem here in our in our state as well as in our city\nWhen are we talk about homelessness I think a lot of people\nDon't really\nConnect to the journey which and in actuality I Know one of your volunteers is on the freaking one morning show today and I heard her say that anybody could be homeless we're just one paycheck away yeah and that is so true\nOne issue that comes up is in regards to children is school mhm so when a family has some some unfortunate incidents that occur in their lives\nThey can't afford their home anymore they're a victim that they are living in their car they go to your shelter and they have children that are still in school [laughter] I I've heard people say that they can't use the address when it comes to the homeless shelter I Know some children have been\nDenied access to education because they don't have a permanent address can do is their services that they can use their to give them a permanent address to the children can continue their education\nYes yes um well ah families are in our shelter they actually use our address that's their um by law if a family is homeless and they want to keep their children in the same school zone they must have that opportunity however it's ...\nClick hated if transportation or is not available or if it creates such a toll on the family to get up hours in advance to go back to that original a school system so what we're saying uh at Nicholas house is it many of the families that were able to place in housing actually\nStay in the zone or Nicholas house is not only do we have great schools but it provides the consistency and the uh the the uh required um\nUh just consistency that children need a that security for them and knowing that they can meet friends and establish those relationships and perform well academically because they're gonna be there they're going to be stable they're going to be secure in that spot until the family is able to move or transition\nTo another point and usually we usually counseling advise them to at least allow them to transition out of that particular\nA phase of schools that they're in for example if it's K. through five at least until they're", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "07"}
