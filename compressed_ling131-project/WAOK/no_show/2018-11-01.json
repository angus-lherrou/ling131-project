W E okay\nWith the New Georgia project\nThat's correct I'm share the board of the New Georgia project founded a just a few years ago and since two thousand fourteen we've registered three hundred thousand about three hundred thousand new voters and uh so we have seen this fight\nWith secretary kept 'em unfold before our very eyes we've been engaged in this work for a long time or he is a most adept architect or an shameless practitioner voter suppression\nOr so we've been engaging him you know we filed a lawsuit the rights to the secretary of state as he is a has placed fifty three thousand Georgia voters who are simply trying to exercise their constitutional right to vote a on a pending status be clear this is a game\nThat he is playing um is classic voter suppression the effort is to shave\nSome votes ears shave some votes there\nOr he is both a player on the field running for promotion and serving as part of the game you really ought to resign or in order to uh assured the voters of Georgia that there really is integrity in this process\nI looked at some numbers last night and this is actually on the eleven o'clock news but I looked at some numbers last night myself in a Mike Dunn than\nAnd that we were able to analyze\nA few counties that the New Georgia project had a very strong influence in the camp county\nFulton County counties where you had strong minority representation in population but not\nAs much in the voter registering the camp can and give an example of some numbers here this time in the previous election cycle for governor at this very time early voting DeKalb County was at around forty five thousand people\nToday it is\nAlmost one hundred thousand people that's right okay I Believe that is by direct effort\nOf voter registration from organizations like New Georgia project\nAnd also the dogmatic follow up the organization you chair engaged in because it wasn't that you are engaged voters you actually followed them through the entire process that's why you know who didn't make the roads\nAre this right or and their science around the correct where it clear that uh if if you touch people about eight times they're likely to show up at the polls so our message is very clear not only in the cycle but in the next\nVoter education people need to understand issues understand what's at stake when people think they're allowed at stake they show up to vote education registration\nVerification because they're purging people from the rolls and often they don't even know it and then mobilization we've got to do all of those things education registration mobilization verification all of those things have happened that's been our work for the last four years and uh I think we're seeing the results of it or we're trying to\nRation mobilization verification all of those things have happened that's been our work\nFor the last four years and uh I think we're seeing the results of it or we're trying to raise what we see as the the new emerging American electorate an electorate that reflects the wonderful rainbow diversity of our nation and increasingly of this state\nAnd I think that there's some folks who see that tired rolling or something as a blue wave but I I see a rainbow wave emerging I see\nPeople of all races and ah backgrounds as a young people emerging listen to the king understood this and and way back in Nineteen fifty seven people think about the the speech that he gave at the Lincoln Memorial in Nineteen sixty three\nI Would encourage your listeners to go back and read without the king said in Nineteen fifty seven standing in the same place in front of the Lincoln Memorial he gave a speech called give us the ballot\nAnd he said if you give us the ballot we will elect governors in southern states who have not only felt the pain of the human but the glow of the divide that we would address lynching and all of these issues if you give us the ballot at twenty eight year old Martin Luther King junior\nJust twenty eight years old understood in Nineteen fifty seven that\nA diverse electorate has public policy implications so this this election is not just about as we as we register voters of color is really not about ... about complex and it's about direction that if we create a more diverse electorate I think will come up with much more common sense public policy\nThat creates living wages for workers give seniors security and helps us to build a tenth as large enough all of our children\nWe got on the other side I have doctor ward knock in the building share of New Georgia project they have registered hundreds of thousands of voters as an organization that's verified they had been in the back and forth\nWith the secretary of state Brian Kemp who happens to be the gubernatorial nominee on the Republican side for governor\nHere's what I Know Brian Kemp understands he understands that this election will be very close\nAnd he had utilizing every advantage he
