I'm calling about the liberal oh ... years like New York Times CBS News World report and CBS Radio and all those off a fine of ...\nI got your Andy I'm rooting for ... I'm ruining for you and to have a point\nWell actually what I was calling about what's something that disturbed me yesterday that you said about academic freedom and I sort of a um put that out of context about the ... professor Garnett Clinton state college I wasn't able to get through you're\nLike okay so what did that take out of context let me give some background to the store for those who may not have been listening yesterday I basically there was a professor and Clinton State University who decided to give her students extra credit if they attended a political rally this political rally\nWas for\nStacey Abrams the Democratic nominee for governor this was also something that took place at Liberty University when Trump was running for president when he was a candidate\nA students went and attend to his rally and some professors did give extra credit for them attending that rally and architecture lives all of that under academic freedom something that is sacred inside of the classroom it is a glimpse\nAn up close and personal glimpse of democracy and you may disagree with the politics of it but this is real life and its\nUp close and personal glimpse of democracy and you may disagree with the politics of it but this is real life and it's how it works go ahead and where where am I wrong it\nCovers ... well when I don't care off a liberty office Clayton stayed a fifth so if\nYou do you think it was wrong for Liberty University June few Paul well why do you call my show and talk about it\nWell because if you pull that science\nBut when when it happened with liberty Andy Andy on the outside looking\nHandy when it happened at Liberty University you did not call my show and you did not raise issue now than it has happened at Clinton's on diversity like\nYou said yesterday you didn't talk you talked about it\nNo I didn't bring it up on that surf Loch absolutely Andy I absolutely brought up the liberty university thing I don't know what he brought it up\nI I miss that shows but but here here's the point I'm not going to go to Dennis ... went to dental school he got extra credit he he was given a grave costs us ... up or at least somewhere political\nHave let me have your understanding of extra credit is so wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute Andy Andy you're conflated issues that do not coexist let's talk about it yes you off just how long have you been a professor\nI'm not a ... I I actually am I Know and that was kind of saying\nLet's talk about X. rated hello sir that sounded like extra credit or hip ugly typically you'd never give more than two points extra credit\nSo let's say if a student has an eighty nine well the eighty nine becomes a Ninety One so that the plus becomes an a minus\nOkay so you're talking about two points want to find a great there are some that give what's called assignment extra credit for additional effort\nSo for example if there was a final exam worth a forty percent of fifty percent of your final great and you could get an extra five points on that exam well that doesn't move the needle very far when you look at the total calculation of the final greatest called a Rubik's and which we grade my Rubik's\nSo if it if two points if you're saying two points one way or the other will cause you to go to a dentist and not go to a dentist Vince or you're not living in the real world I understand that socialization\nCollege students will pass by socialization an Ivy League institutions more so than any of the institution that means based on their status and the personal relationship with the professor and the university at large they are socialized through the academic studies more so than any other institution and the United states of America Ivy League institutions\nHave that going no more so than anybody else did you know that\nHey you're shutting down I don't have any like ivy Ivy League institutions again\nBut I've never heard you call the show and question the so I've never heard you called the short question any credential of anybody in the I Believe no go ahead and talk about your life\nYeah your I I guarantee you down if you're a high to the doctor ministry or ... or a masters in business a of a bachelor's in religious study they're not going to be letting students out the door just giving them great\nNobody does that what they're nobody's going to say that's not what was being done a great State University in that regard but sorry that was not being done hold on wait a minute I think that was not being done at Clinton said university no institution of higher learning that's worth their weight would do that anyway\nWell I Hope not but that's her she's getting an extra credit was something I didn't have anything to occur criminal just\nRadio I don't understand how it had the at the time we gave him all the time you know we never got involved in that if I can\nHappen African Americans and the lack of [noise] people seem to be with us when you didn't tell me that none of\nThat not everybody told what to tell you when you don't want to say let me find out something they don't know\n[laughter] but you ... to compliment you put your father figure to listen to a Julia did post that interview late where you could hear for yourself what these guys are saying about yours truly that is on the face of aging and you can also vote the\nThe interview leave where you could hear for yourself what these guys are saying about yours truly is on the Facebook page and you can also votes delicious there was well on the Facebook page I got to be hard to move the broad who I'm sure you vote for me\nUm I really don't vote on hold but I Do think you're a legitimate news station and I I I think you're very fair to take all different kinds of callers thank you I appreciate that Tea Party Lou go here\nYou are talking about climate change stuff and if we're gonna make it is that you know we hear a lot of different things there's a lot of propaganda out there and I want to just point out um there was a Wall Street journal opinion journalism video journalists you can actually hear the interview\nWas posted on a April twenty first at twenty Seventeen and at eight thirty nine in the morning and it was by Steve could and he was a former Energy Department under secretary under brought up on up from two thousand nine to two thousand eleven\nWhen they were trying to pass cap and trade\nAnd it was about how government twists climate statistics and he was talking about no one asked them basically how they put out propaganda just like Exxon Mobil might or anybody else\nSo you know if you want us to believe and buy into this\nUm you're gonna have to show us facts and there's a whole lot of stuff that counteract\nWhat the propaganda is out there about how we're changing the climate and back when I was in so I'm In my fifties when I was in school in the seventies we were going into an ice age we were going to they're going to collect all the ... from the smokestacks and spend it on the glaciers then Thirteen Years later we're going to burn up the planet I mean it's kinda hard to to buy into the propaganda\nAnd um you know so if you want us to buy into we're going to burn up the planet then you'd better give us fat and give us science\nAre well that's what they are given Tea Party move you guys just had learned sign\nWhy aren't you listen to the interview and you can play it it's actually on video but there's a there's been a whole lot of\nThere's always conflicting interpretations of the data but no one disagrees hold on wait a minute you brought a little no one disagrees then when we put taxes in the environment it makes the environment toxic nobody disagrees on that the only disagreement\nIs the issue of global warming\nAnd the and the issue of temperature rising some people believe\nThat it is a natural phenomenon with the earth actually oscillates goes back and forth as people believe that it is contributed by the uh by human involvement so that is the interpretation difference not the other stuff we all know if you put a poison in something that's something that's poisonous we know that\nWas something that we actually are desert and stuff or green or with increased the o two there's benefits to it as well All right but what you talked about ExxonMobil has altered your motives so does the government when they when they were trying to pass cap and trade back and and two thousand nine or do\nWe know that if he bought a little I Would love to have this conversation which we prefer that but I have got to roll will help her get to Mars you brought a little research go All right here's a second part of the interview with Bill Campbell\nPiece\nWhen I heard the ... ... ... agents were involved are there are issues at city hall but when you say eight agents are involved in a criminal investigation\nBecause of an open letter to really get to where I was in in the time I had never heard of anything like that in my life and what what I was shocked about Mr Mayor is how many people to accept that that narrative normal\nThere were a lot of people who said yeah will they didn't give the records I Know they never do governments many times have an adversary and when I was ... and that's why\nWhen you talk when you hear on the panel in this year will remind ministry right they act like\nSarah ... and that's why when you talk when you hear on the panel and they skip over my minister ration right they act like those eight years didn't exist in by the way\nBlack folks love those eight years you know the great a lot of white people love them too because\nThe city ran well it was prosperous we added people we pastry rebuilt new devices and new but still these are we reduce the crime rate we open up new recreation but we did a lot of great things and we had with the natural integrity all this kind of thing and so it was interesting\nWhen you go out to the airport right go out to the airport\nAnd go through all kinds of course I think it's easy to be\nAnd they have this wonderful thing about the history of that land right and\nMy eight years or even in it so I didn't exist right they've got\nYou know rubber a good way to you know Coca Cola and this and that but no one of the\nSix African American mayors it is not even a present there and so it tells you that some black people buying the same narrative and that and that's why I circle around and tell you my friend\nThat you cannot let older people write your history for you and I and so people asked a reporter asked why was out here today and I said because I\nBelieve that this audience hear your height and there's a narrator\nUnderstand that history should be told by those ... and and those who understand\nIt and those who believe\nThat's a very good point a to compound on that to compound on that\nI get the great opportunity because of a guy named Maynard Eaton who is a professor in the mass calm department at Clark Atlanta University and I get is a great opportunity to guest lecture these mass calm students and many of the most of the searching\nFor what they want to do some of them want to do print some of them would like to do on their some of them elected in television\nAnd I said regardless of what you want to do\nUnderstand that when you write something when you put something out fifty years from that day a hundred years from that day somebody in that prison arrow\nWill read when you put out were revue when you put out and that will provide the context of history for them joins Thirteen eighty W bilking enjoyed pretty

at the same time\nYou'll never get used to that you know just trust me you just you know it is what did you learn to back road though ... been born and raised here we can tell you a few ways learning learning do they go\nBut we have a we have some uh services were when you stop and think about it or insurance companies or you can't you don't run home to look at the newspaper to see what insurance companies are doing you know you look at other things but a care sources one of those insurance or insurance companies that we offer\nA multitude of services in addition to providing health care or to the population and what we learned when we came to Georgia was that a forty percent of the individuals in the state of Georgia for a eligible for Medicaid or they have not graduate from high school\nSo we start a way as part of the programs that we put together a in addition to providing health care coverage\nOr we provide assistance rented vigils to get their GED or we also have what we call our life services program whereby we attempt to remove the barriers that the typical medicate person has to deal with on a day to day basis so the concept is that\nIf we remove those barriers that they have to deal with on a day to day basis they're more apt to go and receive a medical care take care of themselves\nSo you and I might think about where we want to go to dinner [noise] um but the Medicaid person they aren't thinking about where to go to dinner they're worried about will they get dinner at all so we try to make the you know remove those barriers so that those individuals can focus on their their health\nI got to take a quick break won't come back we'll continue our conversation with Bobby Jones he is the president of the Georgia market for care source a Medicaid ... are eligible for a provider of services\nAnd um won't come back by the tell us what\nYou're telling us some of the soft skills\nServices are that are not necessarily mandated right a debt you provide but you saw a need and you're trying to step into the vacuum of that need when we come back we want you to also tell us what make you uniquely in addition to these services what make you knew you look at a different\nWhy should people choose care source they got a menu of providers what makes you stand head and shoulders above the rest of that because people are listening\nAnd uh and uh do you all have a ... is its own open enrollment period 'cause you that started to November's of rolling in Rome and I are rolling rolling I so they listening today and said look I if I Want to switch\nWill come back once you talk a little bit about that if people say look after hearing the services you provide how do I switch phones here and we want you to tell them how to do that to fall for eight nine to two seven zero three we not not only want you to be healthy we want you to overcome some great barriers education is a great equalizer\nAnd so I tell people all the time there's nothing wrong with not knowing how to read [noise]\nThey is something wrong with not wanting to know how to read the services provided G D services educational services\nAnd it's free you should take advantage of it job training ... job openings that you've been given opportunities pointed towards jobs you should take advantage of it for for a night to to seven zero three don't go into place they can stay with us it is too much room ... new top Thirteen AWAC okay\nThis is Danny Glover and you are listening to ... to ...\nFor for each to Tucson oak tree or news and talk Thirteen\nYour goals\nFor two to three dogs are you\nStill see a fluoride hitting through downtown after\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou listen to my guess lean mean much to talk to you\nFor two to three million dollars\n\n\n\nOr more how are you\n\nJust didn't know this is the more they [noise]\n[noise] I actually am a healthcare\nOkay so I pretty much all day long and I was absolutely the family and we love you bet\nSo I have pretty much in my car all day long and I just absolutely love the al ... family\nAnd we love you back you love us we love your bag now how really shield you know you just riding around getting it in and you listen to every day\nWell let's let the body than I Do he's talking about ... what the care toward a pretty much do what he or when I\nLook you know Bob as he however now you can get into where are you guys drive around you can drop on them\nAnd if you use ... laid out in the background\nI had I I look at look here you let me see your president President can associate right here so we're we're lazy and I was livid about ... you know I Do look I said well you're great tell the people that people bid on your tablet\nOr you know they're not as such they want to act out you know a lot that's quite All right how many down okay that\nI learned how to literally had to plug for a moment because we are truly living at a day which is absolutely crazy you know where the water dot told us that Taiwan calm when they will call\nEvoke good yeah they call an evil yup\nAnd I just when they put that Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court has said that that just didn't make him\nWell let me tell you this and I say the converse added that is the only thing it take for evil to exist is for good men and women to sit back and do nothing at all it is our job to resist\nIf you ... if you see something that's not going right or even the Kavanaugh hearing I'm so proud of them women who stopped the senator at a good or bad otherwise they're men had to stop for a minute to listen to the pain and anguish\nYeah and again I tell you all all the time now if your follows purely politics you going to be crazy as some of the ones up down here and so we have to realize politics have its proper place in our lives that politics is about public policy of not personalities\nIn the end of the day we have to all we have to advocate for a more sane and balance public policy there is no I'm In the in this very conversation we're having now\nOne man the governor at one time with the stroke of his pen could expand the Medicaid in six hundred thousand or not or genes I have been covered\nThat's right and in in in many of us got out of ... like the Dickens for that because we know that this very governor\nWhether that was a Democrat or Republican heavy card in his pocket they get home health care that is one hundred percent pay by the taxpayer better no so you got a card and your family got a card in their pocket that we're right in your health care\nYou could choose care source as a provider of those services whenever you and your date to renew comes up\nA ... degree newly on a rolling schedule\nAnd or if you've not been happy with the provision of serves or you've been happy to say look\nI Need some of these other things that other not providing your body's not providing you with a job readiness skills some of the soft skills\nUm because really um you know the goals should be look you want to get employed and you'd be at a job where they can provide you healthcare services four one K. and a bunch of other stuff that you're not getting it so\nI'm Bobby tell everybody what what makes you all his stand head and shoulders above others who provides similar services\nOr their great great a great question are we are care services a nonprofit are companies have been in business a Thirty Years'\nWas originally started by a hair Morris uh she was a social worker so wow when she put the company gather a she's obviously wasn't it was a good get a business person but when she put the company together she wants to make sure that we kept the member at the center of the universe so to speak\nFor every decision that we made as a company over the years ah you know we're sensitive to the needs of the members of every service\nSo when you think about our life services program um it's just that one of the components within like services are job connect from a touchstone women earlier\nBut our staff that are we in for these individuals and we paid for in life entire life services or ...\nThat's a little bit earlier or but our staff that uh we employ these individuals and we pay for in light entire life services are program out of our net income\nUh and the other people other companies that we compete against a they have to service a shareholders whereas we take the dollars that we make and put it back into the community and put it back into expanding services for the of the population that we serve\nI mean we have coaches a and a coach or let's say a person comes in to care source and they say that they want to take advantage of our life services ... they get a coach that cultural work with them a sense where they what's going on in their life or they\nNeed to go back to school to get their GED we all start the process to help them uh to to get a get that if they if they have a GED and they're looking for employment or we have a relationship with over with close to eighty companies\nOr some of which are fortune five hundred companies ... Georgia a whereby we developed a relationship with them to take those individuals that we is this and making them job ready\nOr to work with those companies and take advantage of positions so this is all part of our strategy again to remove the hurdles and most people what we found is that most people want to be independent yes um so we're just putting those putting vehicles out there to help them I gained independence\nTalk about a care source your doctor's your network um do your doctors work at a your facilities or they work at hospitals talk about the network of doctors that people get to select from when they come to\nCare source of what we did when we came to Georgia our goal is to take advantage of what's already in place a these members\nAre individuals the Georgians now I'm One of which now but the uh these individuals have had relationships with ah the facilities and doctors are over the years\nUh we've contracted with a every [noise] we have to hospitals left that were just finishing up the contract with them but we are contracts with every hospital in the state\nSo when you sign up with care source you don't have to worry about us driving you to to a facility or hospital or a doctor that's fifty miles away right now you can normally find a physician or that's within a few miles from home or a hospital that's a few miles from home\nSo I mean a above and beyond that I'm being able\nTo get these additional services there's no real gap or stop or shortage in terms of you being able to probably see brown and the same doctor Dr within the same um group practice that you're seeing now\nWhat we did when we came to Georgia we looked at uh the utilization patterns of ah we're individuals are going to see their physicians\nAnd that's where we focus we said if you already have a relationship with Dr Smith uh we went out to Dr Smith office and attempted to sign up a Dr Smith and so we did that throughout the state\nAnd in a matter of six months we were able to put a network together that was a on par with or better than some of the people that had been here for ten years\nUm providers they they like us are and what's what attracted them to us as the fact that we are a nonprofit so are you you're talking to a doctor and and um they're concerned well what are you going to do with the money that you make 'em what we're saying we're going to put it back in ... for the other population\nAgain because we don't have to send dollars to the shareholders of the other for profit companies that that that they do so because of our being a non profit organization and we were able to um uh develop\nThe other for profit companies are the things that they do so because of our being a non profit organization we were able to um uh develop a relationship with the providers are network a lot faster than I Would say that our competitors are that are comparable timeframe\nFor zero for eight nine to two seven zero three got take another quick right won't come back after I take this call from Scotty uh I'm with you to tell people the simplest way people want to know chair source I Want to familiarize myself\nThinking about changing or would

and in Georgia the craziest thing about\nA certain party not expanded Medicaid now we have hospitals closing down in the rural areas you got to drive all the way up here\nUm you know it it is

I'm originally from Michigan so don't hold that against no but I Do have a pizza on my driver's license now so I Am a resident of a George I live here\nAnd I'm getting used to the traffic but\nYou'll never get used to that you know just trust me you just you know you never know what it is it is what did you learn to back road though how does it have been born and raised here we can tell you a few ways learning learning do they go but we\nHave a we have some uh services work when you stop and think about it or insurance companies or you can't you don't run home to look at the newspaper to see what insurance companies are doing you know you look at other things but a care sources one of those insurance or insurance companies that we offer\nA multitude of services in addition to providing health care or to the population and what we learn when we came to Georgia was that a forty percent of the individuals in the state of Georgia for a eligible for Medicaid or they have not graduate from high school\nSo we start a way as part of the programs that we put together a in addition to providing health care coverage or we provide assistance for individuals to get their GED\nOr we also have what we call our life services program and whereby we attempt to\nRemove the barriers that the typical medicate person has to deal with on a day to day basis so the concept is that uh if we remove those barriers that they have to deal with on a day to day basis they're more apt to go and receive a medical care take care of themselves\nSo you and I might think about where we want to go to dinner [noise] um but the Medicaid person they aren't thinking about where to go to dinner they're worried about will they get dinner at all so we try to make the you know remove those barriers so that those individuals can focus on their their health\nI got to take a break and come back we'll continue our conversation with Bobby Jones he is the president of the Georgia market for care source a

you were watching the fights\nI don't remember exactly what the numbers were for pay per view but I Believe it was upwards of two million so there are a lot of people data why was thrilled I'm sure with a number of people who tuned in for what\nThe main event between ... and ... except after the fight was over and after Connor had tapped out there was extra curricular activity that the Nevada athletic commission did not take kindly to and this goes back to a situation in New York\nWas earlier this year in which\nMembers O'Connor's team Connors crew\nThrough and Dolly at a bus and they were members of the ... crew that were injured they were the targets\nAnd so now retaliation in Las Vegas on Saturday once the fight with over ... climbed into bullet over the octagon and into the stands and some of his guys then came into the office he got an attacked counter\nI mean he literally got he got jumped from behind\nBut he also then climbed the octagon climbed the cage and that's a no no in the eyes of USC and the athletic commission so ultimately Connor got paid ... has not yet received his money for winning the fight and what we're finding out\nIs that they've both been temporarily suspended starting money starting Monday both Connor and could be ...\nHad been temporarily suspended by the Nevada athletic commission\nNow I Need to\nCould be ... had been temporarily suspended by

so they're suspended temporarily pending a hearing\nAnd I would not at all be surprised if there were sanctioned for at least can be I think what are you expecting since you were there in Las Vegas what are you expecting to come out of this\nUm they both need to be suspended severely maybe four or five months and uh I Hope there's not a rematch because this got really really disgusting with the

Corey climate was back and he had sixty nine total yards and to score and it definitely helps that the defense was able to get pressure on the giants and either force them into shorter\nDrives or keep them out of the end zone\nIt's after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio I an eagle with the calls on the Westwood One radio network so huge division victory for the eagles or what could be the turning point to their season I'm going to remember this I even wrote it down in my notes week sex turning point for the eagles\nQuestion more because it's the best they looked so\nFar this see them a with cars and ... with the often despite their losses they not only were able to protect their defense a secondary\nI'm ... but the defense then gave the ball right back to the office who was ready to go with it and it helps when you're playing with a lead on the road\nThat crowd inside metlife already subdued by a turnover that happened within the first couple of weeks weeks sorry first couple of minutes I don't know where they came up\nWith it in the first couple of minutes and so it it kind of lead to some confidence and a right away you feel like you've delivered the first blow and you want to build on that so that's a huge deal and Carson whites noted that after the game and\nDoug Peterson happy to talk about the success of his quarterback\nYou did and I show you a run in the office for a long way to go for making maybe she did she just life and there's you know and I'm grateful for the full game to get it and they have the guys relative to stepping up\nDefinitely was we saw Nelson Aguilar make a couple of catches that\nLooked like a higher degree of difficulty ah we always see uh what we get there on the the legal side from Zach earth's he's really reliable ... Jeffrey had a couple of touchdowns as well as nearly a hundred yards a window small would along with Cory climate and climate was back after a couple of weeks\nAway so it was a total team effort I'm Still hung up on the way the defense got to manning and the fact that they were able to hit him or knock him down twenty five percent of the giants snaps\nThat doesn't even count the pressure in which they actually uh we're close but didn't get him or where they forced the giants into a a player into something they didn't want to do often simply\nSo that's one game won divisional battle a and we're often running into week six and I'm Wondering because going into this game between the eagles and giants we talked about how both these teams are desperate for a win who else is most desperate for a win this week\nOn the NFL slate\nAnd it's easy to say the cardinals 'cause they only have one victory they last we just got off the ... and picked up there\nOf the ... and picked up their first when they're on the road at the Vikings um ... it's also easy to say\nTrying to think of who I I mean would have been easy to say the giants the falcons it's easy to say they're desperate for a wind but what about some of the other teams um who are kind of on the verge of either like the eagles turning this thing around or sinking farther back into pretender ville\nI Wonder if that's a real place somewhere in the United states it might be some crazy names of towns out there you can find me on Twitter\nAla radio while you're there vote for the game that you're most looking forward to this weekend is one of our most popular Twitter polls that we do and Facebook you're bloated up there to\nA and R I guess what we've got to change in the lead again so this is a game it's going back and forth between two heavyweights collide lettered and Peyton Manning with war I'm just told you collide Leonard and Peyton Manning what [laughter]\nWith one word he made me lab but it's just so ludicrous so you've got ... and his laugh that took the entire world by storm\n[laughter] I've never heard anything like it in my life [laughter] and then you've got\nPaintings atypical tribute to Drew Brees those are the two that are in front but they're not the only contenders you will hear them again a half hour from now on after\nHours if you want to cast your vote for the hall of fame as well you want to hear these samples you want to hear the candidates have their fun [laughter]\nRuin it for me [laughter]\nBut if you've already heard them\nWell go ahead and weigh in either on Twitter again a radio or our show Twitter and then also on our Facebook page after hours with Amy Lawrence burn [laughter]\nNo doubt CBS the super bowl season continues on Sunday was an awesome double header first you got that AFC North battle Pittsburgh colliding with Cincinnati and then it's the NFL's top defense\nThat does keep it in games [laughter] the Jacksonville Jaguars will head to Dallas to take on the cowboys they're desperate for a win for sure the day kicks off with the NFL today powered by ram trucks at twelve eastern nine am Pacific only on CBS\nEight five five to one to four to seven Tony is in West Virginia Welcome to after our CBS Sports radio\nMore them hey saw\nWhen you do a quick production for the ... and ... or ...

been to three consecutive and all the ad says\nThey don't want a World Series of the franchise has Nineteen eighty eight so they're out for redemption after last season of course the brewers have never won one in their franchise history it's after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio are really excited to spend a couple of minutes this morning with the J ...\nFormer big league pitcher who will be doing his own show at the top of the hour on MLD network radio you watch\nA little more the breakdown CJ thanks so much for a couple of minutes when you look at the starch or the starter I should say uh that ... kind of he didn't pitch it all in the division theory kind of thought that they would go with ... shot seen what do you think about his choice to make geo the game one\nYeah it's a little bit surprising I guess any time you go with your game one starter for potential seven game series there are thoughts about bringing guys back using guys on short rest and as far as how you on the line that up and yeah there's without a doubt\nUm some concerns with a guy had the pitch in a while right that's always a big one you worry about guys\nAre getting a little bit rusty how are they going to feel about being back from all that time off or what have you guys be a little bit too strong that's always a concern about I think in this case for credit counseled us was more about\nAh maybe matching up a little bit using a left handed starter against the Dodgers lined up because they could play matchups with you and they're not afraid to make their changes early and we also know that part of the brewers plan is they're going to rely heavily on their both and right and so it may be a situation where they're just hoping ...\nTo maybe get through that order two times\nKeep some of those low paid it back on the bench at least for the first half of the game and then ended over to your both by the game plan that if executed properly certainly could work well against the Dodgers\nAnd so far none of the starters have lasted longer than five innings ... per ... council just as someone who used to pitch in the big leagues what's your reaction\nAction to that and the fact that a quality start like what we got from the engine review and Clinton cursed shock and games wanting to for the Dodgers and the N O D s that's the rarity now we are in the\nWoods I Know it it it's a kind of a sad I guess time but I also get it to him in the name of the game is to win and if teams are ... are OK with it\nIn one of the funny quotes after I guess it was the wild card game when we Severino through four innings and after the gay marriage Rogers to post game interview and he had said it was like listen for innings out of your race is really all you can ask and I remember thinking wow yeah things have changed a little bit like this to say\nThis is a feeling now that his residency throughout the cover of they're actually looking at even their best stars and big situations and say listen they get four innings and five if you're lucky you'll take it and that's because when you have a boat and like the Yankees near the bullpen like\nOther Milwaukee Brewers and that's what your team is built on um an all this talk about face in order a third time through a everyone is starting to gain a boost to get the philosophy and is gaining a lot of traction and makes a lot of sense\nAnd I love watching Clinton car shop for eight innings I think we all still like seeing those games are the reality is they're going to be fewer and far between\nWell I'm Glad you brought him out because he generally had success against the birds and his career including at Miller Park by Christian yeah ledge is for insects against him with a couple of home runs this year and he's nine in Seventeen against him for his career what magazine yelling successful against Clayton\nSo you know what he does so well especially in this generation which is kind of nice we talked about getting the ball the a lot more and talk about launch angle I was left handed hitter first of all the power guy who added a ton of home runs this year in one of the lowest launch angles\nA in baseball so without you know some too nerdy or getting technical he just doesn't hit the ball high in the air like a lot of the hitters do these days\nAnd so think about left I left my job I was left handed pitcher and one of the things that I always wanted to know about the left handed hitters that I was facing I wanted to know if he could try if he had the ability to go opposite field especially early in the cat will be looking for something out over the place to maybe had a line drops of left field is he willing to do that\nSome left handed hitters as good as they weren't even some like say using ... told me as an example hall of fame hitter they may be looking to yank early pull early right turn and burn a little bit on you and so you felt like you have the outside part of the plate when you needed it ... not one of those guys it's a left on left to look for something out over the political and he can even drive it\nOr the other way and so for Clinton curse Shaw a he's a different kind of left the scene the ball well against him\nOr that nice level swing works against some of Clinton curse all strengths which is the curve ball in the slider and so that's likely the reason is that he stays in there really well against left these uh and is not pulling off the ball and those are the toughest left on left matchups a as a left handed pitcher when you get a guy who to command the

about to do a show on and I'll be network radio for now we've got 'em for a couple of minutes former big league pitcher and baseball analyst travels with the rangers that was part of their regular create what's after hours on CBS Sports radio so let's talk about asteroids and Red Sox\nI Am I'm fascinated to get your answer to this which pitching staff do you believe has the edge in that ALCOA as\nWell you know it's funny because it it comes down to for me ah who's bringing a game to the table now the ashes of already shown that with Justin Vernon lander and Guerra coal at the top it's just that's a really really difficult combination to beat\nThe question becomes for game one in game two ah with the red Sox is looks like Chris sales healthy there were some concerns there because at the end of the season the philosophy was way down and out scored said the whole time you find these fine it I'm like oh I Hope you find for you to believe he's still going Ninety miles an hour and he's a guy that we used to seeing sit you know Ninety six Ninety seven\nTo seeing sit you know Ninety six Ninety seven when he's had his full strength\nUm there might be something wrong he was perfectly fine he showed that so far out throughout the postseason that he is healthy that the good fastball velocities back but I think you'll always wonder in the back of your mind is is he a hundred percent okay he's proven that so far but I'm Still wondering what happened the last ... or the regular season start\nAs or anything that's bothering him um I think that'll be okay I think that question there'll be an easy one to answer the big one is David Price David prices we well knows the two hundred million dollar pitcher\nHe has just been awful in the postseason as a starter I mean there's no there's no better way to describe it we just have to be honest about it is made ten postseason starts he's only nine within the area over six starts and it just it hasn't happened now\nIt's interesting that he got the game to start quite honestly and then you start looking and you look at his numbers against the Astros over the last three years he's crush them he's done a really really well against the Houston Astros\nAnd the numbers get even better at Fenway the array overall I think it's somewhere around two for\nA infant away even lower than that it's up to uh get over the last three years he patrol against them this year so\nAspects of the publishing process for you bringing ... publicity copyright and editing go eat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine now for your free author

W E okay but I have a clip of Trump\nSaying I think he was interviewing with Sean Hannity or somebody on Fox News I remember Fox News on the safe place of all things begin to\nSo he was on Fox News\nAnd he was saying that Congress may has has great respect in the African American community he has a lot of followers in the black community and and this guy likes me that's the way it was basically saying so why was ... at the White House because according to Trump\n... have a lot of black followers well why does that matter right now because of a little something called the mid term election now he's oh blimp used to the fact that we've been\nBut continued the reserve category\nLike he's on the beach at the moment he's not really an active player on the court as it relates to the black community in that sense\nBut remember this is the same ... who went on national TV and said President George W. Bush doesn't like black people\nI Know people disagree with him doing that\nBut remember he was speaking to a collective frustration felt by many black folks who went through that hurricane and they felt as if they will be treated like second class citizen he created a personification in that moment of their electorate frustration and he was kind of gay\nAnd he did that and now look at tap dance for this president and not even when they're half French just really a fun\nFor the role for not due to seven zero three we got more\nWell I'll tell you first of all I like him a lot he's been a friend of mine I've known him for a long time is a very different kind of a guy I say that in a positive way but he is a different kind of a guy\nThat those that are in the music business Asian genius and that's okay with me because as far as I'm concerned he is I Will say this one guy and he came out very strongly a number of months ago something happened my polls whatever like\nTwenty five percent\nNobody's ever seen it's like he's got a big following in the African American community a big big following and I think he has in a lot of communities but at the polls runs through the roof and I have not seen that\nI think if I can honestly say I've never seen that before to that extent so he is respected\nAnd he's really a great guy you know what do you want to ask for anything for himself he's not saying hey gee I Want to do this or that\nIs a private guy and he wants to help people and I think maybe most\nMore than anything is prison reform because his wife who is terrific Kim she is the one that brought the attention to Mrs Johnson where I could look at you like many people like Mrs Johnson that are in jail for another thirty five years\nOn a charge that frankly everything serious but you know you don't get a life imprisonment because you're talking over a telephone\nAbout I don't I heard your attorney general doesn't want prison reform Jeff Sessions is standing in your ways that inaccurate\nWell if he doesn't he gets overruled by me 'cause I make the decision ... and\nThat's really interesting so let's dissecting so number one ... is there because he can bring black folks I mean that's what President Trump said he my phone number is all about my numbers just when you have a strong bond we black people\nOh is he can bring black folks\nI mean that's what President Trump said he my phone number is all about my numbers just when you have a strong following black people black people\nMidterm elections so he's they're being used\nNow because there are some level of mutual respect that because there's an ideology that Trump would like to listen to from ... but because you're black folks\nBut you really doesn't have Trump is just so out of touch he doesn't know

the Internet it seems like that's true yeah right oh\nBecause she knows that you know outside of the community we pretty much everybody she no she can push origin and can stretch her fame out for that and also of amber oh is it going to count to be a break because we forget we love everybody you know and you know she knows that\nAnd every road if she wasn't you know didn't have to look because I take that away from the the pretty girl you know but if she won it didn't have a look she has been she would be no by\nShe had no time with the obligation to glorify ban slice of your which is a segue to the next or\nYou know we gotta stop embrace and stuff like that man because it it it the way it manifests itself in our community it leads to you know father ... broken homes you know kid women should get you know getting pregnant at the slightest behavior that we can't we can't embrace\nThat some of them I mean talk about that just for a moment because this was a discussion in my class yesterday during the Eighteen sixties you had a marriage rate in our community over Ninety percent\nCorrect okay so I'm Talking about adult marriage with children so ... percent but you have to also understand what that meant during the era that means understanding social contact right\nSo the reason why you had the marriage rate above nine percent is because one women had no rights so women do not have the right to own property women in many cases didn't even have the right to file a divorce period so they were stuck in that relationship so right it does not\nClearly illustrate the morality of the nation just because of marriage versus non marriage so I don't like it when we conflate\nThe values with the morality of a nation specifically with marriage and using numbers based on historical data because first of all the morality of this country was in question on day one when we decided to own people\nSo ... that's questionable and immoral already but uh but marriage itself start marriage itself\nHas to be understood in the social era of that time\nRight and and and I agree with you know how to even ...\nItself has to be understood in the social era of that time\nRight and and and I agree with you know to even further illustrates what you're saying that I agree with that is that I mean you almost we almost had to be married just because for the sake of survival\nRight up there was an economic factor in that as well now there was a protective factor with the family unit all the bad is relevant to that society yes\nRight yeah and the and this is not even so much so much about marriage because it's more or less just about a behavior man that is just that you know that that she celebrates will slow walk and all that I mean\nIt's just you know it's one thing but that that's kind of secondary but the young lady banned in their ... you know she count illustrate itself and and now this is why I just want you to rile me I Do not want to listen to really think about this man and the ... this is this is kind of at the root of all of this stuff with Trump you know it's no secret that Trump has questionable\nRacist things in behavior about him but to sum it definitely racism\nBut here's what I Would challenge you and people\nTruth be told man where all the rage to be honest with you know people can say well black people can be racist 'cause we don't have the power and you're right but the truth be told behind closed doors were you talk about everybody we black or we talk about Mexicans if it's a bunch of folks in the card or what they're illegal we talk about\nHis breakdown first of all let's go back to your premature premises while all races I Do not believe they let me tell you why racism is an actual engagement\nOf our act\nAnd our ... association yeah there you go so in order to engage in that the structure must have you in control absolute no no not in control you really can't be races which you can be as big as it you can definitely be a good job or they don't have the better better term All right go ahead and\nThen that was illustrated body out later when you have to her she data entry racially she was like well no because I just don't like in the human person and you were trying to you know if they try and say well wait a minute ... well you know whatever whatever why why why I just don't like well truth be told we all have those bigoted views when it comes to something\nNow I'm not saying right Robert different I'm not saying that's why I'm not saying that is good but I'm just saying\nWe got almost ... and I know it's hard to do that because of the history of what we've gone through other people but we've got to almost to this point now we've got to almost be\nAble to say okay we've got to remove the motion and the frustration surrounding that say look okay how can we still drive within ... and what can we do for ourselves to overcome that 'cause I'm gonna tell you there's nothing like come within the bank overcome racism I mean that's just that's the truth you know\nI Am following I'm I'm a part of you know boss walking and I think that he had to write you know yeah we can talk about all the ills and injustices now agree with that\nAnd again you know you know my political stand for by the same token also look at baseball practical standpoint and we've got to remove you know ... you're going up there and meeting with ... you know Trump wanted to meet with meat meal he went to his trial I don't know whether it could be just a photo op and let me just say that I'll grant you that it is a political move yes he wants to get\nPeople on the side no different than Hillary had bring a Jay Z and Beyonce to try to get the black vote I mean everybody plays this political politics politics\nBut you know what happens let me say wants a little different with Trump's Trump skilled more so than others or he's willing to do it at a higher level than other politicians that is to exploit the individual he's meeting with so usually that meeting on early was they know all they hear the one ... let me let me ask you from it let me ask you that this\nWho has really want when you get exploited by Trump so\nI don't really know see I don't really know anything that's\nIt has really want when you get exploited by Trump ...\nI don't really know see I don't really know anything that's quantifiable that you could say okay well he did or didn't do this I Know they said that he didn't do to be so you're saying and I know now\nThey say so he didn't that's that's not an issue of argument that's the statement of fact\nBut let me ask you this question okay do you believe you honestly believe in this day in time\nThat ... access\nTo education being what it is if somebody wants to go you can literally go to school on your phone\nBill you really think that that even if he had gotten to really think that can help it a lot of people\nLet me tell you why does help okay federal money that goes into programs like the federal trio program which includes educational talent search\nThen it comes up what bound those programs when put in the hands on H. B. C. use creates a conduit to the local community and that conduit recruits first time college students in their family\nShow because of that federal funding we're not talking about\nStudents who do okay in high school they go to college with talking to my students who would have never seen college never write or that's a federal program that pays for that\nFor those children it makes a difference you're talking about funding for education I'm Talking about funding to get a student to get higher education to put the idea of higher education in mind that starts in the eighth grade that program typically starts in eighth grade yeah\nThe ... and and if that's the case that that that does not work and I and I call a spade a spade you know my thing is I just know that on a lot of these issues with regard to our no prison reform you know when the pastor's caught a lot of heat I noted their help and things that have been done and tangibly that was signed by him or at least that's what they are\nBut he'd done but sir he does these token gesture for example he releases one woman\nWho should have never been incarcerated that long for the drug convictions she really however he still says that he thinks drug dealers should be executed which the U.S Supreme Court determinant was unconstitutional to do because we used to do it by the way and there are pretty important said it was unconstitutional no I don't believe he he ... he changes\nNothing when it comes to policy but he gives us these token gestures that are just guys as policy actions through executive order and they have nothing to do\nBut let me ask you this and in all fairness and I know you've got other in all fairness like okay what is it what what what what he gain or what does he gamed by more than ...\nLet me take this ... he said it did you hit the clip doggedly impolite okay so he said Congress has a lot of followers his poll numbers increase because of ... this guy special so that is what he thinks the game's not about what he actually game is about ready to leave when you were dating from this\nBut the people certain people in office deal still through the whole system ... using the excuse to stay there for that either there were four it's brown and you know you have the opportunity over to somewhere else\nSo I don't think I don't think is that calculated I Do believe the state or state legislators who would like to\nTake the airport from the city of Atlanta they will capitalize on any mistakes made by an elected official or any issue of malfeasance by anybody at the airport they will utilize those realities in order to prop up their political point\nClass a phrase that it offers a cyber appreciate\nYour brother thank you ma'am I voted for zero for eight nine to two seven zero three let's go to is it decks let's go to decks and clay coal thanks good they welcome\nHis day said again that\nDutch my father just robbing Dutch I got it\nMan I I I'm I'm I'm about to make you laugh uh okay so\nAh you know you've been talking about is how you know going to vote for you and everything like that on the edge I see right right so I went to the second guy who's traveling you his name is Stan ... park yeah so I was on his Twitter I haven't heard about it or nothing\nI happen to go on this quarter and I've seen talking back he's like you know who the F ... rich and you know just just just talking trash right so what I did was I read activated my sweaters [laughter]\nUh I just went ahead and start you know like we have a shot over here like you know what I'm saying is trailing in the polls\nOn on a back and forth with me about you know uh it's not about the cold is about the right to his right and she's not in the top twenty five and I'm like well if it's not about the right if it's not about deposed and why you sit up here asking people out of state to vote for him\n[laughter] like\nBrother this this this is hilarious to me I was really interesting is that they will talk about their numbers they won't talk about their streaming numbers because I killed them in that they don't talk about the diversification of broadcasting because I have CBS forty six I have print media with rolling out magazine and I have a few others\nBut here's what I said when I posted it and my brother I Want you to understand how conciliatory I was trying to be here's what I said what I posted a link to AJC poll I said and I quote thank\nYou Sam and that AJC\nI'm In the polls vote for your favorite Atlanta news and talk radio personality and another link on my Twitter I'll put that I was in a poll up with other very well respected radio personality as I said and I quote\nThe AJC initially left me off this list for best news and talk radio personality in Atlanta they had so many direct emails nominated me they place me on the official poll with ten other very well respected talk radio personality I'm not pulling that number one I didn't throw anybody under the bus nobody

heard of him or the station he's on please vote for Lionel Richie son was shot Regina ... and he misspelled my last name\nI'm very fast please ... originally he needs this recognition more than I Do

when when he loses he wants to say hey I told people to vote for the guy so why would people vote for the guy or they could just say oh well I told them to do that well here's what's interesting every single one of them have told the audience to both of them all of them\nAnd that would entail at number one and yeah I did it you guys want to try to call me out it's cool it's great I Do this
