possibly listen to me and hold on hold onto it and then see how they might today right I'm just asking a question\nI've said of all of all scholarly endeavors history as best qualified to reward or research so tell me what I said so I could know how to properly answer you go what you thought I said\nOh no I was asking the question so it started today said that you felt sorry if that was when I got is that you felt sorry from one end and that you want to reach out and give give up and then a hub of\nI cannot help but and I and I even what the meat to want to say certain things about the need to women but if if if I just feel in my heart if I was if I had the time to go and look and see how somebody is one of them voted I Know they voted for Trump I Know that they did I Know a lot of them decided\nTo go and I do understand so if they voted for Trump would have to do with with anything I'm I'm just curious well and explain what on the conversation we're having\nOkay so so because I don't I don't look at just contacts I look at it like a whole a whole scenario stuff if you are in a particular environment located like like like let's put it that well let's look at ... okay so you're saying that you're in this\nType of relationship with copper or any one it is and this industry and then you have someone who was wanting to be the president of the United states and he has those same characteristics\nThose same things that record still high treats one of what it says about one he didn't do anything to them yet you support him your support in the same cause or the same represent representation of the person that has wrong too so but you don't want sympathy from the world but at the same time you support someone\nThat was similar or very but the same characteristics of the same person that has affected your life\nSo and I say that I'm saying that\nIt's like a double sided sort\nOf ... I have I hear you but here's a here's a distinction made there but it is very clear\nYou hey I I could care less about politics to be honest with you it it it matters not to be who is the president who is the mayor who's the city council ... could care less about that as I said earlier this morning and the polls I'm On my patio come chronicles\nI'm I'm going to get out here and grind if there's a Republican in office for the ... office I got ... whether Obama was in office didn't agree with half of the stuff that he was about\n... whether this is a Shirley Franklin Tennessee read or a man named T shirt at the end of the day when I'm saying is as it relates to rape\nAnd there's nothing that you heard me say that negates anything that use it\nSo I'm not a lot so I'm very glad that I'm\nNot saying that I'm not saying that she said that about\nRight I Am not a this so I'm saying here's what I Am saying about the news what I Am in the arena\nHere's what I was in about rape I could care less what your political affiliation is no person man or woman\nHas the right to violate you or or take from you that what you do not freely give their will actually know what his name and Republican or Democrat independent that didn't matter to me\nI wasn't saying that at all I Would just say\nWhat would you basically said you had no sympathy or do not down with the women who turned around and voted for Trump I'm saying that they got married for it doesn't matter to\nBed what did I have sympathy I said I Do\nHas oh okay so what is your point of making the political I was an issue that\nFact because okay I was talking I went from one subject to the next what I'm saying to you and your conversation to me when you said you wanted to hug women\nInto I said I Want to do that every so that our lives is\nNo no no but he did what you what here's what what were we don't have a disagreement or ... I don't disagree and use it my input see is based on what I've heard some brothers on this radio station say right and I'm not able to generalize the net\nSo what I've heard some brothers on this radio station say right and I'm not even generalizing at the bottom line is I I Believe in this what both ... others can believe as they want to I Believe that one of the worst crimes that you could could Mitt\nShorter murder is right\nIt is okay and so I'm very clear that\nWhat is happening in Washington is politics\nI don't give a damn about Republican Democrat independent because at the end of the day none of them give a damn about us\nRight here in Atlanta we got to fight with a black woman who should be fighting for black people in Port au Prince people\nBut she is as Bush why in as elite as they come and she's no different than having a white woman over there at the end of the day I'm Talking about ... a lot of them are done by this current mayor of their friends and so you get back to the different but the facts of what the facts are and\nSo when you give away at one point yeah but we dollar you know we're now and then when you give it away what what I what I Know like if they ignore when it hit here here\nWe go another this is Deborah with ... ignorance that she shows up every couple of months with the same ignorance so she calls in and want to fight and let me beyond which is just that I Would I don't argue with people that Harriet Tubman would have shot and not put you in that category would that level of ignorance in stupidity\nThat that's what's your problem is what you wanted to do is August so proud you somebody who argue with you\nAnd that's not that's not db and get that kind of time\nFor for eight nine to two seven zero three 'cause you don't disagree with me on the premise you don't disagree with me on what I'm saying so now you want to say I just mad black woman you come to that conclusion would I don't like is politics or that is about not about the people\nHave a difference with teaching land Bob next week she'll do some great but this week as it relates to the Gulf when you get one point seven billion dollars don't even care for the poor

keep their fingers crossed that when they come out of pre season they're going to be ready\nWe know that's not the case because very often veterans will take off most of the pre season\nUh and then in

matches we'll talk a little bit about the Ryder Cup and\nThe lack of production from the captain's picks a gym here it goes with Phil Mickelson and goes with Tiger Woods fill didn't even golf on Saturday the middle day and said neither he nor tiger managed any type of a point now that\nHave a point not a NATO points not anything that didn't sniff a point to not enforce them not in singles\nAnd there are the forty some things I don't know maybe it's just me but tiger looked old he looked old and he looked tired now granted he was coming off of the Torre championship and a bunch of media responsibilities than travelling straight to France uh but man\nHe he'd look to me like he really needed to sleep [laughter]\nI really needed a break and he's played a lot of Gulf this year but\nBuilding Albany better uh so that's coming up plus we want to make sure we've got you all caught up and ready for Monday and major league baseball was supposed to be an off day except it's the first time in baseball history that two\nGay one sixty threes are required so neither the central nor the west as a champion yet both of those division titles will be handed out on Monday and then we'll understand a little more about the playoff picture which right now is very willy nilly and the national league\nSo we'll do some baseball and some Gulf about a half hour from now\nAnd in in the meantime we still get a bunch of NFL storylines to sort through its after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio were inside the Quicken Loans studios national mortgage lender Quicken Loans apply simply understand fully mortgage confidently now we've got two more overtime games both involving\nBlender Quicken Loans apply simply understand fully mortgage confidently now we've got two more overtime games both involving NFC nope AFC South\nAMC south winners\nI guess three of the fourteenth or as the south and the super bowl champs in there as well so there were three overtime games on Sunday the browns and raiders I just talked about and we'll get to the titans and the Texans in their overtime games coming up\nWe'll do that in about Fifteen minutes or so but I thought it would be interesting to look at the teams on top of or at the top of the AFC and I know we're only a month and so we're we're not talking about clenching playoff spots what Bill Belichick saved a week three\nUh I don't believe that anyone is clinched a playoff spot and I don't think anyone's been eliminated from the playoff yet either and this is how quickly things can change so the patriots\nIn one of the games that you told us you were most looking forward to weeks for in the NFL were hosting the three you know Miami Dolphins the dolphins one of three teams who had yet to lose going into week number for\nJust as a side note rams moved to foreign to foreign oh the chiefs play on Monday Night against the Broncos they could move to foreign oh but right now there are only two undefeated remaining why well because the dolphins look for\nThings like the team that had to put a three you know record on the board and the first three weeks of the regular season this got an interesting a nerd alert if you will or we have to say at the right way Tom Brady\nHelp to put the dolphins in a massive whole twenty for nothing and a half on the Seventy ... anniversary of his first NFL start\nSo Sunday September thirtieth\nTwo thousand Eighteen was the seventeenth anniversary of the very first start of Tom Brady career\nAnd look at the man now he did have two interceptions but he also through for three touchdowns Josh Gordon was active for the patriots and you can tell he's going to be a major component or not only see a big target but he can get down field\nPhilip door set continues to make all of the high degree of difficulty catches\nSony Michel had his first touchdown\nAs an NFL player remember he wasn't ready to go and camp and so he's still kind of getting a sea legs under him

I don't know the color commentator was but he was going on and on and on about\nIndia showed up on the football ... you know wait for the tide wa blah blah I take ... for every ... every time\nIn the NFL just the singing of the law there is virtually not any difference between the one in three and one two and more just exactly the same\n... like I have no idea what's that\nIt's not the when it comes to standings uh you're half game up on the people who have more law said\nOkay let me ask you this how many fires and you're like oh I don't ever remember seeing it or somebody made the playoffs because they were let's say junk five and one and the other team was financier\nNever have I ever seen a pie get someone in the playoffs as opposed to help in a law never\nMet a ... pie in the NFL is the that was the same as the last I mean if you've ever seen it have you ever seen somebody make the playoffs the regatta apply sort of a a you know being from five and wants to be fed them sick\nYou're going to have to give me a second but I Would bet you it's happened\nOkay what what one out of a good check it out would be that much from what\nI Will Michael but I Can't do it right and they can sometimes but sometimes that you know sometimes the research takes more than ... ... it out but I I well you\nJust ... percent of the time anyway ever cook the reader will talk to some other jai\nThanks Michael eight five five to one to forward to to\nSeven I'm certainly anti can work both for you and against you know I hate ties let let me just get that straight up I Can't stand having ties in any pro sport and that includes soccer I don't think there should be a tie same thing with hockey can't stand it at the you know these guys play for money this is ...\nIn any pro sport and that includes soccer I don't think there should be a tie same thing with hockey can't stand it ah the you know these guys play for money this is a business there there should not be a tie there's not little kids who get a trophy for participation\nUm and so I I don't like the way the NFL handles its ties and I was hashed tagging away no more ties no more dies no more dies on Sunday afternoon I because I don't want to see them either by it just depends on your division if\nYour tie puts you ahead\nOf enough teams behind you well then that tie keeps you from falling back into the same record let's say you're competing for a wildcard or the division title if you have one less loss\nIf that law is not a loss but it's a tie well that [laughter] that makes you ahead of them now it could also work against you because of you I have a tie instead of another victory well yes then it can keep you from a playoff spot\nBut what it does is put you in the middle so almost reading between the lines of puts you in the middle there where it can work for you but it could also work against you and it's a fluid situation\nBecause it depends on everything else that's happening around you and obviously it depends on what else do you do the rest of your regular see them but I mean there's no\nThere's no concrete black and white way to say that a tie is the same as a lost cause that's not the case it's almost like a half and you could be a half above or you could be have behind depending on the rest like I said the rest of the playoff picture Tim is listening in Ohio Tim welcome to after our CBS Sports radio\nYeah Hi uh I\nI was new sometimes a good show but I just wanted to shoot you say you know you said it doesn't come down to one that she plays but essentially that's exactly what the browse game came down to is to play but I mean they took away\nThe first album Carlos Hyde which I mean everybody clearly saw as a first down let alone even if it was and you can't reverse it you know wants to calls already called the way it is\nUm it really should have been reversed and then to you have the uh\nQuarterbacks armor going backwards you know while ... and they don't call that either I mean those are two plates that significantly made this game what it was and why we\nLast time I mean I literally held out by the lake\nMixed Tim ... everybody did it was a really good game how about the ... six that actually put seven points on the board so that one doesn't have the same impact as the calls that you're talking about\nA early on a day but essentially at the end you get up I Will say are you at\nHow about the miss ... point after intent or I'm Sorry to miss two point conversion that Jackson decided to go forward instead of uh instead of the extra kick that would've been a another point on the board I mean to me I can go on and on and on how the four turnovers two of which led to fourteen raiders points\nI mean how about the fact that the browns had a double figure lead in the second half like we can go back and forth on this and I can tell you a dozen more things that impacted that game just as much as the two calls that you are pointing out to me and it it I'm not going to change my opinion and maybe you're not going to change yours\nPhones you know [noise]\nAre you behind on your federal student loan payments you may qualify to have your entire student loans

Ninety five and sixty seven brewers within eleven to nothing went over the tigers cubs doubled up the cardinals tend to buy that game was at one eastern and tend to depict the winners of those games move onto the divisions theories while the loser as we'll play each other\nIn the national league wildcard game\nThe angels ended their season where they win over the age and manager Mike social

final weekend of September serve as the spicy hors d'oeuvres\nFor what's to come in October [noise] now I Know the Ryder Cup adds a little something different into the mix we don't have that every year um but to have that on the final three days of September ... plus the end of the major league baseball season coinciding and\nWe still don't have to division winners in the national league so we've got\nGames one sixty three in the end all central and in the west is the first time that's ever happened we've never had a baseball season require two extra games\nTo settle the full and complete playoff picture but that's what we've got on Monday and if you hadn't heard the national league central between the brewers and the cubs at Wrigley Field will start at noon\nUtterly new ... central time\nOne o'clock eastern time\nAnd it's followed by the double header the second half of the double header between the Rockies and the Dodgers in Los Angeles a Dodger Stadium\nAnd there are two reasons why the games or early in case you're wondering I saw people complaining about it on social media that nobody's going to be watching la la la la uh two reasons number one the games are contractually obligated to be on ESPN\nWhich already has Monday Night football so that's one reason or like it or not these games have to be on TV and to others already commitment major league baseball's not bumping Monday Night football uh and then in addition to that\nThe losers of these two games on Monday Have to turn around and play in a wild card game on Tuesday so better not to have a night game especially when there's always the potential for extra innings of course no clock on a baseball game as much as the commissioner would like that to be the case\nOf you know you need to give these teams\nWherever they're going oh what a and one of 'em could end up being at home of course um but if they have to travel if two of them have to travel you want to give them the opportunity to get where they're going to the losers of Monday's games in the end all central the Old West will turn around and meet in the wild card game on Tuesday night\nThat's then followed by the American league wildcard game on Wednesday night which is\nThe opening days at the New York Yankees so that one's already set\nThat we move onto the division series and we really only know one of those at this point we certainly know the winner of the AOL wildcard will take all the red Sox\nWho finished with a franchise record one hundred eight victories and we do know that the Indians will be battling the world series champion Astros some so that's what we know in the American league in the national league\nIt's still very much in the air the winner of the central so either the brewers are the cubs whoever wins today's game at Wrigley Field will host than the winner of the wild card and we don't even know who the teams are that are going to be in the wild card game\nWe also know that the division winner in the west whether it be the Dodgers are the Rockies have actually never won a division title in their history that division winner in the west will host the brace so we know the west will have a home field advantage otherwise we're going to have to wait and see\nDivision winner in the west will host the brace so we know the west will have home field advantage otherwise\nWe're going to have to wait and see so that's coming up on Monday just when you saw on the weekend was over no thinking get and we've got more week ending for you that should help with your manic Monday

hours which Amy Loren [noise]\nYou know weeks for any NFL eyes very grateful for that instead you hear the game winner is no these are just the ones that over time we also had\nThe Seahawks the cowboys and the bangles wind up on their last possession of the game and so you had six games that went absolutely down to the wire\nSo pretty amazing first Brent luck burger the voice of the Oakland Raiders radio network\nUh after that mark Vander Meer from the Texans radio network and then finally one of my favorite place of the entire weekend\nA that was my teeth and Corey Davis his first career touchdown catch and just the perfect placement firm Marquez Mario to the awareness to recognize lost the ball up there make it a self taught for heaven's sake if they're under hand and do that to whatever it takes to get the ball up in the air\nNice lost the ball up there make it a self taught for heaven's sake if they're under hand and do that to whatever it takes to get the ball up in the air for Davis to be able to get it uh and that's why you know you you get those toll targets six seven guys and so those were all really dramatic finishes\nUm and there was so much to build up to those moments for sure\nI mean it it was it was some kind of a Sunday\nWere only at the corner pole and and I'm not sure how much more drama and spiking of my heart rate I can take but I say that every year\nIt's after hours with any Lawrence on CBS Sports radio we have our latest Monday MVP poll up for you and as always these artistic Chechens so no need to get to all upset and get a\nGet all painted a bunch\nA if your guy is not in the Monday envy people knew instead you can just quote the pool and send us your potential candidates right so we've got mixture of escape because six touchdowns we've got out of the ... because even though Drew Brees did not throwing touchdown pass on the road at the giants he had\nWell over a hundred yards and three scores himself\nWe Adam ... because it forty five years old he is now the new leader in NFL history when it comes to feel goals made five hundred and sixty six\nAnd that's why I think Greg decided to go forward on Fort them for because he had out of military just waiting there to kick a game winner sin quite play out like that and then the Eliot as he kill LA to all of a sudden that Dallas often looks like\nA a much more fluid viable off and it's an often that wasn't on life support uh and and it has a lot to do is eat\nOf course the old line plays a major on it too but what does he kill Eli it\nHas a not just the yards on the ground rushing but also is able to catch passes and we've his way and do damage that way that's a lethal combination deck and sneak and who knows if they've got the consistency now if this is going to be the rhythm they stay in a but it was good to see them\nGet comfortable and and be able to eat up chunks of yard edge and take time off the clock with extended drives so his IQ is also in our main crush no or Monday MVP I guess you can call it man 'cause she'll be like a five five to one to four to seven let's do this call from Gabriel in San Antonio welcome to after our CBS Sports radio [noise]\nBy any thanks for taking my call sure um I was wondering if\nYou knew um anywhere in the NFL if the number one receiver for a team and the number one rush reports he was the same\nPerson [laughter] I'm\nDeliberately that way um the reason I think about it is because they say the cowboys still don't have a number one receiver um and we know the ... you know very sure hands\nAnd today he or even a very long path for that um when we can be a what'd you think you'd be a good idea to vote number one receiver in Russia is that a good idea\nVisited sparsely dot com to

but miserable pretty awesome to see ... with his breakout game he finishes with career highs of six touchdowns and three hundred and fifty four yards passing jumped Jody AK\n... with the Chicago Bears radio network at every single one of those scores a it was\nFirst tap alone now was lopsided and enough to decide this one in in the first half four hundred total yards for Chicago I mean that's more than\nA handful a team scored the entire day or a put up the entire day\nUh but they were in some kind of groove and yet the bucks often just pitiful it which is why dirt cutter made the change at half time and went for Brian Fitzpatrick to Jamie It's Wednesday and it it sounds like Winston has done enough to earn his starting job back according to cut her\nHowever\nRyan Fitzpatrick does not play corner back he plays a quarter back and well a couple of extended drives certainly could have given that deep as a bit of a blow and or maybe they would have been a little more effective if they had more uh you know opportunity so the bench and rest\nStill the deep end tested bears a major responsibility for how much of a debacle this was\nAgainst the bears it's after hours with Amy Lawrence

classic as in the hall of fame or the\nGame today we couldn't make enough changes we should\nFire every person that was on a field so to me that was I was ...\nHe went on he elaborated but that essentially is the just based on what we saw there today we can't make enough to H ... oh my gosh\nHow quickly things\nCan go awry in professional sports but really in the NFL I mean this first month has been so\nThis is the bucks all fence\nThat went into New Orleans is ... forty eight points in the season opener\nAgainst the state's all their own turf now I get it there's a opportunity to put up a lot of points there but if it's Patrick has four touchdown passes and he's got three games of four hundred yards each and now all of a sudden\nIt looks like\nThey're the I'm trying to pick off it's what often they're the cardinals all of a sudden it looks like they're the cardinals or the bills on alternate weeks [laughter]\nTo the bells rookie cornerback given\nAnd rookie quarterback taketh away so Josh Alan had bill fans all excited last week right it was it was the whole oh bondi Davis left\nAnd now the team is really good so they go six corners after ... Davis's abrupt retirement and they kill it in those six quarters and they go into Minneapolis and they put twenty seven boys on the board and they hold the Vikings to your what six points total when the game and they look amazing right Allen with three touchdown passes\nI I mean he barely gets touched against the Vikings events\nAnd then comes week for the Buffalo Bills instead play against Green Bay\nAnd the Green Bay Packers without the flags clay Matthew is good for you know clay Matthews without the flags the Packers sack of Josh Allen said ... times and he has three turnovers and how quickly everything can get completely turned on its head\nTo head that Josh Allen soundbite and trying to find here on my page and I cannot find a do you have it ah where he talks about his uh his performance against ...\nIf you do that is great you can give me a thumbs up but that's kind of the deal is that it's not just inconsistencies buddies rookie quarterback and I thought it was kind of fun to hear the discussion or on NFL and CBS Tony Romo was in Studio before he went to do the states and giants game\nAnd they were talking about how the rookie quarterback you should go out there and through intersections because it's really the only time you can get away with it because everybody thinks oh rookie cornerback okay he's making mistakes yeah well as good as weak three was for Josh out of the bills week for was that bad\nFor the difference when I'm unemployed really well especially in the second half you know they've got the Senate for the most part and they really have a chance you know they forced to turn over ... myself about three times and complimentary football when it's not an issue when doing them\nKnow that is definitely not complimentary football uh so Josh how old is not one of our this week anyway not one of our Monday MVP candidates\nOr you can find those on our Twitter a law ready or showed Twitter after our CBS and then also on our Facebook page I fear a lot of you are weighing in Troy is listening in Dorchester, Massachusetts Troy welcome to after hours\nOh you're going through ... or ... good so good of a neutral not much oh\nTroy welcome to after hours oh you're going through more are you doing good so I\nDid have a legitimate voters oh he got forty four points on my ... old ... ... people were a lot but uh well um and I took it out of my survival ah we ... we grow up to the eagles the beat the courtesy of figure out who was an Oprah\nReally you\nKnow the you know I was a good on pins and needles and then ah I I couldn't believe the where you go to the uh the\nYou know they were up a couple of touchdowns and it just seemed like all of a sudden they couldn't they couldn't do anything on often state\nIt was so ... and I'm like man this is a much survivors of the week before so\nI didn't make it out a week one man so you got maybe ... [laughter] thanks for calling I appreciate it but we want\nYou to uh it's not as though it was only the bills with the identity crisis so I don't want to just pick on the bills how about the Miami Dolphins who went into New England at three and oh and did not score until Brock ...

talked thirteenth eighty W E okay\nA way to\nRight now\nOkay well I can I just ask one more question acted information about okay drinking is one thing but the concern is about truthfulness and in your written testimony you said sometimes you had too many drinks I went there ever a time when you drink so much that you couldn't remember what happened or part of what happened the night before\nI don't know I remember what happened and I think you're probably a beer center and and\nSo you're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before a part of what happened that\nYou're asking about yeah blackout I don't know have you\nCan you answer that question judge it just to you that's not happening is that your answer\nYeah and I'm curious if you have I have no drinking in order to why okay thank you\nYeah I imagine if he was drunk now you already said in his testimony he said\nI used to drink beer I still drink beer\nI like beer he said that\nI think people don't go over I think he was drinking the night before he could not hold his composure but thirty minutes he was already off the train imagine when he drinks\nLater the gentleman he could\nTo meet up and have some beers drinking beer which I gladly do I like for that I like beer I don't know if you don't like the center and um what do you watch the next one is or what do you what I Would have an event we drink beer and and a soul do so whatever\nI think you've probably had beer center and and so\nYou're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happened if\nYou're asking about yeah blackout I don't know have you\nCan you answer the questions catch and just to you that's not happening is that your answer\nYeah and I'm curious if you have I have no drinking nor do I\nWill I Swear before God I Wish there let me be a U.S Senate for one day I'm day just one day just one just as as a matter of fact just give me twelve hours I don't even need twenty four\nFirst of all a judge Kavanaugh do you even know how this works because this is not your courtroom you will not the prosecutor you are being confirmed by the court of Senate Judiciary committee\nThat's what you're doing at this moment but instead of understanding his role I'm really perplexed\nAs to how can you believe a man who does not understand his role during the Senate confirmation hearing if he doesn't understand his role there what makes you think people understand his role as the United States Supreme court justice and what makes you think he understood his\nRole before becoming a lawyer\nOkay let me bring this into the equation and I've I've been saying this for years nobody does angry southern white woman like Lindsey Graham\nAre you aware that at nine twenty three and the night and July the night the day you were nominated to the Supreme Court by President Trump Senator Schumer said twenty three minutes after nomination I'll oppose judge Kavanaugh's nomination with everything I have\nI have a bipartisan hope a bipartisan majority will do the same the stakes are simply too high for anything less\nWell if you weren't aware of that you are now did you meet with Senator Dianne Feinstein on August twentieth I did meet with center finds yet you know that her staff had already recommended a lawyer to Dr Ford\nI did not know that did you know that her and her staff had this alec is allegations for over twenty days\nI did not know that at the time if you wanted to FBI investigation you could have come to us what you want to do is destroyed this guy's life hold this seat open and hope you win at twenty twenty you said that not me you've got nothing to apologize for\nWhen you see so to mind cake and tell them that Lindsey said I'll ... voted for them I Would never do to them what you've done to this guy this is the most ethical sham\nSince I've been in politics and if you really wanted to know the truth you sure as hell wouldn't have done what you've done to this guy are you a gang rape that no\n\nI cannot imagine what you and your family for going through\nOkay here's what I'm trying to understand so live it was like oh my God I just I just can't believe we're job done to him\n\nHe's looking at is no but you need you really need to see what happened\nI just I just can't believe what job done to him\nWhile he's looking at his notes that unique you really need to see what happens here you need to watch it because all of his outrage he is looking at prepared no so he looks up like I Can't believe and then he looks at his notes it's such a sham then you look through the snow\n... prepared testimony\nAs I've said nobody does angry white woman as well as Lindsey Graham but then in all of that\nAnd all of his I Can't believe they're doing this to you and I can't believe that our\nGang rape is\nWell wait a minute so now you're you're actually the only person that acts them that question [laughter] do you realize Lindsey you're the only person that put that question on the record argue a gang rape incest\n\nFor zero forty nine to two seven zero three let's go to the callers\nWe've got a lot of them I got Charles in DC Charles\nGood they weren't Happy Friday Happy Friday sir\nThank you thank you very much I doubt very seriously that Kavanaugh what led a ... to get operated in this courtroom the way that he operated on yesterday and what\nCrazy stuff gangs illegitimate children fights on boats in Rhode Island's\nAll nonsense reported breathless lay off and on critically by the media\nThis is destroyed my family\nAnd my good name a good name for the built up through decades of very hard work in public service at the highest levels of the American government's\nThis whole two week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit fuel to the parents pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election\nFear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars and money from outside left wing opposition groups\nThis is a circus\nThe consequences will extend long past my nomination the consequences will be with us for decades\nThis quote tasks and coordinated character assassination well to sway confident in good people of all political persuasion from serving our country\nAnd as we all know in the United states' political system of the early to thousands what goes around comes around\nI Can't really put my finger on it but I'm going to say like ... told me something ain't right about that fella something ain't right about that ... quite put my finger on it for the report not due to seven zero three he was contentious his favorite was jacked up\nHe cited the Clintons in others it's almost as if the same person who writes Trump's speech wrote\nHis speech I don't think I've ever seen such a part of the narrative displayed\nBy eight nominees for the U.S Supreme Court if you can find one that's more partisan than what Kavanaugh did yesterday please alert me to it\nThis whole two week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit fuel without parents' tent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election\nFear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record revenge on behalf of the Clintons\nRevenge on behalf of the Clinton okay sir\nKevin Oh you do realize that Trump already has the Supreme Court\nPick that went through you do also realized that there were a couple of Democrats voted for bed Supreme Court bit\nThe only difference meals there he did not have women saying that he will do sexual abuse or that's the difference so he's citing everything else oh this is a political hit this has to do with the Clintons all this was on President did sir I've got just got confirmed a few months ago\nEverything else oh this is a political hit does have to do with the Clintons all this was on President ... or ... just got from a few months ago so please missed me with the ... you\nKnow this is because you are inappropriate with women that's report you left out and the other guy agree or disagree with his politics was not\nFor zero for not to do seven zero three that gives you the conversation let's go to Britain in Atlanta Brenda good they welcome\n[noise] yes thank you thank you for having me back in ... oh [noise] well my position on is is that uh\nEven though the leadership changes in terms of the president didn't tend to stay sane and I think that you know we as as black people need to really understand what the overall agenda is which is to me a\nA\nNation of us as a pizza and uh as far as uh you know this is an agenda that was written by someone else for someone else other than us and I think that ah\nOf course we live in this system so we should emphasize our rights can vote and those kinds of things\nBut we also have to understand that when there's an agenda that's been put in place uh that's what holds and I think that um [noise] I think Kevin I was going to be concerned regardless and because a Trump has shown that\nHe has total disregard for anything that is a set up a new system\nOr in terms of monitoring behavior\nUh putting checks and and and I'm On a certain legislation and whatnot you know we can't do that the country cannot get tough to cooperate and I I don't think that this is just what we experience and here in America I think that this is an agenda that global\nIn terms of dictatorships in terms of taking away people's rights uh I think if something is put in place\nOn a global scale and so I think that we as a teacher who didn't need to refocus\nAnd and look at what is our agenda uh\nAnd really put some time and effort I Know we do things on a certain level but we also do a lot of things that's totally connected with this system they keep trying to get out placed on the agenda uh so I think we need to rethink things and ah\nYou know and and there's a lot going on politically without Senate with those senators and ah there's a lot of outside inside players that uh corporate and as\nA influencing what to send it to do and so you know I mean it's it's something that is ongoing I think is is ... is is coming into his demise but I just feel that we can\nGet really really need to refocus our armed yeah so that's my comment\n... appreciate your call is in gold friday for zero for you not to do seven zero three good point Lester a crocodile two years\nI had to laugh at the job but I Do yesterday Kavanaugh pausing as if he was about to cry\nAnd as I said\nWas Lindsey Graham Senator Graham does the absolute best white southern female then

the you know everybody you know that there is racism here but at the same time and we got a letter desperation and in our community and it's causing a lot of this crime it's it's it's the money\nYou

go um you know on the bus get a car or get a job at Pizza Hut get two jobs working at ... they're not they're not doing that and you know I think\nWe will always with was to go help super hustle and

record yeah most of the time is is because of money\nYeah and that is on for now yeah that's unfortunate because this old idea or approved by the Sunday you know in in a very real way this whole idea of this western ideal of individualism and and uh just hoarding of resources and things\nAre in the ... just to come modification of as a people have caused us to become what we despise I mean we

constitutionally mandated something they did not give President Obama's pick but that's a different story I said he would not vote because after his performance he did not have the boat\nI mean you have a guy who obviously\nHe did not have the votes I mean you have a guy\nWho obviously does not respect\nThe rule of the constitution because he decided to question the U.S senator who asked him about his drinking do do do you do you uh blackout do you really sir what's ironic is if that would have been his courtroom\nAnd a person did that to him and his courtroom they would have been held in contempt of court possibly jail definitely find but he had no problem coming before the U.S Senate a constitutional authority\nAnd making a mockery of the process it was so out of ... or join them and they did come back and apologize to the woman that's why I said he's a horrible drop\nHe's a person who gets drunk and this horrible\nHis friend from Yale agrees with me his friends from gale have said you know what I had no problem with him being a U.S Supreme Court justice I had no issue\nWith him going through the Senate confirmation hearing\nBut I have issue today because\nHe is lying about his drinking and if a man can lie under oath in front of the nation that is not a guy I Want to see as the U.S Supreme Court justice is not because Brett had a drinking issues because he's currently lying about it\nNow here's what's interesting two weeks ago in my class as a matter of fact one week ago\nThe Brett Kavanaugh hearing came up in my class as a college professor I attempt to create an atmosphere conducive to diverse thinking and so this came up in the classroom and one of my students bright student young lady said\nDr Ritchie doesn't really matter\nThat he has a password about people who have changed you are a change man yourself\nAnd I couldn't Kurt ... her sentiment people do change and I said I only question the authenticity of a person's transformation if they're not willing to be honest about it\nNow I've talked publicly for years about my personal transformation and will continue to do so\nFor zero for it not to to seven zero three but when you deny that very transformation\nAll you really a change to individual that is a relevant question especially when we're talking about giving that person this extreme lifetime power I Know we call it call it a lifetime appointment but what it is\nIt's lifetime power you have this power as long as you want it for the rest of your life until you die\nIf you choose to keep it\nIt is life long power for zero forty nine to two seven zero three we will have my guest come and gone and just a few minutes you don't want to miss that I talked about it during the model law\nYou need to know exactly where you stand in this Georgia election we're going to talk about that come and go for zero for eight nine to two seven zero three that gets you up in here for zero for\nEight nine to two seven zero three or something else\nThat's going on right now is the breakdown of Kanye West\nYeah ... that's going on right now is the breakdown of Kanye West\nNow when he came out and say slavery was a choice\nI did a commentary about bad we put it on video be one oh three eight okay put it on video and it basically went viral my response to ... when it was really insane him saying this may be one of the choice and I broke down the definition of choice\nAnd there you have it now he did Iran own as a nail a pro Trump speech got booed on as a nail\nA demand needs help the man needs help and please I'm Talking to Hollywood stopped giving him a platform\nYou already know what was going viral that's that's why people keep saying hey time Jay come here with us say something we don't care what you say oh we got to do is allow you to talk\nThis is just insane All right let's go to Todd and done with a lot to talk good they welcome\n\nTodd how are you there Todd\nBryant wants going twice no time let's go to Doug ... in College Park dug a good day welcome\nHey Russia I didn't hear are the first part of the monologue of it is a is\nGreg and be such and basically this yes okay sorry\nPerfectly All right well I I don't want to uh um interfere with what Greg has to say\nSo I'll I'll I'll just give my two cents on a cabin up now if anybody was said attention and watch the ... um the the testimony that was given\nFrom I'm from Dr Lacey for\n... was was was riveting or ... it was powerful it was authentic genuine she was telling the truth when she was Fifteen Years old\nShe went to a party or with a and Brett Kavanaugh was there\nAre several of his friends\nThey pushed her in her room and he's forced themselves on her\nSon to take off her clothes she doesn't have any reason to make it up she brought up the story in two thousand twelve and two thousand Thirteen to her therapist and councilor marriage counseling and this was something that she kept\nTo herself but what she found out that he was on the short list to become judge she tried to reach out confidentially and anonymously\nAnd report it so that\nHe would not end up becoming a Supreme Court judge so for all those people who are saying that she lives politically motivated it she was doing this to do it she she had been tries to let people know about this guy and she just wasn't getting the attention\nDoug ... and I I wanted to say this because people continue to talk about the motivation behind a woman's outcry it\nReally doesn't matter I don't think she was politically motivated but even if she was politically motivated it doesn't change if it happened\nOr not a lot of times does an elected position of public officials may give the ammunition to be used against them I'm really not concerned\nIf it was motivated by politics are motivated by code words you know fear or you just don't want this guy to be a U.S Supreme Court justice the issue is is it true did actually\nFear or you just don't want this guy to be a U.S Supreme Court justice the issue is is it true did it actually happened and hear the two facts that you can't just be number one\nShe took a lie detector test than past it\nShe took a state certify from eight states certified examiner lie detector tests and she passed it number two ranked Kavanaugh said his own testimony\nLet's go let's go beyond her testimony let's go to the friend from Yale because I think the bigger charge unfortunately or fortunately depending on how you view of the world\nThe biggest charge is not what he did to women because of the hierarchy in this country the bigger charge will be did he lie under oath\nAbout what he used to do well cording to have faith\nThat was somebody else's opinion\nHow was it hit somebody else's opinion either either him drink too much or you don't ... let's\nLet's let's go beyond yeah well\nNow wait a minute Andy and to have wind to have you ever have you ever drunk to the point of blacking out is that an opinion\nSo you dropped and pass out oh you never did it no I Know he's a stumble slows your words what are you know never did it\nDrinks and had a good night's sleep come out and\nThen you know I just got to be out of Utah like a fellow that knows how to throw the bachelor\nWhat let's go beyond jail why constructing bio and was changing Brett Kavanaugh\nOff to Pablo Kevin let's say Pablo was accused of being a member of MS for pain when he was Eighteen Twenty years old the liberal Democrats would have no part of\nMy man why are you telling the stories from la la land any less everything you're saying you're not rooted in any fact no truth is all hyperbole this is ridiculous and you've got to combat and that meant I I think a lot of you actually\nWhy he's being accused duck status\nNo he's being accused by multiple ... Andy\nAndy it's different now I Know Kevin ... guy I Know you really want to see him make it I Know you do\nBut you have to contend with the fact\nThat he has been accused by three women does far more may come so there's an F. B. I. pro\nInto the allegations and hopefully it actually extend to the individuals that may claim against Kavanaugh especially the claim that he lied under oath now well in this for truth think about this the FBI\nIs the place where this should be investigated\nCorrect what do you also have any okay then you should be happy right now than they are you happy and I'm happy he let me ask you this what if it's true such stuff you know what if it's true and happy\nYou know who else is happy ... can I make this\nPoint heart just ... answer this question what if it's true what if he did sexually assault Dr Ford\nWelding them across they go to let's say okay that ... fair enough\nBut you know the oh I'm not alone in the other Alan West Kanye West's sure David Carr he says it's funny that that would the short short Clark so there's nothing that's been presuming that whatever holed up in the ...\nCourt records of all share of Clark is a blow over ...\nWho is no longer share of why because he let people die from starvation and dehydration and his own jail why he was prancing around on Fox News being the token negro for that agency so I have no respect for sheriff Clarke he's not even sheriff anymore\nWell if he couldn't even hold down a job he said he was going to be the deputy homeland security guy\nNo not not he didn't get vetted not the guy and you're just walking around saying oh but David Clarke share of David ... a B and C come on man who was in I don't know about it\nNow I work from a Congress as soon as he don't they they are they directing their director\nWho David Ho park yeah the right to tell what homeland security\nYou see here's see I Know you're not well Andy here's I Know you're not well sir the guy on loud inmates to die from dehydration\nWell in his defense he said he cannot force feed these people cannot cannot make them drink\nServe there is a person who ... who decides that they do not want to eat no drink fluids inside of a jail I'm a lobbyist for sheriff's office here in Georgia\nYou then recommend any mandate after the recommendation them to go to medical because they are suicidal at that moment that isn't administrators called that always reaches the level of the Sharon\nAsian them to go to medical because they are suicidal at that moment that isn't administrators called that always reaches the level of the Sharon\nAlways so you're telling me that he did not make the medical mandate once they realized this individual was not eating no drinking\nWell what they're doing ... and I respect your role here and what you do in Georgia and I think that's the perfect thing to do what they do in Wisconsin I I don't know what a what role like bay in Wisconsin and how\nDoes it really matter what the rule is are we talking about human decency no not not okay thank you\nI agree I agree with you on that I saw a lot of the cabin off\nThough there is nothing but a political it job yeah ... yeah okay so\nYou're really been camping out the really big Kevin did not sexual assault everybody you think is all made up\nA you know and it's the other\nI mean I'm asking your opinion and they were Marietta and they do you think he didn't do it\nNo I don't think he did it with what I've heard so far okay hope for the light of the sudden I Can't remember how I got to the party I don't remember\nWho do ... past a lot of secular tainted the party was I don't remember\nWhat I see a lot of Jack the let me ask you what you'll be okay with Kevin not taken the lie detector test\nSure but around the after care you know somebody that's like a a a good liar can pass like a while to get their care so that's really\nI made a lot of tech protests have you pay a well I've never taken the exact appreciate your call thank you sir I've just never did that for zero point not to do seven zero three you're getting room to run his main radio news of talk Thirteen eighty W.
