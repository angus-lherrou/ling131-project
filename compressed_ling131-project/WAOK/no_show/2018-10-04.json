gave a great opportunity and some great advice in ... uh in terms of just airing out things right is to make up more credible\nAnd she missed a golden opportunity she didn't have to go into every phase with Jeff to talk about some things to make us that Jeff\nIt's a golden opportunity she didn't have to go into every phase with Jeff to talk about some things to make a ... just in a transparent to be able to to be a credible person\nAnd you gave that you or I mean you you you can't you gave it to a couple of times that I ever and she's still wanted to push back so thank you for doing that for that young lady and not only that all you do the other thing I Want to share\nWith that and I wanted to say this on a personal note she's a remarkable individual I Know I mean she is right and we continue allies the interview through the lens of politics but you separate the politics\nOf the matter is just a really good person so you can't take that away from her\nAbsolutely and I am and I wanted to say this you know out there she still listening\nShe should retain you you know because I feel that she's kind of young in terms of her experience and exposes but some things\nUh she should retain you to kinda guide her you know a lot of times when people go through certain matters in their life to certain ... certain circumstances and situations it makes them a better person they know how to deal with the day's\nShow you were just given heritage is I mean I don't believe a brave vice to to just move forward\nAnd she take that advice she's going to do well the other things at once

and foremost back and forth I saw the whole heart of the ... definitely should be full of full of what will still go way for those that I Know who wants to not think however I did not make a comment about the uh the the young lady will fall\nHeaven and you've got a lot of background noise\nI don't know if his window what how does that matter that's a little better go ahead okay\nTo make a comment to the young lady because I found her to be a little disingenuous as a critical too\nIf I Want to make a comment to the young lady because\nI found her to be a little disingenuous\nAs it pertains to being transparent it feels like\nUm she thought she was coming for a love fest than I did guys have a friendship and she's a nice person and all that but it was within the confines of her running for public office I feel like in order for her to truly a spouse her transformation needs to be more transparent and the brother was like he gave her a\nGolden opportunity to do it yeah and I understand some I don't want to pull\nA over shall I say they don't want to highlight anything that's in a split from grants racing comes on the air and your soul and few showing that emerge from somewhere that sucks\nFact that she said oh his reporting was so unseen correct and then the only thing that she could give support her\nIdea is that he did the wrong state\nBut when her a situation was under investigation that's not wholly incorrect I was going to say those are not the charges I was under I you know there were dismissed he misspoke when he was like\nYou got to be a little more transparent says and the fact that he was so willing to say oh there were supporting the whole heartedly well it's kind of harsh and going on with Brett Kavanaugh we know that they're willing to support somebody in the midst of wrongdoing\nMy son and my daughter in law and my granddaughter lives anytime I Want to do that somebody that represents them is going to be willing to that same level\nOf a willingness to come first shot with Michelle because I'm a go to my brother has that local\nWhen it's time to vote on legislation when you sit in office for your brother\nYour sister appreciate your call we got

man\n\nFor the role for now too to strive for zero three I've been put this in the book by the way I Do this may be chapter five\n\nFour zero Fort Dodge reduce rapidly row three\nOh let's go to Anne in Atlanta and good they\nAre missing all the under terrible here why you're reading a book or you're just using that as a general question um [laughter]\nNo I was making I was making a joke record saying the patch interview that I just had and some things that happened during the commercial break that obviously every one did not have the opportunity to experience\nOkay yeah I appreciate that understanding um you know I I was just having a reaction to the young lady she was unknowingly immature I I I Would like to see a little more distance between her fellow when he is activities and her running for this office\nNow would you say distance like you're talking about Tom was time why how can I just don't understand this one there was no felony conviction based on the interpretation of no law or in addition in addition to that the law itself grants Eighteen year basically a ... year stay\nOn running for this particular office if there was a conviction and remember they interpret that it was not a conviction\nOn running for this particular office if there was a conviction and remember they interpret it ... it was not a conviction so the law says ten years as far as I'm concerned\nI really don't care about any of that I care about the person transformation from anything negative that would compromise them in office and their ability to serve properly and that's it\nYeah I appreciate your your continued explanation of that now that I think about it you did emphasize that with her at the time though the legality of it all night three sheet that um I just think he still needs more time as they say too ripe and she says he struck me as being cocky he struck me is just being immature\nI I just that he needs more time give her another ten years me\nI don't know about the ... than ten years yeah I mean here's been saying\nIt's just because of her personality because of her personal characteristics\nShe she's actually she's a really nice person she's only thirty two years of age and you know I advocate for young people choose the millennial advocate for young people are being held run into office all of that because we knew that\nYeah I Do too but you know she's not you I mean I just think she's just not just as I say this is having that much to offer and and the way of of\nOf of the kinds of kinds of finesse and you you were telling our little about that with this little thing that strikes me I was just not impressed I mean the other thing is I have I have kind of I guess personal disdain for all Republicans\nI'm trying to remember whether this is the same district that and that test or I don't think you may not remember\nWho now say that again that her name was and that Catherine ... anyway she was the first black woman I'm elected I think his cob something and this has been years ago and she managed to to offend some of the white God there and so they literally ran or out of town on the rails\nBut um Marietta um I I'm just wondering how they how ... how the stacks up against the Democrat is there is he running against a Democrat I if\nShe is now just so you know I Will be sending that person and invite because of the equal time claws\nBut I Would not send to before we did the interview because I needed to know how long her interview was before a offered it on the other side sometimes they accept to sometimes they do not but that is part of the equal time clause in elections\nOkay yeah well you you this has been quite and lightning for me I was not aware of her and uh I appreciate the information that she provides as I said um that un she provided but um I don't know I I just found that she was over there and to me I mean she me the keys and charming and all that\nBut he he needs a little more time and a lot more maturation on it just\nYeah and for and for me I'm understanding because\nI've stood next to candidates in her position that have gone through extreme extreme public backlash and questioning and ridicule while trying to do something positive so I understand it from a human context so I get I get it\nBut at the same time you try to figure out ways to navigate this political Mays right ... and I thought that\nShe needs more time to do that I think but it is a very informative and I thank you Bye bye\nSegments and goodbye for zero for you know to to seven zero three you could agree with the rulers man

abstract reason that they feel if she wins\nThey get Medicaid matters the take Medicare that matters and get lower tuition that matters in so leadership matters a leadership may have none of the king says that's called the boycott the rich people might not boycott the new book out your leader\nMost of them were calling the Buckeye because they figured if people don't follow the ... so you have to take the leadership involved risk\nUm but if it's for the right reasons ... and that's the big ... makes a big winning\nUm talk about the conference it opens up a rainbow push I mean this is this is an annual event and that um showcases or um business it also talks about issues to talk about politics I mean you had the one that we were going to focus on a lot\nThis year a voter registration closes out on October nice mhm next Tuesday and or in the housing starts out with ... the next Monday\nThat's that's a big focus a judge who wins that victory in November the six either electrify as a nation it's just a big mess is and my God if she wins in Georgia and Gillum whereas in Florida I mean all bits off\nWhen we're in for a million blacks in the south unregistered today\nAnd two and a half million originally didn't vote for the last time\nSo we don't have the right to the lesson of this we did left not best we've got Trump as a result and so if I buy when he really really want to say about three million votes that are calling the court so if we ... the prospect of winning a against all odds is exciting to me\n\nWhat do you want or are people let's let's talk a little bit about the conference people coming I'm you're going to be dealing with a number of issues or a ... one gonna be leading conversation on justification would would that\nHere in Atlanta and uh you know I Would that last year we had a deep serious conversation but you had all the players in that paper public housing tell people why they should come out uh on tomorrow and learn about on this issue and other issues that's going to be a product\nI think um when you think about gentrification I Know I grew up in the seventies and you know we grew up in an era where they set up the street like come on if you stay out past street light the Boogie Man of catching\nNow to Boogie Man is Sam White uh urban hipsters walking dogs and riding bikes and black traditional neighborhoods\nSo we have to be able to address this this problem in the panel is talking about managing justification that we have to manage it because it's something that is happening and one of the ways to ...\nResidents ... minute Jackson and may I ask ...\nBegin to win in the early sixties some white flight why you know random suburbs early but they found this impractical to live where it costs more to go live in suburbs\nSince the ... is is mostly brings it up a lot of that built on something called transportation and Lance means transportation and so that they'll pay the way the comeback yeah\nWe'd go running out to live next to them they were going to come back to the city\nAnd what we're saying that Rob Jackson is the displacement these ads cities\nNow become the new era for big mama got to live ... now big mom has cut off from grade hospital 'cause she's living way out and Ellen ... she's living out in a fair veal does how does she get their um she's cut off from a you know my sister in law who did the suburbs and I live near downtown\nFrom ... looked at my front door was fifty three miles I Love her\nBut she won't know why wouldn't come to visit as it looked as advertising get asked\nThat's I mean it really it brought home that this really cut you off from your family so in order to get us to come all the way too deep wouldn't at fifty three mile door to door from my house she had to host a Thanksgiving dinner the Christmas dinner fourth of July\n... New Years and she said look if I had to cook for the day to get the family come back out here but I'm just thinking now let's let's look at\nSomebody who did not have a car or who have relied on public transportation and couldn't make it you can't get good public transportation ...\nOf the thing is that in Chicago it's a phenomenon it's new it's Chicago or it's not the the ... and the ... suburbs\nWell since in the city is like the road rules rules been reversed right and it will not kept ... base to we almost did not get an Afro American whether some around uh when I kept it will happen this river since it was the number and\nThen some of us said we have blown that you know I I look at it from the I'm a political or the political now at the same time contemporaneous with we got married and they teach you we are next\nTo the Emery C. D. C. area into the city\nAnd do you know what that we don't live in those areas\nThey're saying the rough numbers about three thousand or the one is out there they got how many thousand students on campus something close to that okay they ... but the but now so if all of them registered to vote that race was that that victory is not even possible and then we are an excellent there\nAre a number of not just in ... in color in the sense that you get people like states in the not limited but when ... when George and said please album and have been football game or its direction I could listen\nIt's ... it's not in films in uniform color and when we were master the big game to them\nAnd then they the is the is in the south you think about that they're not long had been feeling surfaces metabolism Mississippi and I asked her running for US Senator and leading that's a big deal that we couldn't you who lives down the riches use the toilet Thirty years ago\nNobody buttered become us and I remember one time asking a Fowler who joined us beat up you know ... uh some support which as I said well we just ... minutes yet will not yet invented the mayor ... might as well\nA can be used and I'm saying if you all the ... that's your policy they shouldn't even be ago funding Vanderbilt has enough money to pay every behoove this family has ... and\nAnd the residual bills the bills as a mother in law were absolutely absolutely rules for a student going to be or they could take those bills for wheelchair the ... fault\nThat family life is changed forever not just for football game and so that's important\nAnd they can take a page on the University of Georgia I think it was two years ago young man was hurt University of Georgia and they pay for everything while shepherds sending they continue to pay so I think it's a\nIt's time for of antipathy to step up it's time for the NC double a step up and to take care of these players because I mean they are putting their lives on the line and you you you solace to family\nUm you're going to be on the justification panel yes you you've been then there's a green light to go and stop the go to ... people trying to call in now what what do you make of this\nWhat we're doing it and I think he has issued we we have to get a better deal I mean we see the city of Atlanta being gentrified in an alarming rate there is no affordable housing there's really no affordable housing in this deal twenty eight million dollars is a drop in the bucket for a five billion dollar project\nAnd so we're saying that we need if you're going to be Fifteen hundred units we need at least forty percent of those\nThat are affordable housing and not at the eighty percent am are we talking about at thirty percent a Marshall schoolteachers and police officers\nAnd the backbone of this community can't afford to continue to live in this community so that's what we're gonna be told him I met\nUp with them or you know yeah\nOh yeah on the base of going to have a fair form a fair deal and I'm One of the Reverend Jackson I tell people I'm he paid a hell of a price when he left the mayor ship you had to go to Chicago because nobody would hire him here um\nClub sometime leadership requires courage loose those who may regret most sacrifice Oh absolutely a lose lose about ...\nVice because it was you know you ... how are you most it's important that people want to hear that you know yeah but the one that you care sharing is a key and carrying on reasonable sacrifice\nI'm One of the greatest Jesse Jackson speech that I've ever heard I still listen to it and I don't remember if it was eighty eight democratic convention when you talk about what you want to go out with a big ships are\nAnd that the women who are in these hospitals taking care of the sick\nIf they got it they wouldn't have the same bed delaying yeah um talk about poverty even in places like Atlanta ... who bad you know the Bible talks about the week banned it in ... the strong brand new for him\nAnd his other week what what is the state of the comedy now to a game\nLast mission he's all those will we one of the combination of right who want to sit in trouble with the travel and so we will come ... and decency and we have the right to vote\nThat people are more month the money right and you can avoid getting in the ... and the child the school's somebody's missing much like poverty poverty is without that ... is\nThe land the bottom of the world and that's that's the trick your people on the way a ... what was the ... and so fighting for Fifteen on the wages are real deal\nRight people should get paid people should or I should get paid for work\nOr Amazon just got up to Fifteen dollars an hour yesterday I think\nWell I'm a piggy bank off of whoever I'm Jackson was saying that the next to this point of gentrification is the cost burden and you have over sixty five percent of Americans that are paying over thirty

plate um you know ... is with the state conference in double ACP ah one of these issues like justification I mean what what from a public policy standpoint\nUm what are these what are these issues and why should people be concerned about not only that goes but the overall phenomenon of justification\nI think they need to be concerned because this is overall changing the face of the city and and the region\nUm as we have we heard from Reverend Jackson the phenomenon of white flight and now we see justification doing the reverse we see now hum that new people coming into the city and there's not enough affordable housing for the residents who've been here\nYou know forever like you said with grandma and your auntie and all of those people who live there and so when you have a deal like the girls they need to put a real agreement in place that protects\nOr those who you know are not making a large amounts of money you know to have you know affordable housing stock and you know looking at the deal from a lawyers perspective\nYou know when I look at the Affordable housing trust which are seeing my eyes agreed to pay twenty eight million or two affordable housing we have a five billion dollar plan\nUm it's just a drop in the bucket and needs to be renegotiated and then you have equal payments that are made two thousand Eighteen two thousand Nineteen two thousand twenty\nTotally fourteen million and then three more equal payments and twenty twenty two twenty twenty three and twenty twenty four so we're not even talking about fully funding it at the front of you write so my concern was when I was at the meeting with the mayor last Wednesday and she tried to outline his books\nOutlined this proposal or was that we don't even know where the twenty eight million is\nGonna is is is this is Joe ... led to even talk about the meeting a oh yeah because um it would just be honest with you\nUm I wouldn't know ... bottom supporter ... some stuff like this coming right or I mean I just had to tell you my listeners know ain't no big I relived rarely have a say no big\nStays Abrams supporter because I have watched your politics and when I got to worry about when you get to the table mhm would you cut the deal for the masses\nAre for the class is the one of the conversation and\nWe got to have a conversation intra\nBlack folk now I don't even do it here and I called the show too much Ruth ... that some class warfare going on into our own group now that is true um that the black bourgeoisie just feel like\nIn the black elite look we we might have will we like to see I Am route we like we like coffee houses and we like to see a wife or walk their dogs in our neighborhood that means is going to be safe but we like to be able to go to Starbucks and have a narrow ... next to us and\nWe'd like [laughter] I mean if it wasn't even a real I mean it's a money thing your grandma me to try and survive\nI don't believe you get to be river jak they Seventy seven and you got to worry about whether you can maintain the house that pay for just based on the taxes taxes to tell the people I just happened to look near my house\nYou know they build some how Islam woods near me that is so big you could put my little house and there's three times and I'm like now what it does go on sale for\n... ... what is this going to sell for what is this going to do to my property value so at the end of the day we just got to you know you know public ... politics all politics is about public policy and what a attorney Greg is talking about what is the best policy that could come out of this um\nWhat do you want to see happen kid is there'll be fix it do it needs to go back to the drawing board or what what if what happened but advocates say well\nBefore I went to the meeting I Believe that it could be fixed\nWell and I was talking about the meeting itself I lost my yeah is held in a small\nThere's room holiday whoa whoa where did you get half of the people already with green shirt zone people who have never seen before green shirt so yeah they have the room up with you it was\nOnly within the city employees and then the police are there in in force and they're keeping you know citizens out of the meeting I I I Will not but that was disappointing I was one of the fourth try to get into the meeting with other citizens and I was looking at the mayor's face\n... and she looked at first it shocked and then she just kinda sit back and didn't do anything and I I'm sitting here thinking to myself I was going to come here to listen want to hear how this was going to impact the city water an open mind and then when I see how that's like that it takes me ... yeah\nWell people call the show black and white saying they would just point because a hundred yards from net for y'all were\nIs the room that has over two hundred and fifty see the city council chambers where we could have done it in the atrium of they had plenty of seats in there I mean why cram people in a room with Seventy five hundred seats when right around the corner you had could have had\nAble to you know probably about who they were going to try and they didn't know that whole national and know what about housing or jobs in non and\nWell well the fallback position is let's get to the table a let's get to the table and talk about this because they're giving a ten percent equity one minority company\nWe got dead now you got to live within Thirty years down the ... all one Monday we're going to put together I votes ...\nI don't know about that I don't know about that all up\nAnd down on Monday but what I Am saying is I Can't the city being that woody partner uh the city has done him profit sharing and other development for example the positive market much smaller deal but the city\nIs it wasn't a profit share with that deal game so you know the end this point uh we're in a position where we're saying\nLet's keep our eight votes against it let's stop it on Monday and less did at that point negotiate a better deal for the city if that's possible okay\nI generally about what it means going to be tomorrow what time\nMorrow Thursday October for six thirty PM or at first I Coney Baptist church at five forty two moral an avenue south east\nUh so we're asking people to come out learn about this deal but more importantly we're going to have an action item we're going to tell you what you need to do\nYou're doing now and the thing to stop this deal and get a better deal on the table\nI is that the next time the city council meat on the fifteenth\nThat's right that time they made it on Monday or a Monday from on high alright okay thank you\nFor a night to to seven zero three I'm the one this\nKind of stuff happening all over the all over the country I mean you you going to be talking about it tomorrow during your seminar\nYeah let's say in the conversation at least\nWhat people have to understand when you look at the situation that happened in Philadelphia I'm with the two are African Americans that were racially profiled\nA Starbucks that was a A N result that area is one of the top to the ... the surrounding neighborhoods when the top ten or gentrified areas in America\nSo you had a situation where they're Starbucks that area had flips and so now the manager is policing the area because it they don't want certain certain types of people so now you've seen not just there but in after Katrina New\nOrleans a little bit to the new phenomena that goes with\nIs when the wife will come in\nThey want to control the neighborhood association in Atlanta they want to control the MP use they want to control the politics of the naval increase policing they want more police\nAnd that's why ... ... yeah it has a right to the bottom line is it still somebody all\nOver here [laughter] right we need to keep our own them now\nYou know it could be turned agreed agreed okay you did right neighborhood we we all know dirty look\nI just see people coming in and out that's why we got permit padded barbecue back in and uh because it was again now they've been a little no they do not know the culture of our community if I see a child

Conn before that and he's so smart I don't know if you've ever seen him on TV or if you follow him on social media he puts out many films sessions a from a quarter backs perspective and he is as good as say at Tony robo at making\nThe quarterbacks progression and his decision making 'em and his plan all of that uh he makes it so plain and understandable for average Joe and Judy\nAnd so I learned a lot when I watch his videos\nBut he's become a friend of mine to we just met last year and we cannot have him on the show any more because the networks for a competing network but I'm so proud of him and I'm so happy for him because he's doing what he loves and it's a second career for him now and he's worked really hard so why I mentioned the genes territory interview to him\nAnd he said that he happened to be part of a seminar and which team was a speaker\nAnd that that and she was really really eye opening and made me look at rest differently in a good way and they finished with gene is a very bright dude [laughter] and then you guys remember Derek Anderson was a was which was the Oregon quarterback\nAnd then he ... and then he was in the NFL obviously the deer and sent me a tweet actually in response to something I put on a social media about genes territory and I was kind\nOf surprised because not only had I not thought about ... percent a really long time ah Oregon said thank you but I wasn't expecting him to see my tweet I didn't even know it was on social media and he writes back about gene therapy or he's an old timer always enjoyed playing games when he was on the field I mean that's\nIs I think um so that's from inside the football fraternity impair quarterbacks that worked when genes territory and and now in ... case has heard him speak that so I'm excited to talk to gene he's now part of the CBS family though it's relatively new for him\nAbout everything I hear about them into these personable he's likable he's also a guy who can help you to understand what goes into these calls that we criticize up one side and down another and so most of your questions for genes territory has been extremely\nRespectable [laughter] I like that to some of you want to know\nCalls that he regrets or or you know what happens when you make a mistake and maybe I'll bring that up with him but I prefer to stay positive if you know me you know that I I like to\nTo get our guests telling stories if at all possible and I've heard that gene is a great storyteller so I Will be asking about the index card because the story itself with the index card I've heard it more than once\nA day and brought it up to like make sure you asking about the the index card because your listeners will all want to hear about the story and why the index card came out in

path that it's taking and it's true\nI mean that the garde passing numbers and the records that have already fallen and the way that two thousand Eighteen could almost take on this major league baseball type quality when it comes to the number of home run records that had been smashed in the last two years and ...\nTake on this major league baseball type quality when it comes to the number of home run records\nThat had been smashed in the last two years and the fact that we got fewer balls in play than we ever had a major league baseball there are more strike out so they are shattering strike out records and home run records and it's weird it's this trend in baseball that a lot of people are disturbed by including those in the commissioner's office\nIn the end those that um\nYou know that are in charge of the games that are responsible for the health of the game while in football\nI don't know that anybody is concerned about the health of the game so to speak\nI'm and I'm referring to to the commissioner's office and the owners because\nFans like a lot of points you may or may not have realized that ratings are trending up again\nNow the ... to start the season they were about ... they were not dropping anymore and now they're taking upward and it's because we're getting these amazing finishes and we're getting all this high flying death defying action and here's something else when you have\nTeams like what we have in the NFL where when I say a dozen quarterbacks\nHave already know it's more than that it's like half the quarterback from the NFL have already passed for a thousand yards an ... forgive me for not remember the exact number even though I wrote the column you know what it depends on the top of my Twitter page so open it up right now after hours with Amy Lawrence it's pinned to the top of my Facebook page to\nUh but you can find it on Twitter a law radio\nSo half the store owners in the NFL have already thrown for a thousand yards which means what passing numbers pass happy teams\nWhen a opponent is up by fourteen point to the game or a team is down by fourteen poisoned the fourth quarter it's nothing because you can make up that kind of a deficit so quickly when you have a viable passing game\nYeah so it's it's crazy the potential\nIf you extrapolate these numbers and project them over a course of a full season\nGranted guys are going to get hurt they're going to be passing games that that slow down or the drop off the map the weather obviously affects the passing game and a lot of places but let's face it they're also a bunch of dome stadium stadiums that are in warm weather climate\nSo it I mean we're going to track these and and these will be charted over the course of the full year this could be a record setting season and in many cases however\nThis was my tease it is ... it's not the passing that most division leaders have in common so we want to check that out you can do it and people always ask me what do I think about this heat what do I think about that to him well in the column at the end\nAs I'm kind of value it in the first mother\nI pinball all over the NFL and and hit almost every single team with just a one liner but it was fun I enjoyed writing like that it was about all that my brain could manage at that point because I had done all the research and put all the numbers together and my

ahead\nNo I was just saying they're they've been hit the hardest yes and uh some relief has come in but I think we can get it there are ... what we're doing there a little bit faster tell us about your company what do you do uh we're the homeland security foundation of America we focus in on public safety energy security and health and Human Services\nPrimarily what we try to do is bridge the gap between the government in the public we are public nonprofit and ah you know we try to make sure people understand if you call the fire department is going to be a gap a time between when you make that call and they actually show up\nAnd there are some things you can do during that period of time to you know say life and property and just like right now we know the government's come to New Bern we know they're coming in North Carolina but between now and then there are some things we can do to make a difference and that's what we're trying to do\nYou know there's always this lag time when it comes to government response Saddam explained that the people\nThat exist because the bureaucracy you have so many people involved and that bureaucracy always has a layer of protocol absolute ... isn't just a person as a person connected to a procedure yeah and that procedure increases protocol which means it just slows stuff down\nInto you are an expert at streamlining that\n... we try our best to be I mean that's where we get so many people\nInvolved we partner there are couldn't community partnerships we can streamline that process and get help the people who need it\nHow long have you been doing this kind of work a lot I joined the organization in two thousand and seven and so it's been a while\nWhile it for a while while and we do a lot of awareness in a big part of us as a fairness to try and make sure you understand what to do to avoid a disaster before it happens but then also making sure we support after that that that takes place and you need help\nYou are here because you have a heart to serve what in your background created that desire to help other people\nA man that goes back a long long way a typically does yeah I was a really young I was at my mom's

people calls heroes\nI liked what Rob has done here he's a hero and eat him in every community yes and are reaching out and bring things to organization like ours attention so that we can get moving and get behind them in and do something good yeah yeah\nYeah ... had the idea you made the phone calls and play I gather and now we're here but I'm thankful I'm thankful for brothers like you know and

especially when you didn't have much in the beginning [noise] extra job and that's why it's important for organizations\nFor companies for people like you to come together and to get help directly to the people who need it directly to their the government is going to take time the government needs to verify and document\nAnd go through a process protocol bureaucracy we don't have to do that we knew that if we say you need to she wouldn't give tissue and we say you need gas we can give you a NASCAR October searching that's right around the corner\nSo the Lauren Hill concert is on October Thirteen so if you get these tickets today this'll be a great big night for somebody\nRight around the corner and all we're asking for is a one hundred dollar gift card Monday card because that will

doesn't make sense financing symbols of our own pressure is ridiculous now if somebody wants to slap\nA sign on the back of the truck and pay for it that's fine if you want to fly Confederate flag and you're on your property\nThat's fine if you got a belt buckle but says make America great again that's yours that's fine nobody would argue with any of that\nThe issue is paying for it with my money I'm a taxpayer\nI Want to see you are beginning to everybody who was already come back we're filling up these drugs we got pallets we got one palate loaded down we got diapers on the ballot paper towels\nAll kinds of stuff now perishable items what certified riverside park way all sterile Georgia one thirty five riverside park where the beautiful a riverside epicenter this was a beautiful facility\nTo the beautiful facility and as I said earlier any time somebody says were shot I just need a good event facility place I always tell them to the epicenter of this is probably\nThe most underrated you Vince facility location in metro Atlanta this is really a privilege to me are spot and the rates are very affordable so even if you can't make it out here today and courage to check them out of line\nMake sure you look at their prices if you're a person that needs an event done here and they're looking for a great place all of the latest technology\nGreat staff I step and knows how to talk to you know I've had some disastrous situation I've walked away from good deals because people didn't know how to treat me I don't care how good the deal is if you don't know how to treat me\nIf you don't know how to treat my dollars if you don't know how to treat the people I'm bringing we gotta go we have a problem\nI'd rather spend more money this is just real I'd rather spend more money and be treated right they get a deal and be treated wrong because if you don't appreciate me\nI shouldn't allow you to get my dollars\nAnd I know sometimes we say well you know what the data cheap it is [noise] the prices are for double\nBut they also need to know how to treat you\nAnd the way I look at it today is if I were drawn my money from an agency or a company that doesn't know how to treat me as a customer I'm teaching them a valuable lesson if I continue to spend my money wasn't an organization\nThat consistently disrespect for me than what I'm doing is enabling them to disrespect the next person I'm giving them freedom to disrespect the person that comes after me and I refused to do that\nI used to do that because I used to just care about the bottom line which was the dollar and I had to think beyond myself I had to think beyond just me and my experience\nI think for the next person so if I'm getting a good deal of being treated horribly I can make a fuss and CEO paid might've what's going to happen is the next person is going to experience the same thing\nOr I can say you know what I'm going to pay an extra hundred dollars to get the hell oh that's what I'm going to do because maybe this interaction with me actually withdrawing my money will teach somebody\nYou should treat the next person better okay so that's why I wrote down\nOr don't forget a CBS

broke a story about Stockbridge and how the insanity of it all\nIs still permeating through the citizenry when you have said when you have citizens who are willing to split their own city\nBecause black people running the city that's the problem I had the white a white mayor they leave Stewart of Stockbridge the former white male mayor came on my show and I asked them point blank right on my program I said mayor is the city splitting because of black leadership he tapped danced around the question\nA dance around the question the first time I looked at him again as Mr Mayor is the city splitting up because they are now officially ramble all black people he looked at me and he said yeah that was a dancer\nYeah we already knew it but he gave true articulation to it as a man a white male who's the former mayor of it\nAll of a sudden when there's a black mayor and an all black city council the white people in Stockbridge decided to leave now what does that work\nHow does that work we didn't even know this was legally possible is the first time I've ever happen in the history of the United states of America and that's where it's happening in Georgia is happening here\nYou follow all the rules you tell people all you got to do is registered to vote all you got to do is go vote\nWhen you go vote elect people that represent you\nAs you do all the vet you play by the rules and then you realize what they got the ability to change the rules are changing the rules in the middle of the game and there's nothing you can do about it you know why because they owned the courts so when it went to a judge the judge said well you know what even though he's never been done before doesn't mean it's illegal\nYeah they can do it I don't see why they can't do it here's why they can't do it because one of the city was first incorporated it was incorporated as a sovereign city how can you split a sovereign city without the leadership of government\nThat's why it's never been done before but that is happening right now in stock ridge Georgia\nThey try to create a new city of eagles landing I guarantee you this if this successful like creating\nThe new city of eagles landing I'd have been existing city of Stockbridge look next for the city of black kid always common pleas believe it over one hundred cities Sunday resolution and the state of Georgia denouncing\nWhat
