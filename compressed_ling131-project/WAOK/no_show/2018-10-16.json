those reduce them in and and vice versa right talk about why this book is important to you as a really a cultural grill telling the story of what was what is now in what's perhaps become\nFor me as a photo graphic artists in two thousand and third chain um Trayvon Martin happen well two thousand and twelve\nAnd when George Zimmerman was not held accountable and two thousand and Thirteen for the murder of Trayvon I decided as an artist to go to the ground because I wanted to tell our stories from our perspective\nHas for too long we have been looking through the lens of the white male in there too\nAnd I felt that it was important to bring in\nTheir elders that were unknown that were members of the civil rights movement like Loni keen Dr Ross them poke and others and intergenerational lives them with the young people today [noise] um\nYou been to Philadelphia bathroom ruse Atlanta Detroit\nFerguson where was the most interesting place and what was the most of his time or did you

into west Baltimore and I've been to Detroit I've been to Chicago But West Baltimore I felt like I was in a third world country\nI mean I was looking at the landscape and it just caught me off guard

P. and felt like a near flawless performance from that brewers pitching staff from start to finish even with a couple of moments where they face of adversity they were able to rally what did they have to say about their accomplishments on the mound\nAnd the ... have been really improvising almost feels like not just game to game but like getting to ending with their pitching and it almost\nI think has to be a little bit hard to predict issue Dave Robert ... who's going to be on the mound a fermenting to any today she released just seeing how the ... and and ... council wrote it and it worked perfection on the Dodgers side\nUm you know they're wondering why they would overturn with runners scoring 'cause it's right I think if you're you're you're the brewers you can't necessarily count on the doctor's doing that every day um but you know having the for one lead was nice and it got to the point where\nUh the Dodgers had the bases loaded in the ninth inning one swing could've tied it up I mean that's how close was again even to the final score but\nUm it just seemed like council push the right buttons again and and the Dodgers are behind the eight ball now\nWell they say the second time in three games and really in ... other than the Justin turned her home run in the eighth inning game to where they struggle to come up\nWith a hit that shy that would produce with a you know with someone on base with a runner in scoring condition or what are they talking about and that and you know when it comes to those moments\nI mean it it depends on who who you're talking to I guess a\nDodger fans of course they're frustrated and they look at a game like this and connected to every time\nThey can remember the Dodgers not coming through with a runner and scoring position all season I think from the Dodgers standpoint or from the players standpoint that is they can look back at the first two games in the series and say you know game one we were down\nA six nothing I think it was six to one came back I'm sixty five final score games to\nThey were down again to nothing and they came back to win that game and you look at those rallies and there's something to build on there I guess and you know hopefully that confidence is enough to carry them through and the game for\n'em and you know the fact that they won plenty again over the course of the season I I think that confidence is there a little less confidence maybe among the fan\n[laughter] well certainly the fact that they were pushed into very brink\nAlmost forget not winning the west but almost not making the post season and then going to be one sixty three and a and having to win the division like that so yes he faced a lot of inverse any are you surprised that they're only been a couple of home runs\nA little bit um [noise] particularly in Milwaukee I mean that's got a reputation as a hitters park um your money ground all it's having a tough series but I've seen him out\nLike career games at Miller Park um son was a little bit surprised to see the ball not travel was well they're Dodger Stadium is a pitcher's part\nPictures part has been since it opened a Nineteen sixty two and the way the wind was blowing today particularly\n... should be happy he even got a trip off the wall um it did not look like it was going to play remotely an editor saver today um\nAnd then you know you look at the pitching I mean just seeing even though he's not a name pitcher in a pretty solid year I'm In the way that the brewers are managing to patch together and he's with their bullpen you know definitely getting the most out of their pitching staff\nA Walker viewer great pitcher right engine where you probably would have been an all star if he hadn't gotten hurt and Clinton crucial quick\nShot so I

been a couple of runs scored because of the mistakes or maybe not even mistakes necessarily but just not making the play I played ah what is he had to say\nYou know definitely mistakes\nDefinitely mistake I'm\nYou know the fact that we've had to ask us money ground all about\nMistake after each of these three game right in itself a little weird um and and and having to answer for things like ... ... not catching a ball that was related to home plate or a couple of past balls or earlier in the series today it was a wild itch\n... and that that was a tough curve ball Walker and people are even said that you know his fault for putting ... play 'em but\nIt starts to add up and and to hear Dave Robert after the game say that he's going to go to Austin Barnes is back a catcher in game for\nYou know not something that Dodger fans were expecting not something credit counselor was expecting um but look the reality\nIs that when the mistake start to add up at this time of year you can just take it for granted the guys in the bounce back in time um you know David Roberts was pretty guarded in in what he said he didn't want to come down to heavily\nResult speak for themselves and and I think I was enough um but it's a question I think it's an open question as to whether ... for you know all the confidence he expresses himself\nWill have time to turn this around and and to get back starting games behind the plate I think if you were getting better um maybe Dave would tolerate those mistakes but back to the matter is going to all really hitting either and and when you're not eating and you're not catching baseball you're going to play your way out of the light up for a long\nYeah I guess at Grand slam tied the game in the bottom of the night would have maybe help to to

first let me start with something that was a big issue with any kind of died down sure ah terrorists\nAnd I've said many times terrorist is a fancy word for tax right okay explained to me it was happening right now with the ... war\nWell you know we're still actually it's heating up or shut things when China are not good right now things that continue hitting you up and it's a tax on the U.S taxpayer because\nWe're gonna have to pay more for goods and services that we import from China and they're all actually author largest trading partners so things are not good right now it's intensifying um yeah we've cut a deal with Mexico and Canada and they're OK near term but trying to remind China remains the second largest economy on a planet we need to work things out what China\nWhat's the real impact on the economy\nOh a significant I'm not near term but it's significant about electronic stink about horror we think about all the things we import from China\nYou know at one point in time we import everything from China so the fact that there's a resistance there the fact that we're paying more for goods and services means if things like the Trump tax break goes out of the window because we are now paying more for goods and services that we bring in from abroad\nYou've heard me say this before and I think you even agreed that unless the government is fundamentally shrinking there's never\nA real tax break is only attack\nShift exactly and you are exactly correct and what we've done is we've shifted the tax\nBurden to our children and grandchildren down the road we've kicked the bucket down the road hadn't going the way we've simply kicking it down the road\nWhat happened to the political\nParty the Republican Party that was screaming shout do not passed on to my children do not pass this on and my grandchildren now it's as if they never said that\nThat's a great point that's a great point what happens is is the Republican Party party needed an injection they needed a starter so bypassing the tax cuts it gave people a\nA ... a sugar high momentarily Mm that's what right now to put it it's a sugar high but as you know what happens when a sugar high goals the way you feel horrible right\nEven worse than before ... so so now you have an economy that seems to be in the beginning stages\nOf deflate him from the artificial inflation or the artificial injection that we saw through Trump's policy\nNo doubt you're absolutely correct keep in mind that the infrastructure and the economy many lower interest rates are regular regulatory policies that were put in place by the former administration the Obama administration\nIt took awhile before it will be kicked in gear yes they kicked in gear and the sixteenth and Eighteen months of the Trump presidency so naturally he took credit naturally he jumped on that bandwagon say hey look at the economy we have lower unemployment\nWe have lower unemployment and the African American community\nYou know we have lower unemployment overall things are good the stock market's up but you know what that's coming home to roost the stock market is now being very volatile things are slowing down that's coming home to roost\nAs somebody explain this to me uh in my MBA class a little while ago when they said here's how this works\nThe economy you you don't aim to create a thriving economy aimed to create a stable economy right because if you have a thriving economy economy work like rubber bands they snap back and forth so the real push is to create a stable economy would you agree with that\nAbsolutely there are ebbs and flows ... are right now the economy is not necessarily a bad place but there are some significant headwinds let's face it right now you know we continue to have low interest rates and low interest rates are good because it means that housing is still affordable going out and buying a big ticket item is still affordable but\nThat equation is changing quickly you know for the first quarter we saw slow down in auto sales for the first quarter we saw slow down and new home purchases so unfortunately we're beginning to see a slow down the economy now corporate earnings are still good corporations are still making money because they're doing more with less ah there are more efficient\nBut again that equation is beginning to slow down and as it slows down\nWe're going to have some issues\nHas Trump\nDone a good job I Know he's taking credit for some things he may not have had anything to do with I call that politics but take that away has he done a good job of bad job\nAbsolutely not I mean you could have had um you could have had Barney\nIn as president and based on the infrastructure and things that were put in place by Obama the economy would have done well\nUm where we're seeing corporations make money we're seeing unemployment drift down a hiring had picked up significantly no uh it's not like he's come in and turn the economy around the economy was already turning around because it's a big economy the world's largest just like a big ship it takes a while to turn that ship\nI have many women are just had two female
