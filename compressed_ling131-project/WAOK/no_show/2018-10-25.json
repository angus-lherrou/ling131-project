don't\nAnd when I wake up recognition looking at me for a pay cut but\nI'm assuming that you lay down and then when you are going to lay down a lot of Danger Arena what I mean I Am on my mind what I like\nAre you a national is to give him even argue someone come in and you know if you are a Republican or a conservative or are you to a nationalist yesterday as I was debating Shelley winter on the campus of ...\nUniversity I brought up the aspect of what nationalism act means what the actual definition is\nAnd also said\nThat there's a reason why the word nationalist or nationalism has a bad name and even Trump in his speech contractual lives the very same\nShelley winter conservative\nShot back and said that he was a nationalist too and I actually well when did you become a national is because I've never heard you say that\nIs because Trump's in\nFour zero for not due to seven zero three let's go to Tony good day Toni welcome\nHey what's going on good morning was shot how you doing\n... brother how are you oh at first I Want to say because you met you at restaurants everything's great and\nThey were coming Rob a bank you become a man\nA man I Wish I could have been a a fly on the wall to listen to the debate the jihad against Shelley man I really wish I could have been that did you make any type of styles Jones or anything like that or was it record it\nBecause yeah it is actually on the Facebook page so Nicole or my sister and she recorded at Facebook Live you would have to go on the real talk with Richard Richard Page scroll down until you find it man this is in their eyes and already have a lot of views but yeah so she did streaming live I said\nShelly had somebody stream it live as we are connected to his social media and there there were many college students they scream did also\nOkay and then I listen to the debate last night with a shaky and yeah yeah man or what what's a\nLibertarian guy's name what's his head met he was such a deal that distracts me big time only ... what was your purpose\nI mean he's one percent\nI mean for me that's just to put in place to just kinda deviate away from all all of the true facts that need to be brought up between those two can't it it was to be a straight distraction because I kept focusing on this dude it was like what are you doing here you can't even answer questions clearly enough no\nMe as a straight distraction because I kept focusing on this issue it was like what is it still doing here you can't even answer questions clearly enough no offense to him if he's listening\nBut I think they it was a little boring\nA date I I think those two really need to get down to get a little dirty and really explain what their true agenda is to become governor because they're just blaming each other and I know that that's part of the political process but hey I Want to hear your strategy what is it that you actually intend to bring\nTo the table that make you want to vote for you and they're not doing that they're just\nThrowing money that's all they're doing\nYeah it was basically a repetition of their commercials so everything you heard them say was significantly similar\nTo everything you've heard of the commercials and so and I I really blame to a large degree the third party candidate being there because if you had just Stacy and just camp and you would have seen a much more dynamic debate about recently\nAbsolutely because then the true facts would have started to come out but it was even the way the moderator allow them to voice question like he would say well actually you know let the question and the question was actually focus toward Stacy\nI Know exactly why they use their mental sounding board almost right nothing more they don't care about his politics\nRight there yeah it was great I was like some sort of like I thought the question was supposedly directed say yeah right Stacy exactly really yeah come on guys do better than that you better than that I mean we want to know really what's going on I mean\nAnd I'm not going to just give up my vote because I'm a black man I Want to give you my vote because you are in my vote you know it's it's more it's\nDeeper in bigger than that but hey man I was really boring I Hope the next one comes\nOff a little bit better than what it's come off to be I Hope so\nRather I appreciate your call thank you for being involved and all for all of your support man I appreciate it Tony I'm their brother love you would take care love your\nBack home for zero for you not to to seven zero three where my conservative callers\nOne question for you today are you a nationalist too\nThat's it\nI mean stand up and be a proud nationalist today do that Trump has given you cover\n\nFor zero for you not to to seven zero three let's go to Doug in in College Park Doug you argue a socialist Doug you let me ask you that\n[noise] ah no I'm not a socialist I'm a democratic socialist\nSocialist justice Bernie Sanders described himself correct\nExactly well here's what's really interesting you are not sit back and watch and I voted for Bernie Sanders I wanted a few guys are on mainstream radio who will tell you why I voted for okay I voted for Bernie Sanders and I voted for Bernie Sanders for Strategic reasons even though I didn't believe he would actually win the primary\nBut I voted for Bernie Sanders and I remember the phase where even Democrats traditional Democrats\nWere talking about Bernie Sanders is not a Democrat he's not a progressive he's a socialist even though he'd never described himself in that way he's always described himself as an independent in politics and the Democratic socialist in policy he's always saying that\nBut they tried they tried to marginalize his impact by saying socialist why is it Doug eat that Republicans are not trying to marginalized Trump for saying nationalist\nIn packed by saying socially why is it ... that Republicans would not try to marginalize Trump was saying nationalist\nThey that's the thing or are they they ... that the Republican Party or through the campaign of Donald Trump with even than they\nAre being his chief strategist on the campaign that he brought in um all of the the cell phone All right\nFrom Breitbart or even he started and so it's it's a bright or was the platform for the ... right and who is All right well All right are white and that's what they're white supremacists or the day that the Richard Spencer is of the world\nAnd so that's where Trump says he's not just\nSending out a a a dog whistle he's sending out a dog bullhorn for all those people at the Texas rally at the uh watching on Facebook all the all white folks in the white percentage that say yeah Donald Trump is one of them are we are one of 'em for supremacy\nHe wants to ban Muslims he wants to locked up\nRound babies in eight years he wants to continue the mass incarceration machines and uh it's just a seat just ... ... they they what they say now this debate\nFathers when white girl lives on the Democratic and black folk again always told my son don't be messing around with that she will primary\nVoting to keep count was ... and the Republican because we have to protect me an envoy we\nAfford to name white Democrat take us back to the bad old days of rain but he likes centrist is lancing white girl screens right\nPaid for by black Americans for the president's agenda not authorized by any candidate for candidates committee now the guy behind that pack is a North Carolina man named burning Robison Vernon runs an organization called black Americans or the president's agenda that's according to the Arkansas\nTime I have burning on the show today I miss the Robison how're you\nDoing fantastic I Hope\nYou're doing well as well I'm doing very well let me ask you about\nThe content of the commercials on because this is not a parody this was a real commercial airing on Arkansas\nUh area in the state of Arkansas what made you approve this commercial\nWell actually we we finished a thrown on friday and we started the jobs that on a Monday you know which is running through the election\nI got to nobody cares about the jobs that are ... ...\n... ... or the abortion out but\nRight let me get why nobody cares about those that are either say we're in Georgia\nAre we care about the ad that has made national news so it's great that you run into the ads but let's talk about the ad that made national news because we're in the state of Georgia not really involved in Arkansas politics you're from uh North Carolina but what made you put that this time together in a proven\nWell again your listeners should be said man because or all all the ads because they will end up ah defeating Claire McCaskill electing Josh Hawley is in Missouri but in any event we can talk about that later\nOn I was horrified watching the Kavanaugh hearings and actually I was trying to come up with a school choice at such a Democrat or oppose school choice of what I'm here to support the union to\nWant to crush black boys in the in the union run schools that don't teach them how to read right in that but I I didn't have as good a school choice out and I I said wow\nYou know the Democrats and the French are folks running the Democratic party right now and the me too movement\nThat just a pro salt on black men and and the women who love us so let's put an ad together because again a white democratic can't jump they have to get Ninety percent\nOf the black vote in order to get elected in the south and you know with regard to jobs or abortion or [noise]\nPercent of the black vote in order to get elected and the south and you know with regard to jobs or abortion or or or the Kavanaugh hearings there's more than ... percent on black writers who are up are concerned about the fringe positions of the Democratic party so that's\nWhy we put that together it's\nA very effective ad that's why\nI approve the ad because we want it to make sure everybody knows that if I'm In a black folks catch hell with the presumption of innocence Sarah Leah Kurt standard for convection will happen is if you change that if the me too movement of successful and we believe all accusers\nMiserables reasonably miserable I Believe Emmett Till's accusers\nOkay so Mr Robison my response to you is this\nA Brett Kavanaugh current Supreme Court justice did have the presumption of innocence presumption of innocence\nIs a standard hailed with in the confines of the court of law not the court of public opinion\nHe has no constitutional right\nTo become a Supreme Court justice that is a courtesy offered to you\nThroughout the transition and progression of your life and he's reached that status to use in there so there's no question about the presumption of innocence the presumption of innocence is intact for Brett Kavanaugh just as it should be because he has not been charged you know convicted of anything in a court of law\nIn addition to that you add up or claims\nThat Democrats and this was a quote girl white Democrats won't village and black folk again do you actually believe that\nUh we have to answer your face again I ask you there was no trial with Emmett Till should we believe that accuser to white Democrats did\nKnow that that's the reality reality as women hidden out what's ... women have made false\nAllegations we've talked about talked about them this program many many many times before my question in my ... with us and ...\nBut I I Want to ask you the ad takes to test the me too movement saying we should believe all cancers\nNo believe that that's not I do not believe the me too movement that says believe all the kids as well as far as I'm good with the me too movement let me take one good with me too movement because I Know harassment takes place I Know the answer and I know women have been suffering in the highlands\nBelieve all accusers\nI ... I don't care who wears a T shirts that that has nothing to do with my son to me to believe if I Believe a person based on the pirates of evidence I Believe that person for example tend to smile to get caught up in the me too movement to right Pamela Molly lost his job I stand with cabbage smiley\nI think what's habit smiley did was something\nThat is done and workplaces where men worked with women and date them I don't think he did anything outside of that and he has admitted to doing that which was a violation of quoting a two public broadcasting of their internal policy but he got caught up in the me too movement I stand with time and I I don't stand with ...\nI think he's a scum bags and I don't stand with them but let me ask you this well wouldn't you say\nIn the industry new ones team\nFor what you are right because even made jokes about an agri Hollywood knew it was not kept secret because they even made jokes about it and so my question to answer my question is I leave the state managed\nTo that first of all it is a historical fact that'd be ... eight Eighteen eighty and Ninety Seventy every black person killed by when she was killed by a white Democrat\nThat's all right that story that that that is a lie that you don't mind show lodging now that is a lie that every single day every single life ... was killed by a white woman right now that is a good thing or is not the thing and I do have steel\nEvery single day every single like ... was killed by a white woman right now that if it was not you know I Do have still not answered the simple question that you have your own ad hurl why Democrats will be lifted life over again do you believe that\nThere there are all kinds of are wintering do believe that there yes there are all kinds of lynching\nAre we we got the other side on hold on I'm coming to a break I got a few more questions hold on for me we'll come right back to you\nI'm a Muslim went life sentence was lynched\nYeah so hold out for me so we're going to get all that just you don't hold your horses man\nThat is burning a Robison the man behind a this ad which I stopped is run on friday in Arkansas are he represents a conservative\nKnown as black Americans for the president's agenda\nWhere we got all the other side for\nZero forty not due to seven zero three you did agree with the mantle radio this is shifting\nTo hear when I'm up on the street fighting crime I'm listening real talk with a real real is minutes waiting\nFor you to teach him a new tree or news and talk to teen eighty double you\nIf you don't dispose of the unused ... prescription drugs in your home they might think they knew when they get into this place stolen or simply into the in whatever the case I don't see the dealer keep them clean them out with them at the U.S drug enforcement administration's national prescription drug tests on\nSaturday over twenty seven and ten am UPN defined to collect sci fi DEA take bump that term that's da take on dot com\nWendy what a spot that burglar when he's case in your home or after easy when asked John who's blink camera alerted him a burglars trying to break in while he and his family were home or Shannon who's blink camera ... feet stealing packages both times blink video clips were sent a police to help convict the crux\nBlink motion activated indoor and outdoor cameras are wire free set up and minutes and run on to double aid batteries that last up to two years\nAnd the live feed option let's check in from anywhere using blink smartphone app so you know when your kids get home from school no contracts know subscriptions totally affordable and blink works with Alexa\nBlinks camera systems are back in stock and right now they're Fifteen Percent off that's right Fifteen Percent off all security cameras\nVisit blink protected dot com slash radio for offer details that's blink protected dot com slash radio link is an Amazon company limited time offered terms and conditions applied\nIn this week playing great deal of all ... like buy one get one free\nOn hundreds of vitamins and supplements the healthy stay healthy get ready for that big game was sixteen ounce blue diamond elements regularly nine Ninety nine now just five Ninety nine card looking for a sweet deal select Hershey candy bars just two for one dollar with card get great deals on the essential you need right here at your neighborhood ...\nTrusted since Nineteen oh one not supplied land restrictions and he listens apply seats are pretty town\n[noise] and the kid in grade school pain through phases blue and white before every home game is the accounting field give 'em their friday ... read the cashier at the convenience store where schools' colors on every game day what makes high school sports here in Georgia so special\nThank you thank you brother four zero for eight not due to seven zero three\nYou're getting ready with the realism and radio news to talk to her ... eighty W.

I\nGot another one where they do so watch out it's going to be owned W s will be three days before the election date okay\n[noise] well they only got so much time it's like yeah that's when they got to do states is that a candidate now but I mean no ... no for more for the comic\nArt peck your brother later appreciate your call for zero afford not to to seven zero three\nI mean it was an interesting debate it was interesting because Stacey Abrams as\nSharp and\nSpot on as she was I made a very articulate and a very dynamic in her ability to land point I mean she could really land the plane right on the runway chip was playing defense we ... we never ... we've\nAlways allow people to vote now these people can vote if they want to vote\nFor him for a minute to sue seven zero three and I've debated Brian Kemp on CBS forty six news replace some of that yesterday\nI'm On the floor with the guy that did go viral people actually thought I was running for governor as well and I was

report not due to seven zero three letter Jarvis indicator Jarvis good they welcome\n... good brother how are you man yes\nI have a we can debate there though it's going to be out\nOut cast wait a minute so we got to for outcast zero ...\nI'm a little bit about visiting la hay\nAnd right but if you had to make a choice is outcry okay\nRight I mean you got like ... like I say no no it felt like both talking about real is a very social factors brother but uh yeah just like ... the and I'm an outcast lay\nIt out of hand Albert okay All right we loved your votes are All right yeah I Would go on YouTube rather appreciate your call\nAnd smoke a joint I mean that's just there's a simple as that can make it and for a young man can not be bothering anyone sitting in the car and who's not even to say they were smoking marijuana but for someone to call the police on them for sitting on a car\nAnd ... ... lives lost a futures totally destroy the police officer\nAnd this young man um it it it's just it's crazy and I think that when we talk about nationalism when there is no for any child that's out there or do that it plans to do something and I believe this young man fear for why and that's why\nAppealing to lease officers in my estimation did not allow him to come out\nOf that place alive because he shot a police officer are they're killing our children wholesale over and over again and they should fear for their lives because they're they're just just fixed that show that day I die\nYou say all over and over again and they should fear for their lives because they're they're just just fixed that show that day I die\nBut this young man rather than go on to a shared somewhere he should have went to a mosque or a church somewhere and say I'm ready to give myself up and therefore he may have been able to make it out alive and and support a case that he feared for his ...\nAnd did it and that becomes a real conversation that people should have with individuals who I wanted that if you don't control the dynamics of your\n... of you turn to yourself and if you don't control that dynamic you could die I had a situation not too long ago with my good friend her room and her room had a frivolous warrant out for his arrest okay this happen or maybe two months ago\nMhm and her room gave me a call and I called everybody I knew\nTo arrange his surrender dry and then we created a public ... public rallies\nAnd I walked whole room into the Fulton County jail personally\nRight and I told him I'm walking you win today and I promise you I Will walk us in a few days after that we walked the brother out okay but what could have happened he could have had interacted with law enforcement\nExams something else would that he could have been at a rally himself protesting for something that's right and somebody ran his name and something else would that they could have kicked in his door for the board right do you got to control those variables when you know that this paper owned you like that\nIn this this speaks to nationalism I call this program and others because of that very concepts nationalism we have no nationality in this country and I chatted with you and go back and forth\nAnd it is let me just take it to the international level and closing when you look at Africa the continent\nAnd you look at the intrusion the antelope or the Chinese data down now what did they trading one white\n... a superior race that being white folks to know the white race to Chinese they both white slanted I asked why are they still have the same agenda\nThat agenda is to create and use the resources that country for their own particular purposes because there is no nationalist agenda on the continent of Africa\nWe continue to allow these internal offers to exploit us we rely on our children to be killed right in front of our face right here in America why we've just vote for is a part of their system that continues to do it\nAnd I I tell you for the life of me\nAs a country boy cotton picker small intellect individual\nWhen I look at these people who continue to support the very people that are ... and taking their chosen and marginalizing miss educating and they continue to want to join them\n[laughter] I as I think we get what we deserve and here on the continent of Africa you got the very same thing going now and this development is actually destroying the environment\nFor the reach of the richest of the oligarchy or systems that set up in America China and other nations and it's crazy\nThe riches of oligarchy system that's set up in America China

team says you know organizations now kind of either playing for the future or try to stock for a run at the play offs and the big one of course is a mark Cooper and and the Dallas Cowboys giving up a first round pick forum\nLet's look from the raiders perspective first what happens inside the locker room when a guy like that is maybe not blindsided they might be too strong a word but all of a sudden he's there\nAnd then he's gone and you guys are looking around going what\nI mean well one I I've been I have not done or the as you know what you know what I had been part of the pretty crazy um I was there in Green Bay with\nThe whole far in a row to deal um that'd be uncomfortable but Elise\nWith us we knew what direction the organization was going to\nYou know 'cause we we were like do we just came off of oh it was one of the soup bowl we love the giants far [noise] but um at least we can do as a whole organization were director will go to in Oakland I have\nI mean right now yeah they're collecting that's but who picks who say who says you're going to drop another ... ... you know all of them are Cooper and obviously those words going around about the car so\nI mean will they have they have a plan you know obviously and the and that word we've got to take risk but\n[noise] I don't know like for a few signs of budget\nThirty five year olds and then I Would really everybody is really love the young guys it's crazy\nAnd there are obviously people who are coming out and criticizing car saying he's crying calling him Abad leader but you got guys inside the locker room her standing up for his for him and how do you circle the wagons when that's happening when it feels like everybody from the outside is again just to\n[noise] um well once again it depends on\nWhat's going on in the new groups you know um [noise] ... ... who\nAre the the true leaders in the building I don't know I have one guy say about this let me just just say what it is you know what I'm saying that's why I Love I mean when I think the title of literally Smith who spoke up about right\nThe whole thing about um car being a cop and a real leader I mean he he looks scare you look what he was a mess around [laughter]\nYou know ... there's been it was truly protect the 'cause right now you're you're it's kind of depressed that you didn't expect you know press from the coach press from their management personal phone office of the things that you're not used to [noise]\nAnd the case of the raiders they've got one way in the case of your former team the giants they've got one when and what we're hearing from the coaches hey we're not taking this is not preparing for the future we're still going to try to win but internally that how does it feel\nMore for the raiders I mean you can say you're not ... I mean you're you're talking to your best players and you're getting a bunch of her from ... um ... maybe for more move there trying to make maybe ... organizes her team for the giant it's really interesting because that's a talented team on paper\nThat may be for more move there trying to make maybe he's trying to reorganize its heart team for the giants it's it's really interesting because that's a talented team on paper you know you're like man they have the on off as you know you got old older shepherd and say corn you know we can still say you I even though people are ugly him angrier\nYou're like man they have all the talent right now to do was blessed with things and defense too that they they have a really good even slow on paper so I don't know once again maybe the the whole leadership thing the nucleus who man it's crazy I totally caught me off guard [noise]\n[noise] I'm outlets I'm shocked about Minnesota I thought they truly would be a\n... one of if not the most dominant defense um and also [noise]\nUm but they shocked me in that regard Jacksonville a as advertised I'm as they were okay but I think there's two of them yeah I'm as expected\nBut yeah you know a lot a lot of the defenses have have battled for injury so\nYeah I'm as expected but\nYeah you know a lot of these events have have have battled for injury so um that's been that's been interesting but Chicago finish I think talk to him last year in public without giving up in the ... five right now which is once again no one really Rosa\nIs there anything you miss about playing out a couple of years anything you know I you\nKnow one thing I I Love and I identify players and I I Love playing like physically um cable like I feel like ... if somebody did with the ... right now\nI but I think I think mentally ours is over you know just the politics ... because it ended up not being so much oh he's not out or God was looking for a lot of concern about like playing though like\nThey just they want who they want ... ... you know it's like some of them go somewhere and and apply it would be qualified will be overqualified for a job and it still doesn't matter\nYou know so I just got so tired of fighting everybody I worked for four teams and they're like oh you know we're going to go on and then the young guys uh messing up\nAnd then also you know while yet we I think we need veteran yeah that's the whole point\nYou know [noise] so I just I just got real exhausted oh just the politics you know I did it for twelve years and I was like you know what I'm ready to I'm ready to be home a

I'm sure I'm real quick point is if they want to get rid of the reasons they look like a quick point about saying well we're sure to watch um\nOh is that the game and he has really been weren't that over the last three years raiders fans are horrible number one issue with that loss people\nAre taken is and again I was there so everyone in the stadium space which school you know call time out\nBecause the more they lined up to kick that extra point was as if they were rushing still at one point and operating in St overloaded the thought of it as we are standing on one side\nAnd something just didn't feel like everybody is you know scream at ... but it is well this is a\nI feel like okay Justin Tucker felt like he was rushed\nAnd felt like he wasn't ready to show proof he's at his responsibility at the same time how many other of those two hundred and twenty three consecutive point after attempts do you think the situation wasn't quite perfect wind was blowing\nGuys were rushing maybe didn't feel right I mean it's it's a guinea ... it's still a if I can lay up in basketball it's still something he could do in his sleep probably with his eyes closed\nSo yeah I mean I get what you're saying if it's a long field goal and it just it felt like things weren't right or you know something was going to take away from his kick he could have but there's no way\nIt was so yeah I mean I get what you're saying if it's a long field goal and if Justin felt like things weren't right or you know something was going to take away from his kick he could have but there's no way he's going to use that in this as an excuse\nSo low enough let me take the time to recruit them you know it's again I agree with you just work as a personal issue with John herbal its moments like that that happened you know to look every\nRude okay it's not horrible assault that Tucker miss a cat [laughter] so it's not the all time out of Sonia\nFrom that because the flow of the game and the way everything is for the touchdown and it was almost as if everybody was saying well slow slow down so to regroup all time off and just\nYou know I think that it would I mean considering that you'd want to get that point of the board as quickly as possible so that you could make sure the game was tied and send it into overtime\nBut ... ... what was the Carolina\nI'm a truck with its bubbles going up and the defense of wind will cause issues\nFor and the players are quote on on you know end up being a good position of equation I Want to get it so that you were you on the road a score from twenty four twenty or twenty or something because\nAll right thanks so much Tony I appreciate your phone call\nYeah I feel like this particular game or the ravens defense has played well now early on the eagles looks great Carson went switch great in that game\nI remember going back to two week number six and Thursday Night Football for the eagles but I felt like it would be a turning point for them because finally the often looked so comfortable and when ... looked like he was in a position a ... to ... back in that flow that earned him MVP\nConversation last year before he got hurt and to Philly is up Seventeen nothing early in the fourth quarter and the Panthers start cooking and they get those three touchdown drive in a row meanwhile the eagles stumble and and cars and said I'm not really sure what happened we just took our foot off the gas\nAnd they had a pair of ... I think one of them was a three it out the other one was maybe a handful yards they maybe got one first down and then the phone bill which of course was the the game clincher there but he looks so

New York also in Westchester\nSo certainly something very concerning here is going on uh the FBI's joint terrorism task force is heavily involved\nIn this investigation with the secret service and local officials and obviously we don't know a where this investigation stands if this is connected to the pipe bomb that was found the ad George Soros was home but clearly a serious investigation here at this point Jim\nAll right ... right to the top Thirteen needed W okay what do you make it and who you think would be behind this\nAnd or is it just another one of those distractions or\nA ... a forty five ... ... you know despicable lacked in one of the spokespersons ...\nYep yep so most of the act of terrorism you know black people got a lot of experience with the bombs and I was on the\nBus and I'm traveling with us this weekend was where the ... we're talking about the history\nOf Birmingham of what they call bombing ham millet so many\nBomb attacks there\nThat was used for everything from voter suppression to\nOutright Tara may\nWas big big some dynamite\nUse for everything from Boulder suppression to\nOutright camera they stick sticks of dynamite underneath a your front room porch they blew up the home of a fringe shows words and Dr King's own bone and\nSo this has been a way of terrorizing people for a long time it is not anything new for oh four eight nine to two seven zero three but what do you make of this\nAnd who you think will ultimately be responsible for it or do you think they'll find out who's responsible for use in that many devices now with all of the sophisticated technology that is available\nAnd that we probably should be able to find out who response with is about thirty minutes we'll see what happens let's go to our phone lines that go to a mark on line one mark how are you\nMr Bowles money mhm [noise] I'm Around very upset about these bombs in ... but as\nLong as they don't want to be a predator and his pregnant wife [laughter] I don't want to see them get hurt or Mr both men and who is what kind of white Persian have\nOh okay I thought his pregnant wife\n[noise] no pressure there man I hate to see what you\nThought about to go ...\nHappened right after he declared that he should know there's no he was saying that guy\nI don't know that's why I'm asking you all do you\nWhat I tell you Mr mode [noise]\nI don't want them to hurt him because you know him and his pressurized they mean so much to all of Russian\nPeople all over the world alone\nBy remembering\nIt kind of same to me Mr bone man\nThat he might be a main disease bond is getting a millionaire so proud of him mhm when you've got\nTo me well why would you say that would make you think he support it would be one\nCaller just like you say when you open your show roller ball you were talking about how there's a thank you use the word didn't use the word incendiary word\nYou know that you get in the air\nAnd yeah you know why you should be were married look you said in the rain\nHe won they look like I say don't hide that man called him and the wife so precious to all of us are seeing this man\nI thought he had more respect what I'm saying [noise] okay okay ...\nYeah you're right that go to Mitchell in South west Atlanta Mitchell\nOkay I'm Still not follow up after that but I'm the baby yesterday I did not win money last night 'cause I don't know I I if I Want it nine hundred million Derek yeah\nTennessee State would be ranked as probably the top not H.

W E okay [noise]\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n[laughter] [noise] [noise] um\nI knew just what happened and I really knew I got to tell you this I must say that it took way longer than I thought Megan Kelly\nMegan Kelly\n\nIs now in trouble because she was racially insensitive and I got to tell you this you gotta give the woman credit but taken this long to show her true colors I expected this to happen way before now but here it is later the gentleman\nBasically Megan Kelly said that she doesn't she doesn't see anything wrong with wearing black face\nWhat's the big deal\nHer show is in trouble or she is exerting believed that she's hired a new law firm I think that I think the old from just dumped her but she's going to have to fight she will have to fight NBC\n\nDrama comes after the host of two days nine o'clock hour defended blackface during a segment about Halloween costumes claiming that the that the practice\nWhich really has roots in on the nineteenth century minstrel show there was really really insane and we broke down on the show\nImmediately and then was did federal ... air she apologizes and she just will you go [noise]\nMichelle I'm Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\nYou may have heard that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes and that conversation turned or whether it is ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another a black person making their face later or a white person making their darker\nTo make a costume complete I defended the idea saying as long as it as it was respectful and part of a Halloween costume it seemed okay well I was wrong and I am sorry\nOne of the great parts of sitting in this chair each day is getting to discuss different points of view sometimes I talk and sometimes I listen and yesterday I learned\nI learned that given the history of blackface being used in awful ways by racist in this country it is not okay for that to be part of any costume Halloween or otherwise\nI have never been a PC kind of person but I Do understand the value in being sensitive to our history particularly on race and ethnicity\nThis past year has been so painful for many people of color the country feels so divided and I have no wish to add to that pain and the fence\nI Believe this is a time for more understanding more love more sensitivity and honor and I want to be part of that\nThank you for listening and for helping me listen to [noise]\n\nUm do I want to say two words\nI'm Sorry no you argue about to lose their paycheck matter we understand exactly what you're sorry about\n\nI Wonder is measured generally sorry for the comments she made on Fox News now on Fox News she said some ... things some things that were quite insane and showed her stance\n\nOn issues of historical race because she did proclaim that Jesus was actually a white man\nOn Fox News you were playing but she also proclaimed that Santa Claus was a white man and she said you know children that just is what it is he's a white men Santa is white center is fictional\n\nBoys he wrote for eight nine due to seven\nZero three but I got to tell you\nShe gets the effort because you're young and they're much longer than a ... but ... did you apologize for this\nIs sleep they have a piece on dot com and Santa Claus should not be a white man anymore yet another person claiming\nIt's racist to have a white Santa you know and by the way for all your kids watching at home Senate and just is white but this person is just arguing that that maybe we should we should also have a black Santa button you know Santa is what is and just so you know we're just debating this because someone wrote about a kid\nBut first of all married to your show came on at ten o'clock at night what child is watching your program I mean goodness that's child abuse and she pauses justice eight kids\nProgram I mean goodness that's child abuse\nAnd she pauses justice say kids wait a minute children that this has gone too far I'm standing out on my ten o'clock show on Fox News talking to children Santa is a white man it is what it is really Megan\nMegan really\nMegan you do know he's for play play you do understand Santa comes from a place known as la la land and make believe\nBut she needed to make sure that children understood that this was a good white man that they're trying to make black a main appalling and here's what was interesting about that entire show I remember the show I was watching it in disbelief\nShe had three or four of the people on the program with her and none of them stopped to say wait a minute Megan Santa clauses whatever people wanted to be\nBecause they just want to be on television people who refuse to stand up to ridiculous news on TV or people that simply want to be on TV\nThat made it a reporter all of the question like so what you're basically like the position that you're taking it out of a national you believe it or not to say okay well if that hey there if I'm about putting America First Republican\nWhere you are so Jason let me correct you you are incorrect on that note because he was given a stump speech and in the stump speech he said I Am a nationalist now he did attempt to conjecture lives than he means America First and that's why I played the entire clip that day and he said because I wanted people to understand\nHis attempt at contacts but then my question is to his attempt at context when he says I'm speaking of America First well which America are you referring to it we know this in the United states of America\nThis is a country this is a nation that contains multiple nations that's what it is and I'm listed\nAs an African American there's another person listed as a Latino American somebody else is an Asian American Hispanic American so the question becomes what America is he referring to because we adopted the word rightfully so\nWe adopted the word patriotism\nRather than nationalism he has now adopted the word nationalism over patriotism that's ...\n... and I understand that that line of thinking but in all fairness\nIn every circle that mentioned when you even get into the work patriotism there are people that fire their critics that find that or even to be somewhat incendiary a because they feel as though that just the cohort were or you know that you know a necklace basically\nSo yeah and I and I get you on that if people do but I I Believe that liberals progressives do to promote the ideals of America and those who challenge the ideals of America are just as patriotic as the other I Believe that\nNo I agree and and listen and we and and we people of color and all the other callers have fought and died for this nation and have given more so now that monitor and and I understand that but I truly think that it's dangerous man when you were an air at worst amass it and I think to be quite honest with you I Would say\nNow twenty five percent of the heap praise on himself you know with with his tone and you know some of the way that he does this thing but\nA lot of it this day and that ... has to do it this way it's like they're being twisted in his\nImagine if George W. Bush would've said I'm a nationalist\nI hate it when general magic ... I didn't like his politics I actually I said many times I ... I thought he was a really decent person but I did like some of his politics but imagine if you would have said that if he would have said that he would suffer the same ridicule is Trump\nMan with ... when Bush was in office especially even though it is so funny how things come back circle full circle but with ... you know that was ...\nI Know everybody everybody loved tons of the black community not ... we're just regular and let the public drowning Katrina you know come on man like much\nUnderstand that errors in society are interpreted different because of men and women behavior the behavior has changed Kanye has an absolute change behavior so people would respond differently\nDifferent because of men and women behavior the behavior has changed Kanye has an absolute change behavior so people would respond differently here but\nIt's not like George Bush with the guy that was among communities of\nColor no 'cause they're not a general agree let me ask you this man let me ask you this yesterday I'm looking for leadership from the president of the United states on this whole package thing this device our thing right and the head of providing immediate leadership he decides to take that opportunity\nTo ... one marginalize the people who've received a bomb because he referred to them as high ranking government officials ... these are former presidents of the United states of America he did not refer to them is that he said former\nHigh ranking government officials that's on humans aren't there\nI think I probably was aware of incompetent you know people like the Congress man I think holder was involved\nBut he but he couldn't help me out of each other today including he could have been so he's a smart that right you believe he's a smart guy he could've said including to you a form of United States president but in addition to that he'd been decided to once again ... due to a vilified does in the media\nRather than calling this an act of domestic terrorism instead of saying that he decided\nTo make CNN a villain in this entire narrative explained that to me\nHere's here's my question my question is this and this is just ... original point okay that would get bored I'm telling you that I don't believe that this\nI think this is all a game that was concocted because I truly\nBelieve that with all these people can eat things at the same time some of them by courier some of them didn't even comfortable some level you know\nWait a minute okay a scheme could talked about who\nBought bought the left on his theory is right now yeah and then my theory is right now sir yes what evidence do you have of this\nMe out just hear me okay area understand we totally disagree on right and I and and I'm not even a ten or ... guy though but\nI Do the ... when he won now no\nNo no I think that I think that the Democrats and liberal have they're pushing all their chips into the middle of the table on these these ...\nBecause it's just a lot hanging in the ... you got the whole situation with them wanting to impeach trauma you got the cabin all day so listen I truly believe in ... and I feel I've given credit yes well I think the cabinet are playing with a party I think this whole thing with the with the people\nMight say what do you think about these devices\nI'm saying that it though if it was somebody that really wants to hurt someone a lot of these devices for what they're saying didn't even have a a triggering mechanisms on it was just to get the care and the call or two that hey we are the attack and all these people who will come after you basically have criticized Trump openly\nBottom on getting need you need packed and so they could\nPoint back to him an exactly what happened because people are saying that this is all across all I'm just simply saying man\nYou know you you know none of them said no no no nobody and all this all around the same time you know I mean it did to what would be the motivation for some ... we're going to do that to them because ... and all these people are evil yeah but this close to the election\nYou you asked ... what could be the motivation that could be a motivation would you not agree that try calling them actual cleaver personified is possibly a motivation\nThere will be but if you're that you're that politically is to know that\nActual personified is possibly a motivation\nThere will be but if you're that you're that political you know back then you also know that the new coke at Berkeley affect your your interest in who you you know if you want to support John I'm under the bed\nAnd you know it's amazing and Jason this is you guys are remarkable that they said it's almost it's almost as if you all the X. men and you're a superpower\nIs the ability to twist facts and make up things in order to ensure your president is painted in the ... not to\nJust say well you out is the only role but labor can be on the other you really had a negative fifty percent evidence do you have less than zero evidence you know you you don't have the evidence that happened\nThat will be bombed split in the mail\nOr democratic [laughter] that you

Mario Mario good they were [noise]\nTo morning how are you hope you can hear me okay\nI can hear you will the morning to you also\nGet to um a couple of things I Want to talk on a let me start with a Megan Kelly and what I like to suggest\nI Would love for you to reach out to Sarah Glover see that the president of a BJ National Association of black journalists which came out in strong opposition\nSay the name of it in celebrate got it All right go ahead\nShe is the president of in a DJ and then they'd be J came out uh when she was with Megan was given that time slot you remember\nThey knocked a top rated show off the air featuring el Roque or cameras hole\nAnd there was a huge uproar when this happened because again\nHammering at our show was was the top rated show in that time slot and everybody was shocked when they came in and set the hell with all we are putting backing him this time slot so it was a huge uproar at that time\nA distinctly remember it because a lot of us it in a BJ were very upset about it and we made it very clear NBC\nOr how we felt at the time so I agree with you Americans should have never gotten that show except for the fact that she's blonde hair blue eyes and I saw that matters I mean the woman when you really boil it down to a baseline level\nThis will be a revealing conversation with the big homey db and I want to see you there myself and they're both ... in the same room at the same time with our listeners we want to see you went to build that is to knock seven o'clock let's go to Deborah into a Deborah ...\nHighly satire I'm ... I'm beautiful\nI wanted to speak on Lake and um let this be a lesson to a lot of parents uncles nieces uncle a cousin who ever used to really start explaining what the meaning of Christmas really is\nThat's number one and and and anytime you get an opportunity if you want you still want to engage in the Santa Claus\nYou should take your child gets like you want like when you see like you got to talk about this all this high where the young I'm black children beautiful black children or children of color I still choosing that blue eyes a Barbie a blind Barbie doll\nIf you want your children to see things differently you don't depend on people like making a Fox News you first of all I just tell them the real meaning of Christmas\nHow Christmas came about and you take them to a representation of the Santa clause that you want them to represent ... in you and your family especially if you like Christmas color that's all I'm spend it on her because\nIt's the aprons is winning I Believe that just like Brian Kemp\nA wide and it has to do both he is a criminal first of all to me he should be in jail and I'm very upset that our current governor has has spoken out against blind camp I'm very upset about that because I um\nI I tend to like our current governor by the fact that he has not said anything of weapons to fry camp and everybody I'm telling ya every body of if you travel if you go to different states and you go out of the uh different states everybody's talking about Georgia we look so bad right now one reference to the children\nUm the human trafficking and the merging of children is still high in Georgia and too because the blind camp and I don't believe the polls ugly safety is plenty and if you are part of the L G out on the other let us not to be disrespectful I don't know\nBut in reference to what Trump just is is trying to do you definitely should go against Frank and Russia I Know because you always say talk about your moral compass but I Want to say this because a lot of 'em\nAnd and I'm I'm going to say that because it's true a lotta Caucasian white women put this\nThe United states where we are today in reference to voting talked into office and uh and and I stand with you when you would would you do the leads me to me to organization I stand with you when when they come out and they say they're starting to do this but they don't want to air time I listen to somebody like Tea Party lieu\nWho makes absolutely no sense it just tells me that they have known that they have no moral compass and if they stand behind Kim because we already see what he's got in and play for Jordan's still involves he has um he has no respect or value for women and he's on a pilot everything to Trump\nTo the dime for the LDP of community\nSo I just feel like if they stand behind net in this election I'm done with them\nI'm done with giving money to the organization I'm Don Was supporting their campaigns\nI'm done with I'm giving money to the charities that went down because they will just show me that they don't care what the process is even though\nI'm there are being treated and started type of way and I and I have to keep talking about this because they're not talking about this but they're not even talking about the fact of how many of their children had been raped and molested in their churches that they still go to that they're still remembers too and they still have those children going to and I wish I had the money and the time\nI Would investigate to see how many of these people who had been\nWhat we call 'em the shooters how many of them were Catholic and and then they went to those Catholic churches\nSo at some point I just feel like I'm I'm just going to be done if they don't wake up at a fatal a vote the right way in reference to camp and that's just my opinion and I know everybody has their own opinion I Love this show\nBut I'm just tired of it I see the news that just think of of of your family member waking up to a bomb all battles Trump already dealing with Trump\nYup Deborah appreciate your call thank you ma'am thank you yeah this is to go\nI mean I don't think she took the

concept of God and to Caucasian class which is also a sack religion and a violation or misuse of what is sacred according to the first commandment\nAnd I believe that\nIt also has done a irreparable damage to the psyche of Caucasians as well as Christians of color throughout the world and I believe it's a direct\nConnection to that to the conscious or the unconscious perception of self as it relates to what is who is inferior who is superior and inferior especially as it relates to the\nUh to the black church is most grief is that they're not a\nMade a public or they're not ... of it because we were most effective in a negative manner or or did I miss the proclamation to your knowledge\n... no not at all you did and I miss the proclamations she did come out and basically say that she didn't mean to offend in the body but then she said the the race of Jesus is not settled and that was it\nRight but the proclamation is rest upon the church leadership\nHere's what we know we know he's not white right but\nThe church leadership who we identify many identified Jesus is being not only a a a profit or messenger but God and I believe in the old scripture arrested him on the concept of truth with young users proclaimed isn't true Prius\nHybrid with the church obligated if this has been made known now that this is a lie to publicly announcing that old concept\nI agree brother
