K. A. F. R. E. E. have a good time\nFor zero point not to do seven zero three that gives you the conversation is going to say I'm In south west Atlanta Sam what ...\nWhat's going on our side than a yes or how are you man I'm good how about you know that's a great brother hey man I was listening\nTo the topic last night on another one of the shows on stage did it so representatives own that at our policy is is what the Atlanta and they were talking about adults and I'm trying to see some of them mentioned some names are who aims to make money off of the deal as somebody brought up for him he said\nI wasn't sure if you go into thing about it but why do you think of land is pushing this deal so hard\nThere are multiple reasons why Atlanta is pushing this deal some of it has to do with legacy\nMayor Bill Campbell transformed public housing you've had other mayors do things like Maine or has the airport I think Shirley Franklin Atlantic Station and\nA casino read obviously his massive development and uh the stadium\nSo this would be a legacy bill now wouldn't create opportunity and jobs yes all of that is very true and it would have a dynamic impacting that undeveloped area of Atlanta\nBut the question is how much tax dollar how much how much tax dollars are going to be involved so I think part of this is a push for a legacy of push to really see ... the legacy\nOf mayor bottoms and also there are people who still believe this will have a net positive in the city there are others who believe that we have a net negative and that's the argument\nWow I Know it seems like Atlanta looking to have everybody making at least a hundred thousand dollars each house so bringing on at least a hundred thousand dollars but the that usually attracts other companies and\nOther people all over the span I hate seeing the British all the uh low income people out because it's not right\nOutside of you they can you know I don't see them where they have it a leg to stand on right now because it's all about who split them an office in the mind behind the politicians they're going after Reagan asserts type of a\nDemographic in an area where I work with a friend at fending for America about Thirty years ago his paws worked on campaigns for early Franken Franklin and he said send me outside of this is way out of the entire United States they don't change and I found out a co-op conflicts of the country\nMoving all the wealthy people within the inner city he said I said told me this Thirteen Years ago I wasn't taking it serious you know because I was no way to do when I was crazy types of stuff I wasn't focused that these\nNow he says you'll see it come to pass it with some of the fastest twelve I'm fine and I think they're trying to set it up or all of the Republican are wealthy people are in certain areas will superdelegates a votes will count for the president in an office or\nThey're trying to set it up or a Republican are wealthy people are in certain areas will super deal a votes will count for the president in an office or why do you think they're doing this redevelopment\nAnd it's not that it's not that because that is contrary to their political goal they do not need a bunch of rich white Republicans to move into the state of Atlanta that is contrary to the political aspirations\nOf mayor bottoms and others who serve on council because\nOf progressive voters so that's not the reason okay if anything they would like to have more progressive individuals more minorities actually come into the city if we're talking about political goal I write because politically those are the people who vote for them right\nSo I think there's a fundamental difference\nIn simple business doctor in an ideology that is what I Believe you have members on the council who simply saying this is a good deal business wise based on their doctor named belief a business and there are other than the council who believe that this is not the best deal we can get\nAt the moment and so they are contrary a contract to the idea\n\nI see some comment about this on social media people have mixed feelings about this channel to report let's get this channel to report\nAnd\nThe title of it is university professor offered extra credit for students who attended Abrams of at\nAn associate professor\nAt Clinton State University acknowledged she made a mistake by offering students extra credit if they attended a campaign event but democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams that's according to channel to news\nThe rally took place at the university on Tuesday Morning and it also hosted United States Senator Elizabeth Warren both of them what there was a tag team situation\nAnd email obtained by channel too was sent by Andrea Alan and associate professor of criminal justice\nWhich basically said\nTo help out I'm offering the following opportunity if you can't\nTake a selfie are you at the events and upload a pig to the photo I'm creating indeed do el\nI'll add to bonus points to your final great that sounds like a good deal to me [laughter] I'm just being straight up that sounds like a good deal to me speaking listen professor to professor that's a good damn deal to me\n\nThat university send an email statement to the news station saying that it just became aware the extra credit and how was offered and that and I quote university administrators have advised to professor the extra credit should be offered on an equal basis to those participating in advance by all political parties\nThere's something called academic freedom\nI get an academic freedom exist in the context of the classroom that is the relationship\nThat is a professor has with their student\nThe American association of university professors a group that I Am a member of\nHoles very sacred the idea of academic freedom you may not always like the academic freedom but academic freedom exist now during the candidates the of Trump\n\nTrump spoke at various colleges\n\nWhy he was candidate for president\n\nNot only did he speak at various colleges walk candidate for president\n\nHe also spoke at colleges that gay students extra credit\nFor attending his speech his rally\nAnd there was some on the left the guy been out of shape about it but here's the truth the reason why I didn't talk about it not in that context is because I just said it was academic freedom\nProfessors institutions have the ability to do that you may not agree with it we got young Julian here\nTo do that you may not agree with it\nWe got young Julian here\nI think I think he disagrees with\nMe you know I you know I actually do agree with you or you know I'm about three days removed from college arise and if if I had a college professor that offered\nExtra credit for us to pull up to one of these events you know I don't I Can't speak for all college students but at that point in time I wasn't as politically inclined so I Would have pulled up especially depending on what kind of class it was kind of course it was I Would have pulled up took that Sophie and put it on let me say each well his desire to learn and that's a uh that's like an academic\nRight on the website for for class and students is not like you're uploading it to to Instagram to promote Stacey Abrams you were there was a\nProper context for the actual assignment or this was a criminal justice assignment the reason why this is appropriate to me is because\nPart of what was discussed at the rally was criminal justice reform and the candidates plan in order to implement criminal justice reform in the state of Georgia unfortunately the Republican nominee for governor he's not talking about criminal justice reform\nI get it and I think that I think it's an overreach because ultimately the students are getting an opportunity to see what this is about\nAnd I think that is the most important part and that's the learning part of a of the lesson right you go out to this political ... you can call a political rally where you're seeing possibly our our next governor speak\nI think it's a good idea and you know extra credit\nIs extra credit credit and and you know I don't get why this is a major story I mean the headline on channel two says extra credit controversy really really you extra credit controversy I interviewed bill Campbell last month last month I interviewed bill chemical leadership talked at ... university interviewed him had a great interview\nEvery student in my class got extra credit for tend to\nEvery student I gave them extra credit for sending that leadership talk discussion\nAnd ultimately that's what we care about as students is getting as much credit as far as we hear well we have to do in order to get that extra credit people will pull up regardless of what side of the other party there on and they're going to come just for those who point\nThey will but again it gives you an understanding of the curriculum outside of the confines of the classroom so it makes it\nLeap from theoretical to a pragmatic one people who have actually experienced it not as a scholar but as somebody who who is a practitioner and so you create those opportunities as much as you can if you are a good professor\nAnd my question to you real shot and all the listeners would be would this be an issue if this wasn't happening during this air in politics\nYou know if that's a great point and it happens all the time this is an issue now because of the increased tribalism Bob political narrative but believe me conservative professors have done it liberal professors have done it it is absolutely nothing new nothing new whatsoever\nOkay speaking of leadership talks speaking of leadership talked we have our very own Derek

Scott FDA president yes how are you I'm doing good uh let's all Jews are Desmond tell us about you tell us about the USDA president so\nI'm getting leaned into that a microphone or and there you go ... tell us where you're from and tell us a little bit about you and why ... is your choice\nWhere I Am originally from California I'm a transfer student from California I'm In my senior year\nAnd I'm studying music and I'm a shows more brown because after hearing the story can you hear me All right mhm All right [laughter] I chose more rounded because at the hearing the story in the hardships going on with it just drew me that people still stay and I figured if\nPeople would stay with\nSo little and they must be that committed to making sure that I understand what I'm learning and they must be committed to understanding or helping develop my character and they all are and I'm a much better of a person more of a leader than I was when I first got here last year\nThere are many things that have gone on it more surround that I don't know would happen at any others who opportunity wise such as this\nRight here but\nEven deeper just um being able to sit with these hidden figures that just speak\nWith them dialogue with them about life than about stories and just having them pour into me on the regular especially my music professor Dr sharing Willis who\nWe call her the great and powerful jaws because these yes absolutely by far one of the most amazing people I've ever met\nJust which she pours into me on the regular\n... and ... tell us about your where you from where is home for you\nAll right well I Would say home for me it was originally in Montgomery, Alabama large from the gum oh yeah well that makes it quite familiar\nWith out there are some great listeners down in Montgomery\n... will set up for that um but I dare relocate to a city called the barn Tennessee ... about sixth grade and that's where I graduated high school and once I graduate high school\nHad the perfect record for it but it was the point as to where did I Want to go and I mean coming from Alabama I knew I wanted to be an ACC I refused to go anywhere else no matter if I had the brains for it or anything I Want to go to actually see you and so\nI wouldn't say more about what's my choice not probably stories but it was my best choice and Venus up some more is brown I Will never forget that day and this McKenzie calling me and just told me and says when she told me the story and hearing the honest the honesty and sincere in his voice and just coming here and it being a family\nAnd me constantly learning something new every day even about myself me being pushed it things that I never thought I Would have done and it says I Love being here\nI'd fall for a night to to seven zero three won't come back we're going to run down the schedule of events so you all of the things that's going to be happening around Mars brown I'm going next week and actually starting on the thirteenth with the community campus clean up day\nWe need to increase our percentage of givers they give to the college to help support us be financially stable and they need to give they can give on line that can go on the website marsh browned out either you\nOr they can bring a check or as you indicated come on the yard those five or six thousand people to come on the yard of everybody just broke fifty dollars right and make a big difference in trying to help these young people that have\nScholarships and financially as we worked wars regaining accreditation so I Hope that\nThe messages that goes out across the country for this coming home come in two thousand Eighteen or that we need to begin to really make a concerted effort to make certain that we can take out place rightfully where we need to be with respect to all of the of the institutions\nThat have accreditation that are thriving in working toward being more transformational and that's what we're trying to have more brown\nEyes in people can give now one of the things I tell people all the time that Mars brown just does not belong to the moms is rich history\nA suggested it is rooted in the struggle of black people for self determination right on that in his own institution that was founded by black people stress expressly for the purpose of educated black people in Georgia and so\nIt is deep roots is rooted not just in

you you're going to get fired up you're gonna raise your heart rate you could potentially cause yourself some problems\nBut if you're Jimmy Butler well maybe it just turned into a really good basketball game that's my biggest question is what happens from here\nIf your Carly towns are Andrew weekends or you're one of the third string or is that Jimmy reportedly chose for his team to run full court within practice on Wednesday and you're fired because you guys just beat the other starters\nMaybe your time to do and you're thinking this is exactly what we need a Jimmy ... or to come in here in with everybody into shape or view of the general manager and you've got screamed\nAt now what now I Will say when I thought about and read about mold over\nThis Jimmy Butler situation and watched the interview that he did with Rachel Nichols\nI immediately jumped to back him junior but ... they're two different says to me in a case of Jimmy Butler it was in house number one most important thing it was in the house\nNone of that gets out if somebody doesn't tell Adrian ... and others now I Would say that this kind of news this kind of development\nThis kind of surprised\nMost human beings don't keep it to themselves some will some won't the fact that he showed up for practice for the first time after holding out that wasn't going to be a secret but then according to multiple reports the gym was so stunned by the way he acted and by this this\nAs he calls wrong me this raw Jimmy Butler\nAnd as he explained to Rachel Nichols he was just so full of a motion and intensity and passion and probably some frustration some disappointment some anxiety all of that comes pouring out of him and he directed at his teammates and at the general manager who's there\nAt least it was in house and I get it didn't stay secret\nBut it's not as though Jimmy Butler\nDid that in his sit down with Rachel Nichols\nNor did he throw any of his teammates under the bus so we think it's interesting to hold up the hotel Beck and junior interview with Josephine Anderson and low Wayne and then compare that with a conversation that Rachel Nichols habit to me butler now he's not happy neither is owed out\nBoth\nOf them are disgruntled both of them are frustrated with their organizations both of them\nAre disenchanted with teammates but if you watch the butler while he indicates that he's not happy\nAnd while he talks about a situation that he believes is likely not going to be fixed in no way does he pointed fingers at his teammates in no way does he say it's this guy's\nFall or that guy's fault\n\nIn no way does Heathrow when he went under the bus now you may have done that in practice\n\nBut it's a lot of these other rumors are true\nAbout the dissension and the ranks about the problems between him and Carl Anthony town specifically which sometimes can be about alpha males sometimes can be about sharing the basketball sometimes it can be about\nSailing some guys girl doesn't always have to be that way sometimes just personality clashes not every team with\nAlpha males and major superstars guys who can create and who can score and who can take charge not every team mesh is\nThe way to the Golden State warriors have don't look at that as the the norm look at that as the gold standard because that special what those guys have dealt with for all stars and they're starting lineup and now making room for another one in boogie cousins in that\nIs unique it's not the norm so when the case of Jimmy Butler and his teammates it could very well be a variety of different things\nBut he's got to be the most intense and he's got a brain leadership through that example the energy the heart that's what butler brings to the table he obviously is a great defender he can score for sure\n\nSome of the reports indicate he's been frustrated with the fact that all of his teammates are not committed to winning the way that he is\nA these are all\n[noise] the oath of intangible thing that's so difficult to know for sure what would change that situation what would fix it what would make him happy what would make him feel like he was

learning and they\nMust be can be on the standing or helping develop my character and they all are and I'm I'm much better the person more of a lead it and I was when I first got here last year\nThere are many things that have gone on it more around that I don't know would happen at any other school opportunity wise such as this right here\nBut even deeper Jess I'm\nBeing able to sit with these hidden figures and just speak with them dialogue with them about life than about stories and just happened to him or into me on the regular especially my music professor Dr Sharon Willis who\nWe call her the great and powerful jaws because these yes absolutely\nMy music professor Dr Sharon Willis who we call her the great and powerful because he's absolutely by far one of the most amazing people I've ever met just what she pours into me on the regular\n... and ... tell us about your where you from where is home for you\n[noise] ah well I Would say home for me is I recently Montgomery, Alabama

when she told me the story here in the honors the honesty and sincere in his in her voice and says come here and it being a family and\nThat have accreditation that are thriving and working toward being more transformational and that's what we're trying to do it more brown\nEyes in people can give now one of the things I tell people all the time that Mars brown just does not belong to the moms\nIs rich history or suggested it is rooted in the struggle of black people for self determination right on that in his own institution that was founded by black people express expressly for the purpose of educated black people in Georgia and so\nIt is deep roots is rooted not just in the loans but in those who understand that that legacy or has to mustn't should and they have a right to continue as right over whether you're on the line but not you you know wherever you are you can go to\nMars brown dot edu is that the easiest way you'll see a donate link on there that's where you can click it even as we are talking and say you want to put your fifty a hundred five hundred thousand whatever you can do\nA into this institution because\nI'm now we're how many years removed from the absolute loss of accreditation and school is still there\nLast accreditation and two thousand and three in the spring of two thousand three lost the appeal of but we have our main over the years later if the students sometimes with six to ... for the students but we stayed open\nAnd are the important thing about that as we have to stay open if we want to keep the assets right and so now we need to recognize established to move forward let's let's let's help each other let's get ourselves out of this whole and worked was\nMaking certain that Mars brown can become stable again\nTalk about a little bit about it and they were going to go to schedule I'm a Mars brown as you you mentioned the um\nThe rivers generic clause in Mars Brown's land lease agreement with Atlanta University I'd always remind people the history Mars round sits on the original campus of Atlanta University in fact the first president I Believe of Atlanta universes very red outside a fountain hard right\nAnd so in that land disagreement it was if Mars round ever cease to be in the education of facility than the proper revert back to Atlanta University or success ... successor ... o'clock in the universe of Mars brown is always and will always maintain\nA a educational of a facility\nOr to make sure that is always educating students on that property\nIs right and has and that's why we all just into two wars being able to be focused on making certain we can keep the institution open and continue to work towards the status in our rightful place with all the other they use in the schools\nIt's it's certainly needed now one today some traction some movement um I've been watching with some some um some interest the movement around the historic significance\nMars brown still boast a although one building is now in the hands of invested ... what we don't know what will happen that gangs hall or that burn but the preservation community step forward and said it would be an absolute travesty given this uh this building history too loud\nEarn but the preservation community step forward and said it would be an absolute travesty given there's a there's buildings history to allow the building to be raised and so the building is still standing with a lot of conversation around\nA reclamation there how do you deal with that a fountain hall perhaps one of the most historic buildings in Georgia sit at the highest point a elevation in the city um you know what\nWhat is what is a conversation around around to know\nWhat I Want but I don't ... you know what I'm saying national park service or they have taken falls out of the operating budget to support and getting a is an assessment done by one of the lead architects in Atlanta\nThey have used their money while doing assessments to make certain that we can find out exactly what it will take to rehabilitate bound and how\nWe also applying for a grid that will help us with that uh with that effort to to be able to make certain that we can restore fountain hall and and and and not lose his last is somewhat like what happened to the games all in order to do that you have to have partners\nThe national Park Service has stepped up and they are one of our partners and we look forward to that or to continue to social\nMen as tremendous right now she walks around a lot of resources right\nAh for for a night to to seven zero

I'm curious as to how you elected official like a steak person to be elected to state office\nUm and and be you know basically broke or have a whole bunch of financial problems like for example I think this previous governor\nOr wasn't sample um but we have a fish will people to get elected to state office and I was probably the same can be said about ... but they come out a multi millionaires\nAnd I'm curious as to um I guess how are the how was this allowed to happen uh with no\n... it's almost like it's it's not even challenge Mica within an hour and required to have ... records as far as their business dealings like how do these things happen I just if you could just comment on that I Would appreciate offering listen thank you yeah\nYou're right you know that can learn to back\nInto what we talk about in terms of ethics and ethics laws and rules within state ... state of Georgia has some of them from the weakest ethics laws in the country has relates to uh to uh to be serving in ...\nState ... state of Georgia has some of the week is\nThat the laws in the country as it relates to uh\nTo uh to be serving in public office also dealing a private enterprise of ... there there are not and you're quite right that\nIt is possible for an elected official to let's say have run a a law firm and still get the new some some state agency\nIt is possible for an elected official to be and some other sort of private enterprise and steal engages state fitness because the if the laws in terms of conflict adventures and\nEthics a week and that does happen and it happened and there and and that does not seem to be any real push\nTo correct though it really is and this and that new thing in Georgia but it's certainly something that needs to be attended to because although you can go to the public record and find out\nWho is contributing to who mhm sometimes is a bit more difficult to find out who is acting on behalf in the private sector\nRoad that particular officials that that's what I let you do some real investigate agree\nThat you really get some real ... with most of a regular citizens don't have the time or expertise to do unless the state takes some sort of affirmative action to make sure that is out there\nAnd we'll we'll make a rule and and I say you do not have those strong ethics laws in the state of conflict of interest laws and the and the and this case with sector Brian ... Kim rather it it just comes for four more and I think you get the caller\nMakes a good point of Georgia fast governors have left the office well well financially situation hate him not today necessarily did anything illegal it just seems to be unethical and then in the country will be doing profit from the office\nThat just an interesting you'd be a politics and sausage\n[laughter] sometimes you want to know what goes in that success [laughter]\nAre starting to bloom I really appreciate you are limited some insight and sharing your expertise in this particular area or bugs will be dealt with the\nMovement in order to level as look forward to see you soon blow community man wants the human they carry a beat them a little symbols of rubber duck the world you're boom professor of political science\nBlog Emery university when we return we will\nCome to your calls for all for a nine to five and seven zero breeds\nSlot open for you to jump into will lose jobs or the former forty nine to ... be blocking them in with more than ... movement or news of talk therapy maybe we'll take\nIt's insightful it's interactive it's thought provoking intelligent black talk radio on Saturday evening and you're getting down with the movement to adopt the at large for news and talk Thirteen eighty\nDollars for each due to some of those three are news and talk to a team where you are you OK\n\nSeventy dollars and Seventy celebrated leaders trying to get updates pretty busy for ya all around town highway Seventy ... activity there Seventy five nor the Judy five Clayton County wants for that one emergency road working class south a round Jimmy Carter boulevard once we have that tree that was again on the ramp\nSunny south on the Jimmy Carter I definitely saw where it's not news and talk Thirteen eighty W.

I'm calling about the liberal a Ford executive was like the New York Times CBS news and World Report and said yes right yes and all those saw a fine of ...\nI got your Andy I'm rooting for ... I'm ruining for you and to have a point\nWell that's what I was calling about what's something that disturbed me yesterday at your son about academic freedom and how you sort of a all put that out of context about the a professor form it quite in state college I wasn't able to get through your\nLife okay so what did I take out of context let me give some background to the store for those who may not have been listening yesterday I basically there is a professor of Clinton State University who decided to give her students extra credit if they attended a political rally this political rally was for\nStacey Abrams the Democratic nominee for governor this was also something that took place at Liberty University when Trump was running for president when he was a candidate\nA students went and attend to his rally and some professors did give extra credit for them attending that rally and architecture last all of that under academic freedom something that is sacred inside of the classroom it is a glimpse an up close\nAnd personal glimpse of democracy\nAnd you may disagree with the politics of it but this is real life and it's\nHow it works go ahead where where am I wrong it\nCovers their well when you are I don't care off a liberty office Clayton stayed a fifth so if you don't you think it was wrong for Liberty University\nWhat what you know I don't care off a liberty office Clayton stayed a fifth so if\nYou don't you think it was wrong for Liberty University tune you Paul well why do you call them a show and talk about it\nWell because if you pull that science and but when when it happened with liberty and Andy standing on the outside looking handy when it happened at Liberty University you did not call my show and you did not raise issue now than it has happened at Clinton's on diversity like\nYou said yesterday you didn't talk you talked about it\nNo I didn't bring it up on that surf Loch absolutely Andy I absolutely brought up the liberty university thing I ... he brought it up\nI I miss that shows but but here here's the point I'm not going to go to Dennis went for dental school he got extra credit he he was given a grave costs us ... up or at least somewhere political\nPepper and let me have your understanding all the extra credit is so wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute Andy Andy you're conflate issues that do not co exist let's talk about it how long is this your walk just how long have you been a professor\nI'm not okay I I actually am I Know and that was kind of saying\nLet's talk about X. rated hold on sir that sounded like extra credit Ohio hip and click typically you never give more than two points extra credit so let's say if a student has an eighty nine well the eight or nine becomes a Ninety One\nThat the plus becomes an a minus\nOkay so you're talking about two points on to find a great they have something to get what's called a Simon extra credit for additional effort\nSo for example if there was a final exam worth a forty percent of fifty percent of your final great and you could get an extra five points on that exam well that doesn't move the needle very far when you look at the total calculation of the final greatest called an aerobics and which we great by this Rubik's\nSo if it if two points if you're saying two points one way or the other will cause you to go to a dentist and not go to a dentist\nVince or you're not living in the real world I understand that socialization\nCollege students are past my socialization an Ivy League institutions more so than any of the institution that means based on their status\nAnd the personal relationship with the professor and the university at large they are socialized through the academic studies more so than any other institution and the United states of America Ivy League institutions have that going no more so than anybody else did you know that\nHey you're shot and I I don't have any like ivy Ivy League institutions forget\nWhere but I've never heard you call the show and question the so I've never heard you called the short question any credential of anybody in the I Believe no go ahead and talk about your life\nYeah your I I I guarantee you down if you're a high to the doctor ministry or ... or a masters in business or a a bachelors in religious study they're\nYeah what he got fired and they asked him back that\nUp to have people please we knew there was a Christian when you do something that it gets on a piece of frequent coaches and copy closest to you so you know what you got that are set you up to forty afford it plus yeah I got everybody votes for you so you know what you don't want to say but don't let me find out something that all social media\n[laughter] prejudices appreciate your problem and if they were you called it they will lose me a duty to post that interview link where you could hear for yourself what these guys were saying about yours truly that is on the Facebook page and you can also vote the link is there was well on the Facebook page I got to be part of the broad who I'm sure you bought it for me\nUm I generally don't vote on hold but I Do think you're a legitimate news station and I yeah I I think you're very fair to take all different kinds of callers thank you I appreciate that ... role here where you are talking\nAbout climate change stuff and if we're going to make the steps you know we hear a lot of different things there's a lot of propaganda out there and I want to just point out um there was a Wall Street journal opinion journalism video journals so you can actually hear the interview\nWas posted on a April twenty first of twenty Seventeen and at eight thirty nine in the morning and it was by Steve could and who was the former Energy Department under secretary under Brock Obama from two thousand nine to two thousand eleven\nWhen they were trying to pass cap and trade\nAnd it was about how government twist climate statistics and he was talking about no one NASA and basically how they put out propaganda just like Exxon Mobil might or anybody else so you know if you want us to believe and buy into this\nUm you're gonna have to show us facts and there's a whole lot of stuff that counteract what the propaganda is out there about how we're changing the climate and back when I was in so I'm In my fifties when I was in school in the seventies we were going into an ice age we were going to they were going to collect all the ... from the ...\nThey're about how we're changing the climate and back when I was in so I'm In my fifties when I was going on in the seventies we were going into an ice age we were going to they were going to collect all the ... from the smokestacks and spend it on the glaciers and Thirteen Years later we're going to burn up the planet I mean it's kinda hard cats to buy into the propaganda and um you know so if you want to buy into\nWe're going to burn off the planet then you'd better get fat and give us saying\nAll right well that's what they're given the part of new you guys just learned sign it\nIf I don't know if you listen to the interview and you can play it affects the on video that there's a there's been a whole lot\nThere's always conflicting interpretations of the data but no one disagrees hold on wait a minute you part of ... no one disagrees then when we put taxes in the environment it makes the environment toxic nobody disagrees on that the only disagreement\nIs the issue of global warming\nAnd the and the issue of temperature rising some people believe that it is a natural phenomenon with the earth actually isolates goes back and forth as people believe that it is contributed by the uh by human involvement so that is the interpretation difference not the other stuff\nWe all know if you put a poison in something that's something that's poisonous we know that\nSomething that we actually are desert just effort greener with increased the o two there's benefits to it as well All right and you talked about ExxonMobil has altered your motives so does the government when they when they were trying to patch cap and trade backing and kid out of nine or\nCan we know that and he bought a little I Would love to have this conversation would you even further but I have got to roll up again tomorrow in fact he bought a little research go All right here's a second part of the interview with Bill Campbell\nPiece\nWhen I heard the G ... agents ages were involved in there are issues that city hall but when you say eight agents are involved in a criminal investigation\nBecause of an open letter to really get the right ones in in a time I had never heard of anything like that in my life than but what I was shocked about Mr Mayor is how many people accepted that narrative as normal\nThere were a lot of people who said yeah well they didn't give the records I Know they never do governments many times have an adversary and when I was ...\nAnd that's why when you talk when you hear on the panel and they skip over my minister ration right they act like those eight years didn't exist in by the way a\nBlack folks look those eight years you know the great a lot of white people love them too because the city ran well it was prosperous we added people we pastry rebuilt new devices and new facilities are we reduce\nThe crime rate we open a new recreation we did a lot of great things and we did with the natural integrity all kinds of things and so here's here's interesting when you go out to the airport right go out to the airport\nAnd go through all kinds of course I think it's easy to be and they have this wonderful thing about the history of Atlanta right and my eight years or even if it didn't exist\nRight they've got you know Roberta a good way to you know Coca Cola and this and that but no one of the six African American mayors it is not even a presence there\nAnd so it tells you that\nSome black people buy into the same narrative and that and that's why I'd circle around and\nTell you my friends that you cannot let older people write your history for you and I and so people asked a reporter asked why was out here today\nThat you can not let older people write your history for you and I and so people asked a reporter asked why we're here today and that's it because I Believe that this audience you'd be right and there's a narrator\nUnderstand that history should be told by those ... and those who understand it and those who believe\nThat's a very good point a to compound on that to compound on that\nI get the great opportunity because I'm a guy named Maynard Eaton who is a professor in the mass calm department at Clark Atlanta University and I get this great opportunity to get lecture these mass calm students and many of them are still searching\nFor what they want to do some of the want to do print some of them would like to do on their some of them elected in television and I said regardless of

E. okay [noise]\n\n\n\n\nWhat advice would you give anyone who's in a high profile leadership position\nWell here's what I think I really believe that our obligation that there's a there's a phrase that we live in cities we did not build and what that means is we have an obligation to give our children are better world and what we inherited ourselves and so what I ...\nWe think is if you're a top leadership position\nYou make a difference for some other people right make a difference for young\nPeople um for young entrepreneur is who really want to do better and want us to make things different that's that's what I really believe they had a a an interesting piece on uh the guy who was the president of the American express attentional\nA one of the finest African American business leaders\nAnd he just retired after an incredible standing at American Express\nAnd they were interviewing and they said you know the thing I thought was most important\nWas to empower young people to be better and and so when I Will tell you as mayor of the things that and always enormously proud of is that we had so many young people that came from our ministry ...\nThey were able to go and do terrific things be a part of campaigns or run companies or start companies and and I think that's what's so important\nTo do to ensure talk to you know do we actually when I one\nOf the reason I say Maynard Jackson was the finest mayor or in the country so you may not appreciate mayor Jackson really created sort of minority contracting yeah right this is this is just an incredible [noise]\nAnd the reason that they want to take the airport away from the city of Atlanta by the way who we build their\nOwn and operate it\nEvery single thing about it is from the city but I was very rare in the country that that happens\nIt marriage and you know they they\nThe airport is Paul Hartsfield Jackson right near Hartsfield was a an important figure in the old airport the airport has been long gone forever right there's nothing that simply remains from mere Hartsfield days as mayor\nMaynard Jackson and Andy\nYoung and built Campbell and Shirley Franklin and the scenery and now he should Lance bottoms other people that built what we know as the busiest airport in the world and through that\nRight through that vehicle alone we've created\n... hundreds of millions of dollars of for you for African American and women entrepreneur right\nWhen I was when I was the mayor we\nGames we gave one of the largest program management almost nine hundred million dollar I Want you to hear that number nine hundred million dollar program management contract to an African American led consortium and you see that doesn't happen anywhere else in the country\nAnd and and that's why there is now an effort by white\nSouth Georgia legislators to try to take the airport and I say if you think that you're going to take the airport from African American leaders and people that that's just not going to happen and there'll be Armageddon before that happens there's\nA real fight those real fight and I had a leash or more a president of Atlantic City Council on the show to talk about what's happening right now and I talked about on CBS forty six as well what's happening is that the state of Georgia is saying let's create\nKind of like a Port Authority and by creating this Port Authority for airport and they're saying oh airports but ... only one of the matter is they don't like the one who really do\nThink they care about the uh the the make an airplane\nAl ... airport the only one of the matter is they don't like the what really look at\nYou you think they care about the uh the the make an airport\nYou know no bastard this guy has to be really\n... airport we're like one though down playing comes in a ... a single seat plane where some of them\nGot ... World War one thing that bringing life playing in that's the one I think that's the place that means they're playing everybody else and so they want to make it seem as if this is somehow connected to some larger program for the airport now keep in\nMind because there are some folks\nWho are supportive of it okay and some of these folks called my show citing corruption and all of these other issues\nUnderstand this if that happens in the state of Georgia if they're successful at taking away this airport from the state of Atlanta they now control all contracting they control contracting well I can I can tell you\nThat um this is a ... an\nImportant issue and there will be a tremendous\nUh book rising shall I can tell you that um because look at the best smart is voters\nAnywhere in the country are in southwest Atlanta yeah right and they don't just tell you this they're allowed their\n... and you know what and they define all of the\nNorm they turn out against you if you all understand that Mary Norwood with the mayor now for a sixteen years ago right right [noise]\nIt's it's just that\nThey don't normally believe that we turn out in in a runoff right we we ... and you know what a lot of places we don't\nBut in Atlanta you know no\nBlack voters in Atlanta are too sophisticated and to\nA ... of\nAppreciating the history of black political leadership and they turn out and that's why the only city in America with six ... let me maybe you'll have a travel but have you been to Detroit did you see Aretha Franklin's funeral so white mayor of Detroit Detroit is eighty\nIf there's if there's maybe there's like seven white people that live in Detroit [laughter]\n\nOne maybe what what the white boy rich and the moon [laughter]\n\nDid you see the movie I just moved to a movie you know what's interesting about the movie what\nAnd I'm not I'm gonna be a spore earlier the whole point of this white boy ... drug dealer in the movie\nRight which they're glamorizing you know if you watch the commercials you think is like a happy ending like you know you're gonna be the end is going to be given out in the ... bags you know Christmas Time right the reason that they\nWent after him was because he was a friend of the guy who was married to the the niece of mayor Coleman Young and they wanted to try to get something on mayor Coleman Young while choice did\nIt it it's almost and comprehensible that the same pot is stir whether it's in Detroit that so that's that's that story right I'm I'm gonna come back to that right think about this up until last year virtually every major city\nIn America that used to have a a black mayor they do they do not have one more new\nRight David Dinkins long gone Chicago Harold Washington long gone\nDo they do not have one more New York right David Dinkins long gone Chicago Harold Washington long gone right Los Angeles times Radley long gone right\nAh well\nI'm going to go to all the ... all the other cities but [noise] at one point right at one point a Houston had a you know the brown or who was the former police commissioner was the mayor of Houston I you can go down the line all these cities no longer have black mayors\nAnd and while it is not indispensable it is invaluable and the reason is invaluable is because in many ways African American companies only get treated equitable a if the city enforces it and determines that it is\nOur chicken land or bad\nFor the Senate governor and you know his ... the commercials this commercials used with his commercials first emerged was\nI'll chicken land a vast right when I'm elected that was his commercial television okay Mike Bowers I can go down the line of people who have just they ran against their land they run again yeah look you know they're talking about dog whistles\nThey that's what it is seen I look at Brian Kemp who when I fall those commercials where he has a shot gun and the truck and the explosives\n... I was wondering like where's the ATF why why do they normally wasting explosion I somebody [laughter] HGF is out there I got a shot done he's holding\nHe's gotta truck where are you going to take all the aliens or the illegal people downloaded rounded person around their personal ended up right [noise] and he's got an explosion on his yard and now the commercials like Mr Rogers right is so my\nPoint simply is they all run against it last night and it's just a it's a dog whistle because it's really it's just a way of saying I'm going to subjugate black folks ... I'm I'm going to make certain that black folk stay in their place and and this is how it's worked forever\nFor look for all you go down\nTo the Richard Russell building right I'm going to give you know the quickest or is it Richard Russell was the one of the most racist\nSenators politicians he voted thirty eight times against anti mentioned bill right he voted thirty eight times gets anti mentioned bill he led the fight against all of the civil rights legislation\nHe said they will never be blacks and whites going to school together I I can\nGo down to listen and this and they named the the richer also building here right and they also named Richard Russell building in in in\nWashington so it it's almost incomprehensible but you see because they write the history right I'm coming back to the same story they write the history of Richard Russell he oh he he was a master strategist right ... ... ... which are\nAlso heard about it [laughter] I heard about over that is a microphone offered a couple of minutes\nI think is really interesting you bring that up because narratives are really different based on the status and something we talk about in the last ... based on race based on race and race has a lot to do a status and we talk about social impact theory in my classroom and social impact theory\nBasically saying you can influence grew based on a few factors number one proximity so if I'm closer to you in proximity I have a better chance at influencing you if I'm close to you insult meaning we have the same ideology I couldn't possibly influence you\nAlso status meaning if I\nAm of the same race or if I come from the same as a socioeconomic background I can influence you and then there's another part of social impact theory that says group dynamics which means if I walked into a room\nAnd you guys walked into a room and I said it's raining outside and everybody says no it's not raining we just came from outside\nBut if this side of the room said yeah it's actually raining you all this side of the room was stopped believing that possibly is raining proximity status and impact and what has happened in your narrative\nProximity status and impact and what has happened in your narrative\nIs that the story that has been written all the stories that have been written I researched all of it is so surgically done that if you're not are trained\nWriter or a train operator or a train distribute ... of\nThe information like I Am you will miss the fact that you actually beat the federal government right you miss that in the article and then when people\nMiss that they talked to other people's group dynamics and they talk to people who are close to them proximity and that is what happened to you well\nIt's what happened to me but I also get free media public's\nYes that's right so that's it's a good trade off I think actually I don't I I Want to make certain point in my bedroom days or the public's people will be called up later on when I get back to hearing about the buck because it's\nSo much love people who understand the ... the rules were paid in southwest Atlanta or or you build a new recreation centers or you make certain that are African American entrepreneur is get a fair shake here\nI mean they were as an example I they they wrote they had a I guess of in the newspaper I had I stopped subscribing a long time ago and his first of all the terrible newspaper I'm just absolutely terrible ...\nYou've given those real do not just today man I gotta tell you at the yeah my wife has given me the cuts and paper is an abomination [laughter] absolutely horrible\n... and you can read it you look here you can read and like much wealth second and the best thing to do is go into stores you can read it right while you're waiting for them to cut your meat\nAnd plug [laughter] but\nThey're ... they they are the two editorials I guess one was um a mere bottoms was talking about why the the city ought to be tried all it's worth the goats project and then they had this absolutely undistinguished a former city councilman who was there who\nWrote an article a star like this are just as you I think they just yesterday Sunday or you wrote your star loud it started out this article by saying\nThat in in Nineteen Ninety six mayor Campbell a brought forth a proposal for\nA ... vendors at the Olympics and we only had three or four days to consider it and that really cast and the ... on\nThe uh the whole Olympics ... absolutely untrue from start to finish now do you think if they if someone wrote something like that about a white mayor that they would not go through and make certain that at least the lines are accurate of course not\nBut because he was disparaging me that's that goes with their narrative so\nI I mean it's just and so you have to overcome that all the time right you have to you have to work hard to make certain that people understand that's untrue and and\nI just believe I I just believe that\nYou know as Dr King said you know the the moral arc of the universe is long been store it's true I I certainly um I'm going to hold him to that [laughter] right right because I Know what the truth is now and I know what our minister ration did I Know how successful we were and what we did\nAnd understand we certainly make mistakes as every minister ration has made mistakes and we had some bad people working for us right and and that's unfortunate as well\nEight thousand city workers right eight thousand\nYeah some bad people working for us right and and that's unfortunate as well\nEight thousand city workers right eight thousand\nSo you've got eight thousand and ten or bad you know that that normally you would say that's a that's a pretty good percentage right but in our case right they they say oh my God it the whole thing was just throw everything was banned from start to finish when in fact it was just the opposite and\nAnd what they are so invested\nIn the story right there so invested in making certain that they try to destroy me and destroyed my reputation and and I you know what I always know\nI Know that the people were like in this room with the people in Atlanta and the people who really know and appreciate things we did because I see them and they talk to me all the time about\nYou know you help my grandmother used that my kids to college are you
