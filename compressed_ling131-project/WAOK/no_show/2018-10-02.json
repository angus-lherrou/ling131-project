A. okay and I say we need to do something where we could not get the actual record we couldn't get the actual names\nSo we decided to create public service announcements letting people know that this has happened to make sure they went to ... put their information in and see if they were still registered to vote that was the best we can do you're doing something even\nMore you're providing the list of people who have been completely purge\nThose who have been canceled exactly everyone now you have to understand I had to get I had a a threatened a federal lawsuit he had a Ninety Days requirement on him to read to give me the Kemp to give me the names on the eighty nice day he coughed them up but he\nHe removed all the middle names are computer guys puts the middle names back by the way he removed all the middle names he he wouldn't give us all the documentation needed like how'd you get these guys and we asked him I said\nI Want the list from that guy in Kansas Trump's guy in Kansas who gauging these names gave you tens of thousands hundreds of thousand names I Want that list he withheld it I guess what\nI got an insider in his office you know me I'm Greg palace in fact if you see me I'm were enough of doors you know what I mean you know Puerto right [laughter] and [laughter] I'm visiting reporter I've done this for years I got someone inside his operation to give me the list the wild west\nSo I have that Hitler's and I'm telling you it's amazing genes and we're brown is supposed to\nVoters James Thomas Brown in another state James Brown junior James Brown senior I'm Maria Inez Hernandez supposed to be the same voter is Maria Cristina Fernandez you know what\nI yeah a lot of people did move out of Georgia those or you know he's got those those names that's correct that's not a problem\nBut what he did was when he got these names from Kansas and I'm Talking five years ago he said that postcards it looks like junk mail you throw it away well you're just throughout your vote friend especially if you missed a couple of elections you're done and people don't know that they don't get a further notice they don't get anything\nAnd I again I Would agree with you every once you go to SOS dodgy A.\nDot Gov dot Gov to do re register 'cause the one thing you can do until October night as you can re register online right now you go to Greg palace dot com you can see through one of the victims starting tomorrow we'll have it all up what time to Margaret I Will have it up by today and tomorrow\nOn line right now you go to Greg how's dot com you can see the one victims\nStarting tomorrow we'll have it all up what time to Margaret how will have it up by today and tomorrow okay and I'm you'll be able to look your name uh we do so if you're purge Lee's re register now but you have a common name I'm telling you if you miss if you didn't vote in that uh if you if you missed the sixteen fourteen elections\nYou better go on that are on the on Greg palace dot com because I can tell you're gone\nEspecially if you pass it like eight out of ten people just simply don't return those postcard they looked like junk mail you get a lot of stuff like that you're one card goodbye\nWe got on the other side I have read palace investigative journalist or they are falling they are showing you who was heard they were found that document Tamar yes on the Web site yes Greg palace dot com P.

A. okay [noise]\nSo you have till next week to October night to re register that the seats this purge system\nYou have a double agent you have a person right now working inside of the secretary of state's office who has provided this list to you they had the list they could have done something with it they decided not to but you have somebody helping you inside are you\nAre you hesitant to do this do you think this will expose your source and the government\nOh yeah um but uh you know someone made a you know to be very honest it wasn't because someone was trying to be honest I'm going to be very you know I used investigative reporting techniques my guys mhm I'm I'll be very honest to kind of ... someone from the inside into giving us a list now we know what I say con okay I mean just to understand\nWe just said\nI had one of my guys and we work look this I've been doing investigative undercover work for BBC and for the Rolling Stone and guardian for for years now almost twenty\nAnd uh but we'll do is we'll say we came at them so we're good Republicans ... show us all this wonderful stuff you're doing hey can you give us this list that you got from Kris Kobach a Trump sign in Kansas wow and that's how they did it the guy was on wedding from insides off this is Brian camps deputy he knows it as\nHe was called an ... an unwilling to write and we went into a human ... and it's like I got to listen we almost fell over dead that he sent us this\nStuff but the thing is Kemp should have given this stuff we're entitled to material under the national voting rights act for justice reason people should know why they are their neighbors had been cancelled last\nThe voter rolls it's not small we're talking thousands and thousands and thousands of Georgians and the people most vulnerable are poor people voters of color students et cetera my daughter's a student here in Georgia by the way this it's\nIt is not this is not fair okay\nIt's not democracy this isn't about whether who you should vote for not\nEveryone is entitled to their vote and should not be removed under some Koch Khamenei excuse over cleaning the voter rolls by the way ... office issued a statement the to challenge me this morning saying he's just following the law and cleaning the voter rolls as required by law yeah the law says you're supposed to remove people who've left the state\nNot people who ... who cording to\nTrump's guy sent you some list\nWith a bunch of common names on it\nThat is just dead wrong effect Harvard University did is they need to do something like Ninety nine point five percent wrong I think at that generous okay you know like\nSo the list is is not as Greg\nThere's another issue here and the issue is the ambiguity not only in the law but also in the ruling that upheld this process there's the languages\nThe language is not specific enough in my opinion it allows for processes that are questionable in order to get to this ultimate place that has been determined legal ...\nWell the Supreme Court made it issued a ruling back in June of this year which says if you get a postcard and you still miss the postcard and skip to elections you can be removed it now here's the big if and this where Brian Kemp midst\nIf if if you know have good faith reason to believe that that evidence that someone moved that they left the state that they're not a voter here anymore well we actually\nNo have good faith reason to believe that that evidence that someone moved\nThat they left the state that they're not a voter here anymore well we actually hired a the company that works with the U.S post office to go through the list and they are as we're speaking finding thousands and thousands and thousands of people who never move or move to within the ZIP Code or even like I say moved with in a single building\nAnd lost their vote the second thing is that the court said if people lose don't vote for two elections then throw away this postcard than voting to moral the miss too early to know that ms for elections and they missed a postcard\nAnd if you think it's evidence that they move fine but I'm gonna tell you this\nHe didn't do that in the case of these people that of ah the hundreds of thousands of people he got from this Kris Kobach a Trump guy in Kansas as soon as he got that list either way for people who missed elections he just sent them to postcard you miss the postcard now you're on the in active with your not enact if you're just you're just the last name is brown or Johnson or Kim\nAnd now you got it missed this postcard most people do miss a couple of elections and you're out\nThat is not good faith\nThat you moved its it's his belief that you're not his voter [noise]\nThere's a statement made in the press release I received from your team and it says ... notices\nTo the one in ten voters purged the group will announce that they are making the entire gym two bathrooms them team ... list available to the public immediately so wrongly purge voters can re register by the October night deadlines here's the obvious question mhm\nWhy did the secretary of state not make this this public so people can do what they need to do to be registered why not\nHosted why do I have to do it why does Greg palace have to file a federal lawsuit to get this list and put this up why am I going through the post offices experts to find out of people have moved here not\nAll right so\nRight I Can't Bryant jumpstart returned my text messages after he got elected by the Republican Party at their nominee right so

I Know a small\nI Know but if this would have been Dr for Dr Ford would have said yes at the age of Eighteen and it was legal for me to drink in the state of Maryland because of the state law at the time and it was proven that she was wrong about that you\nAnd everyone else who supports Kavanaugh would have used that as a reason to discredit her entire testimony but when I bring up back to you and he bought a new effort is she already knew Kevin a lot about [noise] were you aware\nThat I don't know if he actually said he was legally and are they all came\nWhy people would refer to himself madam this is amazing to me you guys\nAnd you're really saying why people for foreign to himself madam this is amazing to me you guys were stretch the mortgage companies to make sure your buddies can fit you know good will\nThe man said that as a senior he was it was legal for him to drink to consume alcohol as I report it's because of the state law that\nWas proven that has been proven to be a lot and you what you just told me that you knew it was a law\nThey did it say what they do for him to drink or for some seniors to drink wow what the the bar to what you got that that's really what you got here\nMetro Maris according to the New York times they called classmates of misery mayor he had spent six days with a Democrat lawyer\nCalling friends to try to confirm it and the friends with killing the New York times that she didn't know it was like having all she was asking them when you get back to this for you want to do a lie detector why don't you play Hillary Clinton's tastes on why she doesn't trust lie detectors when she was defending a pedophile she interviewed back in the eighties\nAnd she got a guy operate the Fifteen year old and why she doesn't trust last lie detectors why don't you you could play that hey\nI'm okay here we go too far to let me go and read the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has repeatedly said that he was legally allowed to pursue my beer\nAs a prep school singer in Maryland in fact he was never legal in high school because of the state's drinking age increase the Twenty one at the end of his junior year while he was the old Seventeen he made the he made that proclamation multiple times during the scrutiny he has received that\nHas proven itself to be on true\nWell I Will go back and listen to say if it was legal for him and it was legal for seniors I think they're called that I'll go back and listen to\nThe also said this at Fox News he said this in the Fox news interview\nHe said and I quote on Fox News this is a direct quote from Fox News for safe haven for all things bigoted he said yes there were parties and the drinking age was Eighteen\nAnd just the seas were legal refer to himself in the testimony he gave on Thursday he fled before the Senate wait a minute about him he said before the Senate Judiciary committee he said that oh A L L\nAll of his comments during the Fox interviews were accurate and could be made part of the record that's a direct quote a direct quote from judge Brett Kavanaugh that all that he said during the Fox news interview was accurate and could be entered into the record\nAnything with NATO for Henry legal for seniors\nDefending our quote just we drink beer my prison are boys and girls yes we drink beer a light beer I still like beer I drink wait a minute the part of who you ask me a question I'm answering your question he goes all just saying I quote the drinking age as I noted was Eighteen\nYou make a great point a great question no they do not have to have begun show due diligence and attempting to field those vacant unit with someone\nUnder that status of affordable housing then they can go to the next one the problem is every city\nAnd sometimes every new proposal in the city has a different\nCalculation for what is affordable housing\nAnd that's the real issue we need to come up with a definitive answer to what is affordable housing and then what's affordable to you may not be affordable to the next person that's the problem too but those are real issues in the details of how this works out\nYeah thank you had asked for his act you know math\nBeg your brother appreciate your call a ... row for eight nine to two seven zero three do you all know that Trump is still talking\n[laughter] they want to have ice because ice walks into MS Thirteen and these gangs and they treat them like it's just another day in the office\nRough and tough and they love our country and I'm treating I stood and I'm treating our law enforcement good and the Democrats don't want to take care of a law enforcement and the Democrats don't want to take care of our military so\nWe are going to have a decision to make some time right after very close to a after the election is over and that will be on board are secure\nWe are going to have a decision to make some time right after very close to a after the election is over and that will be on border security and the wall but border security there was a big factor\nOkay you don't want to address some personal was part of the conversation and then a girl she nation that\nJust yes there was yeah we talked about with Mexico we talked about it the it was a big part in certain things and certain understandings were had at the same time we don't want to mix it up too much is a very big deal at a very good deal for everybody but a border security and security generally is a very big factor we also have drugs\nSometimes and some people would say it's a very similar thing but we talked about drugs with Mexico that's a very very big factor very very big\nWe have a lot of good understandings and will be discussing that with them thinking okay but it was a factor absolutely and in the deal okay let's go come on you want to I guess get off trade I don't think people are falling asleep with trade I think it's to to me it's the most exciting thing you can talk about right Johnny\nRight [noise] All right let's come up [noise] to\nSay that your limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into judge Kavanaugh but your own statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited and so so which is that\nI didn't say anything or very what I said is left the Senate decide whatever they want to do is okay with me and also the FBI I think the FBI should do what they have to do to get to the answer at the same time\nJust so we all understand\nThis is our seventh investigation of a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a what a change he's gone through what his family's gone through\nThe trauma for a man that's never had any accusation any he's never had a bit statement about him he's led I mean I think he was number one in this class at Yale he was number one in this law school at Yale and then\nWhat he's gone through over the last three weeks is incredible so uh I Want the FBI this is now the seventh investigation so it's not like the you know just starting a I Want them to do a very comprehensive a\nInvestigation whatever\nThat means according to the senators and the Republicans and the Republican majority I Want them to do that\nI Want it to be comprehensive I actually think it's a good thing for judge Kevin or I think it's actually a good thing not a bad thing I think it's a good thing now with that being said I'd like it to go quickly and the reason I'd like to go quickly very simple it's so simple\nBecause it's unfair to him at this point what his wife is going through\nWhat his beautiful children are going through is not describe bubble it's not describe ... it's not fair\nI think it's fair to do it to me because you know I've been gone from day one I'd been or from long before I got the office you've been doing it it's almost became ... I I think for me it's like a part of my job description to handle this crap\nBut as far as as far as ... this is a man that this is not from his world and you know what if they're not going to want him and I think that would be a shame um with um all the way I mean they charge made or said to have occurred thirty six years ago\nAnd nothing happened since then and look I feel badly for all parties I feel badly for everybody I feel badly for our country this is so bad for our country but I Will tell you I watch those\nSince then and look I feel badly for all parties I feel badly for everybody I feel badly for our country this is so bad for our country\nBut I Will tell you I watch those\nSenators on the Democrats' side\nAnd I thought it was a disgrace and partially because I Know them\nI Know them too well and you know what they are not angels are using your White House has no limitations on on my White House is doing and what the senators you know now you know what I did interview you don't understand what I'm saying you do understand you just don't want to report it that would just say to understand\nMy White House will do whatever the senators want\nI'm open to whatever they want the one thing I Want to speed now they started I Believe on friday could have even been a little bit earlier than that but they started they have worked round the clock on Saturday Sunday they're working right now\nI mean they're covering a lot of territory this is the seventh investigation of judge Kavanaugh number seven this is a number one\nThey started on friday they worked all weekend they've gone late into the evenings\nThe FBI is really working hard and they're putting in a lot of hours so hopefully they can come up with what everybody's looking for but no I'm guided by the Senate I Want to make the Senate have because ultimately they're making the judgment I'm not making the judgment I've already made my judgment the Senate\nIs making a judgment on judge Kevin or that's a very important thing to do ... yes go ahead Peter Sanderson farms present a chicken\nThe all new radio jak combat is available now it's a totally new experienced it puts listening at your fingertips and we made it easier than ever to access the radio stations you love now will save your favorite stations and\nOthers do you based on your list and it's a news and information you rely on even when you are near radio you can take this station when you're on the go\nDownload the all new radio dot com app on your smartphone now\nAnywhere\nHe's ... what\nYou know what did you talk to them about the controversy that's how we try to control even a little an orthodox\nYou've been a challenge among geology I have a doctor within the August ... did become a concern of mine were people expect ... to ... to settle for to the movies ... going with doctor su\nAbout this helping me about\nThe is turning on Monday to friday\nOn news talk Thirteen have W.

the pitcher whether to Africa and discovered that harsh rooms and stuff but anyway I got to have this discussion about the danger with um my great great grand nephews harbor and their mother\nAnd a lot to say like a they don't want to hear it matter of fact the grandma machine drive a fifty five and four word of mouth to watch them play a million\nIs really just a little bit have no circumcision oh now that\nThey have but now my answer the question about the fact that said\nMore get fixed I'm hard\nThey need to get rid of the procedures that series to they need to get rid of all the blank and the quarterback and then where you have to say that they're just saying you want to build taller than not fertile ground\nOr a mob willing to go meet with the church ladies now let me get to the other day the new book All right let's go to a\nDaylin in uh in Atlanta daily now are you dealing with the Richard Harris\nLike good Yes sir\nYeah this is a actually they were wrong you know I Know well they lose the middle of this is football player to play a lot of football what is the\n... what do they need to get get\nActually they are ours you know I Know what they know the ... there is this is football player to play a lot of football what is the\nFact that the what do they need to get it straight now in us\nI'm a I'm going to say this ah one's move too and I think they're two top ten pac was in the least not on the right in the league and the ...\nThere's not a soul in the world that you just play seeing week one or the next week week two weeks and three weeks out they can just replace that guy so you've got to give them the geysers and there are times to mess and a get together\nAnd they all they do know there is only sixteen games in the past the only sixteen games but only if we doubt a game number four five six week that he had signed up and gave it up and\nLooking at it if you look at the way the league is set up as a lot of other things going bad that are doing as bad as that but if we can sustain until the ... get fat I still believe we're the best team in the league and then look out the last caller said from about ... ... yeah five to last you know\nHe just looked at me believe ...\nBrowns fan but uh the last two games he's been supper I mean you know he's been just been surprising\nIsn't that easy to say no you know ... ... you had to find somebody to talk about other than that there is a good to hear from you man\nOr and I also can I comment on the player who went down on a little a high school ball with him um a guy and ah this this hurt side he's a fighter do and he's with the condition and even the the player to high school player or just want to say\nOne as a football player when you ... you know you know what what the car and took it a step forward your intention your bad intentions will step on the field are you going to hurt people have no doubt football is but uh I just want to say I think this is what you see now\nAnd a link to not enough practice\nBecause I'm not going to say and I don't want to and I and I want to clear my word for us either I'm not blaming the bat tackling for the injury but I Will say there's a lot of bad tackling the high school with Carlos ... any leaks into the NFL man when you when you first start to feel they don't teach it a\nDuck your head and they leave with your head and\nSome of the stuff I see I'm a you know Dion Sanders one who I a respected so much in in football because he played football and baseball all the same time said look without hit you are not as a business decision\nAt certain levels is a business decision where I'm going to try to cut you would have I'm going to just try to take down the businesses because they've got to be around here\nAnd um so you're you're right that's what I was saying that's why we did two a days I'd love practice I really did and uh you know some folks believe that after you get to a certain point practice is not important\nBut your your body gets used to you know the heat the punishment the hits ... brother appreciates your man I look all the respect for hanging out with this faith\nYou what are the with Julio him at all times he's double and triple covered no no data why so many of the players are opening yeah I think I can play slots obvious before the trial to him because he's always warrants and job or an hour or an hour you don't want to an end to\nIt takes a special type of a high caliber of athletes to know that and then except that he's not getting the catch is that he could and should if he didn't have doubled tripled\nCovered well look you Julio can catch it I mean the and what are ... and so that's what people it's the in football they really is the excitement factor and he is dead excitement fact I just you know always with him for me has been\nThe guy so friday and hurt in Australia we stay here and when you know\nFor four quarterbacks to make to end this weekend there was an injury on to a player in April ... Seahawks okay and he was going to last year of his contract right\nRight and they were talking about um like a dog and the media because they were saying he should be coming back and he wanted to get his contract clinical renegotiating right though he gets hurt yesterday and there's out for the fever yeah and and so now look at what's going\nTo have you on the yeah certainly\nYou know the kids are only found something that are that are agreed with Michel hall and that's that we both still of finance but at the same thing is happening with the running back their levy on bail he's holding out because they don't want to renegotiate his yes right now the quarterbacks\nWho you might as well put address on them now make thirty million a year and a top running back from the air they want to get twelve Thirteen million\nWho you might as well put address all them now make thirty million a year and the top running back from the air they want to get twelve Thirteen million\nYeah I mean this is what they do and all of these high paid industries right we pay our superstar the top dollar in everybody else get chump change ... I mean what do you play with Meg Ryan but the real uh hey\nWait and my ... way he's a hundred and twenty be down quite a bit\nHe shouldn't be making more than ... without only O'Hare regular quarterback how far you have to take it said it take it or leave it alone\nHere but it doesn't help the beat a a losing a blank nephew laws though you are an ...

was\nEssentially killing her and the doctor said we don't want to lose you it's you know it's not worth going through more this treatment is so she's really sick right now and those types of things

to me is even more impressive than the fourteenth touchdowns\nKareem haunted by the way another hundred fifty five total yards a and the score that you just heard and cream hunters of course the reigning champ\nOf the NFL's rushing category the Broncos themselves now someone who has watched the bronco since I was Thirteen Years old before even understood what football was about and trust me I knew nothing I couldn't figure out while the whistles were for uh the Broncos have really struggled to find a consistent run game over the past couple of years\nPart of that has been the personnel part of it has been the injuries and part of it's been the office of blind just hideous but they haven't made much of a commitment to the run game well they've got these two rookie running backs who are making a dent and changing the identity of the Broncos often which is great it's been good to see\n'em and I feel like they should use them more Royce Freeman Philip Lindsey both dynamic players

that's one example\nBut it's not the only one case Keenan was overthrowing guys that were there a football that were flying over the heads of his target sometimes he can be inaccurate and sad\nThat it not only can lead to interceptions\nBut obviously if what you're going to do was emphasized the past well then it puts you in some sticky situations as well so the Broncos didn't have a hundred and fifty nine rushing yards but couldn't sustain that drive in the fourth quarter when they went three and out and desperately needed to keep the ball away from a red hot path in the homes and also try

but I wanted to\nTalk a little bit about sour grapes told me that people say that I don't remember the last time I had a sour grapes or any type of fruit that his sour is not sweet like you would expect it always causes you to make one of those faces like write me just naturally produces this ah this\nThis scrunch up face or sour patch kids I've ever had sour patch kids they start out sweet and all of a sudden you're like oh yeah I just got to know\nWell that Patrick read sour grapes following the Ryder Cup and he goes for the trifecta here Pete's\nNot only does he tell the New York times he was blindsided that's his words not mine he was blindsided by the decision to split him up from Jordan's beef after he and Steve had performed so well at previous Ryder cups and they have\nMade all I'll give Patrick that he and speak for for one and two meaning for wins one loss and to matches that ended up ... square they were for one and two in the Ryder Cup they were eight one and three if you include the president's cup which is a a different version of an international competition a team competition\nUm and so I read and speed they were kind of this this pairing that the U.S had counted on in recent years except that Jordan space\nLanguage Justin Thomas because they're really good friends and\nThey went three in one at the Ryder Cup so you have a retelling the New York times he was blindsided by the decision to put him with a different partner which oh by the way happened to be Tiger Woods read and what we're going to do together and did not play read didn't play at all on ... in the friday or Saturday afternoon four sons\nAnd so he was left out of those to\nRead then went on to describe the decision making process like the buddy system so more like a popularity contest where he says that the input of much of the team was ignored in favor of a few select names now he didn't name those guys but Tiger Woods\nPhil Mickelson I don't know about fill that to me doesn't feel right 'cause uh Mickelson didn't play it all on friday hit a watch on friday a and then\nThe the other idea would be that it's more of a popularity contest and it is about what might be the best for uh for the the us Ryder Cup team and then finally read says it's obviously that Jordan didn't want to play with me\nThat would makes me cringe the most so singling out Jordan and saying it's obvious that Jordan didn't want to play with me um I mean first of all what are you five years old okay maybe or maybe you're seven\nAnd then saying it's obvious that Jordan didn't want to play with me um I mean first of all what are you five years old okay maybe or maybe you're seven you're seven and you're worried about whether or not Jordan's be likes you\n[noise]\nYeah just um maybe if you'd waited a month and come out with these particular comments\nThey might have been taken more seriously but part of the problem is you're making these comments and the hours after the U.S\nThe U.S lost the Ryder Cup\nReally did not look good at all against Europe so this was not a a Ryder Cup to write home about for the for team usa the parents did look off they didn't look like ... other than speed and Thomas\nAnd to think who else looks good I mean there wasn't a team that looked as good as Francesco melon Ari and Tommy Fleetwood I mean those\nThey will negotiate ... plus protect you

[laughter]\n[noise]\nYour choice for Monday MBP and our player of the week brought to you by Granger let's take a look at who won breakout game from Mitch Trybulski he certainly got it done\nJeb Jody act with six touchdown passes five of those in the first task for the bears quarterback in fact the bears had four hundred total yards at halftime of their game on Sunday and ... in that first tap\nAlone have the kind of stats that most quarterbacks would take as a a a strong day ... day of work fourteen of Eighteen two hundred eighty nine yards and five touchdowns plots throw in fifty three yards rushing and it was ... he was responsible for more than three hundred yards themselves\nFinished with the career high six touchdowns\nAnd three hundred and fifty four yards before Sunday ... only had nine touchdown passes and his career so\nWasn't quite doubling that output but it was pretty darn close and you chose him as Monday MBP we choose him as the player of the week brought to you by Granger rangers got your back when it comes to the safety in industrial supplies to keep your facility running get what you need when you needed\nAt Granger dot com\n[noise] in addition the bears are three and one I think is the most important piece of this uh with their new head coach Maggie with uh the ... Mac\nA addition to the mix and that coming so close to the beginning of the season and yet in every game he's had at least a stack and forced fumble\nUh with the the breakout ... who knows if it's going to stay that way I wouldn't expect six touchdowns or even three touchdown passes every single week but the fact that he had shown that he can make the throws and that they've got a viable run game and to me\nUh that's one advantage the bears have over the other teams in the end of the north we did see the Packers go over a hundred yards rushing this past weekend he gets the bills\nAre but generally that's a challenge\nFor the alliance for the Packers um and for the Vikings even in that division but the bears have Jordan Howard they have guys that they can trust uh to run the ball and to me that sets them apart and certainly does create some balance in the office\nIt's after hours with Amy Lawrence here on CBS Sports radio thanks as always for your votes\nFor Monday MBP and four\nTouchdown Tuesday which will be putting up in a poll form on Twitter very soon a law radio I'm thinking there's just off the top of my head I'm thinking\nKarim ... because that was the go ahead

dot com again eight five five to one to four to two seven\nLet's see wanted to mention a couple of the tweets that came in earlier before the show I had actually started because I mentioned this and the tweets a couple of hours before I even got to work a David set a\nYeah David says about Monday Night football I Can't fault the Broncos too much tonight I saw a quarterback with the escape ability of Wilson meaning Russell the arm of Rogers meeting Aaron the legs of Newton meaning camp and the smarts Brady meaning Tom\nHe says too many options to defense of bodies are too few defense of bodies\n... well two things I'm the same number of defense of bodies that he faces every week and the Broncos actually did a better job against him than than any other opponents so far this year but more importantly I think\nIs that in the fourth quarter the second half but especially the fourth quarter when my oldest is leading those two touchdown drives with the game hanging in the ballot the fact is that the defense was gassed and was chasing them all over the field and so for the\nBroncos all sense to go on the field and only take three snaps plus the upon which turned out to be thirty five yard for them to only give their defense a very short break wasn't even two minutes\nThat three it out and also to not recognize the concept of keeping the bowl away from a red hot quarterback I mean\nThe Broncos defense had played really well to that point they were giving up a lot of yards\nBut they weren't giving up a ton of points and then to put the defense in that situation it's um obviously an advantage to the office anyway but ah the way that they had been chasing him around for a the early part of that fourth quarter that to go out there trying to do it again\nDoes your water

you can\nUse that hash tag ... uh what are the top storylines from the NFL season after one month\nBecause believe it or not we are one month into the season it just goes so fast we wait and wait and wait and we count the days and we're so excited for football to return to than it does and it flies by light speed\nBut it's good it's good for business I Love October and the baseball playoffs began today as well as a lot to be excited about sports but that's our toys alert Tuesday question what are the top storylines the top headline from the first month of the NFL feed them\nSo on Twitter a law radio or on our Facebook page named after the show and our phone number is eight five five to one to four to two seven five five to one to four to seven or certainly the emergence and the excitement\nAnd the just the enthusiasm\nFor the youngest crop of quarterbacks that we've gotten the NFL that spearheaded that group spearheaded by the moxie of one Patrick homes\nI think he is better on the run that he is in the pocket and now he does not run ... first are his instinct is not to run to pick up your own and she's not a running quarterback but he's an athlete\nAnd if he needs to scramble if he needs to run to extend place there's a reason they don't call running plays for Patrick ... there's a reason why he scrambles there's a reason why he takes off its to extend to place similar to an Aaron Rodgers\nAnd it's amazing what he can do when he's on the run right handed or as it turns out left handed we've got to see that\nOn Monday Night football and he reads that he'd been practicing shifting the football for one hand to the other and moving down field with his left hand that was it a pretty throw no it was more like a shock but kind of shoved it or to ... kill five yards down the field\nBut the fact is he was able to do it in the moment as von Miller is draped\nUh to ... kill five yards down the field but the fact is he was able to do it in the moment as von Miller is draped around his ankles and about to bring him down in\nThe sack on third down nonetheless\nSo what I appreciate about more homes yes the athleticism yes the ability to move and extend plays and to make these unbelievable throws across his body when his feet are set and he's off balance all of that's awesome\nBut there are other guys who have that kind of arm strength and who can do it I appreciate the field vision from a guy who's only started five games in the NFL\nWhat he sees and how we see that when he's on the move\nAnd when all heck is breaking loose when the pocket as disintegrated\nAnd he's\nBeing chased by men who would like to fall on him do of course they're gonna raise or on the ...\nLike I I mean that's flat\nHappens every single time now that a quarterback it fit the defensive lineman the linebacker whoever happens to be quickly shoots his arms up in the air like\nA weighing in on Facebook as well it's after hours with Amy Lawrence coming up the major league baseball postseason is that as much as they can be until we get through the wild card games\nThe playoffs are here they begin in near hours really excited Monday with kind of a a treat almost

expecting it but it was awesome to see the Milwaukee Brewers and the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field again that was one to one and two what the seventh inning um and for the brewers to be able to win their first division title and uh it since two thousand eleven and to do it\nThe cubs the teen they've been chasing for most of the season especially the second half of the year a lot of fun to think about the possibilities as well now the cubs are going to have to come through the wild card if they go any further than they than they are now and the brewers have the ability to skip\nThat wild card game all together and you think about Christian yellow choose turned himself into the MVP candidate didn't end up as the triple crown winner and the national league\nA but did have another RBI in their their eye game one sixty three and so he finished with a hundred and ten RBI thirty six home runs\nAnd by far the best batting average in the national league at three twenty six so pretty amazing a ... they definitely going to hear the MVP chance when he gets back home and so for the brewers this was a major hurdle\nFor them to get back to the postseason but also to now when the division title\nAnd uh for the cubs to me it's disappointing to be sure to have it happened on their own field when they had this game one sixty three ah at their their place they're friendly confines and now they're the team\nThat has to play that wild card the good news as they get to host it against the Colorado Rockies\nUm but you're talking about turning around and play and again\nSo use it as

about you\nBrian during the break offered to work for free if there was additional it's you know he said if I made the bunker so I'm never made one myself this is not homemade by me um and I'm determined to try the holidays though I'm very on artsy so it could really be an ugly pumpkin roll it might taste good but it could just be a hodgepodge of pumpkin and cream cheese\nAnd Ryan said he would work for free if I did that so let's keep that from it it seems like a no brainer I mean I Am management what are you talking about just give 'em your management inch All right Chris ... about you\nHonestly out and ride was what it right up there with the horseradish that was my favorite which I also made on Monday actually I made some salmon I broiled salmon and had horseradish tip\nAnd I

takes\nThirty seconds to whip up a badge of horseradish dip\nAll right let's do a little QB news before we get to the top of the hour I'm holding in my hand right here it's actually confirmed by the two guys and the other side of the old paying glass I've got Julian Edelman a book\nThat was written with Tom current who's a a guy from the patriots for years I knew and when I worked at Providence he's does a great job Edelman book\nI'm not sure it's supposed to coincide with his return from a four game suspension uh probably just to ... eating a buddy is back in the facility he's back with the patriots and itching to be out there on the field and as luck would have it the paths or on a short workweek and so they take on the colds on Thursday Night Football\nTom Brady is getting back his security blanket uh the guy who he's got the most familiarity with the most snaps with over the course of\nA their time together they obviously rely on one another and and Edelman knows what Tom Brady

got to do that or else we don't have it we don't have a chance at all you know this you know what I was just I just let me I I was thinking about this you know I had a lot of time to take over the weekend let's say what I'm saying\nI had a lot of time to to thinking to concentrate on just this conversation and then on my list is\nThe take that this approach to understanding what we must do\nAs black people in order to get more relief\nOr into it to move to finish a ... to move further toward liberation and this is my this is my fault and I'm going to say intimacy in almost see it over and over and over and over again\nWhat what the vote is is your let me finish your boy\nWhen you don't use your voice you can't be heard so let me say this to use us as I say you and every other sister and brother who is eligible to vote and is in their right mind who does not use that what you're doing I'm not saying that you back people's enemy\nI'm not saying that you crazy ... ignored each one of them is I'm not saying I'm not saying that your grades are ignored what I Am saying is is that you are\nBlack people enemy I'm not saying that you crazy ... ignored each one of them is I'm not saying I'm not saying that your grades are ignored what I Am saying is is that you are new\nYou don't have a voice in this country and if you don't have a voice and you can't be heard the the policies that are created are going to be increasingly and increasingly more against you\nAnd your struggle that's just the bottom line so you can head over to be quiet all you want to with what did I go out but I'm not going to change and you ain't gonna be able to change it by yourself they over there why\nOh thank you you say it again and again it's like well I Want to say that God yeah\nI think I Believe that we shall we say and and the ... in in\nOr the tickets were will come there'll be ... you know the Seventy one okay back to live and I ... my dear sister teen oh\nOn ... and the last thing is that just a lot of them will be upon you in the urine\nTina Sunni\nAnd the last thing you talked a lot of them will be upon you and the Europeans and probably you know ... ... yeah you you and your yes thank you mhm\nAnd same to you and your family your prayers are with with a up our prayers are with you\nThank you appreciate that my sister\nAnd I just the you know what I'm saying that worked out it was known workout\nShallow and will and that and charge where I work at it [laughter]\n\nAnyway what's going on yeah so things are so they got you are you in school you in the twelfth grade right yeah you know you want to graduate from high school but\nThere's something within you that says ah that you care more about uh liberty and justice than people just talking about liberty and justice or and they'd be\nTalking about for all but they don't mean they'd be liberty and justice for all white folks they don't meet liberty and justice for black people or other people to either and so\nWhen you find when they finally hits you in the heat you get it in some says do you I Can't stand for this because I Would be standing for life but you trying to graduate oh which one would you do\nWell to be honest I Am with you and I refused to stink I'm One of those you want a new system that that's\nNot something to do my family and I remain seated at the games or wherever we are no you know they're\nNot out of it doesn't take much for me to answer that question I say I would just received was but I understand you know a lot of people are total on ... but did they not say it's got fires in the country\nRight exactly and I'm\nThinking that people have just lost a hold of that you know are you really worshipping God or not [laughter]\nOn that now that's a good question um and it's one that people tend not to this one in the Bible things are folks like All right so I don't like their parts so [laughter] I don't really do their part he taught right who's a Texan somewhere and that is is that you know God does our banner\nAre in that means that you know God is our flag we don't stand for no other flag\nYou know but anyway that's what it is a bad you know [laughter] right\nWe only hear about what we want to hear about it yeah people only care about the parts that they won't indoors when they want to endorse it oh if if if it doesn't work for them then they don't they don't they don't go with it they don't roll with it and they just let it ride lost to the past\nBut these people in charge here do you mean what they say and say what they mean\nAnd now no longer than ... and I just throw a little historical point out here because I've been reading a um I Do a lot of studying history and do you remember ... brother ... off the cuff our coffee\nCoffee Paul coffee yes well that was when I didn't realize\nI Would listen to this black man black men was opposed to slavery or I think he was out of Philadelphia back in the summer\nYes yes I either Massachusetts somewhere after ... yeah ... you know they say that he is really the father of the foreign markets\nThe yes yes yes I either Massachusetts somewhere up your mhm\nYeah ... you know they say that he is really the father before Marcus Garvey the father of the um pan African ... ... and um basically what I saw that she did when he didn't like\nWhat and and this is you know I'm looking at today what what our politicians and legislatures you know what they're what they're doing for us he decided to do something about it what he did that is not a tax he said if you're not gonna\nDo you know do right by me I'm not paying taxes into this mess\nYou know you're you're ... ... ... and he was a a small coffee ... was a a a brother who who was he was the African extracted he was his dad was a Sunday and oh here's momma was a it was\nThe ending Native American yeah walk on August ... so your\nCoffee when when no joke man or not but see this is the thing though the difference was this is this going to get his locked up in a long distance between them they get my taxes out my check before I even see my check understand\nThat you know what I'm saying and so I'm like well how do I get in between that because if I was able I wouldn't send them nothing [laughter] you know and I mean I Would do nothing but those of they got me to get it for I'd give it to\nThat's why we we've got to come together and figure that thing out got to find a way to civil out to that part\nIs nothing to do is do we think it through\nWell we get to know about about is why I Do appreciate it

interpret it\nWere shot when they wrote it and that's the crux of the argument people who want an updated meaning is what we owned though right like to call activist judges or that they want to put an emotional interpretation of something that is clear\nThe rights does it in certain instances but district is interpreter of the constitution as Clarence Thomas and that's why people don't understand him he's going to read the constitution and applied the strictest interpretation of the constitution to any case he received whether you like it or not and it may be\nIn the outside of anyone at any given time a missed the hall understand your point\nAnd there is a fundamental difference between those who believe the constitution is a living breathing document those who believe that it is a static document\n\nI Believe it is a living and breathing document and actually everybody else does too they ... they just don't want to tell you that let me tell you why everybody believes it is actually an evolving document because we have something called amendments to the constitution\nWhat is an amendment to the constitution oh it's a fancy word for correction that's what it is and we have all universally agreed that these men image to the constitution are right and proper and needed\nTo conceptualize our country they have come with the times\nWhich means the original document known as the U.S constitution was written and it was flawed\nIt was an adequate it was inappropriate it was not perfect it needed to evolve\nSo while we can argue and pontificate about the purists

makes is silly it's called sleek shape he makes these slick shade remark and then he realizes he's done it in front of people and he kind of backed away from it he said yeah you never do\nThat so I'm

calling on people and doing the Trump thing right which is really quite entertaining and that there were there was a guy a Kurdish guy who's a reporter\n\nAnd there were ... that was a ... a Kurdish guy who's a reporter\n\nAnd Trump started talking about how the Kurds are brave fighters they're great people the Kurds and what he went to the foreign guy he said hey how are you Mr Kurd\n\nRough what he called the man Mr ...\nThis was during his solo news conference in New York\nWritten by nice report another book that you've got to see this guy I don't know what I Do remember\nAt the top president during their lifetimes forty two percent of fifty four to seven to two euros at thirty eight percent of Seventy through the night of euros ranked Reagan as the best those second best once again showing the generational connection\nPartisanship also affected this survey\nAmong Democrats or democratic leaning independents Seventy one percent ranked President Obama as the best or second best presidents\nThat reading him as best as a second best a majority of Republicans listed Reagan as the top presidents with fifty seven percent saying he's the best of their lifetime it by the way Reagan was not\nReally a Republican I Know he ran as a Republican he was not really a Republican remember Reagan was the first and only president to actually give amnesty\nTo what conservatives were called illegals secret to them that amnesty they them immunity\nSo we can say he's a Republican but his ideology was contrary to many of the Republican values of the time\nTrump comes in second among Republicans once again another guy who's really not a Republican so the number one and number two according to Republicans as best presidents are even really Republicans\n\nFor zero forty nine due to

all men are created equal ...\nNo you're right it should be self evident that all the way to ... yeah\nSo that that they're actually he has pointed out that it was like if we if if um if we set a true that you may you know I suppose we'd estate below the catch you then you wouldn't have slaves in the first place\nOh as well eat a staple of the country then you wouldn't have slaves and the first place [noise] [noise] yeah that's all I'm saying they have served the life take certain aspect\nWell that's right that's the great discussion and debate about the U.S constitution every member I Believe the constitution just as the previous caller said is a living breathing document that that not only is able to be corrected an amendment but it should be corrected wind amendment and the Mendez ...\nShows the size of the time you start relevant to hide your he doesn't do now because things are as you or value as well as long as it is now\nYou know it's really interesting brother and I thank you for your call is really interesting we talk about a human equality\nAnd human equality or human rights as an ideological discussion is really primarily a western culture or a argument or discussion is not something universal\n\nYou didn't have anything known as equal rights human rights\nIn many of the ancient civilizations on the east and the merging civilizations of the west you still really don't have it in America we have it by way of idea and yes western nations\nAre more so ... grass or progressive in that area but it is still not something that is actually understood is not something we know and engage in as a reality I'm Talking about human rights\nYou take that human rights philosophy to the middle east and they laugh at you that's not their way\nSome of our culture has been permeating in their culture for many years and they see that as an attack\nOn their face what we see in a secular society as free thought free living they see as a religion they see it as a religion that attack their religion I wrote about this extensively in my dissertation\nAnd you can find it you can Google on the global effect of western religion and politics policy and government you can Google that I wrote about it researched it and it's really interesting how we see this as non religious\nOur secular movement but they see it as a religious movement\nAnd these ideas that we assume our basic and fundamental to the human experience such as equal rights that his foreign\nThat is far into most of the world is not far into the industrialized world all the emerging democratic world but it is foreign\nTo many four zero for eight\nNine to two seven zero three let's go to Tom argument to Mario good they walk them\nHey how you doing this morning good sorry you\nCan't complain I just want to start off with saying that uh a completely support the first possibly act and if you get a chance I Want you to look up a case out of New Jersey I Wish I had this woman's name right now but it ... me but I'm\nJust happen several years ago back when Chris Christie was governor of New Jersey there's a ... a woman who ah she lived in Philly and uh you know fairly is right to just to South Jersey border\nHer husband was across the border I Believe in Kansas or somewhere in his car broken down late at night she leaves home to go get her husband like any Good Wife will do and she rose up out of the house with her piece on her she gets\nShe leaves home to go get her husband like any Good Wife would do and she rose up out of the house with her piece on her she gets pulled over I Believe it was about the uh uh New Jersey state police I'm not mistaken and uh they find\nA gun at a car she's register gun owner out of Pennsylvania the ... she's legit the whole nine yards you know what they did that this woman a hard working innocent family woman they arrested her and this woman was given I Believe two or three years in prison\nWas such a huge outcry behind it that Governor Christie ended up having a part in this woman to let her out of jail ... her life was destroyed while she's going to pick her husband up from a break down and she ended up going to prison for two or three years so you know you're not\n... how much time did she served before I got it all\nI don't know and I'm Sorry I don't have all the details in front of me right now because I wasn't expecting you to bring\nThat up short yeah then I have a miscarriage of justice and that was absolutely I have a lot I have not rendered and opinion one way or the other I just made the statement after report saying well\nListen I understand that certain states are more restrictive gun laws and others I totally get that but there's no reason why you\nShould uh be a licensed legal gun owner and once you drive right over the border and you go to prison for three years that's ridiculous yeah I agree and and so there needs to be some human uniformity to how the gun laws\nAre a administer across the nation that's the whole purpose for the federal government is to make things uniform this like you can't go to an airport in Atlanta and go through TSA take your shoes off and then you go to an airport in Florida and you just walk right through the checkpoint without getting scanned it all the drivers at work that way and so we\nWe have it and by the way mark ... it used to work that way I think the federal government got involved\nAnd you know what happened we had nine eleven and that's why there's a their standards across the country that cross state lines to prevent certain things like this woman going to prison who never should have been in jail because she had a gun in her car it it is out of control the last thing because I Do this kind of an odd thing um\nAnd so I get I get a chance to talk to a lot of great people around them saying I'm going to try to do to say hey we're at a higher rate over ... says he's the one how does that work out a lot of other stuff and it's entertaining it's not as as you know you tell that people say what needs to be said you've got people from other sides of the party's listen to sell\nThe one colony and every day that's because they live with drought and now they've got plenty of friends is listening and it's not ... ... what I wanted to talk about your brother appreciate the compliment go ahead\nYes sir Yes sir what I wanted to let you know is is that I'm I'm just I I see a lotta a lotta\nOccurring over here in my area and it's this is the comment so so severe it if they want the poor people\nOut what area what area are when I'm In East Point okay and I see it\nWhen I come out when I leave out of my house is about how the market area I'm seeing a white people jogging I'm seeing in Asia people jogging\nAnd this this area was important for for ... my entire life so I I see with ... trees on camp grief and now I I saw with when a major ... actually gave the people ... storm windows put on their windows by the airports\nI've been here for the lone comments and so now I'm seeing how they set off that we're\nAll a public don't count ... partly they're not taking a week they they are victims people out of the apartments across the street from a from a ... that um that I work in the old set of apartments\nIs on the floor of College Park in ... in East Point and they say the airport purchased ... that people are already been evicted that that's one of the highest crime generate instead of says don't apartments within the city so right now I'm seeing all of these apartments within each point cause for our today feel Union City and uh\nThat that are that are all into them\nAnd run down and it got out of drugs coming out of I'm trying to people because I'm On the drug dealers to cut the grass that might as well as I said look man if you want to sell drugs I've done that before but this thing just over this area it's a billion dollar project up the street this thing it's not that it's this this developers and he will not they can feel that the crime\nBut this thing is over in this area it's a billion dollar project of history\nThis thing it's not that it's this this developer and he will not the gas field and it's a crime to dress in the area so if you're going to take it off it yeah free file at a police officer or ...\nOr ... or our office just let this no is because that that stuff is happening over there and they've got it set the tone I'm coming down the road and they got out and says all five man like chips\nRubber on him and they don't realize this is all done in coordination they understand the move and sometimes he was really interesting sometimes they don't even communicate with each other they are saying the move based on the oh the mood and so they know how to move as well\nSo yeah you may see increased police presence you may see private grocery chains\nStopped accepting wake you may see a lot of things started to happen and they're all in the same book not necessarily on the same page\nBut they're in the same book and you can do that when the entire story was written for you so you don't have to be on the same page you just got to be in the same book and that's why we have to be more intentional about being the same page because the book when wasn't written for us\nYes that's oh man I I it just gets me upset\nWhen I say pilot says fill out their immigrate people like to sit in a letter they are like stadium they ... they passed with the with the trolley going around here and there once they're out of office they throw them away because you're not allowed for useful and it can be up to the tune resolve and while the path\nChanged that's what's gonna happen and so what are the other thing is a policy to get an office that does that the\nPeople to support their campaign\nSomebody has their own money to bring their owners did it to the table as long as you have to depend a supporter\nOf giving you money okay thank you off and there are a puppy\nAnd that will end up paying it depends it depends I've seen people do it at the local level with out having major money back in them but remember money only does one thing it helps you distribute your message your messages free\nDistribution of the message costs money that's mailers robo calls door knock hers flyers\nBillboards commercials all of that costs money but what does it actually do it at polls your message so if you could figure out a way to get your message out without having to take money from special interest groups or private developers then that is a win and you don't have to run into office\nPeople your soul I appreciate your call prisoners that are\nBegging me for zero forty now too to seven zero three they get you to compensation for zero for eight

that in public but there are on a lot of people who are quite angry I think there\nIs a plan demonstration in front of my house today\nJust for suggestion of compromise there was a demonstration in front of your house\nWell they feel that to have this is just going to lead to more allegations this is just going to go to a joyous process and we need to move now we have the votes it's this whole tribal\nNature of politics now that to it becomes you know shirts and scams us versus them there's no room for compromise or doubt and that's been projected onto our federal courts in our judiciary people increasingly talk in public and in the Senate about\nEssentially read Jersey judge flew in Jersey judge oh this is a judge from a Bush or Clinton this as a judge from Obama or Trump as if that means you know exactly how they're going to decide on everything\nThat can't be in the case for our federal judiciary if it's going to continue to be a respected gold standard and judiciary around the world [noise]\nYeah something I've been saying for months\nNow we are in an era of complete tribalism as it relates to politics and that is being reflected more and more in our judiciary\n\nThat is a reality ladies and gentlemen it is here it is a fact it is what we are as a country as a nation today not tomorrow not next year not Twenty years from now but right now that is what we are\nWe are not
