I really don't want when I tell brother I could tell you time after time again but that has worked in my face [laughter] that's just me I'm not telling you to do it that way but that's just me I don't take the high road all the time\nYou know I Know you're not telling me to do it but I'd go that route to yeah I mean I I Try to treat everyone fair but if you get in the mud I'm getting right down there which yeah you know we could just do it so you know you're giving me the business I'm gonna give you the business day\nThat's it with some of them I appreciate your call I'm a I'm a try to make them Tonight Show band your brother would love to see you okay okay so four zero for you not to to seven zero three\nSo unlike ... Michelle Obama said when when they go low we go high\nYeah she was just she was just saying something for the the man [laughter] yeah she was just making it a brother and um I I Know she has to say it because she's a former first lady she was the first lady at that time she has to say things like that\nIs there any respect that comes from that like you know to somebody look at that and be like you know I respect that for them not even going that route\nUm she has to say things like that but is there any respect that comes from that like you know could somebody look at that and be like you know I respect that for them not even going that route\nYou have people who are not involved so if you're on the sidelines you may say you know what that was real stand up all of that person to take the high road and not respond so if you're on the sideline yeah maybe you say you know what that was real stand up but if you're in the battle what are you going to respect if you're in a battle Julia\nWhat are you going to respect if you're in the battle\nOr a good fight that is\nSo when you were in the Democratic party and you are\nYou said you were the chief lobbyist\nYeah so I was the lobby is also the political director and chief strategist she tried to just know how much dirt would you necessarily go looking for for your political everything\nLike there was no holds barred it was only a rap battle yeah the only restriction I had personally and I tried to make sure it permeated in the culture of the state Democratic Party at the time\nWas uh children were completely off limits so if they had a child who had some issues with law enforcement I didn't care about any of that showed off limits or your spouse was completely\nFair game everything your mom and dad are completely fair game wow yeah\nThat's ... that's the nature of the business that's the nature of the business\nFor zero for a nicer to seven zero three that gives you the conversation and here's the thing about running for public office anytime you decide to run for public office it's not just you running for public office and that's why I have always encourage anybody who wants to take that leave it is a noble operation\nDonald Trump publicly has now in braced nationalism is nationalism\n\nNationalism is a political social and economic order defined and classified by the status of your race that's basically what it is now we can put all of these other\nDefinitions on the word well that means he's really standing up for America\nNo that's not the context that's not what it means and that's not what nationalism actually means\nWe understand what nationalism movements are about we get it we know we are America\nThis is your new normal\nFor zero for eight nine to two seven zero three four zero for eight nine to two seven zero three nationalism can also be described as an ideology based on the premise\nThat the individuals loyalty and devotion to their nation on NPR raise surpasses that of other groups\nAround them nationalism\n\nFor zero for eight nine to two seven zero three that gets you right here today for zero for eight nine to two seven zero three\n\nAt least the said\nThey should not be a debate any longer and here's what's interesting\nIf somebody stands up from the Democratic party and said there are socialist\nOr somebody belongs to any type of communist friendly political outfit Republicans will destroy fail oh there are social you know was socialism is how does socialism or Tommy evil\nHow does that become evil\nSocialism is the exact opposite of nationalism but if you are deemed a socialist people will interpret that as you make something evil and that they themselves can't even give you the definition of it\n\nBut now that Trump has embraced nationalism the crowd goes wild\nSocialism is a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production distribution and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole\nIt's that the means of production distribution and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole that socialism\nLet me take that step further\nCommunity benefit agreements in our local cities around the state\nOf forms of socialized government understand that those agreements are not purely capitalistic no democratic but rather social\nWe engage in socialize government every day but if\nAny politician stood up and said they were social lives the Senate Republicans were crucified them if a politician was cutting that they take any comment is fairly group they would crucify him but no nationalism they rule our nationalism is not democracy\nUnderstand the hypocrisy here\nThe founding fathers of this nation founded they form of democracy albeit not pure democracy but a form of democracy a form of democracy that said voting actually counts\nNow as the country mature word I use that word loosely as the country mature word that aspect of voting expanded to include black men to include men that did not own property to include women and expand it\n\nThis was not founded as a national this country it was it now here's another question where Republicans start changing their moral compass again again to say well really this ... this country was founded on nationalistic principles\nThis country was founded based on the tennis some nationalism well Republicans start saying that rewriting history in order to fit this president\nBecause those same Republicans have been telling you for decades in this modern era that we are a democracy that we are a nation of the people by the people for the people that's what we are\nThat's what we are but their president said no I'm not a Republican I'm not a Democrat\nI'm not an independent I'm not a socialist I'm not a communist but I Am a nationalist\nThey were waiting for that moment that's the moment they were waiting for that sealed the deal\nFor zero for you not to to

in your address what's going to show up on my app is not the same as what's going to show up on your app because we live in different parts of the city\nI'm In uh want to make sure that you know we fly those two points so\nAmendment three and\nSays essentially that it changes the formula for calculating how much taxes people who have forest land pay so if you own land and it's your house is on it you pay a certain amount and property taxes on land taxes\nUm but if you have\nA forest land and you use it to grow timber to grow would\nThey pay a completely separate amount of taxes than people who own homes and they want to extend on and make it a constitutional amendment for them to have a reduction in the amount that they pay in taxes but people for so for people who own forest land and commercial\nThat is so deep Lindsey ... we are considering making a constitutional amendment absolutely so rich people who own the forest land\nMhm mhm and tear down trees mhm can\nPay a lower tax bill yeah wow yeah\nWow just think about how that is the George a constitution and sacred rite host the constitution of Georgia who cares about these rich force oh I Know the people and the legislature that got the power exactly 'cause nobody else is saying you know what I really would like to the gym can pay lower tax write\nYou know I must ended that wealthy land owners pay so much money it's [laughter]\nRight this is not a thing right now right it it offends me this is this is amazing to\nPut this in the constitution which basically means UK mess with it right exactly if you put it in the constitution is locked in you can't even mess with it anymore one hundred percent yeah our what we got what else we got okay I'm ...\nI'm basically it adds the rights of crime victims\nSue the Georgia constitution is so this is Marcy is law and it's super controversial I see your face I fear\nYou know because I've been watching a Kelsey grammar and everybody do commercials go by business enjoys on my first of all guessing you you're not even from here please go back to wherever you came from somebody okay I'm like wow you hear this while they're at least\nOr should go by business enjoys on my first of all just ... you're not even from here please go back to wherever you can talk to somebody okay I'm like wow you hear us while they're at least at least give me the decency of a person from Georgia okay Frasier [laughter] right right well it is or go off and you're not a real doctors are so please [laughter]\nBut yeah a martial\nLaw super popular amendment for\n[noise] um and essentially a no vote a\nSays it's a no vote does not\nConstitutionally protect crime victims rights in Georgia it does not change existing state law covering the rights of victims of the accused so basically um what they're saying is that\nI'm currently in Georgia I'm you know if you are a victim of a crime um there are certain\nNotices that you are eligible to get if you're if the person who committed a crime against you is going to be up for parole et cetera you're supposed to get a notice\nAnd that's about law that's vital okay and that's the current law in Georgia what Marcy losses to do is to make it a constitutional right um that you know you get notice\nEvery time they go up for parole arm so that you get an opportunity to testify\nEt cetera um and that\nIt's not clear to me again that there is a need for this law I'm I tend to think about extreme cases I mean frequent cases without so extreme cases and I can see\n'em how ah this can be used against black people explained to me to get more people yeah so um\nThat idea that it's a constitutionally mandated like judges makes mistakes prosecuted make mistakes drift mistaking identity um\nBut uh people are poor people are the poverty is criminalized are races being that criminalize century and so the idea that that\nUm what is already a state law is elevated to a constitutional law um or to a a a constitutional right means it will be that much more difficult to change it that much more difficult to overcome it so what if we get to a place for example\nI'm ... and trying to come up with an example that's germane and ridiculous but\nUm you know what if your conviction is overturned 'em I think that um or\n... I was trying to use marijuana example um give me a second but ultimately\nFundamentally I don't believe that um\nWe need to elevate the the the rights of victims are already protected by Georgia State law and elevating it to a constitutional right\nUm feels like I'm\nA it feels like an unnecessary\nMove I Wonder what's behind me ... let me tell you the here's what I Wonder when I looked at an amendment like that number one I Do know that it is\nA law in Georgia to inform victims yet when things like this happen because one of my best friends is an elected prosecutor okay and I remember there was one instance where his office I won't say his name on there but his office made a mistake\nNow is that something you'd rather grim reaper not\nUm I mean I think that smaller school districts I'm On my lose some leverage um but ultimately just does not offend me karma that\nMean ideally I Would like for school districts to work together um\nUh and if this if the tax is to benefit all of the public school students in a county then I see it is I see it as a win for our students and I see it as a win for our community art\nSo do us a favor in say and go over those five but now she lives quickly okay again and remind people where they can go ah to download the app\nSo you can first I'll start by saying you can go to the store and said the Google Play store and download the New Georgia project at 'em\nAnd and it it gives you a personalized ballot you get to see faces and bio of everybody that's running for office in your jurisdiction you know who they are indoor spy I eventually will have donor information so the top five dollars for every one running for office that you're eligible to vote for no longer do you have\nI eventually will have donor information so the top five donors for every one running for office\nThat you're eligible to vote for no longer do you have to go into the voting booth and only know who you want to vote for for president and who you want to work for for governor and gas on everything else you can be informed when you go in\nSo and there are five constitutional amendments I'm being proposed on this November ballot so amendment one I'm eighty percent tax of taxes on sporting goods that go to support our parks and clean water so it's not a new tax\nIs just to make sure that we set aside money from taxes that's already being collected to make sure that we have a clean air clean water and state parks\nUm amendment to is um creating business courts or that the governor would appoint so it's a state wide business courts that people don't get to vote on these judges only the um governor appoints these a judge's amendment three\nI'm changing the formula for calculating taxes on forest\nLand so reducing taxes for people who um our land owners specifically who own forest land and who own land for timber and making it a constitutional amendment I'm\nAmendment for a is a constitutionally also a former leader popularly known as Marcy is law so making a making victims rights a constitutional rights and the state of Georgia and amendment five\nI'm allowing the largest school district in the county to call for a tax increase to support all of the schools in accounting\n... that's really interesting or appreciate real breakdown and what'd you got coming up\nOh man we're excited so you everybody's heard about the seniors that were kicked off the bus in Jefferson County absolutely they're coming to Atlanta on Sunday widower Sosa deposed together we're going to also a thousand seniors and college students going to vote on Sunday we're meeting at the IBM ...

I was the first African American\nAnd you can do to that brag a little bit where did you go to ... because I ... I Wonder what are they always young girls and others who are listening can be inspired sometimes ...\nStore yeah I mean so basically I didn't really know people who are plastic surgeon however I knew this is something I was interested in and so while I was in um college\nUm I made sure I met other alumni who came back ... physicians so doing my programs over the summer and also doing a winter break\nI Would actually shadow doctors because I Want to be your and I want it to be a plastic surgeon and actually entertain pediatric surgery at one time because I did love that\nUm so after that um you know all of these a shadowy and programs I decided to apply to medical schools I went to Albert Einstein College of medicine I got a pretty much a full scholarship except for a thousand dollars a year well and that's why I picked it I got into a number ... holes but for me I didn't want debt\nRight um so I went there was a great program they had a lot of international programs\nDid I got into a number ... holes but for me I didn't want debt right um so I went there was a great program they had a lot of international programs for classic surgeons where they did reconstructive surgery ... yeah and I love that\nUm and while I was there I decided to do some research that I worked in the ... lab because I was interested in how the how at scar would actually\nUm improve or become worse so I had interest while yeah just no because I wanted to make sure that\nWhatever ... takes in surgery because once I was in medical school I knew I wanted to be a surgeon I wanted to keep my research on aligned with the skill right all of surgery there and if you operate you're going to cut somebody and they feel\nThat match it in because you're in one of the things that doctors always do because you were smart minimize your debt that I wanted to go into the\nBig pain feel mhm\nSo are you more creative obviously the ... surgery is a big paying too I mean I get to be a doctor you ain't going to be then no food stamps or you know the\nPresident is this is how it works for me I always feel that\nUm when you go to a lot of schools ... professional schools a lot of time for people of color they pretty much theorists toward low paying career right any feel we go into your mhm and knowing that because I went to this magnet school and high school\nI knew that I had to go if the masses went last I had to go right mhm so if I now I heard of women going into pediatric\nI knew I wasn't going to be a pediatrician\nAnd I you know you would read about it but I just felt like I was good enough\nTo really distinguish myself and also hang with the boys I've always been some very competitive and my own way ... played tennis I ran track\nAnd so I just always wanted to represent because I felt that I was African American that has something to offer and I wasn't afraid of myself and I wasn't afraid of my shadow Saddam was respectful of my space so I never push the envelope a kind of pushed by ... by study\nBy millions at my school board now where where they left you did so they can never cutting out a plan in surgery program or out of a general surgery program\nSo while I was in general surgery I was really fortunate enough to work for people who were pediatric factor surgeons\nAnd they would do face off and work on babies and I worked with some weights he actually surgeons um and I decided to go to Mount Sinai in Montana it was a small fool at that time but it was a Jewish full and I've always found the Jewish population to the dairy nurturing and and also fostering\nEducation now there's really no color not with them put a pan and that we've got to take a quick break food comeback I'm we're kind of heard this story to dancing a plastic surgeon and everything and we'll\nWell um I Want to tell the doctor that that I had much admiration for her profession now that it's actually well studied and trained she is she has a passion for it now now I have a

C. plus I'm\nAn address some Arizona skill ABC\nYeah indeed that's pretty much you know you can go to eat and doubled either ... or more\nFor I Would think for other populations happening more for the Caucasian population to but the average African American woman is looking for somewhere around and see\n... D if you're on reality t._v.\nWhat what ... what they're getting they're getting like that would be OK okay let's let's be Frank about that like ... bottom in the best windows were average in an ad that average for land is not a script\nFor our guy guy tried actually I got I got it up\nAnd job what men get no so memorized rote ... wrote talk ... talk he said oh I'm getting for them they don't want them lines across the forehead you don't have any oh you're in the last you know they have any real evidence down the middle of between their brand right\nUm and then get islet surgery I Know I ... a mob is is radically rights that some people do what should we do stretch amount of what what has outlived surgery I let\nSurgery your action removing the skin of the upper late and you can actually have the\nKind of place up I a little higher if they meet once I got a little higher you can remove that does that make me look younger it would make you look younger because as you get old you look sleep year you know OK rouse fall I got you get ... around the globe but I didn't want to talk about breast cancer so people can come to me for um\nRussia reconstruction um and there are women who have um\nMastectomies either a single mistakes me or a double mastectomy but this is breast cancer awareness month yeah and we need to know some facts um basically about a quarter of a million people\nWere diagnosed with invasive breast cancer this year in the United states alone you have to understand the African American women under the age of forty habits\nWell were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer this year in the United states alone you have to understand the African American women under the age of forty have a greater incidence of breast cancer than the white population mhm and breast cancer is the most common cancer among his stand Hispanic women\nSo this is a very serious issue for us you know we have a poor prognosis because we are diagnosed at a later stage but it really just requires\nDaily or you know yearly mammograms if you get a yearly mammogram people say why do I do eat yearly well not all mammograms will pick up a breast cancer ... percent of the time a mammal ramble not show anything you may have a lot\nSo what mammogram may not show them what's the best of the doctor so what's the best way because they are a couple of years ago there were like\nBreast self exam like they they know good whether you agree or not\nIt's really breast self exam whether the doctor feels the math and then the mammogram and then they have other imaging ... now\nBut the mammogram Israeli every year for him and\nIt's every year because that's you know in some way to go not very good at examining themselves but also when you go for your annual physical if your doctor Phil's lesion they're gonna persistently tried to follow up on that ... see you know there are other things to do which\nI've had to have a close friends who are who are in their forties now been diagnosed recently they trigger age that you see the danger zone age wise of what would and when his ... what do you generally\nSo when I when I Want people to understand there really isn't a trigger age because when you have a lump or a mass and you're right you really have to be focused and make sure it's not malignant if cancerous and needs to be dealt with aggressive her and a lot of times you know I can see women were very young with breast cancer and they don't think it's breast cancer they think it's a benign lump\nSo I don't like to say that there's an average age of course you get older rights more than likely the cancer in general so generally between you know forty fifty is where we're going to see our biggest bombs\nBut all women can get breast cancer and remember men can also get real answer yoga and ... yeah exactly and so also we have something called the breast cancer patients\nEducation Act that something that the American society plastic surgery is pushing and what that what we're trying to do is make sure that when a woman gets a diagnosis of breast cancer that they get the information to understand they can be reconstructed\nBecause when you were reconstructed really going to make you feel hold up some more like a woman sexually it'll make you feel more confident\nAnd it leads to simple nation 'cause remember information is your are\nNow is the reconstruction generally a good good carrying on insurance too\nThat's also covered cover literally it's covering that's the thing but I always tell patients you have to be ready for reconstruction because\nThere's a lot going on when you ... I Can't I mean there are people who have the diagnosis of breast cancer just want to have the ... hits through chemo radiation we know it's almost up to a year of going to just want to live\nLike something you said after the after care the loving husband they launder sand look I Love your\nWords you have abreast of the number is their family members who still come around\nAnd you have a lot to do us ally to use a lot of like well you got to take care of yourself as a mom is the captain of\nAbsolute come on and we have some very probably number tried to get some of them in some very close friend wanted to turn in one of the attorneys\nWhy from you know I think just the power of this story is um these are people close to ... and it's almost like you know how to you what do you say what do you do other than watch their absolute indomitable will encourage to just go\nAnd it's almost like you know how to you what do you say what do you do other than watch the absolute indomitable will encourage to just go do this right but it it is not been to a ... you know the thing that people don't see particularly your loved ones in this case I Know the husband very close\nUm it was tough for him to be needed a support group that's what I mean when you add on constructive surgery too much you know there's more but you can you can you can give them later on down the road and have been laid off because it's still too much\nI'd vote for a night to two seven three looks tasted from Boston don't go to places you've been there a long time hailing from ... from the DMV will come back Dr Lisa do you what was the booze you want you to here say right\nAnd you will look like a Coca Cola bottle oh you want to get your Renault plaster your nose job done to\nMen do you want it you know ... like me you know Doug leagues is here to give it all to you you\nKnow it will come back to ... that we want you to is it expensive is it you know do you have a live boy playing them and I put\nMy nose on their way and paid for overtime I mean it ain't got no issues of whatever the case might be um would talk about all of that because I Know you don't want to know\nAnd so you can manipulate the scar by distracting pulling away\nFrom you know the cartoon ... to the underlying issue you squeeze it and let me tell you this is not fun it hurts\nSo usually I tell my clients and you really want to aggressively to this car do it three days a week so this way if you watch the daily news at ten o'clock you know Don Lemon okay great or you know the ... year mhm if you listen to your show okay sit down and massages for Monday Wednesday friday and you do for a program\nThis way when you go to your doctor and your doctor says well what have you been doing to help yourself you can say well I Try and Madame ... onion extract so it helps only in a third of people so yes or no so that didn't work I massage aggressively and the doctor always goes well what does that mean to you because most people think that just touched it and I'm done\nBut when you show a doctor you've been aggressively massaging that means is really just not really amenable to massage and the only next therapy is you can inject it with a chemical to help flatten it\nAnd that's wrong analog and what that does is basically slow as well as the process of covering the genesis down the college and makes the scar it makes too much of a scar and that's why you have the speed bumps and when it to feel the way that makes a lot of car and well roaches beyond the borders of the car\nAnd it becomes almost like a piece of meat on this yeah and so those are treated where'd you can try injection therapy but that sometimes very painful\nUm and so you can go on from the injection therapy to have it excites even have radiation you're treated so there's a hole spectra\nDoes a lot of different options do we want me to start just I Would say you got any laws\nWhere you are kind of a non surgical kind of guy you don't want to have surgery nine that crazy about so we're going to start with aggressive massage\nAnd ... ... is not as bad as much as I Want to exactly\nAnd you'll actually see all the different the next thing I Would recommend is probably just inject you with the little bit and along okay and that's his theory that basically flattened hard now has to be injected very carefully because if you have high dose cataloguing cause your color cells to go away and you\nGet a ... term of why are we going to just savvy I becoming white she got to\nHave a doctor who knows what they're doing you know have your people tell her that's it I got rid of all we're all go out to get to these phone calls or let's go to Stacy in Boston you got to a question with Dr Lisa they\nGuy Dr Lisa\n...\nSo um [noise] my question is I've had three ... with my children [noise] and I've also had the gastric I'm not by a pass but the sweet surgery mhm\nUh-huh I've had that also now I have a ton of me that hangs down a little bit and I wanted to know what can I Do to get rid of it like I I Can't see my bottom area\nBecause my stomach hangs down a little bit not to mention okay talk about boy\nI I Can't say my bottom area because stomach hey look down a little bit not to mention okay talk about [noise]\nUm I my she was like an upside down here I have ... I have no ... I just am blessed I'm a liberal the size and show 'em big so\nThis is what I recommend probably so when you've had 'em some type of gastric\nOr massive weight loss surgery that's great insurance companies now have restricted their coverage for um repairing or doing up and if you like to me that you can look ... policy and see if massive weight loss surgery is a benefit if it's a dentist that\nThen you see a plastic surgeon and then they may be able to depending on your symptoms submit some information for picnics electing not panic if you like to me is part of a tiny tap that a tiny tack\nThat isn't it so if you like to me is its own surgery and if and if you like to me is included in a tiny town\nBut it's true that is not included in it than if you like to me it's just the lower half\nOf the skin is removed now the reason why I Try to do it through insurance is because that's going to decrease the costs somewhat and the other thing you can do is you can do a money maker over half\nA breast reduction done and it's the same time do your tummy and that will also decrease the costs\nSo there are a lot of surgeons that will work with you you may have to wait and change your insurance and make sure it's a covered benefit and you know you have to jump through these hoops like he may have to see a physical therapist you may have to take some more conditions for your back pain shoulder pain that Cain is that\nUm but by and large just make sure you find out it's a covered benefit is a breast reduction a covered benefit is a picnic electing a covered benefit is massive weight loss surgery a covered benefit if it is then you start looking for your plastic surgeon\nAnd just discuss it with a make sure they have insurance and they also do cosmetic surgery 'cause a lotta times we can create extreme value for our clients not\nWe've got to a quick break now if if she's in Boston but say look my doctors Dr Lisa in Atlanta I leave you know I see people from all over 'em so\nDarned at least at the ... naturally Instagram or you can call for zero four to four zero eight zero for\n... or go to plastic surgery heights in Atlanta dot com as my website to Instagram is easy what easiest way to ... to get back to you and people come from all over to see me they stay here for about a week or two on you know we have\nHungary houses in Atlanta wow do you know you just got to figure it out you know you can do it online consult with me I mean it's amazing what we do in my heart or do these days\nWon't come back more tell people if they are considering any of these surgery whether the main uh\nMostly these are not elected some like you said they can be taught to other things as well exactly and and you didn't get it that's where the value comes eyes\nYou were going to get your pen and paper and when we come back we'll let her give her phone number and got a few more minutes to go and uh we'll come back we'll talk to jak we'll talk to ... as well for for eight nine to two sevens are three of you have a question you'd call quick\nTo get it in also have some tickets to give ...

[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nIt remains to be seen exactly\nHow this this trade hands out for both the Dallas Cowboys and the Oakland Raiders 'cause we don't know who that number one draft\nPick will be for Oakland we don't know what will happen moving forward with either jak or Cooper or the fence but on paper it was worth making the trade I'm all in on the cowboys making this move\nI Believe that that Cooper can change the office and a variety of ways also this is the opportunity to the cowboys need to evaluate that Prescott\nYou know write as much as I Do the jury is still out on jak is he going to be the face of the franchise moving forward is he going to be the quarterback of the future for the cowboys going to move on from him once his rookie contractors that are they going to pay like a starting quarterback in the NFL\nSwitch right now the going rate is between twenty five and thirty million dollars a year they cannot evaluating jak Prescott until they give him another receiver because last time he had started to throw to reliable experience surrogate the cowboys were Thirteen and three\nAnd he had what twenty three touchdowns versus foreigners options and so it's not possible\nTo evaluate him and his decision making and him as a\nSignal color for the cowboys and you don't give him a number one wide receiver which is a kind of a hidden reason to make this move for the cowboys after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS Sports radio\nI'm already Cooper showing up now with the by we for the cowboys but he was showing up for the first time with the facilities and getting a two hour on Tuesday\nIs great you know a storage furniture and not just came just walked through the place and you know it's a it's a great place man phenomena a mum was\nCooper's a little bit gun shy like wow it's like the young guy who still just ...\nAnd Cooper's a little bit gunshot like whoa\nIs that young guy who is still just twenty four years old the cowboys are certainly one of those franchises that elicit fall\nThree first round picks next season for the Oakland Raiders but for I'm already Cooper this is a new lease on life he's got twenty two catches two hundred yards and a touchdown and a six games I haven't heard that he got officially cleared from concussion protocol but they're coming out there by week in Oakland and his\nHelmet to helmet hits was back when they were in London so let's hope that's the case and he can get right to work with the cowboys\nTrying to come in and you just hope the cowboys you know when we're games or wherever they are trying to accomplish a hardworking God go I was going to come in every day and you know doing into you know we're really extremely hard to be the best I can be it'd be the best team in ...\nSo that's what the cowboy should expect from a large Cooper into his fourth season the Alabama product sitting down with the media for the first time in those soundbites come from cowboys dot com it's after hours with Amy Laura's on CBS Sports radio\nHead coach Jason Garrett was a guest on our Dallas affiliate one five three to fan I Know a lot of you listen and we got to get tons of calls\nFrom cowboys fans not just in Texas but a lot of you in the Dallas Fort Worth Arlington area\nWanting to weigh in on this trade over the last twenty four hours and Jason Garrett is now telling you exactly what he thinks of Cooper and this isn't just because of the train he's he's had this opinion of Cooper for quite a while we know\nPeople well above a really highly regarded by the people around them\nOn a daily basis of both as a player and as a person with the same same report for people going around to a pro football so he's twenty four years old religion has a lot of physical ability to going to help us up for the kind of want to bring your football team\nAnd to me that's huge that age that age factor is uh to me one of the major selling points to make this trade because more than likely the cowboys were going to draft a receiver in the first round or make a high draft pick\nFor our receiver in two thousand Nineteen but you've already got\nA young receiver in fact Cooper still under his rookie deal he's got the rest of this year so you're not just renting and for the end of this year plus next year his options already kicked in and he's only twenty four which means he's going into the prime of his career he still has plenty of miles left on those legs\nBut he's already got some wisdom and experience he already fans of gives me already understands how the NFL works and what it means to be a pro football players there are still learning curve like there would be for real gr a broker like us it's definitely help show where the brain of the mouse to light up\nHe knows what it means to be a pro but he's still under that rookie contract which means the cowboys also has some time to decide how he fits in but he's he's impact with immediate when he joined the raiders\nAs a fourth overall pick in two thousand Fifteen he had to back to back pro bowl campaigns and if you look deeper into his stats which I did with my column\nHi I'm Joan London with a place for mom nobody knows your

ask me about one exotic food I made this week we're all good there are also some leftover chilly in my fridge but that'll be consumed on Wednesday [noise] any other food questions\nAfter hours with Amy Laura you're CBS Sports radio I feel like they're always food questions that's okay we love to talk about food around here in Star Wars that you're interested in my solo review okay\nI Can't be jumping the gun I got away from producer Chris uh TV up ready set go\nAmy I'm asking you to review so\nThat was a statement not a question can you wait is this all this from you or is this from someone else's from me uh okay cool well wait a minute just to talk about it yet though I didn't catch you two words after that the uh the viewing of solo which I\nI did while I was folding laundry and well my dog was a beauty parlor on Saturday was a couple of minutes a quiet and like I have to watch this movie before the game seven of ... and I'll see us darts and the football they Sunday\nIt was highly entertaining I really thought it was it was fine them so it didn't feel much like a star wars movie to me that there were fewer\nFewer direct references to the star wars franchise is do you could tell that the young actor playing Han Solo had definitely studied the iconic character because he dropped in a few of the lines and he also you could tell was trying to mimic the ... the mannerisms that Hans solo I'm Harrison Ford made so iconic\nBut it didn't feel much like a star wars movie to me except for the millennium falcon I Would say my favorite part was how he ... that was awesome the way they develop their friendship their relationship and became lifelong partners that to me was the best part about\nPlus Darth mall and that's what I texted ... whatever you don't throw your hands up in the air there Isaac you haven't seen that yet that you don't get to be protected from spoilers my favorite guy well good he's in the movie but he's not in a very long and you're left to wonder was\nAlso there were some anxious there with the ah storyline about the the woman from his past and and that made me really sad but then I thought what was she now going to turn into a step is that kind of the idea we don't actually know but uh yeah the the Woody Harrelson role awesome and I jumped\nWhen he died I won't say how he died well I guess whatever now he died uh I I went no Han Solo shot him it was such a surprise\nThat I was like whoa I jumped out at my feet but yeah I don't the movie with really good again I felt very disconnected to the star wars franchise but it for two hours of entertainment why not I bet it was fantastic on the big screen I just saw it on my own TV but I bet it was amazing uh in in a surround sound on the big screen so I like it\nDo we have like an official like one out of four stars were five and three\nEasing uh in in a surround sound on the big screen so I liked it\nDo we have like an official like one out of four stars are five and three because again it wasn't because of my love for Star Wars that I loved the movie it kind of stands on its own um though I did appreciate the debacle part if things\nI'm putting just even if you know nothing about Star Wars it would've been a fun movie it was action packed it was really fast pace some great cinematography and very dark at times too\nUm but yeah I really I enjoy watching it and uh finally understand the crimson dawn storyline that got\nUm revealed at the end yeah that was good\nFor us [laughter] perfect Saturday Night with the family at home just need some fun to watch\nYeah except that in mind was pre college football in pre game seven because I had to work on my sports so it's weird to watch a movie in the daytime I don't normally do that but I thought it was good it was kind of a cloudy darker day because\nThere was rain so what happens so we'll start with the pure who writes dear Amy very dramatically you think the prices of tickets for sporting events have gone out of control and if you do what would you do to ...\nWell I don't think you can fix it I mean this is the United states of America this is capitalism it's supply and demand so as long as people are willing to pay the prices for the tickets are well then obviously owners and stadiums uh they're they're going to continue to get what they can get at at the gate\nAnd I don't know that you need to change what I Will say is if you if you don't want the prices to go up for that what would have to happen there would have to be empty seats at the park\nBut as long as there are people willing to buy them it you know it's it's does suck right because then you go and if you want to take a family of four you're talking about a couple of hundred bucks depending on where plus\nThe parking always gets me then the concessions I usually take my own snacks I hardly ever buy anything it stadiums\nUm I tried to smuggle in waters generally when you go into a press pass you can get away with smuggling some stuff in the press box or in your bag but yeah I Know it's hard I mean it's hard to to fork over that kind of money if you have to drive any length of time or maybe want to fly to a particular game is expensive\nGenerally there are ways you can get cheaper tickets\nAre sometimes on the secondary market or you wait till the last second um or you know you go into the season tickets package with a group of people sometimes that's a great way to be able to get into two or three games because most teams will have\nLet's say in case of baseball a Fifteen game package or thirty game package so you buy in and and you get a better rates and the access to better seats it's to splurge every now and then to be sure maybe it's like a once a year thing\nYou go and he splurge and you really enjoy it\nSo Kevin using a birthday present sorry that's I think that's a good idea of them have been using the hashtag ask me anything was today in Boston we had help rein lightning water spout and a

became a nationalist\nAnd really we're not supposed to use that word you know what I Am I'm a nationalist sub [noise]\nDonald Trump publicly has now in braced nationalism is nationalism\n\nNationalism is a political social and economic order defined and classified by the status of your race that's basically what it is now we can put all of these other\nDefinitions on the word well it means he's really standing up for America\nNo that's not the context that's not what he means and that's not what nationalism actually mean\nWe understand what nationalism movements are about we get it we know we are America\nThis is your new normal\nFor zero for eight nine to two seven zero three\nFour zero for eight nine to two seven\nZero three nationalism can also be described as an ideology based on

you right here today for zero for eight nine to two seven zero three\nAt least the said\nThere should not be a debate any longer and here's what's interesting if somebody stands up from the Democratic party and said there are socialist\nOr somebody belongs to any type of communist friendly political outfit Republicans will destroy veil oh there are social you know was socialism is how does socialism Tommy evil\nHow does that become evil\nSocialism is the exact opposite of nationalism but if you are deemed a socialist people will interpret that as being something evil and that they themselves can't even give you the definition of it\n\nBut now that Trump has embraced nationalism the crowd goals while\nSocialism is a political and economic theory\nThe crowd rolls while\nSocialism is a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production distribution and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole that socialism\nLet me take that a step further community\nBenefit agreements in our local cities around the state of forms of socialized government understand that those agreements are not purely capitalistic no democratic but rather social\nWe engage in socialized government every day but if\nAny politician stood up and said they were social lives the say Republicans were crucified them if a politician was connected to any comment is fairly group they would crucify him but no nationalism they rule our nationalism is not democracy\nUnderstand the hypocrisy here\nThe founding fathers of this nation founded a form of democracy\nAlbeit not pure democracy but a form of democracy a form of democracy that said voting actually caps\nNow as the country mature word I use that word loosely as the country mature word that aspect of voting expanded to include black men to include men that did not own property to include women and expand it\n\nThis was not founded as a nationalist country it was it now here's another question where Republicans start changing their moral compass again again to say well really this ... this country was founded on nationalistic principles\nThis country was

that's the main thing for today\nUm however I Want to um\n... into a conversation with my guests who are in the studio oh this is world when steak or I have a with the national director of public policy in the search for minorities for medical marijuana as well at the Georgia\nThat is correct yes please explain to my listeners ... ... ... is all about and I'm was going on we're going to do is make sure I'm going to let cast take that 'cause she she's our point person for that come over here\nAll right national experiment we um came about Torry um kill Marshall as a young lady from Washington DC she owns that company we baked and say I'm at a company that are of course is legal in Washington DC and she had a dream of\nSeeing her peers who have a records and can't get 'em ... adequate housing employment I'm voting rights education\nAccess um to have their records expunged of a misdemeanors and convictions and um that um time it pass and so he was helping them out herself and she and the system was a little arduous and approach so she wanted to coordinate and effort just in Washington DC and that gave birth at the genius mosaic\nI'm In Washington DC to a larger project idea with Adam bind who owns case who started cage free cannabis and there are quite a few organizations involved in the legalization of the movement to legalize cannabis and a lot of us are faced the facing a lot of 'em\nInvolved activists who have small you know I'm charges who need their records expunged so\nUm national expungement weekend the week of events across the U.S that we coordinated with all of these organizations because we don't we lack the resources a lot of people want to give money to invest in the cannabis industry but they don't want to look at the social justice and from the justice reform aspects of it right the expungement is very necessary you know do we definitely got together and we said OK\nTruly recalls blurt people absolute ... more records were more records or interested more in our criminal law of war\nWe were having this discussion last night and you know it was yours ahead was absolutely Jordan has ten point six approximately ten point six I'm residents in the state of Georgia two point six residents have convictions on the records\nAnd when you look at the disproportionate number of African Americans who are arrested for possession of cannabis Ninety to Ninety six percent of arrests in Atlanta\nAre of African American descent and and you look at three point seven thirty percent of African Americans\nAre of arrest in Atlanta are African Americans were more likely three point seven three percent more likely to be arrested then I'm white counterparts for cannabis production so when you look at those numbers those are incredible numbers when when they factor out and you see how many African Americans might well they had to\n... ... what we know the truth Robert motion very looking for nobody\nWell around the nation from Seventy seven million Americans have convictions on their records were seventies I mean you got Seventy seven million people who face everyday housing restrictions restriction access\nTo education to getting a job I mean to getting up everyday and understanding that you have very limited resources\nSo magical expungement we use could make good particularly to or convictions related to kind of ... no no\nActually no no actually we were helping out all types of people in Athens as long as it's a misdemeanor\nOr you haven't been convicted at every state has different every county has different parameters and that's what was very interesting to us we learned a lot during the clinic naturally and even the county solicitor very interesting\nWe had um participants in the clinic who had very basic questions what infractions are you know can be expunged he had to bring out the code book himself and read them and read them because he didn't know them [laughter]\nCan be explained he had to bring out the cold become self and read them and read them because he didn't know\nWhat goes on we need to look into the what's the what's the what's the range of things that can be exposed\nNow see I'm not up last night yeah non violent crimes mostly and\nCrimes of a sexual nature a non violent crimes crimes that um are not drug I'm ... don't deal with I'm just I'm\nDisturbed distribution of drugs yeah if if it personal they determine personal possession violent minds anything against children anything that having to deal with any type of child violation sexually or any violently or anything like that definitely is on the list of not being the lives of our\nDevon the infraction yes like Seventy some friction so that you can't get that you can't get it straight and then it goes into different codes sections and um it's different reference to so it's\nOK well they say or whatever what I'm saying to\nVery telling you would want to really guy whether it's do you what\nDown to the return to review [noise]\nIs the music\nOr they are here we are discussing a expungement week oh which we are in the mid stove right right and do people need to know this is what you can just what could be exposed\nMurder\nFelonies and first degree misdemeanors in which the victims and to use a rape sexual battery corruption level of mine from sexual impulses and I don't know what that is\nA senator or pornography involving a mind them or serious weapons charges ... do a drug that's right okay but I guess if you\n[laughter] I mean like I said it it varies based on what county you live in based on what state you live in every every judicial system has something set up differently and that's why\nThis this conversation is so necessary and why we made it a national explains why they made it a national expungement week\nIs because there needs to be across the board even if it's just state by state something across the board\nThat clearly states what the regulations stipulations are not having to go to each county district attorney to try to figure these things out because that's what that's what takes a lot of the time and it just figuring out what each county and how each county and state is set up\nAnd you've got someone that's just come out of prison who's already been beat up by the system Mm and they're facing a lack of knowledge about how to operate in in in ... and go through the system known early and\nSo um it it becomes a problem\nFor them when they don't know whether you go to the sheriff's office there da da da da da da da da and their solicitor ... what is the solicitor general right right of lives were ... in food to vote ... your your views all over the ... northern justice\nOr they're just as you if you use a just a phenomenal phenomenal mhm amazing person and who ... who works on behalf of all of the people\nAll the people who are you guys happens to be a African American yeah but you use ... and it's a blessing it is ... is that the way across the state of course no no of course no it was much more difficult outsider anywhere else out of food to go up slowly and ... you have taken a\nVery aggressive approach to expungement and restored of justice and when the county\nYesterday when we were at Morehouse campus for a candidate is um politics challenges and opportunities panel discussion ah we had mayor pro tem mark Baker um that was my first time meeting him and hear him speak\nUm but it's it is great because he really feels like south Fulton is like what kind of um him and the mayor down there are trying to their best believe they're bad beautiful yes no honestly he settled on times yeah like he was like he's proud of the fact that they have\nA a a a threshold address full of females\nAnd black female man running they said yeah let a third largest I'm black populated a city in the state where Lou\nLevel so I'm I'm On the other thing I find that right and I and I can appreciate\nThat there are people um that come from our communities that come from these communities that are ... that come back to their communities and I'm giving back to\nAppreciate that there are people ah that that come from our communities that come from these communities that are ... that come back to their communities and giving back to their communities it's so important\nIs the ones who are with your own ... break man I Want to get I Want to talk about um\nUm this this governor's race ... inside on the debate and what you saw last night ... um because you know you hear the sadness said rather cavalierly so that we have an opportunity to make history\nHistory could actually I mean really really history can actually be made\nThis this this woman is eminently qualified for the overqualified you know what I'm saying that's right and ... and has a record of standing with him for the ... when you look at camp record I mean is I mean\nIt just boggles me yeah it boggles mean uh but I've said this today and and other times is will\nThat uh this country right now is polarized Mm when one North Pole and south pole ... right\nAs far away from each other ideology ideologically best possible right so what ever is going to happen on election day is going to be based upon who gets up it gets out 'cause it's what have nose up\nAt ... that's what it's gonna come down the numbers I Know my I Know mine changing now everybody\nIs in their position and they're not moving Mm you know what I'm saying so ah you know you folks did they characterize as independent as you already know ooh you know how that's going to go to\nThat's right you know your candidate is not going to win so you choose and you're going to vote for\nThe ... the independent I Love him I Love pacman was well he's I Would I feel like I was looking at your period you know what I Would just add\nThat is the ... I got on the we'd be you know and and um you know I think he would it wouldn't mind this I just knowing who he is in his fight in this but he's he's a survivor\nYou know he he knows what the power that plant is you know the time it is yes and that I I was not alone yeah yeah yeah you know the time that\nYou can run down yeah any information on cannabis ... ... yeah\nYou know the south was as little as like I Wish he had a ... like you got to about three percent [laughter] three three and a half year\nRight or will be like when we get back into the movement ah my name is loaded takes key words sound Seventy where they wanted to a good one one thousand dollars in once I'm Out of the ... one of them were the Oakland system news from Thirteen it it will be ...\nSays it's insightful it's into accent it's stopped provoking intelligent black radio some either Los Vegas and you're getting down with the movement with Dr ... on news in top Thirteen eighty W.

fantastic I Hope\nYou're doing well as well I'm doing very well let me ask you about\nThe content of the commercials on because this is not a parody this was a real commercial airing on Arkansas\nAre airing in the state of Arkansas what made you approve this commercial\nWell actually we we finished a thrown on friday and we started the jobs that on a Monday you know which is running through the election\nI got you nobody cares about the jobs that are ... ... or ...\nOr ... or the abortion out but\nRight let me get why nobody cares about those that are just that we're in Georgia\nAre we care about the ad that has made national news so it's great that you run into the ads but let's talk about the ad that made national news because we're in the state of Georgia not really involved in Arkansas politics you're from uh North Carolina but what made you put that this kind of proven\nWell again your listeners should be said man because or all all the ads because they will end up\nAh defeating Claire McCaskill electing Josh Hawley in Missouri but in any event we can talk about that later on I was horrified watching the Kavanaugh hearings and actually I was trying to come up with a school choice at such\nA Democrat so opposed school choice of war um support the union to want to crush black boys in the in the union run schools that don't teach them how to read right now but I I didn't have as good a school choice it out and I I said wow\nYou know the Democrats and the friend is a folks running the Democratic party right now and the me too movement\nThat just a pro salt on black man and and the women who love us so let's put an ad together because again a white Democrats can't jump they have to get Ninety percent of the black vote in order to get elected in the south\nAnd you know with regard to jobs or abortion or or or the Kavanaugh hearings there's more than ten percent of black writers who are up are concerned\nAbout the fringe positions of the Democratic party so that's why we put together it's a very effective ad\nThat's why I approve the ad because we want it to make sure everybody knows that if I'm In a black folks catch hell with the presumption of it\nI approve the ad because we want it to make sure everybody knows that if I'm In a black folks catch hell with the presumption of innocence Sarah Leah Kurt standard for convection what happens if you change\nIf the me too movement of successful and we believe all accusers\nMr ... miserable I Believe Emmett Till's accusers\nOkay so Mr Robison my response to you is this\nA Brett Kavanaugh current Supreme Court justice did have the presumption of innocence presumption of innocence is a standard hailed with in the confines of the court of law not the court of public opinion he has no constitutional right\nTo become a Supreme Court justice that is a courtesy offered to you threw out the transition and progression of your life and he's reached that status to use in there so there's no question about the presumption of innocence the presumption of innocence is intact for Brett Kavanaugh just as it should be\nBecause he has not been charged you know convicted of anything in a court of law\nIn addition to that you add up or claims\nThat Democrats and this was a quote girl white Democrats religion black folk again do you actually believe that\nUh we have to answer your face again I ask you there was no trial with Emmett Till should we believe that accuser to white Democrats did\nKnow that that's the reality reality as women hidden out what's ... women have made false allegations we've talked about talked about this program many many many times before my question in my ... and ...\nBut I I Want to ask you the ad takes to test me too movement saying we should believe all cancers\nNo believe that that's not I do not believe the me too movement that says believe all the kids well what I find I don't I'm good with the me too movement let me tell you I'm good with me too movement because I knew or harassment takes place on ... and I know women have been somewhere in the highlands\nBelieve all accusers\nI don't know I don't care who wears T shirts that that has nothing to do with my fundamental belief if I Believe a person based on the preponderance of evidence I Believe that person for example tend to smile to get caught up in the me too movement to right Pamela Molly lost his job I stand with Tavis Smiley\nI think what's habit smiley did was something\nThat is done and workplaces where men worked with women and date them I don't think he did anything outside of that and he has admitted to doing that which was a violation of quoting a two public broadcasting of their internal policy but he got caught up in that me too movement I stand with
