W A L K I'm to be the math isn't Janice Memphis is here in Atlanta with me in Studio and you're listening to accounts of the a conviction I'm Jason Van Dyke I said earlier just invent die but his name was\nOfficer Jason Van Dyke well whatever his name is he's in jail today convicted of second degree murder was shooting Laquan McDonald a sixteen times in Chicago in two thousand fourteen that was the same year the Michael Brown was shot and killed in Ferguson, Missouri\nBut this case it in a long time to come to trial and there was a video at the center of this matter a body cam that was won by officer Jason Van Dyke\nIt suits Chicago parties over a year to release that video even though there were protests you know Jay and there were a whole lot of political implications regarding this look why make Donald case and you pointed out to me one of which is that the prosecutor was by the original prosecutor\nShe was fired by the voters Anita Alvarez here was defeated and they brought in a special prosecutor handled this case and we ought to congratulate him think Patricia brown Holmes who was the prosecutor who's rowdy and best to prosecute this case but when voters make up their man\nThanks Patricia brown Holmes who was the prosecutor who's brought in special ed to prosecute this case but when voters make up their minds\nThat something needs to change you can get rid of an Anita Alvarez who played a key role in keeping that video he hadn't for more than a year and get somebody who views the law firm a more equal perspective but there are a lot of implications I mean just a few of them of course\nFirst of all I think we must say that look want not coming back to the family\nA Seventeen year old has gone from his family forever and nothing that happens in the courtroom can change that so hard to go out to them the other thing I wanted you to explain to me the difference between first degree and second degree murder in Illinois\nYou know we tend to think murders murder killings dealing with all kinds of degrees of killing\nAnd so maybe we could talk a little bit about that from a legal perspective\nWhere there are different degrees of killing and a first degree murder is what we think of what a person could get life in prison or the electric chair for but second degree murder is\nA less oh has less penalty then first degree murder and I'm going to look at it while we're on the air what the penalty in Illinois is with second degree murder does it also\nInvolve a less militia state of mind\nIt involves a less malicious state of man and the jury in um this Van Dyke case I keep calm lukewarm McDonald's case but Bullock won McDonald is gone the person who was on trial was Jason Van Dyke the officer\nIn his case the jury found that uh he was acting in the line of duty when he\nThought that he was doing the right thing now I don't ever know after all these thousands of years the price of law I don't know how a jury can determine what a person is thinking\nOf all they know is what the person does but the jury determines it was a first degree murder because\nHe was less culpable and that was because he was acting in the line of duty\nIn my mind it would be that he would be more couple would because he's acting in the line of duty mhm but because he should be held to the highest and he he held to a higher standard but that's why the jury found him guilty of second degree murder\nOr not malicious murder bloody murder that took place I'm more than negligence but less than malicious and asked\nThe clip that um was play when we came back from the break emphasize the point that you made earlier about protests there were if dances protracted protest together with\nOrganizing and voter activism in Chicago about this incident\nAnd just like you said the NFL protests played a role the local protests and activism and organizing also played a role because people came alive thing I it occurs to me is as far as I can recall there only four states in the country\nThat have ever elected a United States senator they are Illinois South Carolina\nLouisiana during reconstruction and Massachusetts and geography matters I'm not sure even a good special prosecutor could have gotten that verdict in Florida because there was a verdict in Texas but what is it that makes these states\nIllinois and Massachusetts in particular different from saying Dylann Roof in South Carolina the what was the guy that was not in the back and the prosecutor was acquitted I mean the or a police officer was acquitted\nThe roof in South Carolina that was the guy that was shot in the back and the prosecutor was acquitted I mean the or\nA police officer was acquitted well the police officer was included in that case he was found guilty he's found guilty of murder and ... and I'm going to look his name up 'cause we are so many unfortunately that we I Can't\nImagine my theory is wrong but I'm just thinking that some of these states do a better job of\nOf a minister and justice than others they certainly do a jazz you were talking about the local protests in Chicago or the police Superintendent Garry McCarthy was fire 'em\nTo prosecute the cook county state's attorney Anita Alvarez was voted out and Mayor Rahm Emanuel decided not to run decided not to run 'em and that's because the protests are turned very quickly to him he said the buck stops here because I'm the mayor well\nThe bug they're starting to have it took him at his word took him at his word and\nHe and he had been on thin ice with the black community in Chicago for a minute and he found decided not to run again ...\nProtests mad as voting matters the political environment matters who the prosecutor is matters\nAnd so we get a little bit of relief but it I think the bigger question ... another question that the bigger question but another question is and I know the black lives matter people going to get mad at me going to start calling\nIs just down the ... the with second degree murder so he pleaded\nGuilty to violating got civil rights but the way he violated his right was by committing second degree murder by shooting them in the back my student I'm In the back end wasn't either one and also planet is okay is or or something on Walter Scott body ... as he lay there dying instead of calling the\nRight side to get him some help he's fixing up his defense and just so happens someone with the ana tree with a camera\nYeah but it in it right he he was the first\nTrial and they were they charged him with murder that ... that trial ended in a hung jury and that happens a lot for for you legal scholars if the first trial doesn't go right\nThe prosecutor can ... if there was a hung jury to jury can agree to prosecute it can bring the case again and often while they're waiting to bring it again a plea will get worked out and so that's what happened in this case\nThere was a prosecutor isn't good for that there was a guilty conviction there\nWas a conviction because he play a guilty plea get on the state charges in in the federal charges what he went to prison though\nRight Jose a guilty on the federal charges but the court as part of the technicality of the federal charge you had to designate what evidence there was the support that there was an underlying selling\nWell we're glad in South Carolina that he's locked up oh we really I really am I'm Glad that the north Charleston police immediately fired him\nAnd they started talking about prosecution right away I did not think that what happened in South Carolina where we have John on the line and he wants to talk about what I don't want to talk about which is the Supreme Court\nDecision or but we're talking about it\nBecause this is John and because he's on that causes them for their hey how are you\nAll right how are you ladies sooner you'll always my favorite lawyers are trying to get a good lawyer whatever they want you to our\nFavorite Chris you give us excellent tit bits of information that we need to know if I yeah I Do want to talk about the um the so called phone a a um a decision that has been voted on a flashlight as well as what's coming down I guess within the next Fifteen minutes but\nMaybe you can ask me some questions you talked about briefly about the Chicago police officer [laughter] um I I Know I'm kinda surprised I didn't think he was going to get any time but\nThe verdict is diverting but as I listen to the Chicago state of our radio station\nAnd I've been following that maybe you can explain to me why has it taken five years to get this guy in it in court or maybe I guess the system probably taught well maybe if we drag this out people forget about it\nAnd we'll get impartial jury on their favorite these cops which is what we always see\nAnd this guy may walk out but I guess it is what it is and I'm hearing some of the people there and Chicago also stating I Know you kind of ...\nI may walk out but I guess it is what it is and I'm hearing some of the people there and Chicago also stating I Know you kinda mapped out the verdict and the time he made shirts but it sounds like I'm hearing from Chicago he may he may only served five and\nGet off on good be five to ten and get off on good behavior where maybe less than three he may be out there maybe you can explain this to me\nWell the address the delay there was a there is a cover up that is being prosecuted now I Can't say that\nUh those people are guilty but three Chicago police officers have been charged with conspiring to cover up what really happened or in that a murder of liquid McDonald's\nThat's unprecedented to um the cover up to place we know the ... well I Know the cover up to take place but that they would be caught in their tracks and prosecuted for it that's that's pretty extraordinary\nUm and the entire Chicago police department is now facing federal oversight of following the United states just a department of justice investigation so that's one thing that caused it to take a long time there was reluctance\nOn the part of the prosecutors and police officers to release the body cam from um the officer Van Dyke\nThat was part they say of the cover up all the conspiracy to cover up that's yet to be determined because that trial has not taken place but the whole process of trying to cover it up trying to get rid of the people who were trying to cover it up that takes time\nAnd I don't know but at some of the people in Chicago's think that the mayor had something to do with trying\nTo minimize the impact of this murder on the community in other words not wanting to have the protests not wanting to have people are fired up over this thing and so\nThey think I don't know whether it's wrong or right they think that he may have I'm encouraged to cover a at least tolerated to cover up to try to keep the peace in the city\nWhere am I think you're right on the news where everything that I've been listening to out of Chicago and this one station I listened to and everything you just talked about was that out in the money I'm less so the mayor of that's why he's not going for reelection he's walking away 'cause\nShe's really pissed off the whole black community and he knows his his days are numbered any out the door [noise] uh so I guess we'll see how this plays out but three to five years this guy I think three to five he's going to be walking are\nGood behavior he'll he'll be out of there was like going to a country club and they can't put a man of regular prison system so he'll probably go to a country club\nIn Iran where do you think about the fact that the prosecutor who help with the cover up was ousted by the voters does it affect your opinion of boating\nWell you know it doesn't affect my opinion I think he he sees the writing a law on the public ... in in that community has decided that they're moving in a direction that prosecutor has to go because I think it's dirty stuff\nGoing on with us you get unelected she went because he got voted out he got voted out\nWell you know let's see let's see I'm curious to see how the verdict is going to\nCome ... years John you you believe that's the right outcome don't you give the third\nOf that sentence you wouldn't have any problem with that which I\nDon't know now now you're saying he got Twenty years is that the cost\nOf that then you wouldn't have any problem with that would\nDo no no no you're saying he got Twenty years that the court's decision\nNot yet but he is subject it's going to give you an\nOkay but for what I'm hearing from those people and she uh Raleigh Bay and the\nProsecutor done do to than it than John ... the ... thing so my question is about

A. okay good question how he's made by ... methods now before the nine to three sisters in law are on the news WGLA okay [noise]\nGood afternoon Atlanta Welcome back\nTo this is all new to him talk Thirteen eighty W A L K through talking to our friend Sherry and she was talking about voting and she has other information she wants to share with the hay shared thanks for holding don't\nThank you told me over the other two items I Want to talk about uh the go and a martyr and I would talk about them in that order now um most people have heard about the goal which is an area\nA martyr and let's talk about them in that order now um most people have heard about the goal which\nWhich is an area of forty acres that is prime real estate in downtown Atlanta that's been under developed for several decades it is the area that's considered kind of underground because the streets were raised\nSeveral decades ago due to flooding so it is the area between the\nFederal building downtown uh right across the street from the old riches building\nAnd it spreads across to where the CNN is a where the ... I'm a conference center is and goes all the way over near Mercedes Benz stadium and\nThose guys who are on the ground now go wrong yes I mean you have the right and you have the railroad tracks onto the on the day or two years\nSo altogether is forty acres is owned by five different entities\nAnd do it then it's a challenge over the years to get somebody to take on that big projects so they say so it was discovered in some of the the the meeting\nThat Abbott and that I attended most of the city council meetings about the goal which I was that the two hour work session and it was supposed to be to allow uh goats work session that turned into\nA four hour work session that only half of the city council members attend it and um and senator\nFort refers to the people at the table answering the questions as a money to wearing lawyers who've been paid ... I'm also attended the mayor\nInformation formed that she had that has been criticized because two thirds of the people in the room were actually city employees which meant that the true public were could not get in\nBut since I was at the hall of that day I I was able to get in because I was there very very early and um it was definitely an interesting scenario\nTo be in the room and see what was going on and most of the questions were not actually after and I feel I'm asked them I ask myself and many others how is it that\nYou have a lawyer who was representing the city who is Alvin Kendall who lives in Atlanta natives\nWho is the liaison between the city and see I Am this developer\nWho has on their board of directors or one of their owners is brothers with ... one of the Atlanta Hawks owners I think his last name as wrestler so how is it that this guy's doing this complicated presentation at the mayor's\nForum and he's not using a PowerPoint yeah\nThey have these these big screen set up and they have a PowerPoint that's you know showing pictures of the Gulf and had some other points on there that they want us to know that was good for the city\nOr in their pain but they could have just as easily had him do a PowerPoint instead of him quoting all these numbers and facts and figures and people can actually see it as he's talking about it so that was interesting\nSo I had that six hundred page document that's called the Atlanta Gulch project and if you go over two hundred and Fifteen\nHey document that's called the Atlanta Gulch project and if you go over\nTill about page um five hundred and Fifteen there is the development\nAgreed that ah that's among the city of Atlanta and the Atlanta development authority\nAnd there's some interesting things because remember affordable housing is very much in need across the country as well as\nHere in the city that land and we need more affordable housing and more workforce healthy so they're bragging about a ... percent of the the um a unit so going to be set aside for a workforce housing so that's supposed to be to thousands I mean that's supposed to be two hundred unit\nBut if you look closely\nUnder exhibit yes\nOn page F. one it's sad that worked for a fourth slashed affordable housing ritual you on that must be lease as such for a minimum\nOf three year old does that sound like a deal to you\nWell it's very weird to read to me\nYeah and then over on another page on page three\nOkay I'm listening\nWas the problem with the three years in your view well it should be for the life or the development not just for the first three years at at over ...\nI just wanted to clear on a note the audience would understand\nOkay I Gotcha I got you you know for three years and then what do you do after three years ... you know they can actually uh by the unit but most of the people that work for housing and affordable housing can't afford to buy you and is that at this point stage in your life\nAnd they could also end up selling it at at market so that a farce a five billion dollar deal um they've come in and that's interesting um another key saying about the portable housing that says that\nFor the border for doubt any workforce slash affordable housing unit that has not been able to be at least\nFor a period of sixty days may be least at a market rate\nSo as to minimize vacancy within the project\n... if you voted off the market for six days and you can ruin it for whatever you feel like\nWhat did you report not those holes in the housing plan and that means that people in the in the EU and people who are concerned housing advocates in others should be pressing the elected officials to get a better deal from the developers right\nYes and we are in that last caller in on this I'm Janice and the Vita is that it says that the owner may elect to pay an inland sea to the city to be deposited until the Gulch housing plus fun prior to issue wants all of a building permit\nSo that means they can pay a fee\nAs there be no affordable housing units in this development which\nMeans this development could be like a Martha's Vineyard\nOnly the rich people\nWere you dug out some important fact there was one other issue you want to Drew Drew\nI Do the other one is that Martin a board of directors voted on how the heck puny sales tax\nYou know what the new story is the ... the rebate again ... said about affirmative action\nI've heard her say several things which thing are you talking about\nI'm Talking about protecting the path to power in this society by making sure that\nBlacks have a certain number of seats and access to the most elite institutions like Harvard Princeton and yeah that's what she's talking about then those are the places from which leaders are selected you cannot close off those places to people because of their color\nThose not the only places though where leaders are selected particularly justice\nI'm not talking about that I Know a Matt I'm dumb and same thing you don't disagree with me 'cause I'm trying to agree with that yes bought him a one on one\nI wanted to pick from a large pool for these justices I really do\nThey do there's nine justice on the U.S a\nI'm not disturbed by the fact that they're only eight because I tell you the truth that gives me a better chance to do when I Want um I don't need six or six conservatives on the court to get my outcome I'd rather have an aide to a split that means\nThe chance to do what I Want um I don't need six or six and services on the court to get my outcome I'd rather have an eight to eight split that means things stay the same you preserve the status quo which in many cases might be better from\nDepending on your perspective but in in and write a song with ms\nWe taking we take a consideration the effort that it takes just to get your case consider the Supreme Court let alone get on the\nDocket is a terrible travesty of it I just\nWanted to learn it does I mean the judgment is just the sound a bit and just the name\nAnd I tell you if the justice is going to vote against you you certainly don't want him or her on the court\nYou still should be nine there and we have to take in consideration\nFor him to handle the blonde about what they found someone tells you don't know what you what I'm saying\nIs we don't know how it's going to go but we do know that the federal government is pulls put nine on year including the for clerk to justice gets plus the fifth one that the chief justice gifts because they are very strong in the decision making on what he even gets in front of the Supreme Court\nAbsolutely know of no clerks don't make that they make arguments for\nAnd they do the research and they do a lot of the writing\nYou

I I mean I still like the red Sox I I still think that the red Sox when there's when there's a the series I obviously I think it goes a seven games\nAre but I liked I liked the fire I like what I see out of out of his Astros team I mean it's clearly the heart of a champion ... and that's that's all you can um that that's all you\nCan say about the Astros and it's going to be a fun series from here\nAnd that's the team that Atlanta Braves fan should aspire to be because they did it exactly the way the Braves are trying to do it with the youth movement the prospects and willing to take some losses for some years just to get to this point\n[noise] All right so let's get into the falcons box as is that game kicks off here in uh in Thirteen hours I guess if you want to get technical what twelve hours and fifty four minutes and thirty seconds\nLie for Mercedes Benz of course we got you covered right here on the game starts off with the the way for tailgate showed up at night in with any bunker and Randy ... Michael followed by the pregame show at eleven o'clock and then obviously followed by that by the actual kickoff why one o'clock or we got you covered obviously pregame post game and during the game we've got you I hear now he's on a game\nOr I mean you look at the falcons what's there to say you know last night I\nMe the positive stuff there's a lot to be positive about when it comes to the FEC despite being one of four there are some positive moment taking place there are some positive players being made there are there are some positive statistics to talk about\nYou have all of that stuff but if they're going to do what the court says they're going to take this I gave it a time and get back in this thing which is not out of the realm of possibility I mean to say here say that they could win what\nTo do what was going to take a game of the time and get back in this thing which is not out of the real possibility I mean to say here say that they could win what eleven straight it's it's not impossible it's probably um\nWishful thinking but it's not impossible and so here my keys to the game as the falcons getting ready to take on the bucks won\nThe most important thing that mark on nine well in the defense has to do is to stop the bugs ... it's not a great run game but when you stop the bucks run game what does that do\nWell if forces James listen to throw the ball and if there's one thing you you actually want to go back and take a look right and you want to go back and you want to look at James Watson over his his short NFL career when James Wilson attempts forty or more passes the bucks don't win games\nSo how do you get James to attempt more passes you stop the run game right now there are averaging three ... three yards a okay so it's actually not all that great\nYou know between Peyton Barber in a Ronald Johnson Sean Wilson a ... you got some guys in there but if you can stop that run and you can force Seamus wants them to throw the ball you have a much higher chance of winning that game why because Jay miss Winston is going to make mistakes\nYou gotta make mistakes he does that a lot they must listen at least two or three times a game like clockwork is going to make it really really really really bad decision\nHe does it a lot if you can stop the run if you stop paying barbecue stopped Ronald Jones you can stop those guys and you can put the ball and James his hands you have a much better shot at winning the game so number one for me stopping the run that deep a divine without grainy by the way has to be a major force in this game\nGot to make tackles gotta fill those holes\nGot to do things old fashioned football number two for me when the turnover battle\nAnd that's something by the way that that the falcons have done very well with this year ... only two interceptions through five games are running backs not a whole lot of turnovers a you know they've done really really well\nNow that said you look at the box they don't turn the ball over either\nA seven interceptions this year in in in what five games and one from ... that's it one fumble last so ... you know to turn over the game for for for the box but you've got to win the turnover battle here\nBut again the same as much as I just said it's going to give you several opportunities to pick up all off that you got to be able to capitalize on that this secondary has to make place they absolutely have to make plays a number three for me protect them out right\nI I ... and it's funny I I almost take it personal when it's all sorts of places like owner crap it's embarrassing you know this is the first time in his career Alex Mac has looked below average\n... are you starting or growing a business [noise]\nBe one of the next ten million small\nBusiness attempt for free like score\nGet your freedom to mentor at ... or\nWho my you save\nYour mother your father your uncle and\nLearn fast S.

James to throw at least forty times and getting winning the turnover bottom\nJames's prone to make mistakes I don't know how many games in his career he's gone without throwing an interception at least one game or at least one interception game but I'm sure it's probably not many uh it's so he's going to give you ample opportunity tomorrow to to pick off passes on it and yes I actually do think\nWhat I'm going to go through on this one because I Do believe that Jay miss a will throw when I Do believe that true for just a gets one uh and and I also believe that democracy 'cause he gets at least one so I I think that's too by the way\nI look at interceptions um he's with his rookie year he had one two three four five\nSix seven games without an interception his second year he had three games dot interception\nNow and then last year he had one two three four five six seven he played a game last year without an interception odd but he more than made up for that though I is I I Want to say he's average actually averaging more than interception the game if I'm not mistaken I probably could be I Know that\nForty five games started forty six interceptions there you go see he's got more picks and he does that affect just so he averages at least one of the game\nI think he throws a couple of tomorrow\nHonestly I think that's been true for gets one and I think democracy 'cause he gets one as well\nOne of the falcons key offenses under Palestinian was thrown into the running backs you're seeing a lot more of moving people into the flat so with that being said Kevin Coleman will score receiving touchdown tomorrow\nI just have a common haven't receiving touched on this year\nI don't I don't know if he does or not I literally I guess I probably shouldn't do that but um you know when I look at this let me take a look real quick uh let's see Kevin Komen rushing notice like a typical and receiving some equipment only has a twelve receptions for Ninety nine yards and one touchdown\nI think Komen rushing notice like seven coming receiving some equipment only has a twelve receptions for Ninety nine yards and one touched down so yes he does have one um he's averaging what twenty yards gained receiving ... you know that but that was something that they that we heard them talk about all off season\nWas wanting to get the running backs or in in involved in the in the past getting more and you look at the running backs right now a hundred and sixty six yards\nUm two hundred yards or a hundred and Ninety yards there so between the three running backs they only have a hundred and Ninety yards through five games that is not getting your running backs involved in the in the passing game whatsoever\nAnd yet we were told all off season that that was something I mean they it starts at the end of last year or two and then they they adjusted again was this is something we want to see moving forward it's something that we have to do because we saw the success of twenty sixteen\nLess than two hundred yards through five games with your running back to the end the passing game they're not getting them involved in in ... I'm going to say false on this one I think unfortunately we're going to see the trend continue where we don't see them heavily involved and no I don't think either ten minute Coleman or Ito Smith have receiving touched on in this game\nOkay and I agree as well because twenty sixteen thirty five percent of the offing right throw into the ... it's it's just drives you nuts as a ...\nI mean you've got to figure that we just said what a hundred and Ninety yards are between the two of them because seven Coleman has Ninety nine Smith has sixty seven\nHundred and twenty three so yeah a hundred and Ninety years exactly between the three running backs they have sixteen hundred and Twenty one yards I mean you're talking that's just about ... ten percent eleven percent of the ... that's pathetic that's pathetic ...\nEspecially when you ride those are the teams who are doing it moving on a set you may not be aware of the falcons do lead the league in Fifteen your plus runs with fourteen\nSo the falcons will have\nThree runs over Fifteen yards tomorrow\nOr today now\nOr they'll have you said three runs over Fifteen yards a I I'm going to say yes I Will go through on that one\nI I like what ten Coleman and Al Smith do without a devout they Freeman in the game with ... and and he's not available I guess both his foot and a squad of bothering so he's out great judges out debt Shelby is officially out on top of the other ones that we already knew about that are out into these ... you know we ate with with the un Jones\nOr I like a ... comment I like what he's done you looking Coleman\nHe's averaging ... both he and his brother Aberdeen just under for you to carry a\nShockingly Ito Smith doesn't have a carry more than twenty yards or his along is Eighteen\nOr I still think they they both get at least through something to say we have for carries a of at least fifty yards of more and I must say they get ... to oh twenty yards are more tomorrow versus the bucks so I'm going to go through on that one\nAnd they are also second in the league in ten your plus runs not just weird I'm hoping it'll Jones\nLoves Mike Smith if you've looked at\nThe numbers who we always had

Jackson came out and said some things on the positive side\nFor ... around his pants or\nDo you think that this team as a whole believes that James listening and that they get that he could get them from when\nI got to do I mean you know with respect to the shah and I'm sure he's really sorry to see fit to go because as you know you know James he's had a tough time throwing the ball down the field and over the top to Sean and\nYou know the shot and my parents are up to maybe there's some of the best thoughts their career I think there were four and five an average yards per game that both that are running a hundred six yards per game\nAnd you know bits throws a better de Paul and then he gets where the ball early he throws it into a space where you can track it for the defensive back has a chance to turn around so\nYou know it's got to be interesting to see you know the body language and just whether or not he it it's a big thing for for damage to hook up with the shot and keep them\nKeep him involved and keep them interested but I think we saw progress at the end of last year with Amos you know throwing the ball down the field and they think that uh you know he had a really good training camp too and they they think they'll continue that with this group of researchers\n...

minutes you're one forty question the nights [noise] what was your favorite one hit wonder song will do that now of where we get to know Michael collins from fans headed\nJoined me back in our number one is we brought down the Georgia last LSU today and well I certainly conversational by asking if he was doing OK because smoke my goes to Georgia on them\n[noise] um okay well we'll we'll survive\nFor those guys I don't know Michel ... is a big Georgia fan I went to school there for a couple of years ... has covered Georgia for for many many years I and so I appreciate him coming on because I think you saw some of the same same things I did Michael the overreaction by by by fans today was was was it was kind of ridiculous wasn't it\nIt was very very silly I I think I think coming into this game you know I had a friend of mine asked me a who's not at Georgia fan but he follows college football at the end he said give me a quick take what do you see going on with George analogy you and I said what\nEl issues offensive line is really good they're probably going to be able to run on Georgia or just like some other teams have George is going to need to run the ball and run it will control the clock keep bell issues all fenced off the field\nKeep their defense rested that's the only way they're going to win this game and that's exactly what they did not do they didn't do much of anything right but they did not follow that script and therefore el issue was able to dictate the uh the pace of the game and to do what they wanted to do and to exploit the are the problems that Georgia has more than any other team so far this year\nYou were you surprised it ... it it the way Jim Cheney called this game you know thirty five ... you know thirty running attempts and it just seemed like at times he just went to the run with how any rhyme or reason I don't I don't feel like today he allowed swift or Holyfield or any of those guys actually get into a rhythm\nNo and I mean they had that one drive when they got rid of the for the fake field goal attempt\nWhen they ran the fall when I think nine or ten straight times with a lot of success that were running ... they were running between the tackles they weren't trying to stretch out that that as deep as they were just pounding it in there with that big strong sense of line\nAnd then they got away from it for no reason whatsoever all of a sudden they went to like I think seven straight passes after that to finish off that thrive and start the next drive and like you said there was no real rhyme or reason to what Jim Cheney was calling me and that's\nThat's been one of my big complaint with him since he's come to Georgia that some games it seems like he calls a brilliant game and other times it just seems like he's just kind of\nThrowing darts at a board and that's what it was night I think he was out scheme by David Miranda I think it looked like LSU defence knew what George was going to do half the time before\nGeorgia did a ... and they played it that way and then uh you know once Georgia got behind that the change in behind the game they had no choice but to try to pass the ball to catch up and then it was all over\nYou know at the ... the one argument that I Know you saw and I know ... and I saw in shamelessly responding to a lot of it what was was ...\nWell you know at the ... the one argument that I Know you saw and I know ... and I saw it in shamelessly responding to a lot of it what was was take from tonight and I think that you can make both arguments and I thought you put it very eloquently on Twitter several times you can make the argument that Justin Fields I should get it does deserve more playing time\nBut also take promises started those two things can be synonymous can they not\nAbsolutely I mean Jake from is the start of this a check from team he's the leader of that team and nobody has lost faith in shape crowd at least not on that team and not on the coaching staff he had a bad game but then again so did most of the team for that matter I mean the receivers were dropping balls they were running bad routes\nThe defense was out of alignment there were blown coverage I mean the entire team\nPlay they substandard game and to cap it off LSU played a very very good game probably the best game they play it all season and you combine all that and you get a a sixteen points Seventy we are for project from and and you know he he threw for two hundred nine yards a touchdown and two interceptions which\nOkay yeah you know but he didn't come through in a clutch the way he had in the past so you just kind of have to write it off I mean you could sit there and you could go through every quarterback whoever won a national championship for his college football team and you could find at least one if not a couple of games where they played\nReally poorly and that's going to happen that does not mean that he should be supplanted or lose his job should we have seen Justin Fields get some more snaps night yeah probably you know he might spark something it might've been a change of pace it might have\nBack to the the tigers defense off a little bit but I think this overreaction of oh we need Jake we we need to know Justin Fields and now Justin feels needs to be the start of that is just be jerk ridiculous overreaction\nMichael calling us

be in New England tonight\nFor the call pat hosting the undefeated Kansas City chiefs so a whole lot to do great guess along the way but we start things off with the craziness from yesterday in college football because when we started I looked at this late\nAnd I said I have some good games\nAnd whenever you look at a slate and you say yeah\nHave some good games out of the week when you go and saying wow look at all these games we have like nine ten great games there's always something crazy that happens inside the top ten and yesterday that was true by everything I just said and of course she had some begins going into it Alice human Georgia Oregon Washington\nYou wanted to see Michigan Wisconsin\nBut then there were some teams in the top ten that we're expecting a little bit of an easier time and didn't get that easy time like West Virginia\nAnd also Penn State coming off their last Ohio State I think the Penn State famous confident and we know what happened to Penn State they lose to Michigan State as once again Penn State had a lead at home there are three with a minute left\nAnd the Spartans go a place for Seventy six yards they could still hear my friend I agree still screaming with is Michigan State Spartans going into happy valley and go on and they play Seventy six yard drive in one minute to take down the ... the lions\nBullets look around the rest of some of these games and more so what happened with some of these ranked teams and\nSome of the movement now that we will see LSU\nWas a week ago I lost you was undefeated they go into the swamp and they lost and you started to think is this the LSU even though they've been impressive taking down all ... and it come from behind victory\nThe way they started the season in style getting a blowout victory up against Miami is this going to be the efforts at LSU that starts to revert back to their old ways and with the expectation was going into this year\nAnd is Joe borough gonna start to come back down to reality and turn over the football\nWell Alice you didn't want any part of that business to the conversation about the negativity they went on to the football field\nAnd from the first try to last drive they were the better team and they were the team that was completely dominant\nAnd they ended up smack it around Georgia the number two team in the nation going in the ... and now they're going to drop a little bit but Alice you not only beat Georgia but they embarrass them thirty six to sixteen and orders are on coach Joe\n... coach Kirby Smart it wasn't even close I don't

going into yesterday Alabama\nWon Georgia to Ohio State three constant for\nAnd then to rap out the rest of the top ten it went Notre Dame West Virginia Washington\nPenn State taxes and you see at Penn State will be out of the top ten Washington will be out of the top ten and West Virginia will be out of the top that when the next stop twenty five comes out\nGeorgia will fall out of the top for\nDon't know where they're going to fall into I Would imagine somewhere in the five to eight range I don't think there'll be nine or ten but probably if I had to take my best guess probably somewhere in the five to eight range probably more like a\nSix or seven if I had to get the made it but you're going to have three new teams going into the top ten now I Wonder how much movement will be with taxes and UCF taxes takes down Baylor UCF takes down Memphis\nHow much more movement will go on for the nine and ten going into this week\nBut when you look at the potential three teams that will move into the top ten\nAnd it's actually for a part into consideration Oklahoma who was eleven last week Michigan who was twelve last week and they beat Wisconsin\nLSU clearly be in the top ten if they felt that Thirteen after last to Florida but now as you as a victory over Auburn\nThey had a victory up again\nWas what they were able to do today against Georgia so this is a Dallas you team that they have three really good performances\nAs they beat Miami to start the year now Miami and\nAlso all burn not as good when they played them because Miami was terribly yesterday up against Virginia and all burnt is falling off but when they played Miami and all burn those early on the season I think it was weak one and three\nOf those were good teams at the time and then the other team you got to consider to potentially move up into the top ten is Oregon\nAs Oregon\nI Know they lost to Stanford and again\nBut potentially move up into the top ten is Oregon as Oregon I Know they lost to Stanford and again they should have won and now you're looking back at that one I find them on and you're probably saying what could have\nBeen because\nThey could have been six and oh man the ranking would have even been better and better going into this week but after that lost the Stanford they bounce back\nA forty two twenty four victory up against Cal Cal and then yesterday thirty twenty seven over Washington so it was a four teams that I'll consider moving into the top ten and I don't think Oregon gets there there'll be really close\nThere'll be knocking on doors sitting like eleven or twelve\nAnd and maybe they get into the top ten but probably not I'm going to say it's Oklahoma\nAs that one last this to Texas and now that attacked a theme\nThat is just completely done in one eighty from after losing week one to Marilyn and what they've been able to do take a down TCU taken down us see\nAnd then obviously Oklahoma was the big statement when last week so go home and we'll get into the top ten they won't pass taxes because they lost the text of Texas probably will move up\nAnd then the placement of Michigan and LSU will be very interesting so your new top ten and no order the teams will be Alabama Georgia\nOhio State Clemson Notre Dame you will have taxes UCF Oklahoma Michigan and Alice ya and try to figure out and order on that one [laughter] won't be easy to do but your top four deathly Alabama\nOhio State will move up to two Clemson will be at three and Notre Dame will be at four and if you complain about Notre Dame all you want but Notre Dame up against good teams this year a top twenty five teams\nHas taken down Michigan taking down Stanford has taken down Virginia Tech\nWas not pretty up against ... yesterday that wasn't the football game Nineteen fourteen and that's all Notre Dame asked to do the rest of the way that Brian Kelly wants to get into the college football playoff you have to be navy three northwestern Florida State Syracuse and usa five games on\nYour windows five games are gonna be going to the college football playoff let's start things off with a going to Fort Worth Texas will talk to Greg first stop was at Yale what's happening Greg\nHey are they so yeah go ahead\nI'm two quick questions uh next week holes going to have a Alabama how they ... they it was a top four teams\nAssuming they run the table you think that there's a possibility that won last Texas can get maybe somewhere else in the playoffs and I'm just wondering what your thoughts do you support possible a dream playoffs\nI've I've always been foreign aid team playoff and when we talked about that before on the show dragon and I do appreciate the call\nAnd the way I talked about it before is you have to give one of the non power five schools to see that the big boy table so if you wanted to do an Eighteen playoff which I'm all in favor for you would do the power five conference winners they'd be seated you also would have\nA non power five\nConference winter so that six teams right there and then the two best remaining teams in the country that's how I Would do it in my feeding actually\nI Would put the non power five conference where did that you take\nOn the same seating level\nI Would put the non power five conference where did that your take\nOn the same seating level\nAs the other five power five conference when for example let's say those power five conference when they get to because they win the conference you place an emphasis on that so that will be seated one through five ... and most years than the non power five conference which will be put in at number six then you have seven and eight\nOf the remaining teams do you put a value on one of your conference you give a little benefit and you give a seat to the big boy table to a non power five\nConference team and you also give them a little bit\nOf a boost as a as a succeed\nIn that non power five the G. five as they call it team that has been selected last year they fared very well in the bowl game that now a little bit different when you're paying for college football steaks and some things may not want to get up for a bowl game but yes I'm all in favor expand the college football playoff\nNot that Ford dumped ... work cause for does work and for has worked and the team that\nHas one should be the team that wins I don't think they've got it wrong yet and make it a top for over the last few years but I Would love to see eight now to your question if Alabama Ohio State consider Notre Dame all without no I don't think Texas gets

Ohio State Clemson Notre Dame LSU Texas Michigan\nUCF moves up to eight wow\nOregon and in Florida yeah I don't think Florida gets into the top ten so he excludes Oklahoma\nFrom his top that so he has a word in I've Oklahoma and the top ten and they all support Oregon and the top ten as well so how 'bout that\nSo very very interesting to see that top ten and the way that ah he does develop that but he doesn't have George and his top that George has not fallen out of the top ten so I I I Can't agree with that one now John\nHutchinson on Twitter says J hot seven to this is an interesting question and I think our listeners Ninety two point through the ... of Cleveland will appreciate this one\nAnd that's something to do with the topic but I just saw it and sometimes that's on my mind works I just see something that I really like and I want to bring it out to the table and I'll even incorporate Horwitz and Recep all into this conversation so Jay hot seven oh two on Twitter says who wins the next Cleveland championship\nBut Brown's the cab\nOr the Indians\nWho wins the next Cleveland championship\nThe browns the cabs or\nThe Indians\nI'm totally take the cabs off the table without a brown there and that's not going to be pretty basketball and won't be even though they still have Kevin Love and everything and some cats and they'll say oh a little better than what we think regardless they're not going to be a championship contending team but that LeBron James\nAnd don't be silly don't forget what life was like without LeBron James came back was very good you went to the finals every or you did win a championship after being down three won but life without LeBron\nIn the short term is going to be ugly and we'll see how long that does linger hey crazy NBA season starts soon too and like\nI I'm not that pumped up for the starting December ... he said just not the season's been crazy with ... going to the Golden State warriors you also have um the brawn go into the Lakers the whole Jimmy Butler stuff\n... Leonard but the regular season starts and I'm not that pumped up for it I'm just not because I anticipate golden state's going to win again in the east there's some form of Boston and Philadelphia and the raptors\nSo some intriguing the ease but even going to last year those are similar beliefs and the regular season ended up being a really good product and I thought was a fun product and then you get into the postseason where you're trying to hope that one of the\nBig teams in each conference goes down but down the east you'll have some new anticipation but with all the football going on I'm just not thinking basketball right now I watch law hockey yesterday to ah but I'm not really thinking in the in the hockey moods yet either and I love basketball I Love hockey but just when you have college football in the NFL driving the train right now\nThose are the uh you know those seats they get you know put in the back they do it but the sports a little bit on the back burner and you have the\nUh NFL and the driver seat in college football in the passenger seat but let me get back to the question though\nWhen it comes down to next Cleveland team to win a championship brown cabs are Indians after the cabs out and it comes down to the browns or the Indians horrible started off with you whose acts Cleveland's team to win a championship is it is it the browns the cabs are the Indians in your mind\nI say the Indians\nOkay there's the most parity in major league baseball you'd like to think that there's not because you know you look at these big market teams is being dominant but the truth is when you go down recent World Series you know royals winners\nSmall market teams have a chance to win and I'm not saying that Cleveland is a small market team but there clearly contenders not New York that was all I'm three years are poised to be contenders again next year why not\nAnd also weak division too and I know it could change for about a year like you're saying right but but it's much tougher right now in the in the landscape of the NFL and especially in the landscape of you know the data to break through but the brown stock has been surging\nThere's no doubt about it surge well I was asked about yes you can use the term surging now you have a ... defensive and that you pick\nNumber one overall you have a quarterback from the looks right now it looks like to be your franchise quarterback and you also have\nDenzel Ward who looks like a shutdown corner yeah there are some pieces but again there are five hundred team right now when I wouldn't say surging I guess when you compare it to one winning two years yes that surging but but doing back foot in the streets of Cleveland right and they should ... for the first time there's a reason\nTo be excited but again I I don't think\nDoing back foot in the streets of Cleveland right and they should ...\nFor the first time there's a reason to be excited but again I I don't think\nI think that the browns are still a few pieces away but they finally I think got in on the track look like they're on the right track the train is moving in the right direction the train is on the tracks and slowly starting to move in the right there before it wasn't even on the tracks the train was kind of like tilted on its side\nWith upside down basically that's what it was ... felt where'd you go\nYou know it's very interesting question because I might be dead by the time we find that the answer\nIs also a U.S so big I really think\nThough I mean you have to go where the town is the town is with the baseball team is not I mean you have to end VP candidates on the team as position players in ... and you have maybe I Know they don't want to hear it right now because you know they got a\nThey got they got an handed to them by the Astros but you do have a very good rotation with caress going back our in Korea bluebird and frankly doesn't seem like he's going anywhere and cared for and calling his one his share of championships in the past\nNot no question was what he was able to do with the Boston Red Sox are breaking the curse yeah I'd have to go Cleveland here with the Cleveland Indians that's what I have to go with you guys thought I was gonna say anything else\nGoing on here [laughter] ... yeah ...\nWhat do you just said the Indians I got to go to Cleveland Indians that's how I say yeah\nThere is the the one going down to you this question his answer all gonna be in the ground though right aren't really no I don't\nThink so no I might be because of all the and that's what I was going to stay in fairness to James is point based on his diet and drinking habits there is a good chance he's in the ground you know tomorrow or Tuesday so he might be right\nYou know are delusional like Cleveland fan is listening right now you know what I'm Talking about which one you're talking yeah right away here's a tweet that he tells me you're telling me\nThat Dan Gilbert team of Kevin Love trust in Thompson won't be the best in the ease with sex than in the ... court\n[laughter] I don't want to I don't I Apologize for even giving this guy Eddie airtime yet don't and here's the thing but he's a definition of dilutes the dumbest person on what we are literally found the dominant first time I last winter\nAnd it's really a certain accurate right like big base of things that aren't even mentioned because there are so an accurate but repeated it before but you know what\nI put my toe into water that I shouldn't even at ... and ... up ... or ... given by not respond here on national radio host and you're going to give this a responding\nYou know the credence of responding on Twitter no not at all so I won't even say it's Twitter name\nBut I just find it funny how this guy only doesn't complain about the show and he'll just you know moan about the show freaked out about the show and any time we mentioned Cleveland\nIt's like a trigger goes off or a signal goes off to his house and he has to go to Twitter and has to turn it on the radio he's all anytime I say Cleveland\nHe's there so I just find it funny they're passionate city yeah third passionate but yeah

radio [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] my niece nationwide on CBS Bush we usually say guilty\n[laughter]\n\n\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nFrom the studios national mortgage lender Quicken Loans apply simply understand fully and make sure you always mortgage confidently coming out\nAnd about thirty thirty five minutes or so for among courses as good a joined if he's a book coming out next week play by play calling me while this games in sports from\nSCC football college basketball the masters and more and it's going to be a real thrill and a treat to talk to burn as so many memories over the year listening to SEC football games watching them on CBS you remember that kicked sex between Auburn in Alabama\nA obviously have cat was of big college basketball\nGames I remember being on cw tournament in Buffalo actually a burden was doing the call basketball actually hit him in the face on the sideline ah during a game and uh it was cool to be around Vernon do a fair for that and see double A. tournament\nA few years ago masters now does your member of the old five a tiger chip\nObviously be a little bit older you'll remember a Jack of course on the Yes sir call and then obviously also the late in her shot so this man is a walking history book and his eyes just seen so many history\nWhen it comes to sports and now he's put it all a pen to paper or I guess\nNow are you typing up\nA with a book called play by play in it document solve it so I'm very much excited to have burned on and when you hear burns voice you know it's a big game no doubt about it like Fifteen Years you hear the voices of Kevin Harlan big game Jim Nance big game\nJoe Buck big game al Michaels big game Chris Fowler big game I even I in eagle who I think is going to eventually be a number one\nUh for CBS whenever ... likes to step aside and ... has the right to do it as long as he wants and these tremendous exceptional and always a lot but I Do get to chat with him Vern was one of those big names in those big voices\nThat when you watch a football game and that cc game on a Saturday and you had a little ... of Auburn, Alabama another big FCC matchup Vernon was there and Vern always had an exception of call and he's someone that\nWasn't afraid to step away from the microphone and just let the natural sounds really tell the story too sometimes build descriptive sometimes you're short and sweet and it does I even much more mix more of an impact and a point\nOn the actual call and what is actually happening captured the scene\nOr sometimes even better so a very very a good book have it right in front of me or read a little bit of it and obviously will try to finish this entire thing or by next week but we will talk to burn and find out more about the book we have to transitional but do into baseball before we get to burn\nA I have to look at both the match us from yesterday show and the NFL we're coming off the game on that look like the brewers were cruising Dodgers get back into the game Justin Turner strikes out as Ford strike out\nIn game one and game too is going to be very telling because if the brewers went out to nothing\nAnd then went up to do with the way that they've been winning which was twelve in a row entering yesterday\nWell ... ...\nTo nothing and then went up to do with the way that they've been winning which was twelve in a row entering yesterday while\nYou don't feel great if you're a Dodger said even though you'll have three straight home games\nAnd in this match up at once again look like Milwaukee was going to win the game they were up three nothing and Milwaukee bullpen has been so dominant and it wasn't as dominant\nIn game one but they were able to survive in game number two it started to get shaky as well and the seventh\nAnd also the eighth inning so it's three oh entering the seven Dodgers get to back the pole within one and then Justin Turner who is such a professional headed by the way and I'm so annoyed that the Mets got rid of him\nAnd make myself sick and makes ... that now Justin Turner is dominant with the Dodgers and dominant in the postseason to while the Mets year after year minus the world series year and also the wild card year\nAre sitting on their caucuses are playing golf and you have to watch it on the former met dominated the post season but Turner who at Fort strike out to the day before it bounces back in game two and his team was down and run hits a two run blacks\nAnd the Dodgers go on to win the game for three so give credit to Los Angeles this tells me this is going to be a dog fight hopefully down to the wire now you may have also would have thought that after the Yankees got game too in Boston that did end up being the case but you'd have to think in the seven game series\n\n[noise]\n\nHe's fled you're still here no bus to the ... [noise]\nCity unfortunately it's self reliant if I Do want to forty two twenty seven his brought you buy Geico hey everyone has a quick way you could save money switch the guy go didn't homeowners rent there was a motorcycle insurance to get it all at Geico dot com or among costs will join us coming up\nIn the next segment talking baseball right now David Price will\nTake the mound tonight in Boston and they must swing game for the Boston Red Sox as they're down ... one after last night's defeat to the Houston ashes the defending World Series champions and they go to David Price\nDavid Price by the way who has a career you are in the postseason of five twenty eight and if you're a member from ESPN stats and info\nIs was the last time David Price one to the mound at a postseason game it's when the Yankees Red Sox six to we all know the red socks went on to win that series in four but after the ... and they gave this nugget David prices teams\nAre now zero in ten ten career post season starts of the Seventy pictures and am obey history with template post season starts prices the only one who's team has not won again\nEven though he's getting paid two hundred and Seventeen million dollars and his contract\nEven though he's been a jerk\nWith the whole Dennis Eckersley situation and then you had the whole disaster with the Fortnite situation and trust me a lot of people would want to be in David prices spot\nOf getting paid a over a contract to two hundred and Seventy million dollars ...\nIf I were to you and offered you a contract to two hundred and Seventy million dollars even if you were terrible at your job you'd still be pretty happy right I'm terrible my job already so yeah and you don't get two hundred and Seventy million dollars would like some stray casual Michele how 'bout that well Randy Moss reference\nBut yeah so when you say under dog people are saying well look I make so much money but if you look at a situation of people that you're expecting nothing out of tonight it's David Price how could you go into this game if you're a Red Sox fan and I have any confidence that David Price is going to do well but\nThat's what makes sports great because maybe this is the one time that he actually pictures well because the bench surely it's going to the pitch won't a baseball game in the postseason as a starter and I have a team win\nBut a lot of it it seems like with David prices mental because he's so sensitive as we could just tell with the way that he interacts with the media or I Know\nBut a lot of it it seems like with David prices mental 'cause he's so sensitive and so you could just tell with the way that he interacts with the media or I Know fun talking about Dennis Eckersley but the way interacted with Dennis Eckersley that was just sensitivity\nWas stupid that he's even paying attention to that stuff about what that is that because we were saying on a team broadcasts about another teammate just silly\n... behavior so David Price you'll know what David Price you're getting in the first two innings tonight that's what you know if he's in the game pass the second inning things will of positive for Boston\nDoesn't mean it's going to do great the rest of the way but if he could get through the first two I think that those big for him as a pitcher and the Yankee series to the same thing you will know what David Price or getting in the first two innings\nAnd he didn't even get through six out so price could just get through six out maybe it opens up\nFor positivity form and it continues to pitch well and he finds a way to get past the struggles or maybe just the struggles to the\nLatest thing or two or three or four and then eventually or his shortcomings in the postseason become evident but David Price\nHe must must must must perform all tonight because if he does it the\nBoston Red Sox will quickly be out of the post season and the entire offseason\nPeople will be healing David Price\nThey will be chastising David Price the criticism for David Price in Boston will be on a constant loop\nIt will just be on a merry go round going around and around and around and around 'cause that would be to post season starts with that lucrative contract and it would be to starts couldn't get the job done if anyone needed\nTo get a good start in this postseason it's David Price coming up later tonight and we shall see\nLet's go out to a South Beach hippie always calls the show what's up ... pi how are you\nThere yeah remember that's going on that\nAppreciate and my friend a lot fun going on in the sports world with\nThem yeah yeah and then try to hit first of all it didn't take it out later that day\nThey already added [laughter] so you're saying hey ms over before it's even started hippie\nDriving with me who's how he got out made by nobody out okay\nLet's say you want to learn some ...\nYou put some shackles on the Houston Astros tonight\nEverything I have

coal articulated fair Queen Mary Tyler ... told me that I used to it but in Christ sucks\nAs a picture [laughter] and trust him run around ... man we're cake or being asked him if he were to fall white\n[laughter] running around the world out there and so the actors going all the way\nI saw all one word can chat [laughter] we could have been\nPretty big thank you\nOh what can we can get\nA pretty big thank you so much [laughter] I'm up yet [laughter]\nSo it'd be a big guy came up in San who is just in Berlin through last year skip out on the parade because he was either getting married or was it is honeymoon I forget which one it was\nEither got married or he was going on his honeymoon um But Justin ... memory did serve me correct did skip out on the ashes parade last year I if I was married to Kate Upton she wanted me to skip the parade I Would say hey hundred percent\nI'm all in for skipping the parade even though it was his first time winner of the world series championship\nSome guys just having the big moment some guys just don't David Price he does the\nUsually have it in a big moment but tonight you never had to the big moment when he starts the game but tonight you must have it and if he doesn't have it once again it's good to\nBe one long offseason\nAnd if he's probably right it probably go to some island enjoy that\nTwo hundred and Seventeen million dollars enjoy all the food enjoy all the women and enjoy all the fourth night\nMaybe get a little Bernard count on sweater and have all that fun stuff and\nTry to get back at some of the leaders but he'd better bring it tonight or those birds are going to be out of Boston a five five\nTo one to four CBS if I Do want to forty two twenty seven the name of the book is play by play caught

David Price pitchers both denied that started [noise]\nSports play\nAll right we start baseball game on a V.

I was a show for for the night\nAnd a three man crew headed by David Hsu major uh CBS or a reporter came into Austin a head of sound man and the film and we talked to in the car and we went west and and David interviewed a hit list of people who had known President Johnson so I Would say we got there at eight o'clock\nAnd we he interviewed people till three three thirty in the morning [noise]\nThen we got it everything up and I drove them to the Austin the airport or they boarded a plane to Dallas transferred New York\nAnd the purpose of all of his interviews or was for backup material to flesh out president Johnson's story and I think everything he dead got on the air alternately so that was my involvement and of course it very very\nVery memorable the cowboy thing I'm I'm an accidental broadcaster I was a news anchor in Dallas at the vc affiliate I flew to Los Angeles and was offered a job\nTo replace a guy named ah go ... and I accepted the job and I flew back to

want to be a network play by play guy you need to get the experience and he was offered to me\n[noise] uh and that's\nWhat happened and he said I'm a vividly remember him saying uh we've got a hundred Nineteen stations on the networks or spread throughout the south and we're going to be pretty good and they are indeed they were uh two years later ABC Sports culture a coward who was one of the executive producers and they offered me a spot\nOn their roster play by play guys for college football and so that was a launching pad I was at ABC for eight years uh and things didn't work out the way I had hoped\nI was let go and uh then CBS came along to save money saved my hide I started with them in the fall of the two and obviously that association continues and has worked out pretty well\nNo question about that burn and you are an extension for so many years when people would tune in ... football on CBS\nI Want to take you to some calls in your career eighty six the answer call

Jones not getting\nIn the end zone so far this season the falcons are scoring points if you look at the totals at the end of these games but they're not closing out and they're not finishing now last week up against the Pittsburgh Steelers it was an all around just in a baseball team performance ... thirty seven\nPlaying the same same toward forty three this is a team that's worth thirty six planning the bangles reform on single scored thirty seven\nSo this is the situation with the fact is that they're scoring but they're not finished shooting at the end the games now this is a buck steam that James Winston backup quarterback but there's no excuse just here for the falcons this is a team that Superbowl expectations going into the year\nIf you want to turn around and you're a season it starts today at ... pm eastern up against the bucks because after that\nYou have the giants and that's an ESPN game Monday Night you shouldn't be able to beat the giants you beat the boats and be giants you build a little momentum going into\nYour body where you can put three wins\nOn the resume beat three and four and then we'll see how you respond coming out of the by but this week and next week you have to wear them if you are the Atlanta Falcons and we'll see what statement they do deliver coming up later today chargers that the browns both teams can make a statement here\nAt the browns when they'll be above five hundred and the first time and will probably would be a very long time I can't even remember the last time the browns or above five hundred I'm sure someone as the information out there but they're currently at two two and one\nThey could advance the three to one by the end of today and that's the brown seem defense has been great Baker Mayfield has brought an extra\nExcitement level to this brown seeming as I like the way ... set up and he joined us yesterday people think of the word of you know being cocky as a negative connotation\nNot a Baker Mayfield they the brown need a quarterback that has confidence Baker made for things you could win and he's done so so far and it's young career and the national football league a whole lot more than other brands quarterbacks have done in the past so a browns in charge or is this a big one\nBecause of the browns when you send more of a statement you send okay we're above five hundred for the first time in forever\nWe are legit we are the real deal for\nIf you have hard water the lime scale not only leads white spots it plugs pipes and breaks down appliances costing you hundreds of dollars in energy and wear eliminate lives scaling other water issues like brown standing bad\nOdors and lead with hydro care water products available from wave homes illusions waves affordable systems don't use salt or chemicals you'll love the way your water taste smells and looks satisfaction guaranteed\nFor more information go to good Clearwater dot com that's good Clearwater dot com [noise]\n\n[noise]\n... guild show is on the air across the nation on CBS Sports radio here's ... gill [noise]\nAnd sports radio so free line if five two on two forty two twenty seven it's brought you buy guy go great news just a quick way you could save money which the guy to guy could dot com and in Fifteen minutes you'd say Fifteen Percent or more car insurance we talked\nTo ... my ... and a few moments we'll we talk to you first hear on the phones let's go to Dave in Miami first stop here and therefore I Am eastern time our ... show on CBS Sports radio what's happened in Dave\nAnd that too much um where do you think about as far as an airline\nIt's a game that if I'm betting I Would stay far away from it I Know the Panthers are now one point favorite Carolina was not impressive up against the giants that to make a sixty something yard field goal to win and the red skins hey I Love them\nImpressive up against the giants they had to make a sixty something yard field goal to win and the red skins hey I loved them up against the Packers\nAre especially with that from seven but then they got torch\nUp against the same said I Know whoever's going into that came up against the Rawlins will brief had the opportunity to do was probably are going to get towards but I think it's an unknown with uh the red skins and when you look at the Panthers often solved through a good start date you know get a big player back to ... with Tom Davis by\nA this defense has been allowing a lot of yard this year which is something uncharacteristic of the Panthers teams so a Panthers skins I\nThink it's going to come right down to the wire if I had to give you a prediction and had to make gay or pick on the game I Will go with the Panthers in a slight when but I don't feel great about it they\n[noise] well I ... I feel really good about Carolina a day when I heard of them I mean we were our lungs\nAnd a healthy watching taking stuff around got cam McCaffrey all the other receivers that can get Ken short passes and you know I think they might go out\nAnd you know it'll be interesting 'cause it's one of those gains you look at the spraying it right where it is right now and you say oh it's only at one point favorite and similar to what I thought last week\nA woods the Packers in line just sit on the Packers are the only boy you know you know point spread here or are you know when when the line so tight like that and you think the Panthers a clue the better team it's all costs for concern but yeah I think the Panthers win the game by\nWashington I just don't know what Washington teen shows up I just don't it's you know they've actually throughout the week swimming they look good on me they look terrible one MacDill good only terrible it's just it's mind boggling are really is\nLet's go to a dean in Tucson, Arizona next up on CBS Sports radio what's on the\n[noise] hello yes the and you're on the air go ahead hey what's going on it and they actually know a lot of talk about ... against\nThe dolphins I mean you know defend sort of shame and shift the bears the beast and clear on that I mean we could easily undefeated\nBut yeah you only lost one game on the year round and\nRound has just throw three touchdowns in the fourth\nQuarter yeah you got choked away you choke the way the game and Rogers was magnificent and it's a parent's team they've been a pleasant surprise this year you should be the dolphins today it's in Miami Miami uh I don't know what Miami team shows up you know each and every week it's it's like the red skins too\nBut if you look at the bears schedule and I don't know what to make it a ... but you hit the nail right on the head it's effect the fence the fence and ... an expert on this process\nAnd Maggie's first year for the Chicago Bears\nAt the schedule from now until basically December you don't have\nToo many games rats adult things then you have the patch which is tough but then after that you play the jets you're in Buffalo the lions Vikings game lines again and then the giants you got some wonderful games on the schedule\nDolphins when the boot jets winnable bills winnable lions winnable or you know the giants you know if I remember being I'm Sorry but they're wonderful to see you got caught up with games is a team that\nYes there are plowed threat but there's a lot of an experience and some big spots in the coach and a quarter back and we have to see how they respond\nThe team that yes there are plowed threat but there's a lot of an experience and some big spots in the coach and a quarter back and we have to see how they respond\nAnd he was ... was the actress flailing liked to have the past couple of weeks you know I I visit written so I Know I I think it's there for the ...\nI think this will be a good price list is for the next three three or four games and we were playing on a schedule for games to get to see a piece in a row you know what's this but I think we can win if we can take to those games I'd be happy\nYeah you know if if I were you I'd be hoping for three I built the dolphins suggesting the bills in the past is it's a daunting task but yeah if you if you go to and to and you keep on moving to train the right direction and get to nine ten wins\nI'm probably more time than yeah you're putting yourself in a a wildcard spot or maybe the division because that division lines or two and three\nVikings two to one I think the Vikings are vastly improving high like Kirk Cousins a whole lot with that the um especially with the eggs and deal and you got the Packers\nAnd I never count on Rogers but right now the bears are leaving that division at three morning I'll tell you that out of all the teams right out their leader divisions the teams that impressed me the most\nAnd the team doesn't surprise me it was the bangles up for one didn't see that one coming titans at three into didn't see that one coming and the bears the three and one and I'm intrigued to see how they go the rest of the way those three teams 'cause they're leading their divisions right now\nAnd you're wondering if they're going to be leading their divisions at the end of the year before we get to my Mac let's go to Cleveland, Ohio we talked to keep next on CBS Sports radio and suck teeth\nThey are you doing I'm baked alright I'm simply for [laughter] okay All right here's here's what I tell you if you can make an intelligent point [laughter] a bright are deep\nAnd as much as everybody been touting are twenty seven we got a lot of takeovers and that's what's been working for us okay with the chargers coming to town now\nThey're up and says one of the top if they stay away from the turnovers I'm afraid of what's going to happen today okay now my ... Lewis got them on top of the division but I don't think they're going to stay there they have traditionally what Margaret Louis ... after\nThey've been able to get to the playoffs they just don't win in the postseason right aren't bright\nBright so I'm I'm thinking today is a good okay for Cleveland if we could climb above that five hundred mark in our division I think the Steelers are gonna be there okay I think Cincinnati there play it over their head and the rape and circle doubt\nWell ... ... and ... and it will be fine if you're going to make a playoff run it will be fun um I don't think they are going to make a playoff run yet but I think there ahead of the curve than what we thought they were going into this year with this football team\nBut here's the thing with the brown when you look at a total numbers and you say oh they're they're they're twenty seven total deep but it's about points allowed\nAnd they've only allowed a hundred and Thirteen points this year that's one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven that's talked in football twelve a few points allowed the\nFewest has been the Chicago Bears and sixty five and you got back during a by weeks and all that to cause some things about ... but yeah I like this round the fence and simply makers miles Garrett started we know that\nTend toward has been one of the better rookies in football this year and then ... you change the culture when you\nIt ... miles Garrett started we know that dental ward has been one of the better rookies in football this year and then ... you change the culture when you bring a Baker Mayfield and he's the winner\nBut\nBefore you start thinking playoffs you got to get the team's schedule because the browns have been done a lot of winning in the last year it doesn't mean they can't do it this year but this is an opportunity where you have a situation to be the chargers steep today this charge you seen that people don't go to a Super Bowl before the year\nBoth to me the match ups up against the in my opinion the end of the apes the north is what will begin to determine success though the browns this year\nAnd I don't know how this division could apply out because the Steelers you got the bangles and and the ravens as well it's been a tight division I will take time out when we come back we talked to my Mac it's that guilt show right here on CBS Sports radio ... latest CBS Sports update with diamonds [noise]\nAnd you also need your own sense of going some long drives and get seven and we know the parents are capable of that would Brady Adelman drunk and now we've been adding Josh Gordon into the fold\nYeah and when you combine the defense of injury jumped in Houston may not play three other top for safety's probably won't play New England starting to hit their stride and you know you make a good point about hoarding because right now\nThe patriots or an inside out often and by that I mean it's ... get tight and its element slot it seems white the running back was that good a path receiver of the reason the lake coming out of the fact you know so it's all inside out\nAnd if God Gordon can start making some plays on the outside and it was fun watching the tape last week because there still is not\nA real trust factor or they're not in sync Tom Brady and Gordon the first two throws were were disconnects between quarterback and white out but that thirty five yard touchdown pass\nBrady extent play scramble they throw it up and you could see the difference for an athlete with links eyes me going and getting a football can change things for them so if they continue to develop a relationship in a report that often is going to get better and better\nYou look at the concerns for Kansas City moving forward the coach and what he's going to do in a big spot was Super Bowl expectations now with the chiefs and then also their defense they played better the last two weeks but so some concerns there\nYeah I think some of their numbers are misleading they're worse than the leg last in the league at in total defense at over four hundred and sixty or the game\nBut that's what happens when you league game early and you you sit back and an umbrella defense and the second half of let people throw the ball underneath so I think some of the numbers are misleading\nHowever what what kind of bothers me is watching the film last week a what a great game they had obviously against Jacksonville but they gave up nine plays at Twenty one yard plug those\nChunk plays were killed in that can't happen this week it makes it more difficult when you're faced these are banged up and you probably don't have one or two about cast Russia's\nBut the big picture for the season you know your office is going to score ... points and what they did last week\nThey by Sachs by turnover that would save their defund there are there in the top ten in the league and generating turnover and if you're going to give up junk plays and yours you got to be able to take the foot fall away as far as their head coach I've always been an Andy Reid fan I I grew up in Philadelphia I Know in the very well\nYou know the knock on him is that he had won the Superbowl yet he took one Philadelphia theme there\nFrom my perspective he gets the most that he possibly can as the talent he has on hand and Zach you're a hundred percent right\nIf their quarterback more homes continues to play in a high level then whether or not they get to the super bowl when the super bowl a lot of that's going to come down on the defense\nTalking to my ... from the NFL Network in Westwood One might go so now you call the pre season games for the eagles on television in Philadelphia\nEagles gone on to a little bit of a slow start they had a big win last week up against the New York giants on Thursday night just when you look at the eagles now when the NFC East in my opinion but how do you think they\nLast week up against the New York giants on Thursday night just when you look at the eagles now when the NFC East in my opinion but how do you think they stack up with the rest of the NFC\n... I think you have to see where we are right now I think you have to look at the same the Panthers and the rams as the three best teams in the NFC now that doesn't mean we're going to end up that way in Philadelphia now three and three and\nI'm a ... fan and have been since North Dakota state I think he's got a chance to be the best player in the national football league over the next ten years so when you have a guy like that you've always got a chance he's\nGoing to be Aaron Rodgers or ... or burger or you or Tom Brady or\nPick a name he's going to get one of the top guy I Apologize hold on one second sex [noise] sorry about that where the ball in the neighborhood they're\nAll good my chance to be I got dogs are always barking as well for him [laughter]\nAnyway where where we were talking about when and and to me that makes them dangerous ... and they gave away a couple of games on their feet up that certain positions or beat up the money back or beat up in the in the secondary\nBut their front seven good as anybody in the league I Believe in and I think they're going to get a little bit of a run of the war for that and done my belief is they win the NFC\nWhether or not to get back or super boy that's a different conversation\nAnd I love one says well being able to cover him in Philadelphia and that's your franchise quarterback for the eagles for years and years to come and you can plant such\nAnd highly successful level the giants had a franchise quarterback for so many years now it looks like the end is coming sooner rather than later for Ely your bread and butter is the draft you do a great job board on the NFL Network\nWe look ahead to the quarterbacks in the draft\nAnd I know we don't know all of them that are coming out but Herbert Greer and lock\nOur son that jump off the page is how about this quarterback classes a hole for this upcoming draft\nYeah we have no idea who's going to come out or not come out you know the Herbert kid from Oregon is six sex with a big arm he's the prototypical NFL style quarterback he can push the ball down the field he's young he's a third year junior\nOr you can see on film I watched over two thousand seventeenth date he struggled against Boise in the ball game or a struggle with crushed pressuring pocket awareness but you love the size you love the physical traits that he had\nHe just hasn't made all play here who play a lot of college football yet so he's highly intriguing I think drew lock up from Missouri\nI think he's in he's got all the physical traits can make all the froze\n'em my frustration with image just a little bit inconsistency makes one good throw makes another good row and then he makes a decision and throw you why why did you go there and why did you miss it so badly so I'm Still in the very early stages I've seen\nThe top quarterbacks you\nKnow probably three games a piece in before it's all said and done all the all of them\nA book right now you know Greer from West Virginia is an interesting kid he's got the map but it could build a a little bit of a gunslinger uh that I'm from ... got some ah physical traits arm strength but at this point I think it's way too early to say whether it's a good or bad quarterback class 'cause we don't even know who's coming out\nWell judging on the early returns from this past\nYear as quarterback class it looks like well I'm a very successful one with some of the rookies that we've been seeing planning the national football league but you look at the browns a lotta people scratched their heads when they went Baker Mayfield that warning Denzel wore down for and John ...\nYou know football league but you look at the browns a lotta people scratched their heads when they went Baker Mayfield that one and Denzel wore down for and John Dorsey did a great job early on those two selection\nI I agree I mean you can pay and then by the way I really like to Iraq Taylor I I thought he was a nice acquisition because defensively they're going to compete and I thought ... Taylor doesn't turn on the football over would keep them in game now\nOf a sudden they feel gets inserted in the game and there was a different energy level with that entire often\nMayfield gets the ball out quickly he extends play you know his quarterback rating is not outstanding he's made some bad decisions but that all rookies though uh I I think it's exciting to watch him play I think he's got tremendous outside and I think their game with the chargers this week\nIs kind of an intriguing game that nobody saw coming\nTalking to my Mac you look around the rest of the league with some of the rookies of the national football league Durban James dairy is Leonard uh with the Indianapolis Colts that you got sick when in Darnah lift the to New York teams will be fun to track for years and years to come who've been some other rookies to impress you so far early on\nI think quite melt in the left or the cult of Notre Dame who who I had just behind Barkley is the number two player in the draft and ah he's going to be out there and he's going to be a perennial pro bowler um I think mark established port who who New Orleans traded up to take\n'em is incredibly raw but has an ability to make plays and I think he's come along and I think you're seeing Calvin regularly\nIn the Atlanta falcon lake first round pick come in and really make some plays and and I think when you start talking about that Ryan in Holyoke Jones and Ridley and realized that Mohammed to news you're free that's pretty impressive\nYeah released been done for the falcons and this question was on the show last night\nAnd we talked about the best wide receiver does in the national football league we obviously have the conversation with Julio Jones in Calvin Ridley or a B and Jews you definitely came out and then my selection was actually dealing and dig so who's the best wide receiver do on the national football league clearly on them splitting hairs\nFor and I mean that that's pretty good question um I ... I I get a huge kick out of the eggs and feeling 'cause you're talking about a fifth round picking a free agent which I think is awesome\nUm when you look at age ... and ... in Pittsburgh I think that's really difficult to be\nFair enough wrapping up with my Mac right now on CBS Sports radio we will get two teams that surprised me so far in the national football league the bangles they play the Steelers later today and the bears also have the dolphins two teams that have had to strong starts to this year how do you think there are seasons will play out the rest of the way\nAttention all authors page publishing is looking for authors have you read the book and want to get it published\nBaseball blistering look at your book into bookstores and for sale on line at Amazon apple I do in other outlets\nThey handle all aspects of the publishing process for you print it got dark publicity copyright an editing got eight hundred five zero one thirty six eighty nine now for your free author so they should get that seat outward signs or one thirty six eighty nine for your free author somebody should get\nAgain eight hundred Pfizer or one thirty six eighty nine\nOr you or someone you know one of the nearly one million Americans lending like Parkinson's disease there is no you know when to kill or\nThat you have the power to help the scenes that night and they hit the painting in a clinical trial that Michael J.

yesterday we had a great slate\nOf college football as you've had a lot of chaos moving inside the top twenty five first off LSU bounces back after a loss to Florida and I'll be one that I thought oh\nLSU losing ways would continue Georgia would get the victory and you may be started to think that this would start to spit in the wrong direction for Alice you\nWrong on that and orders are on our coach Kirby Smart\nI don't know what ... was doing faking a field goal in the three nothing game\nLSU was aggressive for for for on Fort downs boroughs talked out played from and LSU ran for two hundred and Seventy five yards of the ground compare it to Georgia's a hundred and Thirteen and then when the turnover battle for to zero\nSo give credit to LSU thirty six to sixteen they bounce back in a huge way after losing to Florida to take down at the time the number two team in the country so that's going to shake up\nThe top four because Georgia will stay in the top ten we'll see how fall off bar they will fall but they will be out of the top four so you will have ... number one Ohio State move up to number two\nI have the magic comes to move up to number three and the Notre Dame who

you'd do and what this often painful defense chiefs are making stops up against I\nWould say this is something that you were destined to do\nThere are a lot of young journalists out there who want to get into the business for the gland and the glitter\nYou get that as well but you truly do put into work when we talk about your body of work I Know you went to Albany state where you're very involved\nFor allowing me to wake up each and every day and to have a grand new day and I'm to be able to where the people that I work with and when you talk about Amanda the difference I guess in the stories that we do\nWhile on the local level\nThere's so many stories in so many details that are available to you they're not one day goes by that there isn't a story\nAnd Amanda there are so many amazing local stories I mean we can talk about a police brutality we can talk about protesting Mercedes Benz at Mercedes Benz stadium\nWe can talk about taking a knee in front of Piedmont Park blocking the street or we can talk about a little baby born without kidneys who all they want as a kidney but the system seems to be blocking it for some reason we can talk about\nUh the mother who wonders why her son was shot so many times so many times and still cannot get answers\nThere are so many stories out there for instance in South Fulton where the judicial system is comprised of African American women take and black girl magic to the extreme or we can talk about ... bottom being elected Atlanta sixty a mayor\nOr we can talk about Georgia having the possibility of making history with the first\nBlack female governor there are so many stories out there that you want to tell you can talk about whether it's news weather is sport whether you're talking about the environment even whatever you're talking about it can be a story it is a story and there's someone out there that wants to hear about it\nI agree and what one thing that I Love that you do is no stories too big or too small you know a lot of times when we talk about journalism coverage for most people take which trendy\nAnd oftentimes you make what's trending I remember he said one day you answer the phone in the news you worm which you don't have to do but you do when that phone rings you answer\nAnd you said there was a young man on the other side talking about his girlfriend had just been arrested because she saw for defending her home yes and south Fulton and you encourage them to come in not only did you encourage them to come in and get a story you actually reached\nOut to an on air personality and had him have him on his show and from there the gentleman was able to get connected with other resources in the community to help him and his girlfriend and because of that\nHe was able to get his voice heard to get his story out just a young man trying to be the voice for his girlfriend was wrongfully he felt was wrongfully incarcerated over something that that should not have been but he we were there for them you were there for the people in the community waffle house\nFor instance every time I look and see your protests icy Maria winds in on the scene and the community and you're getting in there [laughter]\nI get in there and your journalistic current and journey has definitely been one of commitment and determination to truly be the best at what you love to do how do you feel\nAbout the current trend of journalism with alternative facts with a lot of the opinionated stories that week you're more so nowadays I mean fake news fake news how do you feel about fake news well I have to tell\nAnd it effects with a lot of the opinionated stories that we give them more so nowadays you mean fake news fake news how do you feel about fake news\nWell I have to tell you I'm\nI focus myself myself who I can control I focus myself on\nTrying to be as factual as I can be what's the source of of my news I think it's less complicated for me because my primary focus is what's happening in Atlanta where I can make a phone call or or or whatever\nI don't have to make it up there so much going on here I don't have to make it up\nUm there are so many very well respected people here that I can talk to there are so many people here in Atlanta who have stories to tell we don't have to make it up these people they feel the pain they feel the sorrow we don't

legislature and how um people can come and advocate to um help victims and perhaps increase penalties when it comes to domestic violence\nYou talked about TPS temporary protective order the tactic orders and how to go about getting those there I'm sure so many out there would say they didn't even know that existed that there wasn't a form of protection for them what are those exactly\nAbsolutely and it's not even just that people don't know that they exist they say themselves how do I do that and um it is a legal process and so what we want to do and what we try to do is make sure that we have explain\nHow you can get civil e protected even if you are not pursuing criminal charges and you just want to make sure that you're safe and we encourage all of our victims do that we walked into the process of how that can happen\nWe hear victims trying to get out but sometimes they can't get out they don't know what to do we hear about the different ways they try to escape doing it in the dark of night packing that bag alerting their their family their friends that they are going to do it and still they can't leave I'm sure there's\nDoing it in the dark of night packing that bag alerting their their family their friends that they are going to do it and still they can't leave I'm sure there are so many varying degrees of stories that you hear in your office\nWe do we hear a lot of difficult stories but what we're a mind it up and what we like to remind folks of is\nThe day you leave when you make that decision to leave can be the most dangerous day in a domestic violence relationship\nBecause that's when we know 'em or that's when the accuser knows that they've lost control in that situation so we encourage our victims to safety plan we want victims to leave but only when it's safe to leave which means having a plan in place where to go services to protect\nPerhaps that temporary protective order a place to make sure your family and your children are protected um all of those things are vitally important to leaving safely\nYou talked earlier about having victims to come to your symposiums who else shows up at these important discussions\nWe get a a host of people from various backgrounds we get we get people that are interested in learning more about domestic violence because they want to volunteer in their community we get family members that wanna that recognize the signs in their own families and want to learn more\nAnd figure out how to help their family members\nWe get community based leaders that want to take that information back\nTo their communities like faith leaders that want to understand more because their church members maybe coming to them for advice and they need to be educated on how to handle those very delicate and difficult situation do you get any teachers perhaps absolutely we get we get anybody that works with\nFamilies because this issue is in every family everywhere doesn't discriminate on race religion or gender\nWe've been talking primarily about the ... annual domestic violence imposing a resource fair building bridges making connections a call to action is a public event\nSchedule for Wednesday October Seventy from eight in the morning until twelve thirty in the afternoon at the manual Maloof auditorium located at Thirteen hundred ... indicator do people need to register\nThey do not need to register um although if you would like to attend you can email our office at a a Riley at DeKalb County Ga dot Gov but you do not have to register to calm\nOkay we're talking to a DeKalb County district attorney Sherry Boston it's great to have you in Studio with us today talking about turning the spotlight on domestic violence it is you're eight annual domestic violence symposium why do you do it\nWe continue to do it because we get such a great response from not only our community partners but the folks that show up every year\nEveryone wants to know we're going to continue to do it we have people that come every single year and then we get new people in the room and as long as there is this problem with domestic violence will continue to bring awareness to it in any way we can\nSo you get the support of the county to put these on\nAbsolutely I'm grateful for the support of CEOs Thurman and our board of commission who routinely come out to show their face because they know that this is a problem in our community and I feel grateful to have their support\nAnd I ask you do the teachers come because in the schools there's abuse there but you also have an event to that target teen dating an abuse right\nSo teen dating violence is I'm also an epidemic but we have to address it in a different way um because there are so many\nAnd Lance is I'm\nAlso an epidemic but we have to address it in a different way um because there's so many of our teams that are just entering into their first intimate partner were dating relationships and so they don't always understand what a relationship should look like\nBecause they've never had a relationship before so we know with our teens fifty seven percent of teens know someone who has been physically sexually or verbally abusive and a dating relationship\nAnd only thirty three percent of those dating abuse victims ever told anyone about it\nIt is an epidemic of massive proportions with our young people\nAnd so many of our parents and guardians teachers and family members don't even realize that it's an issue because as we know teens don't like to share her they don't like to share their coming thing going let alone\nProblems that they may be facing in a dating relationship\nNot to mention some people may be dating without permission\nRight mhm uh they may not be allowed to date they may be keeping a relationship secret just because if not allowed in the household imagine if that relationship that secret relationship were also in abusive relationship they certainly aren't going to share that with our family so it's a real problem\nFrom the legal standpoint how difficult is it then to prosecute when you have the source of cases versus those adult cases\nI Would say it's equally challenging in both cases because it whether you are a team or you are an adult I'm or a wife or a mother or twenty five years on these relationships are emotional and it's scary um and\nIt can be intimidating I'm so we we we face the same challenges in teen relationships as we do in\nAdult relationships you talked about teens not wanting to share how have you determine that matter is eventually brought about is it because someone finally shared something someone in the relationship shared or because someone witnessed something and they came forward\nIt it's a combination of instances but I Will tell you there are many family members that don't learn that their teen is involved in a dating relationship until their dad unfortunately uh we we have seen also across the nation and uptick in homicides\nI'm among youth and in ... and these young dating relationships and there are so I I hear mothers and fathers saying\nI had no idea that this was going on not only in my house but with my with my daughter my child and they're devastated\nUm and that's certainly not how we want this to come to light but unfortunately sometimes in these relationships that's when we're learning when there's a death\nHow important is it to not remain quiet\nIt's important to speak up and speak out and that's what we want to encourage our young people because what we do know is although a young person may not confide and a mother or father\nThey may confide in a a best friend up here someone that they trust and so we feel like if we can educate young people then maybe that best friend ah in the group\nWill lend the support to that friend to get them to speak up\nYou have that event coming up your teen dating event coming up in February rice\nIt's coming up on Saturday\nThat friend to get them to speak up\nYou have that event coming up your teen dating event coming up in February right\nYes it's coming up on Saturday February twenty third that'll be in two thousand Nineteen we're going to have\nOur third annual love around it is a five K. and the proceeds go to the women's resource center to end domestic violence\nBut more importantly we want to raise awareness around teen dating violence and we hold out in February every year because we know that February ... Valentine's Day and we want people when they're thinking about\nValentine's Day to think about being unhealthy relationships and what that should look like and that's what our love front is all

a major Cooper in this segment of Atlanta up close we are highlighting and featuring ordinary people in our community who are doing some extraordinary things\nToday we are featuring intercom radio Atlanta's and very own Maria Boynton Maria welcome to the show\nThank you Amanda this is such an honor because when I think about your body of work as a journalist I don't really think our listeners are aware of how extensive your experiences\nAnd today we are honoring you because you are being honored by the state of Georgia\nIs a little bit about that and also give us more insight about who you are\nWell Amanda first and foremost I like to thank you for wanting to sit down with me to conduct this interview because normally I'm interviewing everyone else I'm Out in the field and covering their stories and it is humbling to me to be here today a what I received from the Georgia\nHouse of representatives is a resolution and from several lawmakers there and I like to thank them mentally uh it says a resolution recognizing and commended Maria Boynton on her outstanding service as a journalist and it goes on for other purposes a bunch of whereas is\nA lot of stuff that I didn't realize that actually accomplish that down there\nOn for other purposes a bunch of whereas is a lot of stuff that I didn't realize that I'd actually accomplish that down they were able to produce in a resolution and I'd like to say that I'm humbled by this and it talks about\nThe beginning the middle and present day\nThat's outstanding I remember when you came in and you show me your resolution I was so elated and so proud of you\nBecause that is not something that they just can't everyone that's something that they hand pick someone to receive it and they can teach you because\nYou're still deserving of this and I know that most people know you're from the news they know you from CNN they know you from the one oh three and Thirteen eighty W A L K as well as your involvement through the community and through all of the activities that you do as a journalist\nI remember you telling me that you are originally from Columbus, Georgia I also remember you telling me that when you were in high school you were at what you want it to do and you said what\nI said I Want it to be a reporter because we had a stations there and I would say I'm arena Boynton reporting and um every what each honor and I'm On social media and there was a young lady named Carol and we're on the ... corps together and high school\nAnd she always says to me you always said you want it to be a reporter\nAnd that's how my life has has moved has um transcended into the life of a reporter I'm Maria Boynton\nUm feel honored to be allowed to do that because I feel that my purpose is that a public service and in my job I'm able to report\nI'm able to get to know others in my reporting and to allow others to get to know others as well so\nYour dream started out in high school\nYes I I Would say my dream started out actually when I was even younger than that because I had the television and I would sit there and I would watch the TV and then that of course helped me realize that there were things that a little black girl could do on the television\nAnd ... but I spend most of my time listening to the radio\nThe radio was what mood my life that's what we listen to we listen to the radio\nThe local radio station there had news persons on them and then of course the music was another thing I Am a country music fan\nAnd so we had a a gentleman by the name of cousin Allen my home town and I have to tell you I Would listen to cause an al his delivery how he was set up the music how they would go to the news and how informative every bit of it was and I fell in love with it\nWell that's a very evident and the news has fallen in love with us well now I Know you said that you knew what you want it to do in high school were you involved in any journalistic clubs where are you a news anchor for your school how did you express that desire\nWell actually one of the local radio stations there had a scholarship and I went and applied and then when I got home there was a gentleman visiting my my grandmother's home and he says I Know you don't want to be a DJ so I kind of made me think well maybe I don't want to do this\nAnd so then I went off to school and lo and behold there was an audition for someone to read the news or southwest Georgia I was a student at Albany State University Albany state college at the time it was known as\nAnd so I went in and I auditioned and I got it\nI was a student at Albany State University Albany state college at the time it was known as and so I went in and I auditioned and I got it and I'm so that was how you can say I\nWas thrust into my career of journalism and it was great to come into the dining hall and people say I just heard you on the news\nI just heard you do in the news so it was interesting and then I'm Dr James Hill who was one of the deans at our college he called me into his office one day and said I have an internship possibility for you and so I guess we can say the rest is history I started out in turning at a local station there and one or two weeks and they hired me\nWow that's amazing I wouldn't even say that this is something that you wanted to do I would say this is something that you were destined to do there are a lot of young journalists out there who want to get into the business for the gland and the glitter\nYou get that as well but you truly do put into work when we talk about your body of work I Know you went to Albany state where you're very involved and\nI Know that you received a proclamation from your own home town down in Columbus, Georgia as well yes mhm I Know you have a a wealth of experience\nAnd they honored and acknowledge\nYour career in journalism your career extends beyond the one oh three tell us a little bit about your journey in journalism and I know you were with CNN for a while\nYes CNN is one of them when I left Albany state I went home and worked at the local stations they're for Davis broadcasting and then I got the call to come to Atlanta Georgia and I went to work for a W GST and the Georgia news network for a time\nAnd then went to CNN or the CNN Radio network\nAt that time I got married to my husband and I moved to the north and um\nI worked in New York City offer a couple of stations dared one I was a writer at another I was on air and we're we're talking about WCBS and W. O. R. and then I also lived in Pennsylvania and during that time and so I was doing some some ... work\nOr stations there as well and so then had a family tragedy I lost my husband and I moved home\nAnd uh when I went back to the CNN Radio network and was there for more than a decade and of course we know as companies evolve and they make changes some of us were let go they cut our particular network and\nI agree ... one thing that I Love that you do is you know stories too big or too small you know a lot of times when we talk about journalism coverage for most people take which trending\nAnd oftentimes you make which trending I remember he said one day you answer the phone in the newsroom which you don't have to do what you do when that phone rings you answer and\nYou said there was a young man on the other side talking about his girlfriend had just been arrested because she for for defending our home is in South Fulton and you encourage them to come in not only did you encourage them to come in and get his story you actually reached\nOut to an on air personality and had him have him on a show and from there the gentleman was able to get connected with other resources in the community to help him and his girlfriend and because of that\nHe was able to get his voice heard to get his story out just a young man trying to be the voice for his girlfriend and was wrongfully he felt was wrongfully incarcerated or something that that should not have been\nBut he we were there for them you were there for the people in the community waffle house for instance\nEvery time I look and see your protests I see Maria winds in on the scene and the community and you're getting in there [laughter]\nI get in there and your journalistic current and journey has definitely been one of commitment and determination to truly be the best at what you love to do how do you feel\nAbout the current trend of journalism with alternative facts with a lot of the opinionated stories that we hear more so nowadays I mean ... news fake news how do you feel about fake news\nWell I have to tell you I'm I focus myself myself who I can control I focus myself on\nWell I have to tell you I'm I focus myself myself who I can control I focus myself on\nTrying to be as factual as I can be what's the source of of my news I think it's less complicated for me because my primary focus is what's happening in Atlanta where I can make a phone call or or or whatever\nI don't have to make it up there so much going on here I don't have to make it up um there are so many very well respected people here that I can talk to there are so many people here in Atlanta who have stories to tell we don't have to make it up these people they feel the pain they feel the sorrow we don't have to make that up\nSo that's the reason when I say is less cumbersome for me in that respect because there's so many valid stories on the local level now when we talk about\nThe alternatives to news and the the fake news have to tell you my interest is more so in those\nWho give their opinions in the news more so than the fake news because fake news is not something that I worry about\nWhen we were ...

have to read between the lines to figure out what's really going to discuss provocative issues that argument ... off of an educated guess crime and everything in between when you're\nLooking for me\nAnd I ask you do the teachers come because in the schools there's abuse there but you also have an event to that target\nThis is a problem in our community and I feel grateful to have their support\nAnd I ask you do the teachers come because in the schools there's abuse there but you also have an event to that target teen dating and abuse right\nYes their teen dating violence is I'm\nAlso an epidemic but we have to address it in a different way um because there are so many of our teams that are just entering into their first intimate partner were dating relationships and so they don't always understand what a relationship should look like\nBecause they've never had a relationship before so we know with our teens fifty seven percent of teens know someone who has been physically sexually or verbally abusive and a dating relationship\nAnd only thirty three percent of those dating abuse victims ever told anyone about it\nIt is an epidemic of massive proportions with our young people\nAnd so many of our parents and guardians teachers and family members don't even realize that it's an issue because as we know teens don't like to share her they don't like to share their coming and going let alone\nProblems that they may be facing in a dating relationship\nNot to mention some people may be dating without permission right mhm uh they may not be allowed to date they may be keeping a relationship secret just because if not allowed in the household imagine if that relationship that secret relationship were also in abusive relationship\nThey certainly aren't going to share that with our family so it's a real problem\nFrom the legal standpoint how difficult is it then to prosecute when you have the source of cases versus both adult cases\nI Would say it's equally challenging in both cases because it whether you are a team or you are an adult I'm or a wife or a mother or twenty five years or these relationships are emotional and it's scary um and\nIt can be intimidating I'm so we've we've we've faced the same challenges in teen relationships as we do in adult relationship\nYou talked about teens not wanting to share how have you determine that matter is eventually brought about either because someone finally shared something someone in the relationship shared or because someone witnessed something and they came forward\nIt it's a combination of instances but I Will tell you there are many family members that don't learn that their teen is involved in a dating relationship and tell their dad unfortunately uh we we have seen also across the nation an uptick in homicides\nI'm among youth and then ... and these young dating relationships and there are so I I hear mothers and fathers saying I had no idea that this was going on not only in my house but with my with my daughter my child and they're devastated\nUm and that's certainly not how we want this to come to light but unfortunately sometimes in these relationships that's when we're learning when there's a death\nHow important is it to not remain quiet it's important to speak up and speak out and that's what we want to encourage our young people because what we do know is although a young person may not confide and a mother or father\nThey may confide in a a best friend appear someone that they trust\nWe feel like if we can educate young people then maybe that\nUp here someone that they trust and so we feel like if we can educate young people then maybe that best friend ah in the group will lend the support to that friend to get them to speak up\nYou have that event coming up your teen dating event coming up in February rice\nYes it's coming up on Saturday February twenty third that'll be in two thousand Nineteen\nWe're going to have our third annual love around it is a five K. and the proceeds go to the women's resource center to end domestic violence but more importantly we want to raise awareness around teen dating violence and we hold out in February every year\nBecause we know that February ... Valentine's Day and we want people when they're thinking about\nValentine's Day to think about being unhealthy relationship and what that should look like and that's what our love front is all about\nAnd if folks want more information about that what should they do\nThey can go to our website and we'll be promoting that information that said WWW dot the cab da da da and it's also on our Facebook page and our Twitter page\nJerry Boston is the DeKalb County district attorney she's been the district attorney now for a quick two years went by really really fast of course you were solicitor general before that let's get into beyond domestic violence this is talk some matters beyond domestic violence\nProgressive prosecution that's the topic a term that tends to come out of your office that I'm hearing out of your office is ... is it your approach to prosecution says that we're talking about\nIt is in it I didn't even know there was a term for and the more people started saying oh you're one of the progressive prosecutors across the United states I mean these were ideas that had already been working on um as solicitor and issues that Iran on his district attorney\nUm but people refer to it as progressive um I like to call it innovative are smart um we have to make some tough choices and our criminal justice system\nUm and we need to make sure that we're spending our resources in a way that makes sense for our community which is holding our violent offenders accountable\nAnd keeping our community safe from violent offenders but at the same time we have to offer opportunities and second chances for people in our community that can be rehabilitated that have substance abuse issues there that have honestly just made genuine mistakes along the way\nBut are gonna come back into our community and deserved to come back into our community and I think that's what progressive prosecution is all about\nThe Boston when you talk about those who just simply made a mistake we discuss cash bail reform folks who are in jail needed a hundred dollars just to make bail in can't what DeKalb County doing about that\nWell I at DeKalb County has been on the forefront of these types of issues and as solicitor general I was proud to be a part of reforming our recorders court at at the time was responsible for dealing with these types of low level traffic ordinance type offenses where we saw\nPeople being held in jail not because they were a danger but simply because they couldn't come up with a few hundred dollars to post a bond um and so we see cash bail are formed being discussed not just in Atlanta all over the United states because the last thing we want is our prisons to become debtors prisons\nWe certainly don't want folks being in jail because they can't afford to come out of jail it does not help our families that doesn't help our community\nWhat is your office doing when it comes to you\nDale because they can't afford to come out of jail it does not help our families that doesn't help our community\nWhat is your office doing when it comes to helping folks who have been in the system who have been incarcerated get that second chance\nWell I'm proud to say that we created when I became district attorney a unit in our office called the decaf unit diversion and community alternative programs\nAnd under that umbrella we do all of our accountability courts within the court system whether it's mental health court drug court veterans' court\nWe also offer diversion programs where we as prosecutors take certain offensive and say these are the types of set the fences that we feel uh we can divert outside of the traditional criminal justice system and where we want people to complete certain programs\nUm and do certain things whether it's getting their GED or counseling\nAnd therefore if they complete that we will not prosecute them and saddle them with a felony conviction that we know will hinder their ability to move on in life so if someone\nWanted information about this and they didn't know that it was available to them what should they do well\nOur website has information about our programs um but any attorney or the public defender's office if you are in the criminal justice system I'm can give you information about those programs are well aware of some\nTalking to ... and the gang situation we read the news we hear the news we see the news gang violence a big problem in the metro area DeKalb County the situation there has it gotten any better has it gotten worse over the past couple of years what do you tell us\nAnd it's gotten worse over the past worse okay um but I Will say this we're being proactive I'm and I'm happy to say that when I came on as da and started to new units to combat the problem of not only gang and gun violence but also homicides in our community\nI started a major case unit as well as a crime strategies community partnerships unit that was really based off of what da ... was doing in Manhattan\nI'm and I'm excited that these two units are working together and I feel blessed to have funding great funding from our cab board of commissioners who saw the need for innovative strategies to address gunning gun and gang violence in our community\nAnd that being said you said you you start at these programs are working hand in hand with each other the gang situation gang violence has gotten worse than to cap what needs to happen for there to be that turn around", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "14"}
