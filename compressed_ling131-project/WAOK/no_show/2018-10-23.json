I said\nThe pot calling the kettle black\nSo Trump is saying that a Rome's is on qualified to be governor of the state of Georgia\nJust weeks away\nPresident Trump reminding voters of his endorsement of Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate secretary of state Brian Kemp\n\nTrump said and I quote Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp will be a great governor he has been successful at whatever he has done and has prepared but it's very difficult and complex job for many years\nHe has much stronger endorsement his opponent is totally unqualified would destroy a great state\nUm who we really are on to the public\nWill sell yeah thank you brother are right you want you to appreciate your call and you're inside a don't forget\nThat November fourth\nStacey Abrams Brian Kemp and the libertarian candidate a admits\nWell actually debate on channel two W. as be TV dot com and the W. as the TV news out what all play it live this will be a debate just a few days before the actual election now\nIt just really should just be Stacey Abrams a Brian camp but the libertarian candidate will be allowed to participate or he's going to be a distraction that's\nAll he will be a distraction or and possibly take away valuable time from the two people who actually have a chance of winning\nBeing that you you moderate a lot of debates cause you break down for the listeners what goes into a debate for a candidate like how do you prepare for such did that\nResearch you do a tremendous amount of research I've moderated local debates a congressional debates the whole nine the first place you start\nIs understanding the nuances understanding the differences and also connecting those differences to the will of the people and once you have an understanding of that and and that's fundamentally different from city to city county to county a district a district\nThen you have a base to start from\nI recall young Julian moderating the mayoral debates in the state of Atlanta and there were a couple of people running who decided not to answer my questions I Know a lot of people looked at the\nTime when a when the young lady Mary did not answer\nMy question but the truth is she wasn't the only one the reason why that went viral is because\nWhen I went back at others who are running to ask then my second time they decided to go ahead and answer the question but with her she decided to steal not answer the question so created this weird moment at this back and forth moment that went viral\nSo as I Know you said used to work with the Democratic or a party how would you prepare your candidate for a debate\nWon't you gotta make sure the knowledgeable on the issues and doing that is sometimes difficult given the type of electric you run it many times there are questions that you know absolutely will be at\nThe other thing you do is you study the moderator and you study the panel is who are involved\nA few of the debates I have moderated\nWe also have a panel and that panel is allowed to ask questions\nUnderstand that if your panel represents the Hispanic coalition expect questions about that\nSo doing basic research on who's actually asking the questions and what organizations are allowed to put forth a question can help you train your candidate they also some tricks or there was one guy\nAnd what organizations are allowed to put forth a question can help you train your candidate they also some tricks or there was one guy we're running an African American male in the city of I think it was fair deal\nI think it was fabulous this was years ago and he did win that election but I remember doing during debate prep\nI had him carry around a pocket constitution\nAnd he had the constitution in his pocket and also told him to carry around the city charter in his pocket and the city charter had all kinds of crazy stuff that nobody really knew so the guy he was running against a typical white male candidate\nWhen it got to the point of where one candidate got to ask the other candidate a question I told my guy to ask him something really obscure\nThat's in the city charter now this guy was already an elected official serving on the council and we pick the most obscure thing and we just knew his opponent would never know it\nAnd yes his opponent didn't even know the answer to that question uh our opponent did and I pulled it went so far I mean our Kennedy went so far as to say or to the opponent hey I actually carry around a constitution and the city charter every day\nBecause I Believe in this country and I believe in the city it was all bogus and they move out both are a lot of work a lot of\nPreparation goes into into these debates my final question for you is being that this debate is three days before the actual election yeah how big is this and how much did it sway voters\nIs not as big as it used to be it used to be huge and why do you have to base like this right before the electric because of the ... the advent of early voting and absentee voting\nAnd so you're going to have a large sliver\nOf the electorate already participated now here's what's interesting I'm Julian there are some states that actually allow you to go back and change a vote really some states allow you to go back and change your vote if you changed your mind George is not one of them by the way but there are some states that if you voted early and you saw a debate is oh goodness what have I done\nI voted for the wrong person I Need to change my vote some states allow you to change your vote as long as it is done before the final day of the electorate we steal the election day and that's really\nFlaw that's wrong because election day\nIs no longer election days electric days the last day of the election is what we really should be saying so November six is not election day November ... is the last day of the electorate today is election day tomorrow is election day the next day is election day you've got election day until November\nSo because of that these debates are not as effective as they used to be they should have done it a long time yeah they should have already done it well

mentioned needs to be the winner ... some of his or her ... you don't think that bothers you need to check in brain CNN actually\nRight maybe smile none of the ... thing that hopefully\nWe widows without even eat late night signed up my she she absolutely but the bottom left\nHand held\nBack for a Dodgers seven zero three good to be with you good to be with\nYou hope you guys are doing great remarkable we've got a lot of calls you know the conversation let's go to her room in Atlanta our own good they welcome\n[laughter] no I'd be your brother get drawn red\nDawn what's going on rubber about about that right\nYeah uh congratulations to your nomination or the uh number one broker on\nOn radio in Atlanta rich you bet you probably already know you do you deal\nYou know it's interesting when I look at this uh conversation about the Saudis involved a\n... a cars sold a\nTermination mutilation because if you think back to nine eleven\nThose individuals that were flying the plane was solving\nAnd that's one connection that I haven't heard made those of us who are in the news and in the know watching these events take place\nThere's a causal connections between the two and when we talk about America and it's a influence throughout the world corrupt\nI was a connection between the two and when we talk about America and it's a influence throughout the world corrupt as it is\nIt when we talk about these assassinations we have to connect those with the deaths and the bombings and the drone stove a Obama and\nAll these other presidents they're all dirty or their hands all feel with the ... another reason why I could never support this corrupt system unless it's under duress which were forced to do\nBut I really don't want to ask you the question and a jihad brought this up and it's something that I have seen and I'm sure we watch television and we see more and more ah this this a white man I'm Brian Mann white woman a connection that they are creating\nOn the commercials and then all of the TV [noise]\nAs a young man and living in this system and understanding a political strategies what do you see that as a the the reason why they are promoting this agenda and I can tell your mom after I hear your if you don't\nMind not clarified the agenda [noise]\nAh I Know I'm asking you ... if you have seen this\nA phenomenon on television where they are connecting in the news is a black man I'm Sorry the white woman uh with the black man\nIn the movies is still black man with a white woman just just about every aspect of media had they're showing a black man and commercials with a white woman had undergone Germany that okay that's what and that's why I'm asking\nRight that's true um ... there was a report and I think this report is from twenty Seventeen so it was not an old report um but it's still shows that basically eighty eight percent of all commercials must deal done with the same race on race actors so basically your commercials will show all white people\nAre all black people are all Hispanic people give it the market that they are attempting to influence so in the end of the day you may see an increase perhaps but it is still nowhere near the majority of what you're saying\nOn the television commercials and the reason why is because these commercials are meant to do one thing they're not meant to create a diverse utopia of America they are meant to promote an influence people to buy something\nSure should I say that the point that ah I see in this uh what I see this growing incidence of this type of a imagery has to do with the ... the fact that black people in this country\nHave no culture because they have no culture they are that they sting their\nInability to promote the ... the legacy of their own ancestors through the infusion of white\nCulture in a interest and I believe that that is because not a utopia in this country that they're trying to develop but a system where people forget where they come from as we've seen we're I guess we're the experimental guinea pigs\nOf the world to show that if you raise a generation of people within a culture and they come from a ... and and that a different culture that they can virtually eliminate\nAny connection with their own ancestry through\nUh the imagery that we\nThey can virtually eliminate any connection with their own ancestry through uh the imagery that we see happening on television that some of us see then maybe\nSo I that's one of the things that I asked seen it because we bring the culture we is no holidays no nothing you know when Tiger Woods came into golfing they say I guess now regard have watermelon and chicken in ... in our food now\nYeah so ... that that was one ignorant individual who said that and what I Try not to ever do is\nQuantify everybody in some general statement because anytime you generalize people you're guaranteed be guaranteed to be one thing and that is wrong everybody is not the same so I I get your point your point is that there's a\nDiluting of the culture which is true but the looting of the culture did not start with the commercialization of our society it didn't start with a celebrating holidays\n[noise] no no it started with the uh what they call the caricatures that were created when we first got here which started the self hatred whether I was the lips a hair knows is these are things that you ...\nWhat do you do you do understand that culture\nIs always transforming progressing\nIf you ask right now particular historical tribes in Africa that try to keep close to the tradition of their ancestors they will tell you stories about how things used to be and how today they are different as well even though in our societal\nUnderstanding as Africans in America we would think that they\nAre ... are not only closely I in relation to activity and culture try ancestors but they are an exact duplication and they will tell you they are not\nThey will tell you that historically from their point of view society they have also progressed and changed and things are different in their cultural expression so culture is always expressing itself differently threw out time\nIs that now make but you know you just reveal something that I have asked you many many times and you overlooked in just invaded that question you actually have for the world to hear\nYour nationality you see\nRather I've always said that the problem with you on hold on wait a minute rather rather you Brian Mann used to\nRun for you brother please I've always said that I've said it and

I mean in the Democratic party went over to the Republican Party because they did not want to be around black folks\nSo those people that you're that this commercial estate and going to let somebody there in the Republican Party now and I kinda I kinda broke their thunder 'cause they were really happy about that commercial but I I I think black people are smart enough to understand when they're being ... you know\nI I Know they are I don't think they are I Know they are and I end this commercial completely backfired and that's why the white incumbent congressman said that commercial is not cool\nRight [laughter] yeah because you may remember when they may Michael Steele the chairman of the\nRepublican right committee or whatever right they didn't trust you with the money\nOr is it not they actually voted to take away the power of pers from the first black chairman of the Republican National party\nAnd then what what is this your last year that came out in ...\nPres from the first black chairman of the Republican National party\n... and then what was it\nThis year last year that came out and said they only elected him because he was black yeah he knew that yeah so that was telling him I said\nWhat the you got to be up on what they're going to understand that triggered me to say what pool to try to get you to come over to their fat and they get you on that that they're going to treat you like a slave anyway so I mean what what would you go\nNow without commercials the interest of commercial\nI think something is a risk job because I don't know if you started making

A. okay the voice of the community calling for for eight nine to two seven zero pre get you involved in the conversation or makes you guys are they a prize was going on in the news the Saudis situation um is going to\nStay apprised of what's going on in the news I think the Saudis situation um is going to escalate quicker than I think the president intense um whereas he thinks it's a minor minor issue involving\nA one journalist I think on the international stage wants the United states begins basically selling out our uh our residents he's not a citizen but resident\nOr in order to maintain deals across the globe it does not look good on the global stage uh so I don't think this is one of those stories is going to die out quickly you know this isn't Kavanaugh and being drunk at a party forty years ago this is someone being dismembered and murdered\nOr in the U.S taking no action because we don't want to mess up a arms deal and I don't think that's something the international community will stay in four\nOh one thing that I think is very interesting I think we also have to ah to look at\nIs the the twenty eighth team in terms of the preamble for twenty twenty of course I and with that what we see is\nThe Democrats have not yet articulated a message there not not yet articulated anything that will give any confidence to anyone to the idea that there'll be able to pull out the Senate and twenty Eighteen or the presidency and twenty twenty\nIt will be nice if they would I Know I Wish they would but as of right now there's nothing to indicate that they have anything along those lines of an ability to do so\nOr they don't have any clear messaging ... if somebody can call in and tell me exactly what the democratic messages for twenty Eighteen besides Trump is the devil\nAnd I don't think that teach you all the way there I don't think that there's enough hatred to make it interesting but it was not enough hatred around the country to win an election just on Trump is the devil\nThere has to be more there has to be a clear plan on what you would do differently and with the economy going well right now how is your plan for what to do differently would not destroy the economic progress we've made\nThere's plenty of things out there to talk about even talk about the exploding deficit were Twenty one trillion dollars\nAnd talking about the fact that all the tax cuts that one point five trillion dollars or a trillion dollars in tax cuts went almost exclusively to the rich and have not trickle down to the rest of the economy you can discuss the fact that the health care system is in shambles because the president decided to shutter most parts of Obamacare throwing things in the chaos\nThere's plenty of things to talk about but right now the only thing you're hearing out of them is calling me Russia um Kavanaugh spying da da da de ... people don't care about\nAnd the reason I think it's important for them to get this message together now is that looking forward to twenty twenty there's an absolute chance that President Trump could get thirty percent of the black male vote\nThirty percent of the black male vote remember being twenty sixteen\nHe got Thirteen percent of the black male vote\nBut at the same time you have to account his number as the the net number the aggregate number of not just the votes he got but the decrease in votes for the Democrat over the no turnout from the previous election and black man simply put did not turn out for Hillary Clinton\nSo between the number of votes he got the Thirteen percent and the number of people will simply did not turn out because they weren't inspired are interested in the Clinton campaign Trump was right around twenty percent for black men\nNow how does that go up to\nThirty percent in twenty twenty well let's listen to the speech by con game and understand that\nHow does that go up to thirty percent in twenty twenty\nWell let's listen to the speech by a con game\nAnd understand that it was not an insane rant as the uh media likes to tell you instead he was making severe ... points one point to key in on\nThe part where he said this pet um makes me feel like a man this ... gives me power of this ... makes me a superhero\nWhat is your take your lady and something that you hear pervasive Leon barber shops in in bars where black men feel like they're under attack by the media\nWere men in general field but they are now the enemies of America is founded by the progressive movement\nAll of a sudden you're guilty until proven innocent if you're accused of rape or sexual assault or harassment or anything along those lines you'll see you'll lose your job you you lose your family you'll get locked up like Cosby did owns\nUnconfirmed allegation from twenty thirty forty years ago this how many men are thinking today\nMany men also our understanding the realities of the monitoring county where women are more educated women have better jobs women have more money and there was no longer the patriarchal or understanding of society\nWhere the male is automatically assumed to be in a leadership role simply because he is a male or a male is considered to be the head of the household because he is male that no longer exist and there was a great amount of resentment around that\nThe PC nature of coach of our culture today is not conducive to inspiring men to as ... said feel like men\nConstantly being totally you can't say that you can joke about that you can't go over there you can't look at that don't act like that will be quite put that you know don't go over there\nYou gotta lotta grown men walking around him pet to death feeling not children\nAnd so when that happened the order automatically what occurs is a rejection of those things a quiet secret majority\nThat surrounds the nation on those things\nAnd some of these people who are the most adamant never Trump ... the ones who call him forty five that she do oh rank a tank that orange minutes so on and so forth no women I hate to tell you this and this may be a shock to your system\nSometimes men lie and sometimes they lie because they hold an unpopular or uncomfortable position\nThat they don't quite want to tell you about to say who late last pizza chicken he'll look over the who what you'll say well you know able\nTo meet you in the house I Know what happened here look you know I don't know what happened either you say you know I didn't need it you short it could have been you and they will treat you like you lost your mind because they don't feel like being in an uncomfortable position\nSo if you ask them are you going to vote for Trump oh heck no that evil forty five Cheetos orange minutes\nNever but then when they get into the voting booth it's a different story that remember back\nDuring the campaign when the video came out a Trump saying grab 'em by the you know what\nAnd everybody was outraged there was universal outrage everybody could not handle it how could he be so evil so disgusting so terrible\nYou get three news together and ask them you know you're kind of funny actually sounds just like something I Would say my frankly I've had that is that conversation that was they fought for bringing up the video it didn't affect the outcome of the election at all and so even now with\nThat is that conversation that would they fought for bringing up the video it didn't affect the outcome of the election at all\nAnd so even now with the whole cabinet thing where Democrats are going so hard on that remember a lot of men are sitting there like I got drunk at a party Twenty years ago a hunch known somebody buying rape him are they doing sit too so I mean she was drunk to\nAnd they see that and they have a certain level of empathy for the person going through it\nAnd that carries over into election season when you have one party what seems to be and prime male and one candidate holding up the mantle of male realty of simply put I don't give a you know what about anything\nAnd that is going to attract a large number of votes if Trump combo this prison reform\nCompost this with them actions on infrastructure to affect the inner city gives more black men employed you could see him getting thirty percent of the black vote in twenty twenty don't say I didn't tell y'all don't say I didn't want to go\nHey them well one thing we say ... beans and all this week Trump does the exact same thing to a as a student for greater we're hoping to lock her up they still chance at rallies were both know knock the hell out of 'em at the winters are well protesters were both in the world\nAt the same thing as what my husband says what you said earlier about you know you can have someone in the president's someone in the oval office cursing as someone saying grab 'em by the way to all of that stuff that came out people still voted for him why\nBecause the same old methods and nothing getting done was just tired\nI he's not my passport he's met someone I Want my daughter to marry I don't want my son looking up to him as a role model what I Do watch it's heading to get our country back focusing on us and I don't care about this side stuff I had to stop but\nBoy and a lot and I live\nBy not healthy he he Elvie that last year's and gay half of them and now voting for him to walk away campaign so it is over he's getting more than thirty percent of the black vote for\n... to me more than a lot of it is you're going to run\nInto historically any nation has been isolationist has not succeeded easy to get it

a lift her\nOr anything so this is a technical difficulty will come back to him Ringo to serious on line three serious\n... minutes now will how are you\nI'm good hey I just want us to you know a lot of times we get on the conversation and topics they use the black voter black people black is like that but they don't realize that nobody of the local politicians in the black community is doing race based politics\nSo while we want to allow us to be the first of all the black vote when you get the policies and you get the politicians on a you know like a a city wide you take a governor's race for example\nYou just that they're not going to address any case if it's about people and Barry aj Fisher last bought us for example he said black lives matter is of that nature but at that point she had she was just do that\nA lot a lot of ... we we miss the mark of these agendas or the argument as we speak in a car about ... ... what our race what are we had a strategy or the other just put together the match a Bible in that\nOh well the race when we get you know national politics that stuff has been filtered out and we just already been silo than to a party with the Democratic party\nSo if you just think work as a black vote and it just got word matters which is a black economic\nYou need to start making the black economy proved the black vote locally\nActually because we're still in minority in that yet but we can at least control a state or region if we organize our money you know at the grassroots where we try to organize our politics in our vote\nAnd that book and if you want but if you want to work at the home and got to start their\nButts there's this for you in the primary or run into that money is politics politics is money you can have one without the other literally first the political science class we teach it opposes the question of I just didn't look when\nHow and why so it'd be like if you try to have you tried to control the economy your own community knew somebody zones your businesses out of existence when there's nothing you can do about ... outdoor every year on that they can't they can't\nThey can't longest spending Robert we have and we have to acknowledge him now that can get around those owning I mean we\nDon't give you a perfect example you'll be a perfect example during the Nineteen fifties\nOr black people from working prove their own economies in the early ... everything we can produce\nOn a basic level of what Eisenhower did put a highway through most of the black communities around the country most of the interstate highway system if you look under them are old growth black community so you don't control the power that you can't stop them from putting a highway through your neighborhood so no amount of collective spinning could deal with your mother is not being met up until\n\nAll right well come back no WFL community calling for nine two seven zero three guys know if you were anywhere around downtown Atlanta last week\nThe whole downtown was shut down because of pride was in town and I said I feel like we ever do pride every weekend I Know there's a there's pride in October there's than the Labor Day pride there's like a black pride a midget pride about Georgia yeah there's there's a bunch of pride\nUm in every one of them you'll see the governor candidate come out the mayoral candidate city council all the business people their their corporate sponsorship\nMeanwhile you go to Jim taint the garbage day you ain't got nothing you got one lady during a fish fry it in the corner and that's about it\nAnd I'm trying to figure out how they have so much ability to influence public policy and want such an important and big events are joining me now the Mars styles an hour every two of our ... plus friends are you guys doing all\nSo you know with the with the um the the ... first of all let it does have a million prize to be able to be exact I Will say three maybe four\nI Know there's two black price says the Labor Day weekend MLK weekend which I Know with segregating black and white pride which is a problem number one and then we have the white pride which is the one that we just did that has the parade the only one with the parade in every single city has is is white pride oh\nI think the reason I'm personally is just just because I mean Atlanta is the gay capital of the cells\nI mean that's the last like I'm In every way we should we were just going to celebrate in party while we have all the government officials I don't know I mean because I mean it's predominantly Atlanta and under the gig in a place but look\nLike a plane that to me how to like Lance of all the cities in the south becomes just kind of the gay capital gay mecca where everyone just kind of have to be a ... I couldn't go to make I mean to me\nIt's a major city I mean you're not come and go into making to try to make it big and just to name out there and you know like there's a lot of personality I mean than Lana than making on who they are and\nIt's the Hollywood like that yeah it's ... it's ... it's literally the one of the biggest cities in the south I mean you can't live anywhere Miami Miami's not as big as the land I mean it is literally this is that this is the south city\nBut what so and that's what was interesting to me why people think you come to Atlanta to make it a meanwhile most folks come here with NO PLAN or idea and they end up you know\nI'm living in swat somewhere trying to get by versus their hopes and dreams and aspirations before they ought to be like a ... on was summarize for all my people on the other acronyms we're going to summarize the LDP Kew\nWas a liberal or late or many of us going to leave it right there are we going to pass that what so what what why was that land to feel like it's such an accepting place\nWhere there is not the stigma that you will get before the ... places in the south\nI like again like I say is I think is a bigger city by being by having so much diversity and eat it it's just more of an open mind to kind of places everywhere else in the south there's literally one mind frame one culture typically when once you move to a place\nEither you're gonna have to fit in or you or you're going to be excluded and that is one of those places where it's just it's diverse it you can have your own mind because everybody is from everywhere is literally the melting pot of the south\nWell you know it's interesting because a lot\nAnd it's one of those places where it's just it's diverse it you can have your own mind because everybody is from everywhere is literally the melting pot of the south well\nYou know it's interesting because a lot of people feel that the LDP T. Q. community has surpassed the black community as far as power and political influence\nThat you you know politicians have no problem tear down a black neighborhood or you know the sayings on saying or doing things that are discriminatory derogatory towards the black community but they would not dare trans grass\nThe gay community around me and when they had the eagle raid maybe a decade ago and the whole city shut down when the police officers raided the the American Eagle a gay bar nightclub or wherever we call it\nBut meanwhile we'll have re play that all the time on the black side of town and nobody says anything why won't how have they been able to gangs so much power influence so quickly\nOr the thing about it as ... and and I and I hate to just strictly go with race but\nIf if if if if the gay community was just black\nI'm sure it has the same influence you know what I mean because we had a the the um I'm just going to go ahead and take Caucasian or people that are more influence wheel in the community that that's just what we get is more power in it I mean like I said back to the whole pride things black pride there's two there's the Labor Day and as an American in Atlanta\nThey don't get as much recognition they don't even have a parade they literally shut down the city for what's considered white pride we have a whole parade there's there's all these sponsored events and all this stuff is because the the majority the white power is is involved\nSo you're saying there's just as much intersection of racism in the gay community as there isn't the straight community\nThat the ... every single city every every every major city that has a pride has white pride what's considered white pride in actually is white pride is not call by price just call a gay pride is Dan Black friday is called black pride every single major cities segregation still exists a hundred percent in the gay community\nSo into our mindset except there was there anything\nYou know because it seems like whenever something happens for the gay community but folks are expected to get on line and be part of that and fight for their rights when something happens in the black community or in the black gay community are using some of these rich white gay guys riding in and their mini Coopers to try to help us so why is that ... was there nothing done about that\nBecause they can get away with ignoring something like that\nI mean I think in the gay community when the gay community gets\nAttacked as far as black and you just coming to the rescue I mean there are white game as well being involved as well so they need to speak up and something needs to be done to deal with the black community I mean white man see something I mean the black community not going to say anything because they can\nGet away with it I mean honestly I mean ... I mean of course they don't have the out is actually the straight guy he's ... he's straight [laughter] so for me\nLike I mean I I'm I'm the gay guy in the room and and and I've been to a lot of different states and cities and being involved with the gay community it's and I don't see where\nA lot of um white people really get involved with the um black ... I I I think it's the exact same issue is two different wars is the straight um it's the straight black and white war and is it and it's the gay white black and white war\n... ... and so on on that point a or a ... or not the big too deeply ... when it comes down to the line when it comes down to you have an issue between the black community and the gay community where would you find yourself a form your alliance came down by ... we bought the fight we bought the rumble you're picking side with us\nThe black community and the gay community where would you find yourself a form your alliance came down by ... we bought the fight we bought the rumble you're picking a Saudi you pick up\nThis this is my thing and I think this is where I'm black it's always been the before the whole black that the movement and and and I'm just going to choose a black in general for me I feel like I'm just I'm just a peacemaker you know I I basically to gay and gay\nAnd black ... as as as a people obviously want I mean I'm I'm On both sides\nBut when it came to pick one one or the other the rumble about to go down you pick one does not want to speak because I'm both okay we'll go and talk more about this after break off we're going to go to the phone call and for for a Jew to seven zero three news and talk Thirteen eighty W. A. okay\nWhat's the name of the movement to go over to when I listened\nTo the best stuff too much true for dared Bozeman this is a pre recorded show so please hold all phone calls and remember that only the truth will set you free on news talk radio Thirteen eighty W A L\nK recently I spent time with a group of young people who are hearing impaired and death [noise]\nThis is Johnny Erickson taught us and I like to pass on some tips on how you can reach out to people who are deaf first talk directly to the deaf person and not to the sign language interpreter second it's adept person speak and you don't understand don't pretend that you know what he said instead\nKim to repeat his Caitlin poor write it down third careful not to cover your face many deaf friends we live partially on lip reading in order to understand what you're saying also don't talk too fast\nPatient even if it takes a while to converse and lastly don't yell sometimes people even yell at those of us in wheelchairs and that can be embarrassing but most importantly jump back away don't be shy\nIsn't just some deaths etiquette chips for you and there's more at disability campaign dot org\nThere it was in my business suit all dressed up just uptight as I could possibly be\nAnd I don't remember much of what was said at that first day meeting was more the feeling of the meeting itself\nThat's what has kept me going I Know it works and I see the people had any with more sobriety I see how happy they are\nAnd I want that I Want that to\nWhat I noticed about a is it sort of helps me to relax and learn to really be happy with my sobriety it's a richer life to live that's exactly\nWhat Alcoholics Anonymous does\nIt teaches us how to live without drinking\nIt teaches us how to have fun and really enjoy life without drink\nThis program is giving me the good life\nThe only good life I've ever known\nI so okay so for me and I and I can't just say it's in Atlanta because I mean\nHonestly it's just in the United states and and you can be open you could just be you could be free but I you know what I call the um DL man is a coward you know what I mean it's just it's like you know you don't you don't you you you so you still scared about what people think about you when you free and you you who you are\nUnder Moser lately yeah you know they just do you why why do you care about with somebody else thing but\nThe thing is in Atlanta since there's no benefit to being in the closet single you get more benefit from being an openly gay man in Atlanta than being a straight\nMan behind it I Can't say that because you know a lot of gay guys still have this whole straight man fantasy kind of thing and this this this this thing this status so a guy that's in the cloud that it's just more appealing I I I Can't explain\nWhy are they break that down summer we meet you lost me lazy\n[laughter] okay so I like get again and I think it goes back to like\nI'm wanting to be out wants to be free want it to just just like your home girls in like high school middle school grade school whatever they're free to say oh my God this guy so hot I meant to him we didn't have that privilege 'cause a lot of people don't come out until later on ... and ... like in like maybe college\nSo when they get to like the college years and they find is the guy who fits the exact same description as the guy in the past who is not like the gay guy\nYou know what I'm saying it's it's just like oh my God now that this fast is exactly what I Want to fulfill\nThis has got weird that Lacey\nI'm just letting ya know me and makes you happier observing I hadn't I Know\nThose girls I Know those girls they want them in\nI Want to fulfill this has got we're in it Lacey I'm just letting ya now me lazy I'd hear a blurb and I had I known those girls and all those girls they want the men [laughter]\nOr a question back on policy wise\nThe gay community so cohesive on political issues while the black community so fractured well it seems like you're going to set an issue set an agenda and everybody's on it just like when they said we need to have gay marriage\nEvery gay personal just all that's exactly what we're doing that's the main thing we're working on right now you'll just wrote that through all the way to you got it done so why is it that community can be so cohesive\nBut black votes you ... you said an agenda item and you've got folks will you got to convince half the people that there is a problem then half once you've convinced you may have to convince them how the problem gets solved then you have to explain to people that it needs to be solved in the first place so\nHow's it going to set an agenda in the yard like meetings there's like a leadership council they're like an email chain or something where everybody gets the messaging\nNo okay so here's the thing like I said will the gay community is a lot more powerful in the black community when it comes to getting stuff done because\nWe're bigger group because I mean it it's it's not it's not limited to suggest a race is literally a lot like if it's all coaches in all races put together and white people just powerful I mean I I I keep going back to my people that look at the whole Caitlyn Jenner thing\nThat a black woman come out let 'em let let Wesley Snipes\nSome out and say I'm transitioning into not the most ... you know let let him come out and transition he would have been criticized he would have had the hardest time became engine came out of the euro and they gave her the courage award Estes put on the cover of magazines woman or the year you know what I mean\nSo basically you're saying that it's that alliance with white gays that makes the gay community so strong\nI Believe it because I mean every we meet like when I go out to like like gay spots like in every city again\nWhite clubs ... totally different from black close I mean it's just it's it's just a whole it's just a whole nother thing it's just it's just it's the community is bigger from the white\nPerspective the black perspective just looked like the ghetto the ghetto clubs to get the get the ghetto gay clubs the ones where you go and they say in a way I Do know so Easter I worry about getting stabbed and Rob you know what I mean\nOkay so we saw on the on the note things that for people in the LDP T.

I ended up that or do you feel like they are questioning you or they are and grass yeah no and\nThat that's exactly what they're doing but again like I decided to maintain some sort of a situation\nOr and so the more how do you you know ... during the break you know and recalled Welby I Am delivery boy who went before the church and said no I gave him more um delivered and now he's run around with like a girlfriend or something like that so the camp somebody be delivered from homosexuality\nYou know what I Would say this I'm growing up growing up in a church or in a saint the fat home with a glorified mother I um I just I just feel like you know\nI'm One of the believers that\nYou're born gay you know what I mean so if you can be delivered I mean I I think some people think it's a psychological thing some people can like they can be um uh I I don't know I mean some people like\nThey can be change some people think that they can they can change what what the answer maybe become more sexually active with women or something I don't know for me I'd never been an insecure and ... you know I I Am I'm Glad I've always been gay proud I knew I was born gay and I was just I'm going to go with the slow\nYou know what I mean so kind of person to be delivered to answer your question possibly but I think that you would definitely have to be interested in doing so and\nSo this is a a a question another Internet question before we go to go back to the phone lines so if\nIf the if all it is that the sexual preference of central desire was there a whole community in life so I was the thing that that will preference to find you so\nFor example if I say I'm attracted to dark skinned women versus being a threat to the light skinned women that doesn't have any effect in my life deeper than the color of person that I'm attracted to but things that when someone has attracted or have a preference for men\nThan their voice changes the way they dress change they socialize with changes it becomes a integral part of their identity as opposed to just simply being what you have a preference for ... why\nIs that you know I Wish I Wish I had an exact answer for that I Would give you my opinion so based off just my experience with being a gay guy I Would I ... at an early age I knew that I was attracted to the guy so I Would say it's an age of four years or the other side of the guys so I Would relate to\nWhat else I knew was the fact that the guys which is females so I'll become more more just\nI felt like they were more related you know what I mean because we we have that in common so I I Do pick up starting a characteristic from there because this is what in my mind at that time guys one you know what I mean that they're interested in the females so so I'm I'm picking up more traits to become more desirable maybe that has something to do with him ...\nAre going back to it from us we're going to go to Sylvester online for Sylvester\nHer [noise] hey hello Yes sir how are you [noise] I'm good man I asked this question I make is calling in on the political thing but I noticed over the years I'm fifty two years and I noticed over the years that in order for Apple male black male\nThey try to blend into corporate America he had to eat him in that ... to a degree so I Want to know from these guys perspective or do they think that the lifestyle is somewhat social engineering\nOr it's just organically gay\n... that's that's a good question and so what what do you think about the the more the idea that uh because it's something I got told 'em all school\nAh we're starting to do sucking your interviews and the one of the older ... ah when the older black attorneys who came back and said well we do these interviews you've got to take the based out of your voice and he got inflate also what do you wear a size Thirteen productive you fit into an eleven because sometimes big black feet can intimidate interviewers is harder for you to get a job\nOh what do you wear a size Thirteen ... if you fit into an eleven because sometimes ... feet can intimidate interviewers is harder for you to get a job do you feel that more men are just choosing to become gay\nBecause it helps you in corporate America as we said there is no disadvantage in Atlanta to being openly gay or frankly there's a bunch of advantages to think more men are choosing that lifestyle are being more open to that lifestyle because of the benefits to the courts\nWhile I don't believe that a person chooses began I'm I just don't believe that at all like I said I'm an advocate of you're born this way if you are choosing your just sexually confused and you're going to go back to what you're naturally desire some point\nUh so I I I just don't I don't agree with that but um\nMy perception of what he was saying is like having some kind of modify yourself for corporate America I'm like for me I Would when I'm when I'm going to an interview I'm not cleaning out you know what I mean I'm not coming in there with my legs crossing ... needs job you know what I mean I I'm going to come in and I'm going to give you\nMy more masculine more desirable a procession because that's what's going to be the job is unfortunate that I have to do that but you know what that worked there answer questions Sylvester\n... well not really because he contradicted himself in the last comment then he said you know he said that he's reverted themselves to fit into corporate America so why would somebody else reversed himself and the opposite direction to do the same pay\nIn so let me throw up groups so our oh you are in the more you're ... I wouldn't say interesting\nYourself to be more straight I think years has been more professional I mean it has nothing to do with me but but that's not so much of the water so you're down\nThen you're changing who you ought to become who you who they want to see\nWell same thing in the opposite direction\nI've seen is a million times any job interview I mean if if if if you if you don't speak properly I mean you you you definitely need to answer\nIs different right right they don't mean that you're not speaking I don't I didn't\nSay I didn't go in as gay I'm Still gay I mean he was with him at I just said I'm not\nLimbo in southern level actually with their yeah there there's max isn't it yeah it was a ... and that's\nAnd that's why I Believe that is part of social engineering because you are modified who you're truly are\nFit into an environment\nJust I mean we I feel like we all do a lot a lot of a in a black man it's a lot of people like to say I'm the term at white so um when when you go to interview a lot of people turn eight tiny white on I like to call it who they turn a coup known to get the job you know what I mean it's the same thing\nI don't think calling this the same thing is trying to take on a professional demeanor I think as a whole different thing I think you want to put it all in the same category but it's not in St\nLois the difference between what I was just talking about what the purpose of professional demeanor I mean coming coming in coming in a little flamboyant is just not considered in society right now I mean really that professional it it it is still frowned upon one right but what I what\nI mean thinking that you can wear the same ... anywhere you go right but when I'm not a huge\nUsing that same logic ... in a in a real masculine male with a high tone in this portion using that same logic would come in and modify himself to fit into that environment you really validate in my part but you're not see it\nWas going to spread out today a lot of it I think\nA lot of it is social engineering I'm not saying that you per se have their social lives in ... but I'm thinking that the lifestyle of homosexuality and the growth and the spray it and I'll take a lot of it is just socially engineered\nWill definitely or of just jumping in on that point a weapon Sylvester things slipping of her before which is that a lot of times these older white men who were making hiring decisions prefer hiring more feminine blackmail primarily one because they feel they're not going to be as aggressive or they're not\nBring decisions prefer hiring more feminine blackmail primarily one because they feel they're not going to be as aggressive or they're not going to be as disruptive and the company\nBut to go there less threatening whether it's true so as you said most of the main people power nailed you beat the cue community or older rich white guy so they of course going to bring it to go to a young black ... gay do so you can have them for your way later on so it is and the motivation of the culture in that it's easier to\nHire someone like that than hire somebody like Nick\nWho could come in with like a tattoo probably got a gun or to want to know those kinds of things\nThat those are those recalls of after that but [laughter] if this was rag on this day because you're you're quiet over there so you know we got we got to make sure you're still involved in the show you got to keep doing gay it makes you better production [laughter]\nOr we're going to talk more about this after the break calling for for eight nine to ... to the show we'll get your comments get your calls it will be back after the break news and talk Thirteen eighty W.

yard he's now a member of the Dallas Cowboys thanks you a number one pick offered by Stephen Jones and the cowboys on Monday it's after hours with Amy Lawrence on CBS portray yeah we've got full phone lines were going to get back to your calls your reaction\nTo both week seven in the NFL as well as\nThe Cooper train to the Dallas Cowboys and where that leaves the raiders well that's a big question\nFor band in the bay area which is why we are pleased to welcome ... men who covers the team for the bay area news group and the San jose Mercury News math thank you so much for joining us I Know it's been a busy day how big of a surprise was the move of Cooper heading to Dallas for the first round pack\nI don't think it was too big of a surprise just because you know there have been reports in rumblings the past uh probably since last Saturday right before they played the sea hawks in London that um are Cooper was on the trading block I expected him to be treated\nWhat I didn't expect is that the raiders would get a first round pick for him I think that was a far more surprising aspect of it I thought the raiders would settle for a second round or I thought a team would give a second round for Cooper just because of the flashes he's shown yes he has been inconsistent but\nUm I I think he's shown the talent to be a clear cut number one guy I was way more surprised that the cowboys fought over a first round pick a rather than just the fact that the raiders traded another three first round pick your\nRight according to Reggie McKenzie they weren't necessarily looking to move I'm already Cooper but you're saying it's not a surprise that he got traded why were you expecting this to happen\nI think regardless of you know the word tanking is obviously getting thrown around a lot of I think the raiders are tanking but I think it's more just a a clear fires rebuilt toward the future um\nOther teams and know that the raiders are in show vote because obviously they're not going anywhere this season Marshall Lynch's on I are uh they're left tackle banged up\n... obviously be people can say the raiders were unreal rebuild not from the start but sharing their best player but I think out to trade of arguably the best or fences skilled player um it it just shows aren't complete fire so a complete rebuild mode\nAnd John Gurdon is building for Vegas and I think that's why I wasn't surprised because mark Cooper is one of the more tradable guys because you can get are strong ... or him at the same time\nReaders probably weren't even got to keep him next year 'cause he was a coming up to the same situation ... faced a long term contracts mentioned in with highly consistent he's been in his career\nThe longest streak ... he's out of more of a hundred yard receivers into just two games and the past using an app he hasn't been very good so I don't think they were going to keep them anyway so I think that's what made him a country Canada\nBefore we talk about Mari specifically you talk about grew to in planning for the future and just being about the mood to Vegas and putting it together a team that will be competitive there\nBefore we talk about Mari specifically you talk about grew to in planning for the future and just being about the mood to Vegas and putting together a team that will be competitive there does that jibe with the philosophy of ownership and the front office\n[noise] I think so um where it doesn't drive is with the fan base and\nGrew and has made it and of course that's a big part\nOf his re introduction to this fan base that he was going to do everything to win win for Oakland because\nAnd I think that this is honest you know he knows how much\nThe raiders mean to the Oakland fan base he spent four years here\nAt the start of the century he knows what the Oakland fan base means it was just a couple of months ago where I was at a a fan rally at the local raiders bar in the day and he proclaimed then we're going to win now you know he said we got Derrick Johnson from the chief he said we're going to get ... back and hear their cars one hell of a quarterback so\nJohn Gurdon really cares about these Oakland fans I think that's who it's gonna hurt more this this fire sale I think management knows obviously that they're not winning now it's the long run but a ... and you just saw from the locker room today you know\nIt's a hard sell to players\n... players the that says you know management and get has given up on the season and players hate that the players and the fan base I think are the are the two groups to this is going to be a really hard sell on less so management and ownership\nMatch nine men covers the raiders for the San jose Mercury News with us here after hours on CBS Sports radio to your your best ability you know what would it be able to gauge about the players and their reaction to this latest trade [noise]\nYeah so you know players aren't really going to talk about this you know Gurdon talks on Wednesday and there was another up and lock room on Wednesday so we'll see if there's more on that\nPlayers ... I Would I take by them not talking is you know they just don't want to express their disapproval you know John Feliciano who started that left guard for the raiders last week tweeted a a a medium I Believe it was it Will Smith in an empty living room just looking around like why is nobody else\nYou're I think it's layers are taken aback by in week seven yes the raiders are one in five of players that we have that optimism up\nYou know we can turn this thing Renee that aren't really the the raiders next four opponents are terrible the cold forty niners and cardinals so they probably have some optimism they can still turn this thing around make a lake pushing a\nIn a lackadaisical AFC but Gurdon and Reggie McKenzie making these moves just tells the players we don't think we can win with the people we have in this locker room right now so I think there's a little bit of a\nDisconnect there right now I don't I I wouldn't say Greece has lost a locked room but I also think there's a sense of who's next these players are like well if we go back and get treated ... Hooper can get traded I might be the next one to go and I think that that makes guys a little uneasy and that locker\nMatch Nyman covers the raiders and the San jose Mercury News on Monday with a big trade I'm Ari Cooper and Reggie McKenzie said to get a first round or from the Dallas Cowboys was too good to pass up Dr ours here on CBS Sports radio\nCooper definitely has struggled a and ... and ... a lot of people would point to the issues with your car in general the off and what do you see when you see that relationship\nI think it's a combination of things you know last year I'm Cooper was one of two receivers in the NFL along with does Bryant to have a drop parade of over twelve percent so I think the drops really hurt Cooper\nUh last year along with some nagging injuries you had a concussion yet ankle injury leave yet a hamstring so nagging injuries and the drops for what hurt Cooper last year so I Would say it's a little bit of bad luck with the injuries\nAnkle injury leave yet a hamstring so nagging injuries and the drops for what hurt Cooper last year so I Would say it's a little bit of bad luck with the injuries drops on him this year I think it's a it's a combination of ... and not calling enough plays would present a primary option it's dark car not looking Cooper's way enough it's\nYou know Cooper not getting open enough I think this year it's a little bit more of a combination like uh when they play the charters two weeks ago there were place after that game where Cooper who's\nOne of the least outspoken guys in that locker room uh went over to a car and grew and on the sidelines that hey guys I was ... you know that's very unlike the mark Cooper to do in a mark Cooper these last couple of weeks has started to at least the U.S media say you know\nI've been open you know it's not on me and dark car obviously gives the perspective of you know it's not always what you see on the surface it's not always Cooper is not the option we're going gym but obviously there's more layers to play if Cooper doesn't get the ball and then grew in and says you know we're calling plays were not calling someplace we probably need to call them more so\nA bit of a jumbled explanation for each of the three of them but I think this year it's definitely way more of a combination of ... car and they're rather than just on Cooper\nWell let's talk about Darren ... I've heard from a lot of raiders fan since we have a an affiliate in the bay area than the raiders need to move on from him is the franchise QB I Know he signed a big extension but he's got fewer touchdowns than he does have turnovers and and the all ... while he goes well in spurts\nUm you know it doesn't seem to be able to put together a full game and and sometimes you don't know if it's coming or go in and if so how precarious for me you know what how solid in cars position as the starting quarterback or the quarterback of the future for the raiders\nThat's one of ... three one two Ninety nine Seventy when Hurricane Florence struck the east coast the world turned upside down especially for children who suffer in unimaginable ways and save the children is there to meet their unique needs\nEven now save the children is in the Carolinas making sure hurt and frighten children impacted by Hurricane Florence get the help they need\nTo care for and protect children has been the mission of save the children for nearly a hundred years so when tragedies like Hurricane Florence strike they're prepared and they're on the ground for children and their families around the world and right here at home\nWhen you partner would save the children you can send love and care and essential for children and families including baby wipes cribs toys and books learn more at W.

quite to the midway point of the NFL season but let's take the NFC North for example the Vikings and the Packers are at the top of that division the Vikings\nFor two and one because of course they talk with the Packers what was that we can number two that they tied a and then the Packers are three two and one and they're in there by week this week\nThe lions are three and three the bears are three and three so there isn't a team below five hundred in the NFC North\nHow about the end of the south the falcons have pulled themselves to three and four\nSo there are only a half game back of the bucks they are going into thereby week\nTechnically only two and a half games back of the states who have won five consecutive games really the only division that has got a great disparity between the number one team and the second place team is the NFC West with Iran that seven to know\nAnd the sea hawks at three and three the next team down and of course the Seahawks had thereby week after the game in London even in the AFC westward the chiefs are six and one of the charges are right behind them at five and two so we've got some really cool divisional battles shaping up\nAs we're down

make the play offs and let's just say that they managed to do that and Cooper is a major reason why not only because of what he does himself but also the way he opens things up\nFor ... and and it

our CBS on Twitter and also after hours with Amy Lawrence\nOn Facebook lots going on in this morning's are too insular Tuesday question is about the lottery and how many tickets you are buying and if

I guess if no one wins it could\nIncrease there's also a Powerball jackpot later in the week so how much are you shelling out\nFor a lottery tickets on what is\nA week that we may never encounter again so again on our social media or on our phones eight five five to one to four to seven\nSo many of you have called in with your opinions about the Maori Cooper trade the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for a first round pick in my opinion it's impossible to judge that first round pick cast a much smaller\nTeeny little shadow is the cowboys extent there are things that they can go vertical if jak Prescott\nHas a target a guy who can get a jump ball down field it adds another dimension to an all sense of his little stale and conservative and to save at times if they could open things up and create more space\nFor their other receivers as well as for his equal Eliot\nIt's worse not just the first round pick but I'm already Cooper would then be worth his weight in gold\nIf the cowboys make a playoff spot let's say they win the division they have a playoff spot and potentially when a playoff game now these are all hypothetical but if they do nobody's complaining about giving up a first round pick for a wide receiver that became your top target\nThis is exactly what the cowboys are lacking they're lacking a number one guy now it's up to mark Cooper to work his tail off\nTo get back to that form and that rhythm that he had in his first two years in the NFL when he posted one thousand yard receiving seasons and was approval or twice so last year a lot of the issue was drops\nTwelve percent of the time and he was targeted he dropped the ball that was in two thousand Seventeen now in two thousand Eighteen it's a different story there have been some injuries of course but also it's it's about the the messy raiders office as much as it is about I'm Ari\nAs for the Oakland Raiders they now have three first round pegs in next springs draft and there and clear rebuild mode but according to general manager Reggie McKenzie he was absolutely not going to trade\nThe first round pegs in next springs draft and there and clear rebuild mode but according to general manager Reggie McKenzie he was absolutely not going to trade I'm already Cooper until Stephen Jones called about Monday morning and said we'll give you a first round back\nBecause he was holding out for a first round pick and finally the cowboys whether desperate whether in panic mode is some people have said or whether they just want to win now despite\nJerry Jones saying lots of teams are successful in the NFL without a number one wide receiver they decided maybe they won't be one of those teams\nSo what's your reaction a five five to one to four to seven and then again on Twitter a radio or on our Facebook page just look for the pictures\nThe falcons have now one two games in a row and they've made it pretty crowded in the end of the south I think this division is so much fun\nThe falcons are going into a ... a week now but they are the only team and the NFC South below five hundred and there are only a half game back of the buccaneers the safety of course have won five games in a row one of those being against the falcons and the Panthers\nYou know do you know somebody has to do I'm going to do with again so but they have is a different correlated they lost the game I'm Out of doing it for years you know they just want us to do but I'm not a type of guy that are out of power\nOr be accountable to the the you know about\nThe men and I wanted to put it down or anything like that you know because of the stress is known for me before the quarterback and everybody says oh seeing everybody else offers wanna move smoothly as it\nOn in life do your job no one else can tell you how to do your job and I want to win more than I care about making about me and just causing a distraction for everybody else around me and man he is damn good at his job to\nA five five to one to four to two seven what's your reaction to the Dallas Cowboys pulling off finally a trade\nFor they've been itching to pull up a trade for a while but the time it's for number one wide receiver in

famous most iconic pinch runner in all of Red Sox history it was fourteen years ago that he was on base when the red Sox snap that drought eighty six years\nA and one of the world series in two thousand and four and now of course he's the manager of the Dodgers and he feels like he's got a team that is primed and ready for what's next\nTo grow up over there but [noise] um we still like our

Dodgers are back in the world series\nFor the second consecutive year do they still haven't won since Nineteen eighty eight so in that case the red Sox are they've actually had three titles in the last Fifteen Years and are working on a fourth but Clayton says he thinks last year's experience against the Astros could be\nA not only an advantage for them but be could be a huge help to this club\nI figured that we've been there you know what I'm saying I'm for teams to get to come back after a while I sure do to one of his wife ... during the games playing the Folsom I'm coming I ...

the NFL he was a thousand yard receiver and a pro bowler and back to back seasons\nAh last year into that in the Seventeen the major issue was the drops um and so that you know ... twelve percent of the drops he was among the worst in in the NFL and drops\nThat's not necessarily been the issue this year it's just that the raiders often does a total disaster if everything it's the old line it's it's car it's you know it's just a whole bunch of different issues I don't know that you should judge Cooper based on this season um I still think that he's\nIt's it's car in ... you know it's just a whole bunch of different issues I don't know that you should judge Cooper based on this season um I still think that he's better than any deep threat or a vertical options the cowboys have and again he he had back to back thousand yard receiving seeds and the year they went twelve and ... he was a pro bowler\n... different this job would say it's exports coaching\nOkay so you're saying that's why

about that\nYou asked me\nThe corruption may get to it gets to do anyway not as deep as it is over here I guess I'm speaking of corruption oh\nForty fives approval rating is higher than former President Obama's rating was ahead of the first midterm election of his\nPresidency a new NBC Wall Street Journal poll finds forty five at forty seven percent approval among voters\nAnd Obama was at forty five percent about the same time in twenty teens and the majority of voters continues to give forty five what bombs down but he's popular among Republicans I was looking at that those polls\nOn last evening of preparing for the day and um would it look like is that\nThis country is divided in half into right it's divided straight down in the middle and it just depends on who go to the polls\n\nThat will determine who wins and what direction the country goes in from you\nOr\nAny rate forty five continues to blame Democrats for the caravan of Central American migrants headed towards the u._s.\nThat is a great forty five continues to blame Democrats for the caravan of\nCentral American migrants headed towards the U.S Mexico border at a rally in Houston last even in the president said he thinks Democrats has something to do with the thousands of Hondurans and Guatemalans fleeing the country\nOr what I Am hearing some pundits say uh is that it could be the Republicans were actually behind this great caravan heading toward the U.S\nIs not about the solution is about the issue for them and creating issues that enthused their quote base unquote\nUm those which they will press before the people are so that they might be more prone to get out and vote because they are concerned about this this threat\nOf a caravan crashing the borders of the U.S is absolutely ridiculous\nAnd then it right [noise]\nOh what else did I Want to share with you a day when it comes to\nPolling continually thinking about that Americans are more worried about drug addiction and tuition costs now\nThan they were two years ago that's according to a study out of from the Pew Research center it says the percentage of Americans who taught drug addiction was a very big problem rose from fifty six percent in twenty sixteen to sixty eight percent now\nSixty three percent of Americans are worried about the affordability of college now\nCompared to fifty two percent two years ago\nWhich means that since forty five has taken office America is more drug out and feed sees itself or the people see themselves as being left ate less able to provide a college education for their

what is it Nineteen and fought and won so all the way out of Griffin\nAnd a solid knows Ken upsides and even when we were riding through what looked like the black neighborhood several camps and and uh it started to wonder ring on yesterday about\nOh just this whole idea of\nBlack conservatism black people being conservatives an action will be voting um for or voting as Republicans\nAre yeah I understand that I'm\nBlack conservatism is a political and social movement that does exist that they're actually black people who ah\nWho refer to themselves as conservative and a and they still see themselves as black and my question is always what is it that they want to\nConserve um they\nSeem to be have bought into this whole idea of uh the good old days or\nThis kind of perverted kind of a patriotism this a commitment to capitalism\nA and the rhetoric of the free market\nAnd in tend not to to care about those who suffer and don't want to discuss a social injustice but they\nRather prefer social conservatism and so I was wondering about this group of people who see themselves as conservatives and and black people and\nI wanted to know what you think about people who are black who are Republican voters who see themselves as being\nYou know\nConservative if you will of the main thing you know maintain the main thing yes\nWe all know that what is most important is that black people vote yes but what is the deal with black people who support forty five in those endorsed by you know\n\nWho support forty five in those endorsed by you know\nI don't want us there and so I Want

I'm I'm that went down to the country now can't yeah but well you make them up on now but that's OK cool\nI don't know how making your point in my my again my my my issue I guess is is in terms of what I said about that they're the same issue that has to do with an angel relationship with God and\nNot not necessarily it has done was relationships with other humans\n[laughter] it has to do with how do you know do to bring God in on the brink God into is too muddy up the conversation this deal with those kind of this stuff has handled this oh at the level where it is we got one group of people who are benefiting\nFrom the oppression of another group of people and so they all press them\nHow they benefit from it it's real simple you know and and you were saying your position is is I hear you used that you'd like to join with them and that you are joining with them in their effort to oppress black people\nNo that's not well I'm\nNot I know I didn't say that you might interpret what I'm saying that way but that's not what I'm saying again trying to get a darn what\nI'm saying is is is when you look at in terms of idea let's look at the ideology if you look at the principal espoused in the declaration of independence in this country those principles are gender neutral they are\nYour none of them were applied to black people none of them\nIn again but what what helped black people that were enslaved in this country is that work Christians an abolitionist just said hey look you said this in the declaration\nThat were enslaved in this country is there were Christians and abolitionist as said hey look you said this in the declaration of independence I don't see that happening in this\nCountry and they said I don't have a minute wait a minute what to do about that they said no I don't have to write down said I don't care and we ended up\nFighting a war over that and and some black people were freed and were able to do some of the things that they wanted to do and that we're spouse and the constitution\nOf your independence and then you have to interview him grow up then you had the reconstruction and then they put\nAll of those things Jim Crow they made that a lot of the land so at the same at when I look at that I say wow that that's that's wrong\nOr a care network actually partnered with for academic medical centers from across the country one right there in Atlanta at Emory University called the veteran\nCare network a warrior care network actually partnered with for academic medical centers from across the country one right there in Atlanta at Emory University called the veterans' program and the other one has a ... with Massachusetts General hospital in Boston ah every er at Rush University in Chicago and UCLA um health out in California\n...\nAnd so what we're doing is is that we did a three year project a pilot excuse me where we invested a hundred million for them to set up intensive outpatient programming which is a two to three week intensive outpatient program from\nFocused on post traumatic stress and traumatic brain injury our warriors are getting Seventy hours a therapy in two to three weeks and the results that we're seeing were stunning clinically significant so as a result of them and said we need to commit another hundred and sixty million over the next five years\nTo really continue this movement a veteran mental health space bringing awareness to it not only wearing his butt treatment as well\nGood so how common are the oh when are you described as invisible ... war in returning war ...\n\n... yeah so I'm close to three million brave men and women have deployed cents or a during these\nConflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan was less seventeenth plus years and coming back over five hundred thousand um had been diagnosed are suffering from post traumatic stress disorder and another three hundred plus thousand are suffering from living with the effects of traumatic brain injury oftentimes multiple traumatic brain injuries\nAnd those are the signature wars of this conflict and they're invisible\nA road in oftentimes take years to manifest in the mental health need in our veterans programs in our veteran population is great and growing and that's why we're in the arena\nI'm fighting for our wars and their families and this investment is one example of our commitment\nGo what resources are available for returning service members who do smoke about oh ... treatment and the into pro boom boom boom dummy what other resources might be available for returning service ...\n... ... and so again um while this is one aspect is the mental health a wounded warrior project and there's a number of other great organizations out there doing great wonderful things but it's important that we focus on the ... aspect of the the veterans\nAnd that is not only the mental health physical health and wellness the financial resiliency and wellness and the social connectedness and wounded warrior project has programming free all of our programs are free to our wars in their veterans are wars and the families because they have their views on the battlefield\nAnd his service to our country and we have um programming that each one of those focus areas or we can make sure we're taking care of the holistic aspect of the veterans and their families families are so critical in the successful transition of our warriors and their families become productive citizens\nAll right go to I mean we're persons can go for more information and to be supportive of of this movement that you describe\nWell doc chowder again you're a big part of that just by having us on your show talking about keeping it in the forefront of the American public I that is critical if you go to wounded

themselves\nThe optimal are possibilities are so that they could also extract resources from them in a in rich and rich themselves so\n... you know really democratic Hollywood with you on the\nPart of that of wells no I'm not saying that that's part of the Democratic agenda I'm saying this part of the larger political agenda in both Democrats and Republicans are part of that organization I'm not saying that's a good organization I'm saying is that is that is wicket and rotten but there are some\nYou know there are some people who believe that there are some countries that have derive some benefits through\nThe intervention of those guys and they were really what they are it's just like it economic hit man and they go out and they and they flipped they flip the a political a person's the persons who were in charge of government and Colorado to go along with whatever it is\nOr whatever policy they're pushing at the time you know\nYeah well that white horse emblematic of book of revelations oh whether they're you know told me with pretty much just about\nWell I mean I'm not in all of that but you know\nWell that's they they chose that are there okay white horse of your pocket [laughter] uh so I'm just you know it got me involved in all the facts to me\nAnd I said I'm just trying to figure out what the point of\nThat oh the part is that you know both sides are involved in the in the various organizations oh yeah of course and uh but I think it's it's you know I used\nTo like a guy who ... who is going to do the most damage to the black community most quickly that's the question who who's going to do the most damage because nobody nobody to be huh\nWho does most damaging all situation a lot of time the person themselves doing to themselves so when I'm speaking\nYou know you sound like a party and the\nBlack community doing most of the damage to themselves really have to just all shoots like people are jumping ship\nThey joined in the conservative movement they could to John McCain movement they joined a Hispanic movement everybody because Jeff this ship good it's like this black base of the Democratic party is like on a beach well you know if you stay in it you know you just let the parasites and ...\nAnd I would I Would I Would imagine that people who are proponents of the Democratic party would or not agree with you at all or in the law that you\nJust said and um so yeah when\nYou had the country are you a number of them are going to ... ... ... ...\nYou know on this show and I'm Glad that you did a researcher called for a for a nine to two seven zero three keep it moving on to movement this Virginia I see you come on you\nGet in line and I'm\nMr Bush and they [laughter] buddy I sit on it you know as\nMy restaurant name when when I used to go

who do some of the world through your assume Moses there but\nFor for either to who sub zero three is the number let's get back on the day we're talking about\n\nThe fact that yeah we know that all what's most important is that all black people who are over age ... and at this point registered should go and vote if you go early early make sure that you know that's most of\nWhat what is the deal with like people who support forty five and those doors right yeah I mean what are the clear way\nSo the way to dissent those behaved himself he behaved exactly like forty five he was like a carbon copy that's the ah that that's the way that they get down now\nIt's a it's it's it's a it's another form of bullying\nRight and what we're experiencing use a continuation of a black people being bullied or into submission oh and that only happens if we don't fight we don't put up the fight\nI just think that when we make a decision to do something like say we're conservative and supporter of conservative agenda that you've given up the fight you know local resistant and you just rolled in with the\nProgram you know like a couple of hundred years ago or\n... or so good at you know what about [noise]\nHey my eight year old man I'll move\nUp go over there should've been doing it for a night game for it [laughter]\nYou know it it will make it more to get down with me and they would have been Democrats seem but that's what people don't understand how the it don't make no difference what the party which probably it is they are also they are practicing white supremacy\nRight one just practice is it in a different way there was a little more palatable for for some of us you know\nThey should have been born they should you know what sort of major combat um they're benefiting from the the um our actions but they they they want to speak I guess the accent ... yes I think it's\nGotten a guy named Peter ... you're talking about if you if you are if you followed him when he first came on the scene and he used to be on those shows I mean do was raggedy man suit didn't match you know what I mean a jacket didn't match hell wouldn't really call them as soon as he stopped\nSoon how Jesse [laughter] scene\nAnd bought a house now you've got five hundred dollar suit and actually I mean if you you would have been seen in when you first started out making\nYour I I don't I remember I'm eight and ... and let me just say and I don't get into these kinds of conversations on me because people are you know communicate in their own way you know but it's the do really is just not the most articulate rather than men\nDo to take her [laughter] not not that the bill to just ignorant I'm telling you I didn't say that you did it but I agree [laughter] and then they\nSay there's about a a LOU LOU said that Obama wanted to um uh he is taking it was a human redistribute the wealth well Lou doesn't want her acknowledges that those who have the wealth did not get the wealth fairly right\nTherefore there's a need for the redistribution because they did not get the wealth fairly they\nWell they don't talk about the wisdom redistributed out of your in my pocket into they ... they were talking about they talk about that reduced to ... that's what I'm saying what I mean\nShe she she she loses that part and the reality of it is Obama did not introduce any law that said give black people money and don't give anybody else money suddenly out of it is for white people middle class white people and even the bigger white people benefited from one of them\nOut of here of course yeah and the first thing I did when he came into office and say they banks for that so I have to say did he took care of the rich by solar cars\nI had I had a friend called me and said that part of the topic was also a something about missed\nIt's right up to date it took care of the rich ...\nNo I had I had a friend called me and said that part of the topic was also\nA something about Mr Peterson says something about we shouldn't force and I think I heard one of your callers talk about you shouldn't make anybody do anything living there may share this with you\nThe the um and I'm going to use their their their argument mhm their argument to cap and Nick\nIs that he should stand up for the flag\nBecause people died for that flag\nOn my argument is that Chris was at I fought in the first war\nFor the freedom of America\nBlacks fought in the first war for the freedom of America blacks fought in World War one to Spanish American war whatever war they started\nWe fought in it you know because we fought in it then you don't have a right\nTo come here and create something that discriminates against blacks\nPeriod right you know what I mean you would argue we'd have a view we we did not fight for your right to discriminate and abused people understand what I'm saying I Do though and then my close to my friend also said something about the man created his own restaurant where the reality of it is whatever he created he had\nPublic and there was public access made to his restaurant right the streets they're like the water you know what I mean the police protection\nAll of those things were were put there by the public\nAnd we are part of the public taxpayer in part\nSo therefore unless the somewhere in another country for an hour and buy and sell ... I don't care if he spent every dime of his money to open a restaurant the does not have the right to discriminate in this space that black people die to create you understand what I'm saying I got in Mali and most black people\nUh uh um we're our ancestry was for the most part here before most of them came over during the Nineteen twenties and thirties anyway\nThrough you know what I mean that created the opportunity for them so they don't have a right to do and the brother said something about you shouldn't fourth antibiotic negro that's why they have laws\nNo doubt for all for you know to to seven zero three is the number my name is loaded I'll be black when I get back more than snow yesterday to for the final segment until the ...

I really don't want when not to run the I could tell you time after time again when that has worked in my face [laughter] that's just me I'm not telling you to do it that way but that's just me I don't take the high road all the time\nYou know I Know you're not telling me to do it but I'd go that route to yeah I mean I I Try to treat everyone fair but if you get in the mud I'm getting right down there which yeah you know we could just do it so you know you're giving me the business I'm gonna give you the business but\nThat's it ... out on my appreciate your call I'm a I'm a try to make them tonight which are thank you brother would love to see you okay okay so\nFor zero for you not to to seven zero three so unlike ... of Michelle Obama said when when they go low we go high\nUsually it was just she was just saying something to see the man [laughter] yeah she would just make it at a brother and um I I Know she has to say it because she's a former first lady she was the first lady at that time she has to say things like that\nBut is there any respect that comes from that like you know could somebody look at that and be like you know I respect that for them not even going that route\nYeah people who are not involved so if\nOn the sidelines you may say you're not one that was real stand up all of that person to take the high road and not respond so if you're on the sideline yeah maybe\nBut ... says you know what that was real stand up for that person to take the high road and not respond so if you're on the sideline yeah maybe you say you know where that was real stand up but if you're in the battle what are you going to respect if you're in a battle Julian\nWhere you're going to respect if you're in the battle or a good fight that is\nSo when you were in the Democratic party and you are you said you were the chief obvious\nYeah so I was the lobby is also the political director and chief strategist she tried to just know how much dirt would you necessarily go looking for for your political everything\nLike there was no holds barred it was a long way to rap battle yeah the only restriction I have personally and I try to make sure permeated in the culture of the state Democratic Party at the time\nWas uh children were completely off limits so if they had a child who has some issues with law enforcement I didn't care about any of that showed off limits or your spouse was completely fair\nGame everything your mom and dad are completely fair game wow yeah that's ... that's the nature of the business\nWe understand what nationalism movements are about we get it we know we are America\nThis is your new normal\nFor zero for eight nine to two seven zero three\n\nFour zero for eight nine to two seven\nZero three nationalism can also be described as an ideology based on the premise that the individuals loyalty and devotion to their nation over here are raise surpasses vat of other groups\nAround them nationalism\nFor zero for eight nine to two seven zero three that gets you right here today for zero for eight nine to two seven zero three\nAt least he said it\nThey should not be a debate any longer and here's what's interesting if somebody stands up from the Democratic party and said there are socialist\nOr somebody belongs to any type of communist friendly political outfit Republicans were destroyed fail oh there are social but you know was socialism is how is socialism or Tommy evil\nHow does that become evil\nSocialism is the exact opposite of nationalism but if you are deemed a socialist people will interpret that as you make something evil and that they themselves painting or give you the definition of it\n\nBut now that Trump has embraced nationalism the crowd rolls while\nSocialism is a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production distribution and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole that socialism\nLet me take that step further community benefit agreements in our local cities around the state\nOf forms of socialized government understand that those agreements are not purely capitalistic no democratic but rather social we engage in socialized government everyday but if\nAny politician stood up and said they were social lives these same Republicans were crucified them if a politician was cutting that they take any comment is fairly group they would crucify him but no nationalism they rule our nationalism is not democracy\nUnderstand the hypocrisy here\nFounding fathers of this nation founded a form of democracy albeit not pure demise\nUnderstand the hypocrisy here\nThe founding fathers of this nation founded a form of democracy albeit not pure democracy but a form of democracy a form of democracy that fed voting actually counts now as the country mature word I use that word loosely\nAs the country mature word that aspect of voting expanded to include black men to include men that did not own property to include women it expanded\n\nThis was not founded as a national in this country it was it now here's another question where Republicans start changing their moral compass again again to say well really this ... this country was founded on nationalistic principles\nThis country was founded based on the tenets of nationalism well Republicans start saying that rewriting history in order to fit\nThis president because those same Republicans\nHave been telling you for decades in this modern era that we are a democracy that we are a nation of the people by the people for the people that's what we are\nThat's what we are but their president said no\nI'm not a Republican I'm not a Democrat\nI'm not an independent I'm not a socialist I'm not a communist but I Am a nationalist\nThey were waiting for that moment that's the moment they were waiting for\nThat sealed the deal\nFor zero for a non through to seven zero three I got more of the other side we got a lot more of the other side would say you for zero for eight nine to two seven zero three you're getting real the real is man on radio news atop Thirteen eighty W.

two seven zero three I in the studio and say we fought with the New Georgia project Irish and\nHow are you enter and I said thank you for having me they could always being here so we're talking about ballot initiatives in the state of Georgia it will be on your ballot for this election cycle it will be something you should chime in on so we've gone over couple what else we got\nA okay so amendment three and ... and we can talk about how\nHaving friends and the legislature really has an impact on you know what you're able to do and the amount of money that people are able to make and save it\nBy doing work with ah the faith so um let me take the moment to tell people that um all of this information that you ... with you today can be found in the New Georgia project at a\nSo if you go to the ice in store or if you go to the Google place door\nAnd search New Georgia project I'm we break down\nOf the constitutional amendments all of the state wide referenda and all of this special elections that are happening just in your jurisdiction so when you put in your address what's going to show up on my ap if not the same as what's going to show up on your app because we live in different prices\nIs people who have\nForests land pay so if you own land and it's your house is on it you pay a certain amount and property taxes on land taxes\nUm but if you have um\nForest land and you use it to grow timber to grow would they pay a completely separate\nAmount of taxes than people who own homes and they want to extend 'em and make it a constitutional amendment for them to have a reduction in the amount that they pay in taxes\nFor people for so for people who own forest land and commercial\nBetter so de la ...\nWe are considering\nMaking a constitutional amendment absolutely so rich people who own\nForest land mhm mhm and tear down trees ... can\nPay a lower tax bill yeah wow yeah wow just think about how the that is the George a constitution and sacred that right ... the constitution of Georgia who cares\nAbout these rich force on all the people in the legislature that that the power exactly 'cause nobody else is saying you know what I really would like to the gym can pay lower tax right\nBut you know fend it that well the land owners pay so much money it's [laughter] this is not a thing right now it it offends me just put\nThis this is amazing to put this in the constitution which basically means you can't mess with it right exactly if you put it in the constitution is locked in you can't even mess with it anymore one hundred percent yeah our what we got what else we got okay I'm ...\nI'm basically it adds the rights of crime victims\nSue the Georgia constitution is so this is Marcy is law and it's super controversial I see your face a fear\nFactor because I've been watching a Kelsey grammar and everybody do commercials about business draws on my first of all of you you're not even from here please go back to wherever you came from somebody okay I'm like why you hear us for at least at least give me the decency of a person from Georgia okay Frasier\n[laughter] or go off and you're not a real doctors that are so please [laughter]\nSo yeah I'm Marci is law super popular amendment for 'em and essentially a no vote a\nSays it's a no vote does not\nConstitutionally protect crime victims rights in Georgia it does not change existing state law covering the rights of victims of the accused so basically\nUm what they're saying is that I'm currently in Georgia I'm you know if you are a victim of a crime um there are certain\nNotices that you are eligible together if you're the person who committed a crime against you is going to be up for parole et cetera you supposed to get a notice\nAnd that's by law that's by law okay and that's the current law in Georgia what ... to do is to make it a constitutional right um that you know you get notice\nEvery time they go up for parole arms or that you get an opportunity to testify et cetera um and that\nIt's not clear to me again that there is a need for this law I'm I tend to think about extreme cases I mean frequent cases without extreme cases and I can see\n'em how ah this can be used against like people explain ... for people yeah so um\nThat idea that it's a constitutionally mandated like judges makes mistakes prosecuted make a mistake dress mistaking identity um\nUm that idea that it's a constitutionally mandated like judges makes mistakes prosecutors make mistakes dress mistaking identity um\nBut people are poor people are the poverty is criminalized ... races being that criminalize the next century and so the idea that\nUm what is already a state law is elevated to a constitutional law or to a a a constitutional right means it'll be that much more difficult to change it that much more difficult to overcome it so what if we get to a place for example\nI'm ... and trying to come up with an example that's German and not ridiculous but um you know what if your conviction is overturned 'em I think that um or\n... I was trying to use marijuana example um give me a second but ultimately fundamentally I don't believe that um\nWe need to elevate the rights of victims are already protected by Georgia State law and elevating it to a constitutional right\nUm feels like I'm\nA it feels like an unnecessary move\nI Wonder what's behind it is let me tell you the here's what I Wonder when I look at an amendment like that number one I Do know that it is a law in Georgia to inform victims yet when things like this happen because\nOne of my best friends is an elected prosecutor okay and I remember there was one instance where his office I won't say his name on there but his office made a mistake\nAnd the letter did not go out and Tom the letter went out but it went out late and so the woman found out about it a little bit later that she should have and she was\nNot happy that the person was granted a bond among the bond was granted by judge had nothing to do with the prosecutors prosecutors said no bon okay okay so when that happened there was a delight and getting her the necessary letter\nInforming her the updated status okay now nothing happens you didn't get attacked there wasn't any issue like that but I remember him being really\nUpset at the person who dropped the ball ... because he said this is law right and law is not a recommendation right so I don't understand the need one is already a law right\nI think it just makes it more difficult to change when there is a constitutional amendment to the point that you made earlier that there are state statutes and there are sort of counties I drive and so having a state statutes it can be changed via the legislature um if it\nFor calculating taxes on forest land so reducing taxes for people who um our land owners specifically who own forest land who own land for timber and making it a constitutional amendment\nI'm\nAmendment for a is a constitutionally also up formally are popularly known as Murphy's law so making a ... making victims rights a constitutional rights and the state of Georgia\nAnd amendment five I'm\nAllowing the largest school district in the county to call for a tax increase to support all of the schools\nIn a county that's really interesting or I appreciate you know if you're a breakdown and what'd you got coming up\nOh man we're excited so you everybody's heard about the seniors that were kicked off the bus in Jefferson County absolutely they're coming to Atlanta on Sunday with ... or so so the post together we're gonna have also a thousand seniors and college students going to vote on Sunday and we're meeting at the IBM ...

for a company oldest elevator at that time and I was in Charlotte when that when that things happen and it was absolutely horrible horrible ...\nWell where were you were in uh the Trump thing happened which Trump thing the the nationalist you guys are nationalist now\nOh why don't you have to put a C do because you said it right because you're a ... he's the standard bearer for the party he's just he's depressed he's the standard bearer for America\nNow out of the United states of America not the standard bearer for the country yesterday as she is in fact the standard bearer for the Republican Guard right right he has now claimed that you guys are in fact nationalist how do you feel about that well you know what I\n... let me tell you the honest to goodness I I guess if that's the the the uh the money that we're using right now I've always been one who consider America First we are Americans we should take care of America First we should provide jobs for America we should be\nA security for America first instead of sending you know for example the president said uh for the uh the individuals who are marching to the United states and we're going to take we're gonna take funds from you guys the millions the hundreds of millions of dollars that we send to other countries\nIf you can't get in line with the wishes of America cut off the funding that money was shot how those hundreds of millions of dollars that we send all over the world\nThose funds can be repaid ... you know for infrastructure for the United states those funds can be used for sending kids to college those funds could be used for repairing the streets and and even just here locally in Atlanta our water systems that we're being taxed for this is Americans tax money that's going abroad let me tell you the\nProblem with your American first ideology Okay Number one he's speaking coated when he says he's a national issue because what he really means is that he's down with white nationalism that's why he prefaced it by saying I Know is a term would not supposed to use\nHe knows that that's why the crowd went wild because they understood when he admitted to\nOther people the the the Latinos in the crowd cheered the the few African Americans that you have the cameras on cheered right because the uncle Tommy oh wow wow well I Know I Know I Know my Facebook is going to be full with look\nIt's okay they offer atomic they tell them that let me tell you why I Know you don't like that let me tell you why now I don't I I'm not saying they offered timing because they're at a Trump rally ... if they cheered when Trump said he's a nationalist their Uncle Tom and let me tell you what\nDo you agree that America is really a nation within nations like there are multiple nations the side of the United states\nYes right I think so so when you say something like America First well which America you're talking about\nAre you talking about the African American or you're talking about the Latino Americans are you talking about the Haitian Americans are you talking about the white American because we we understand by way of our status by way of what what classified ads that they are different types of Americans in the United states\nSo what ... what what you're saying is there are different but once an individual chooses to pledge his or her allegiance to America we're looking for one ... ... if the goal is to have one America that's the do you pledge allegiance to the United states of America\nNow we have so many little bit like you said a little bitty pockets of like you said people come to this country and all of a sudden you're waving your flag\nI seen Haiti's Haitian flags up the Mexican flags the same things of that nature but your allegiance\nLike you said people come to this country and all of a sudden you're waving a flag I seen Haiti's Haitian flags of the Mexican flags the same things of that nature but your allegiance should be for the country should be for the place that you're living in a lot not allegiance\nAllegiances earned and not mandated if this country earned\nThat fits that\nDesign from the person if the country earned that country has earned it what countries aren't America has earned out the ... ... this is the country that you chose to be a part of you don't you don't have you on the way to you don't agree that wait a minute hold on to make sure we don't agree that\nThis country it depends on who you are in the country number one Okay Number two you didn't choose to be part of this country you will Bert into this nation and by way of birth\nYou're supposed to have all of these in ... right right so I don't have the pledge to anything as a matter of fact based on our constitution academic nouns this entire country and you still must protect minded announcement and protect my being that's what our constitution say that's what our constitution says but I don't need a pleasure to anything\n[laughter]\n[laughter] your life that thought I'd be until job I voted for you it's all good and he said he voted for me personally winter wasn't that it would have thought about what exists I don't forget to thirty\nToday rolling dot dot com make sure you too many ... dot com for zero forty not due to seven zero three we got to be part of the ... the power to look good they welcome\nHello I'm not sure if I agree with Nicole and everything with I'm I'm a sugar and grits person I was born in New Jersey so I don't remember\nWhat people are a little ... doesn't that does not surprise [laughter] ah well let me just say some of the Tea Party Louisa\nSee far Lu I I Love when you call and and I just love your fat [laughter]\nI just wonder why I Love her fact she'd be given a New Orleans where what we want to not let the party loop talk no oh darling oh my goodness the party you continue we'll call it and don't you let was shot tried to put you in a corner and you defend your argument because you do a fantastic job\nDoing all the little don't allow my facts to get into wherever your story go ahead\nPlease stand on Mitchell spectrum earlier because I agreed with him a hundred percent or whatever\nBut you know when you talk about the the migrant caravan coming and stuff like that I mean you you you think Donald Trump makes it all about race I think he's making about our country and if you go back to what other people we listened to what other people say you take the president elect of Mexico Obrador\nAnd when Jamie election and the Mexican election on June nineteenth he talked about this was a quote from him immigrants must leave their towns and find a life in the United states\nAnd it's a human right we will defend and what he did he marched is a socialist communist when everyone calling his ideas to send people to our country have them take jobs have an influence our politics and they live in California they could probably vote and\nAnd they cannot they voted they live in California a mother registering illegals and ... no ... no matter if they're not allowed to vote now\nThey they are registering them through their motor voter but anyhow they are not\n... they're they are allowing them to operate a motor vehicle legally\nPolicy position is to send people to our country just to swarm our borders to have an ... job and not keep money in our communities and reinvest it in business this year but to send it back to the next Nicole\nOkay let's lift up their lives up there with with your commentary because we need to insert some common sense here a long standing tradition of the United states of America\nOr to take in refugees in interviews along the journey migrants have said that they are fleeing watch the widespread violence poverty and corruption\nThat is something well documented that they have a that they have encountered you know which we should be able to say yes on some levels to assisting and not making it worse for these particular countries because we have a heart in addition to that part of Lou how many people are on the on this caravan\nI think it's gonna have to ten thousand but not no man and all now no male way\nYou don't even know the numbers do you but you know why you don't know the numbers because you don't care you don't see them as people so you don't bother to actually research how many people are we talking about compared to the resources of the United states of America and you don't even know\nWhen I look at our community you when you when you have people coming across the border you\nAnd we came across the border and that sticking hold on wait a minute amount you came across the border I was born here no your people came across the border\nAnd that it can hold on wait a minute amount you came across the border I was born here no your people came across the board amount my grandparents came across the border hah yes really what about their grandparents yeah you\nKnow I'm not changing anything mail that is that is relevant to the conversation oh border control how in the world do the greatest violators will border policy but come the border police themselves how does that happen\nDidn't pay type Cal five thousand dollars per person get kind of cross the border that was that you and a half billion dollars that way for the cartels along the border just last year so that he made it\nArt now don't they bought a little part of the little the party well you're you're getting very far away and I'm trying to see or hear you but you you're right in the middle of la la land and you too far away so let's do this a miserable here you know I I I I agree\nWith the United states is one who who who brings in immigrants we let individuals come here uh when devastation of the destruction and I'm fleeing violence but Russia there what Thirteen\nEleven to any people say it's anywhere from eleven million some people say Seventeen Thirteen Eighteen ...\nWe really don't know how many illegals are truly if we can't even control the illegal population that we have and what you said\nYou know what I thought it was no place to start on the illegal population tabulate every white person as here in America and trace their lineage back to those that violated the Native Americans and that gives you an idea of having a legal actually on a on the country on the country for right now\nSo I I think that he's like you said Tea Party Lew is going to live on land but you know for a little young American what what part of the party ... Native Americans ... their Native Americans\nBut let me ask you a question let me ask you a question of hold on one second to for a little wrist shot there has always been individuals who are now let me ask you this question who had to land before the do you know who had the land before the Native Americans handling\nWe never quantify land in that way historically so so let me explain that's not a simple answer I Know it's not about to cross people were indigenous of various races\nSo individuals were digits to certain races you don't know who's ... you don't know who ... you don't know who the American Indians took delaying from you don't know who that because there was always individuals that were here that individuals have taken landfall site and I I totally ... you know they know and your non Native Americans\nNative Americans did not have the same history with conquests as those who can't question them they didn't have the same history they had a respect for nature that to this day is unmatched by many cultures are owned the globe's so no that history does not fit the Native American existing\nBeing one who is has lineage as a Native American\nOkay there was no no no no no no no no no part Cherokee [laughter] first the first to see probably ... thank you for calling in because I Love when you call and I love when you defend your point yeah and I bought a little you've got you got to last point you want to make before we go\nI Try to la la land to think if people are coming here to escape violence and the people that are potentially violent are not coming along with them and what ... say that again I think if you and you're happy with the public has laid kinda\nOpposing land so you don't even agree you don't even agree with the American government here the American government agrees that there's widespread corruption in their government they agree with that so you're saying you don't agree\nI Am saying that if you have people walking across the border of ... you don't have any criminals walking across the border as hell I wrote a member acts were mixed\nI I'm saying that if you have people walking across the border of ... but also have the criminals walking across the border\nI remember I remember the proclamation his government corruption that's the proclamation and that is also a prerequisite for the refugee status government corruption or an action of governments to handle the corruption that said I Want to live with my\n... at the wrong time of year for that and they would show up for their court hearings and be legal most of them don't show how as\nNuns ruining being said that's that's all right appreciate your call that's your ... that but I Want to appreciate your top ... yeah that's a ...
