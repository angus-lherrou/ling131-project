stand awfully pick you up into two am getting into some falcons combo and some NFL here in the midnight hour in about twenty minutes we're going to hear from a Super Bowl champion good friend of mine Chris canteen he's\nOn radio in New York He's going to give us some entail on the New York giants and ultimately are are there some advantages that are falcons can take advantage of I noticed terrible radio but\nOh there's some things that we can use our vantage and ultimately come out of here with a victory on Monday Night a blackout as we have all been told and I thought the falcons video was fantastic if you haven't gone to their social media\nGo take a look at that video I liked the all black is going to look doping they are on Monday Night I'm sure I'll see many of you there we will be doing or the way forward show following through some bill due to the bill will be\nLive from Mercedes Benz and then of course that takes you up to my country as well as a Hugh Douglas arch wisdom the Atlanta Falcons radio network on Monday and then of course you need a game Monday Night right here as we ought to flagship station for our Atlanta Falcons\n[noise] let's see if it is a job as this was a topic that you are now as we were preparing for the show I find this one fascinating because you and I are former defensive players\nI'm not so much of an NFL variety however we know defense\nRight there there's a certain level of AK human that we've been blessed and fortunate to have access to and you covered his team you're in that like Rome Europe it flowered branch you're doing post game with these guys you know these\nGuys I Know a few of them um well let's just\nLet's just kind of chop about the state of the state of where we are we know that after this game Monday Night the falcons go into their by we Georgia owned by this week\n\nAnd so first let's take a look at the injury report right jobs you added up earlier Muhammad says new did not practice you're not practiced today Kevin really was upgraded to limited um and a greater\nJerry and Jerry's Shelby were limited as well today\nSo and it looks like more than likely some new might not play is Andrew maybe a little bit more serious and some were led to believe ... but the rookies still there I obviously you still have a Julio Jones\nAnd you know obviously I'm ... out until December twenty third some more than likely that removes him for the season\nYeah mom is the news got a hip costs Matt Bryan and his hamstring the two of them did not practice their Shelby bought back a while back from his growing cabin released got an ankle he was upgraded to limited today costs Grady has the ankle that we know about just about the quarterback\nBrought over free agency he was a full participant in practice today because of his ankle\nWe start there before we go in I I had this conversation with Chris and uh my boy was eleven\nBecause of his ankle can we start there before we go in I had a conversation with Chris and uh my boys eleven years start a Super Bowl champion\nAnd he's had several injuries and surgeries and\nThat's just a part of playing a game is not a matter of if you get hurt his when you know I've had reconstructed knee surgery jobs ... have you ever been seriously injured I ever heard you talk\nAbout oh you're a broken this toll on that\nI was in in college I had ... sprained ankles not the ones who just wow my ankles where it is right now but\nDefinitely I tore my PC you ...\nParts of the two of my AC of parts of the two amps yeah\nYeah the hypocenter no did in ...\nUsually I taught order yeah that sort of yeah I'm ... parts of the two of my AC a positive to my answer yeah\nAll of them when it was all happening at one here's what I find those ... oh yeah I've had\nA handful of surgeries myself a\nComplete neat right knee reconstruction and twenty excuse me in two thousand three I had to learn how to walk again two thousand for a\nUm bro\nSports hernia chronic turf toe\n... ... if it was anyway\nUm [noise]\nChris brought a point for consideration and and that's why I Want to pose is before we get into the damn queen conflicts we spent so much\nTime talking about the falcon Andrew report for good reason who's on IRR\nVolunteer Freeman having growing surgery this week in Philadelphia\nI Believe\nBut there are two things number one I'm growing concerned I don't want to say that I'm drawing uncomfortable with every time we bring up the falcons right behind it we talk about these injuries\nAnd as a former defensive player mob mentality and certainly those guys that are out there on the falcon fifty three are all better than I ever was\n\nMy mentality in life\nIs black and white because that's what defense is\n\nDefense is we either going to stop them or they're going to score points those are the only two things that can happen\nAll fits of le ... all fans can can't waste two minutes to ... sees me weighs four minutes the clout they can get on a twelve play Dr ... down there to the plus forty two and ... the football and that will be half five when they come to the sideline because office has flipped the field\nWe just need a way to get

J. and of course was the situation ... J. was on the field ... ... or so that the human torpedo and try to divert Josh\nJay and of course there was a situation where you're Jay was on the field is a huge himself as a human torpedo and try to divert Josh Norman Andrew multiple personnel file flags actually led to the NFL exact thing the new personal file injection rule\nUh but after that instinct when Tom Coughlin wasn't in power to take over their off the field and discipline them for that specific instance\nI think it is it further empowered old Dell and to the point now where people in the organization don't add in here\nAnd there is a perception that you know entire that organization's bigger than you know judge themselves\nYou introduced me to him on one occasion but you know him better than I Do obviously you there were you know around organizational regular basis who he is only deal back on them plainly\nI Will say this I think oh Dell a is typical for today's athlete and what I mean by that is an athlete that concern with being a star and athletes that that is focused on developing in his mid ... his brand and so from there I I think that\nThat's really what the issue is uh I think that oh Dallas frustrated by the office and it being stagnant not taking more shots down seals not being able to get him to football position where he can he\nCan do what he does I mean oh dealt with the special special athletes but he has had many opportunities to impact the game not like you had in his first three seasons with the giants so I think that\nThat's the part of the frustration and because of that I I think that you're starting to to see some of the\nSome of the behavioral issues that the giants had been dealing with over the course of the first couple of months of the season I'm going back to the interview that he did a couple of weeks ago with Josephine Addison with rapper Lil Wayne sitting next to him criticizing his teammates saying that they don't play with heart saying that they don't play with energy\nAnd then reiterating to the public that he brings those same things\nA week in week out basis and so when you do that when you go from the quarterback Eli Manning when you show\nA I I Am I saying disrespect toward the head coach and criticizing his play callers I think they all point into one direction which is all about to junior frustrated that he hasn't had individual success that we've known him to have in the past\nAnd the fact that the giants are one in five only costs out in the situation\nIs very rare when you think about the model franchise is of course New York giants being one of those [noise]\nThe giants and I learned from you and others the giants are very conservative one land to John mirror coming out publicly speaking on who deals antics\nWell I think that was a last resort and I'm not as sure as he was speaking to oh del as he was speaking to the giants fans\nAnd speaking to the other players in the locker room I think John merits tempted to a set a new tone for what has to be expected from a behavioral standpoint but the reality is the guys in my locker room gravitate toward older that can do is their leader and you saw\nThat from the boat trip a couple of seasons ... made the playoffs right before\nThat wild card game in Green Bay he had those guys on the officer down in Miami now there's there's no crime and that but but obviously the performance that he had in that game several drop Pakistan the shepherd several drop passes so on the eve of the biggest damage your pro football career did you decide to make that decision I mean I think that can that can give you some\nInsight into what his priorities are and I think there's priorities are not necessarily in alignment with what's in the best interest of the team and success moving forward\nStarted I think there's priorities are not necessarily in alignment with what's in the best interest of the team and success moving forward\nVoice you hear that a cruise can't form a defensive lineman NFL over a decade in the super bowl champion with the New York times on the radio ESPN or your Ninety seven or ... days during the week\n'cause you have

[laughter] say that because\nYou hear me up nearly as I say that because I don't believe the guys with a lot of old believing the law\nIf you go back and listen to all those comments after the Carolina Panthers game because he didn't regret the comments that he made in the interview that he did with Joe seat Addison ESPN and I believe that he doesn't regret those comments because he is

what they are going to do two thousand four thousand seven\nAnd then two thousand Thirteen and then uh we have a two thousand eighty now with Alex course so you had three different managers\nAlong the way so all over the board there are some different names obviously are in the early years you had to Johnny Damon you had Manny Ramirez\nYet page or your Curt Schilling now it's a completely different look with what they've been able to do and no more big Papi obviously as well as the topic was such a big name for them for so many years but\nNow the red Sox team that all sorts of the outfield and their outfield but the killer bees embed attendee and bats and also Jackie Bradley junior and he didn't have the best regular season ... down the post season this year\nHas been remarkable it's been phenomenal with what he was able to do than he was there\nA else yes envy pay but if you look at what impresses me the most Boston it's really what they've been able to do on the road in this postseason you're going up against a hundred plus when teams and the Yankees and the Houston Astros and what the Red Sox were able to do\nAgainst the Yankees and then the actress on the road to be five in oh\nAgainst to really great teams [laughter] it's just stupid good without good it is and the red socks on those five road games games three and four Yankee Stadium and then games three four

that you could have wanted so far as a baseball fan\nAnd the other series even though was short it was entertaining\nAnd I talked about this last week I wasn't really thrilled with the product of the post season the division around because for the\nIn the adult BS I wasn't really feeling the games\nYou had some quick series\nYeah the most entertaining games in the world the few of them in the court series you have a few of the games were were entertaining but Yankees Red Sox which was the big sell\nIt was disappointing to me and I get it hey I was at that game for the ale BS and one central such a bottle of fields you're thinking the Yankees are going to force the game five\nBut these games in the early rounds of division around the vision of series they just weren't that great but I knew that the ... to me I don't see as\nWould have lived up to the height and clearly in the L.

C. S. even though it was a short series\nIf there were so many storylines you could take away from that how that ends with David Price put you in the way he did which is fascinating I don't have a dog in the fight in that one with the Astros and the red Sox I did it and actually you know I picked the red Sox before the year to go to the world series\nI thought you someone's going to win the series so did I and the way Boston just quickly took advantage of them on\nWorld Series I thought you was going to win the series so did I and the way Boston just quickly took advantage of them on their home turf you spin and then what they did in New York after that series is one one Yankees win game show\nAnd they take the red Sox take care of the Yankees and the Bronx like there was nothing name a huge statement out I'll keep the same point that I've made going into the policies and the red Sox bullpen does scare me I I don't there's no shut down pieces now\nHere's my question do you guys have been good though that's my question to you what what's your fear level with ... because I think if the brewers lab gang through their book they have two guys and they're hoping that are just so a lot of things that kimbro bounces back you have to think that just with what he's been about his career but to get back home and he's been this way so career\nBut to get back to your price question though because I think it's just more of an interesting question\nWhat price I Can't say I'm overly confident with him going into the world series\nBut maybe that's the breakthrough game that doesn't mean he's a dominant postseason picture but it starts to turn it around and the floodgates just get open for him or he has the a ha moment now I Know what it takes and the starting role now my team\nThe

to Arkansas though we welcome Bobby ... show on CBS Sports radio what's up Bobby\n... doing great go ahead\nI out I mean their answer your question game seven I think I'm taking the brewers are just too much ... and the Dodgers I don't think there are bats are consistent enough to win it\nAnd that same thing with the world series of brewers just pull fights pose a different threat compared to the Dodgers the Dodgers do have bigger bat but when it comes to consistency I just don't think the Dodgers could do it against the red Sox especially with their bullpen\nAnd you know the brewers to give it up against the red Sox is what you're saying\nI I think the brewers have a better chance um with the consistency with their bats and they're both pit\nBull pen is depicting the bullpen you me I mean that when you were a series of ... and also ... now\nNow I wouldn't pick against the red Sox just goes with the red Sox did the first two rounds it's just it's remarkable to me but I I Would have to go the bullpen is what is the real enticing option with the brewers right just looked at Dodgers their experience they were there last year\nAnd it's the team that they add Machado where if he's not spiking guys at first base\nThat's the biggest problem for them but really he this is let's say either one of the team that when I'm not saying there's no chance they can\nBut I don't feel great pick in either of these teams but I Would just go with the Dodgers just because they're to me as a team that's been there they've done it before at least getting to the world series and if you get to the world series twice in a row hey yeah you could lose both of them\nUh there's no doubt about it but maybe this one will go your way\nNo that's true but then again the brewers also has Kate and stopped us who've been there\nYeah room strip point he's with the royals it better to\nBronze has been in the league for a long time pay a show in there to not in the world series but he's been in the playoffs so it's not like the brewers are just ... it would be that are going into it you know what I mean you\nKnow not just totally fair this though this game coming up later tonight like you were saying\nAnd and if you look at this match up I lean I it's a toss up at scoring flipped his game seven we laugh when I leave towards the brewers because of what happened the night before where what they got to the bullpen and they still have hater and hate or did not go in the game and so he could go for for three innings\nAnd an haters I mean that guy's nasty everyone knows he's he's nasty nobody I mean he's on hit of all for it to watch yeah they ... him and what game for five\nBut it was he's he's one of these pictures that like he just does not get hit very often this brewers bullpen reminds me of that royals bullpen that made it to the world series\nWhich are three starts yes\nThat's a good point Bobby appreciate the phone call so we'll see who wins the game but the most compelling thing to me going into this game seven is not even the two stars it's one of the fate or get into the game and when is Kurdish I'll get into the game\nAnd how long do they go and can anyone get to them\nWhat I think will decide this game seven we go to Chris in ...\nAnd how long do they go and can anyone get to them\nAnd that's what I think will decide this game seven we go to Chris in Boston next on CBS Sports radio what's up Chris\nSame Zach I'm hey I'm the red Sox outfield\nBut I think was a not underrated at all I think it was well spoken for but um\nI think they're set up quite well for National League ballparks um especially with their speed and the town although that's going to be tested with ... you know in the in the world series\nUm also the red Sox I think the more that they play the less of the um crap their pants factors that goes into some of these players like price who just you know just\nPure panic attack on them or they can just see it ... I'm just hoping that some of these guys just you know the\nBig one without all down a little bit yeah temporal I had to think he would bounce back by man he's looked terrible he's nervous on the mound it is a cause for concern but just with the way that he's been as a pitcher throughout his career you had to think of ... just like with price a bench leads to punch through right\nRight right and as a question for you and then there's two different ways of looking at it but who do things better for baseball um the red Sox versus a big market team like LA or is it a smaller market teams like like Boston and Minnesota are giving more hope to ah you know town so\nYeah I Would always go with the two big markets with Boston in LA I think that for baseball they would rather see that but with the brewers if if you get the brewers tremendous store 'cause the bird was going to the world series you for the year ... you want somebody plants like yeah I Would have listened to it but\nTo go to the world series before the started no one had the Bruins going to the world series\nRight right and I'm Alex Cora he never took his foot off the gas constantly on the attack never waited for things that happen totally came out people um the the the Yankees and the Astros were always\nThinking about bad mood that core has made so far in this postseason I really wanted to move I [laughter] what did you say I Want to go to Vegas [laughter] sit\nDown at the blackjack table give you some when there's no doubt about it there's no doubt about that and he seems like you said in every single one in the right way and Alex core he's done a really remarkable job\nYou go to the Yankees did this you know the extra hundred games have you told me before the year the New York Yankees or to a hundred games ever said no they when the police\nRecalls Red Sox wouldn't want to wait you got a tip your captors someone when they're able to do that and to the caller's first point about the outfield everyone knew bats was\nAnd if you didn't have a better time he was going in this era shame on you by now you know who ... and Jackie Bradley junior\nNot a good ... during the regular season but big hit in a game too with the three R B eyes and neither grand slam as well sketch just been an R B machine and the post season now so the killer bees have been phenomenal but then yes\nI Am now ... recording artist access and athletes against on grass as a pro racer my life's all about extreme\nDrinking and driving that one is deadly combination and the next few minutes in a drunk driver somewhere is going to call the rent and maybe we'll kill someone you don't let it to you or someone that you know because friends don't let friends ride boxing public service unless it's run by the U.S department of transportation read the national association of broadcasters and the [noise]\nThe same stadium will be the first Super Bowl fifty three February third twenty Nineteen [noise]\n... ... if you'd like to me it would be the one radio dot com\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n...

Sports radio veep and be a season is gone\nRight here on CBS Sports radio the NBA season is underway and it got me thinking\nAbout some big storylines entering this season now [noise]\nI Know if you're listening in your car right now or on serious or on the ad for whatever you may be saying that Higgs\nStorylines or the NBA they share come on\nWe all know what the story's going to be the Golden State warriors are going to win the championship\nAgain and they they want to lash out at one of the year before that they have Cady they have staff they have clay ... by the way even though he's hurt right now\nAdded a bogus cousins the markets muggy cousins and the off season ... why the hype up the NBA going into this year\nI'll tell you why even though I don't have a great interest for early on right now just because you are football fully underway with the NFL and college you also got the M O B. postseason\nYeah no doubt about the NBA and hockey to me take a little bit\nOf a seat on on the back burner right now they do but but the NBA the off season always dominate and there was a lot of juicy story lines this off season that yes it does make you raise a few\nYou know may make you raise both your eyebrows Hussein okay even though you think the warriors are going to win the championship this year there's still some storylines and that was proved true last year everyone can talk about\nAnd I remember this for years like oh we need to see a little bit different chains you know this and that and that's not in the products\nBoring it's so predictable so Ron ... wherever\nThe warriors have but you know what last year's rent you see in well it's a good regular season so yes the warriors will win the championship this year barring something crazy but there's still a laborer the MBA to have a good season there is\n'cause you could have some really good storylines entering the post season or some good storylines that developed throughout\nThe regular season so let's get some of the storylines right now let's start with the apprehension Golden State warriors who by the way what might spend on a temp and and it wasn't staff there wasn't clay it must take day it was it was a remarkable was to tip and with ... who\nWas the plan at the tip and you\nCould say it on the air go ... go thank you it was we were watching the news room ... which is oh my goodness gracious crazy a tipping and it wasn't one of the big players are goals that war is that the way that you would've designed it up for for it to happen but let's start Golden State warriors\nYou just wonder when that teen turns it up is it going to be a year where they go for Seventy something wins or is it going to be one of those years of their okay we'll get in sixty two sixty three sixty four sixty five\nYou just wonder when they turn it off but when they go all out for it and also you have\nCagey with depending free agency already got some news going in on that\nWith his brother and everything and and all and all that craziness and the speculation that this could be his last year was the Golden State warriors which I Believe it when I said I'm not going to start to speculate on that but it is something that you look at and we all know how much the MBA all seasons as dominant so you could ever get too much\nNBL season talk even this time of the year the next from the Bronx in LA\nNow brought it out why what's intriguing to me is I don't think that's a team but the ... they have right now that wins the brown a championship I don't\nAnd I think there was a better alternative than our way to go to for LeBron James\nThere are so they have right now that wins the brown a championship I don't and I think there was a better alternative than LA to go to for LeBron James if he wanted to one another championship as soon as possible but you have a Braun was a lot of younger players right now ... ball who's ma\nHeart et cetera et cetera et cetera\nYou just want to see that dynamic does she out throughout the year now and the west the two teams that are clearly better right at the top of your head the golden ... words they use the rocket

Golden State does a lecture they like to play that all up tempo style so that's why I see the Celtics when the season I just named Golden State comes up short\nLast hey how's it going out on a limb there because everyone's going to the Golden State and I'm not going to be the person to pick against Golden State I'm just not going to do it\nAnd I think they will get the one seed this year I Know they didn't have it last year but I think they will make that a little bit of a a point of emphasis put even if they don't want no one in the west is beaten on and that for the Lakers as you mentioned the Lakers but the thing is I'm really curious with the Lakers\nWhen you know just thinking about a little bit more how young players a matched with LeBron and also at Brown is in the final seconds of the game and likes to pass up the shot what you've done before you seem to make a few big shots but when you pass up the shot the ball knock it down\nDoes a cruise but knock down the shot does a Ingram knocked down a shot\nYou just want to see how the younger players now and we know they played on big stages before but with every game paying a bigger stage when you have the brawn James\nHow that does a play out as well and the first year ... in Georgia next on CBS Sports radio hey what's going on in the trunk\nOr rather than doing great go ahead my man\nHey that story or if there's here says look we're on the west and currently I'm looking at say not exactly what have you watched scar takes a whole other eastern conference this year you know you got a call\nAnd tell you the truth that rather than I think this is this is a ... year for the great for you\nIn the play offs it's time for the great Britain to put up a shutter\nYeah it will be interesting to see what will happen now Milwaukee I was\nYou know [laughter] they were at the end of last year that was said in a little bit\nOr you know at the end of the rings I remember seeing them play in Philadelphia right before the end but really what the the ether competent admiral inspiring effort in Philadelphia but really in the eastern conference it comes down to three teams in my opinion it's the Celtics\nIt's the rafters and then it's the Sixers and if if you're going to ask me who's gonna win it\nI I gotta go Boston right now 'cause like we were talking about what the last caller\nThere scorned up their coach and this is a team that took the bronze to game seven last year and\nThey were without quarter hey were they were doubt Kyrie Irving\nNow they get those two players back we have to see how they perform dealing with the help and all that but I Would like to go to Boston\nE. phones\nCome home\nDoes your water stained and damage your fixtures does it smell or taste bad are you worried about what's in your water water quality should not be painful and worrisome get hydro care water systems from way home solutions with the most advanced purification technologies\nCoal wave homes illusions today at one eight eight eight nine seven three wave or go to best water now dot com\nHydro care will eliminate lame scale because it's hundreds of dollars in damage to pipes and appliances without using sold well water will no longer smell or staying your fixtures city water will be purified of harmful chlorine led arsenic and chemicals\nWave home solutions provides the cleanest healthiest water at every faucet satisfaction guaranteed\nFor more information call one eight eight eight nine seven three wave one eight eight eight nine seven three W.

mortgage lender Quicken Loans uh fly simply understand fully and make sure you always mortgage confidently what a thriller was last weekend in Fox borrow between\nThe New England patriots in Kansas City chiefs the patch take a twenty four to nine lead into happy for the cheap to make a comeback and half number two but then the patriots prevail at the end led by Tom Brady Rob green county and also the kicker and seeming discount skew gets when at the end to fall through\nForty three to forty the patch take down the Kansas City chiefs undefeated no more for Casey the patch coming up on Sunday and the Chicago Bears one PM eastern in the windy city let's walk them in the starting Center for the New England patriots also a team captain and that's David Andrews David ... thanks for the time how are ya\nThat I'm doing great how are you\nWhat I'm doing great and we appreciate your coming on that was one heck of a victory last weekend just how about the roller coaster ride of emotions that you went through in that one\n[noise] you know the great came when oh there are some good situational football you're playing that game and uh you know it came down their right to the end and um yeah we were able to execute\nI saw Tom Brady at the end was saying that he believes this off ... could be even better how do you guys get better we always know bill signs away Josh finds a way and Tom finds a way how do you look to get better after putting up forty three on the streets\nYeah you know what I mean there's always things can improve on you know I mean we had to turn over so you never want to do that or something we can ... um you know and especially I often find with can always improve our past butting around barking and uh you know even try to get it better than it is\nAnd I'll tell you I think the biggest difference from the wanting to start where now you're able to put three in a row together is obviously you get some teammates back in some new players into the fold but really the patriots have been able to run the football the alliance dominating and you're able to run the football it's a lot of success\nYeah you know we've just been putting in work and um you know each week got coming in working harder every practice you know going out there and are trying to prove and really bought it and um you know hopefully we can keep that turn roll\nIt has to be tough for a rookie to come in right away and have success in New England just with all the pressure and the dominance they've had over the years Sony Michel though after the first few games was hearing it from the fans but ever since he's\nReally been rolling in these last three just what is impressed you the most with a former college teammate of yours out of Georgia and Sony Michel\nYeah you know I got to see him come in as a freshman at Georgia or same thing the great work a work ethic I'm really doesn't say much just tons of then he'll put the work and then uh you know he's been off and the bar or\nAnd we know there's two big sayings in Fox borrow it ignored the noise and do your job just how was Sony Michel been able to do his job so far and also how was he able to ignore the noise when he got some criticism early on in the season\nYou know what I mean there's just told me up and down the hill and the NFL and a week a week you know a year to year whatever it is and uh yeah so I think he's learned from valuable lessons early and ah and you just gotta keep going out each week can keep improving improving and now you'll see the fruits of labor\nTalking to David Andrews right now patriots starting center and a team captain you were in two thousand and Fifteen and drafted free agent you walked in and you ended up winning the battle in a starting from the patch right away and you had to look back\nCaptain and you were in two thousand and Fifteen and on drafted free agent you walked in and you ended up winning the battle in\nA starting from the patch right away and you had to look back ever since just what is that like walking into New England where all they've done is one and you have Brady imbalance jak just two giants in the annals of NFL history what did that like when you're walking as a rookie to Fox bar\n[laughter] [noise] you know it was definitely a challenge it was on I was you know up for and I wanted to be a part of the best and you know there's been no\nBetter organization over the last you know Twenty years in the NFL and uh you know I was fortunate enough to make the football team and contribute and um [noise] yeah but to me that you know I think it's been tough but at the same time it's been easier expectations are clear a you know you know what you're supposed to do and how you do it you just got to go there and execute it\nIs it at all intimidating [noise] uh\nI'm a I guess you'd say it's intimidating I think um yeah but at the end of the day is just football as what you've been doing for however long you been playing and I'm at the end of the day just got to go out there and play you know do what you know what to do\nWhat do you remember about your first interaction with Tom Brady a first interact you actually knew my name which ah [laughter] ah [laughter]\nYeah I mean you know going into a sixteen Fifteen year I don't know what it was exactly now to know and I'm drafted book you know God probably all shocked like football to\nName the first time it's all they are definitely not a lot and you know made me a little bit more comfortable\nObviously you're a professional and you're respected being there for a few years and now being a team captain did you call your family once when you got home that first time he didn't Tom and just say Tom Brady knew who I was like losing one of those moments\nI don't know 'cause I probably mess up now\nLater practice [laughter] probably overshadows that moment\nThough are probably more concerned with that than you know actually meeting him\nBut what's it like when you have the bad snap and practice the time or what his bill like when it's time like when that happens\n[noise] honestly I guess\nI'm more concerned with Tom than bill uh yeah I mean bill is definitely going to let you have it but at the end of the day you know Tom guy you're working with back there and um\nYou know ... my ... year at times a\nA gotta feel each other out and learn you know what he likes and how you operate things like that so it was definitely a little bit of a challenge but uh you know with a guy who's been\nDoing it for you no longer than you've been playing football I guess you you do it he says\nDon't go to David ages right down CBS Sports radio so we talked about the success of the wrong game you look at the fence overall you guys have been role in the last three weeks what else did change with this team after not wanting to start\n[noise] no I I think\nWe just try to come in age we can improve you know if we're gonna know wanted to or when whatever or you just got ... coming in each week even proven throughout the year\nHe practicing your fundamental um [noise]\nYou know we weren't playing good enough but that's the bottom line and um you know you know when you had to really kind of worse off than you know so we got to pick up the slack and do better and I'm the only guy I've bought and uh you know when we responded well and um I just got to keep doing that\nAlso helps when you're able to add Julian Edelman coming off the suspension and then a bill makes a trade to bring in Josh Gordon just how about the importance um jewels and also Josh born with a mental disability\nYeah you know and then a great in right um yeah for the for years I've been here ... he's a heck of a competitor and a great ballplayer so you know getting him back you know it's always good to get ill when\nYears I've been here ... he's a heck of a competitor and he's a great ballplayer so you know getting him back you know it's always good to get you know what are your teammates back and you know God has done a great job or a no we've had a great school guys that you know we just got to give them a chance that can make or is\nIt seems like there's a lot of respect in that locker room all ready for Josh scored it seems like there's some good synergy between him and and the teammates you could see in a few weeks ago when he got the touchdown up against the colds and how you guys celebrate it as a group and uh you know change them high fives there\nYeah you know just in a great teammate I'm now to me and everyone here and I'm no and it's always great you know and the guy comes in like that you go to the ...\nYou know and then when all that hard work humiliate the touchdown every one that you know\nI'll tell you as well because obviously Adelman and Gordon they're going to be the people that a lot of people talked about nationally but let's show some lumped the old line I'll lose in nature soldier it was going to be a a big

eight and the college football season so it's time to play a little bit in the college football season what's it to be\n[noise]\nAll right let's get a gun and we've got three games for you\nThis first game I don't feel great about it\nIt's Michigan at Michigan State\nThe Spartans coming off the victory in happy valley last weekend Michigan at home and just completely took care of what counts and then I was very impressed by Michigan team as we know that season started with going down in South bend\nAgainst Notre Dame and it was the opposite looking terrible horrible ... when the big game and last week they find a way to continue their win streak and they clearly take care of Wisconsin Michigan the better football team\nBut a seven point spread is very big in Michigan Michigan State game [noise]\nSo you think your point the point you take Michigan State at home and your ... and Michigan will probably still win the game that's what\nWould be the easy pick that's what I Would lean towards\nBut man something with this much you get off the fence and the way they're playing right now doesn't make me feel great importance in the seven points\nI think this is a close game most of the way a field goal game that Michigan's leading but at the end they get a late touchdown Michigan goes on to win the game\nAnd roll what did Ali I Will take Michigan lay in the seven point don't love it could go either way but I'll just go\nAmos and roll what did we I Will take Michigan lay in the seven point don't love it could go either way but I'll just go with the hot hot tea and right now and that's Michigan laying the seven ... what you got you know Mia Love\nTaking the easy way out so I'm taking the Spartans a so history you know it's been on the side of the Spartans here in the last uh\nIt's not a joke at your work ethic just wonder Amy easy fix it could be a joke but I Am I thinking of it [laughter] so history has\nBeen on the spartan side in this in this match up their ten and won against the spread in the last eleven meetings including five and I went home and get spread against Michigan that's a Big Jim a horrible games you know how those usually go Spartans\nOkay what are you got for McCain in ... so how many of these big time lenses Jim horrible really has in a college listen\nHe's been Austin here in Michigan it's been awesome to share but in a rivalry game like this the home teams getting seven point\nThat's a lot of point a lot a lot of points that song at Michigan State fucking seven points\nNot necessarily to win the Michigan may come out like by a slight number but Michigan state's gonna keep him close that door when I first looked at it I said it seems too good to be true in a rivalry it's good to be true that is what scares me about this war and nobody but you can walk around as rowing\nWas that again you can lock your pick and you can walk out or isn't as much I don't know what the Michigan lining the stuff that you you're still in Port I Hope I don't get up here I'll put you in your place you'll never work here again I'm just not [noise]\nWhen that makes a pick locks it and make the pack them just said this is a difficult one to lock it a week she my kid man go look at it like see\nLike a little a little dog get murdered at the corner to contain himself from breaking I count that much here trying to jump in and steps on things and some of my role for laughs at\nThe bar ball would sail writes gave number two by the way how do you think that would go by what the management and said I never want my kid again they probably look at me and say we're paying them like six bucks an hour or so because\nThey'd be like a loop [laughter] they'd like you don't want who they'd be like the guy that yells at worst a Yankee hat on Rican the brewers have the next week we don't know we don't know who that is\nAll right let's go game number two all burned at old men\nAll burned me who I Am four points off and it's been such a disappointment this year especially if they started off here taking down Washington gets black as black could be over the last few weeks but here's some numbers ... spirits within Seventy six point one yard for getting us Monday third in the country they're deep and\n... [noise] they don't show the CBS towards radio so we made our facts on Michigan State Michigan author an old men and Oregon and Washington state\nWhat just look at some other storylines not juicy as you would expect\nFor a college football week that's happens from time to time but you never know what could happen and what moves could happen inside the top twenty five in last week it was absolutely crazy with it was four teams going down in the top ten\nAnd this is the college football season that you never know how it's going to play out but\nAlabama still the team to me that I don't see how am I wouldn't pick them to go out but it that way\nAnd I don't know who is going to take them down this upcoming season not impossible but the way that it goes right now extremely extremely tough so here's your new laws top ten\nWas last week you have four teams go down at Fort teams that went down to the top ten three what out of the top ten one state and that of course was Georgia a Penn State that of course fought Washington did fall out\nAnd West Virginia default watching some Thirteen I should be West Virginia now Thirteen washing now Fifteen at Penn State goes down to a tea so your new top ten Alabama won Ohio State to come to three Notre Dame for LSU by Michigan six Texas Seven Georgia eight\nOklahoma nine and you see at ten so the right ten teams are in the top ten if you want to complain about the order you could do that I'm sure if you're UCF bend you're going to be saying well we were ten last week we should have went up but\nAt ten so the right ten teams are in the top ten if you want to complain about the order you could do that I'm sure if you're UCF bend you're going to be saying well we were ten last week we should have went up but you know that you're not going to get the respect their Oklahoma nine I think is right Georgia falling to eight I don't know if there are several other teams better than Georgia in college football but\nFinally had a a a ... attack last week a tough task and LSU just spanked ya I had a few\nTaxes going up to seven the way the season started off protect us losing to Maryland no one would have seen that one common Michigan and going to have you ever told me after they Michigan will be sex I would've said probably not LSU at five how else\nYou may lose too you know that they lose they lose the game\nTo Florida and the swamp after\nAlready happened impressive wins against Miami in Auburn they lose to Florida twenty seven through Nineteen and then they bounce back and only bounce back they just roll\nOver Georgia I wanted to get my twenty points Notre Dame set for here's the thing we know today whether you believe in Notre Dame or not\nTheir senator now\nIf Notre Dame runs the table are going to get into college football playoff whether you like that or not\nAnd their schedules woman five games or mating and they just survive pet last weekend Nineteen forty navy northwestern Florida State Syracuse USC they win the next five games doesn't matter if they're all by one point\nOr girl by twenty points they are going to college football playoff if they were on the table that's the biggest concern they do play NC State later today that game though is that clumps and it's a thirty six team match up\nA spread was like Seventeen Seventeen and a half points it's a big number but you come sit at home I don't know what to make an NC State I don't\nKnow respect to them for being the sixteenth given they shouldn't be in five and all but are you going to the games come to that game are you I'm not and a big tests are already been for them was West Virginia and she said to get more film what they would have been was canceled earlier this year\nSo the Windsor NC State this year is James Madison twenty four thirty they'd be Georgia State the Panthers forty one to seven West Virginia game cancelled they beat Marshall they beat Virginia the b._b._c.\nNot playing the best teams there this is their\nFirst big test their life they test of the year they have ... because after they play Syracuse which give credit to you know babies are nice job this year Florida State Wake Forest Louisville UNC any CEO so not to kill a schedule but they could send a big statement today they go into confidence find a way to pull off the victory\nNow Mississippi State LSU this is the battle of what Mississippi State team's going to show up\nI it's been tough to get a read on Mississippi State for this year and then my Dallas you you would expect them to keep this thing rolling right\nYou lose the Florida then you're bounce back and you get the victory against Georgia you you would you intend to pay than the cheapest thing rolling but may be and I don't expect this when you have a twenty second team in the country coming in one of these cells you players look ahead\nTo what's next on the scheduled out there somebody ask I don't think they will but this is a Mississippi State team they made over and twenty thirty nine they lose the farthest Thirteen to fix it looks Kentucky twenty seven I'm Still trying to figure out what team on the seesaw\nMississippi State team they've all been twenty foot and on the news the farthest Thirteen to fix it looks Kentucky twenty seven I'm Still trying to figure out what team on the seesaw from Mississippi state's gonna show up to the team more like a Florida in Kentucky or the team that took care of all ... who is a pretender was not as good as people thought they were\nSo let's see um is to be said a few plays out I Would lean towards LSU getting the victory though just because anytime you think she's not going to win one this year they find them in it when when the when and when when convincingly and it's a nice little American athletic conference match up but I'm not just saying this because I went to Temple University but Cincinnati undefeated\nAnd you get a temple team that is starting to surge temple\nLet me ask you this much Ian let's see how good of a gambling guy you are because uber claimed to be like the best gambling guy there is and you make all this money and and all that stuff and McCain shakes aside 'cause you can never play along with the joker have any fun let's get a little personality McKee inherit trying to make yeah\nI'm a little more entertaining you understand that correct shore okay you didn't like the joke that you just think they're pretty good the bad in college\nWhere I think I'm going to ... I'm not I'm not no change after dark but I'm going to be some better\nYes Cincinnati at temple where do you think the line is on the skin Cincinnati undefeated there I think it was like twenty it's in the country\nI Would say Cincinnati is favored by six and a half points wrong\nWow the temple apples are favored or three points favor\nWhy is that jak I I have to ask you that I don't understand\nI don't know temple lost to Villanova this year in Buffalo they've also taken down Maryland and the other ones are Tulsa ECU and navy\nAnd it's not like they have some impossible home field advantage that we know vi don't bits homecoming and it's been a link is great but I had a cat which will be in the house oh okay so now that that definitely couples right I mean they should be a ten point favorite at that point [laughter]\n... ... s a Cincinnati yeah they should be fair but I saw that line I said if I was betting on this one which I won't be I Would say I'd plus the three points with since they are\nBy what\nI Would have thought they would have been a four point favorite yeah it's about right I'd say at first I just thought I was reading the line Ron I thought I thought 'cause the blind is three three point do you think OK yeah Cincinnati and then I saw temple report favorite this'll\nBe the game you see and you're like oh now I got to throw money on the line that great and then when the ...\nWhich would be great fight fight fight for the church and the way it would be very happy yeah sure whatever he said I'd be extremely happy jumping up and down the temple gets the when the protests quite\nThe jury and the way you could tell what I was an announcer that and not someone that was the pep scot doing that you don't want to see me from people\nUp in the air and and say let's go ten boat you wouldn't want to see the man there's another dead girl great\nAll [laughter] I have to go there for ... you were leading it there so I just don't get their ... throw somewhat up in the garage or next broken oh no\nI I think I'd be able to catch the person with my brave you better hope I don't think I'd be able to get the cheerleader on the palm of my head I was going to do that that was just it let's just say you're dropper\nYou got a problem you know what I'm saying is true yeah broadcasting didn't work out I Would not be a ... you would not okay [laughter] I think\nI'd be a drunk student in the uh in the stands\nGoing [laughter] as opposed to a drunk broadcaster and me and the precedent if you were drunk\nOr you know it'd be in a better position that there's somebody up and here I don't think so maybe you never know [laughter] I mean you get hidden talents when you drink would you ever be achieved\nBeing a better position that there was somebody up in the air at all so maybe you never know you get hidden talents when you drink would you ever be a cheerleader or several look at me\n[laughter] I Would have money [laughter] like I Want to do that ... one of the skin tight shirt sleeves joined the jets flight crew [laughter] how many uh ... what school did you go to Manhattan Manhattan but what's their mascot jasper's the jasper's [laughter]\nThat'd be great it was certainly think I'm doing that no school color green green light green white\nYourself on the green and white I tell you I respect them for the guys that do that I I'm actually from there was someone in the temple ... wrong then\nOh it's ridiculous how ... I always wonder how do you keep the girl's sport in the palm of your hand and looked or above your head it's\nRidiculous it's crazy absolutely crazy alright final one Alabama versus a tendency\nUm I didn't know until uh until I talked to the media\n[laughter] [laughter] that's a great dog it emerged in Davis right now CBS more radio you know stranger to playing with Alex Smith in chemistry does it take a little bit of time to rebuild the backup or is that something that's always there\nI think it was something that was always there um you have to play with him for so long in San Francisco is one of those things you know we had an opportunity to reconnect and once we became familiar with each other um it was like hey we we really miss a beat\n'em I'm Still I'm Still I'm a understand this guy and yeah I Know how he throws the ball I Know when when he's going to let it go he's a lot of data that they get the ball out quickly you have to be cognizant of that and I'm always on alert\nWhat was that like for you obviously you know and Alex for a long time by you guys are getting comfortable with Kirk and we know ... was on a year to year deal in was probably on his way out and then you're scrambling for quarterback and you're from wind up with dialects mess of how 'bout that\nWell for me it was surreal because I you know like I said before I started out with Alex back in two thousand and six\nThat can happen and joined Washington Redskins I'm like a it's it's really like a dream come true um I wouldn't trade it for anything and\nHaving him in and watching here and have have success over the years is truly a a great to watch as well and now our here together same locker room thinking and are are ready to play football when they're\nWhen you look at your team this year you guys have been up and down your when one week then you lose the next and it just is like a seesaw going back and forth what do you think this team can accomplish is your what are the Washington Redskins\nWere so young but were talented we have a bunch of great guys on this team as a ... and I'm Talking as people and its players so\nTo us we just have to stay together and make sure the camaraderie there and ah continue to work together to be a team players one and always hold each other accountable because uh you you know how to end the team atmosphere team setting you have to\nBe able to rely on that next man and and trust that they'll always have your back and come through for you so as we can tell you to move forward we must make sure that we have those key components are in line or before we can even take a step further\nYou know what it's like to take those steps further adds a professional how do you try to encourage those teammates and what are you trying to teach some of the younger teammates on how to do with the right way in the NFL\nOr just a a some guy's a verbal some guy like apple but most importantly to actually speak louder than words you want to make sure you're always\nI'm aware\nBecause you never know who was watching and if you're if you're leading if you're a good leader and you're doing the right thing at all times than those young guys want to see that they're going to follow um even when you think they're not so are the biggest thing is just a leading by leading by example in a like a sure your accent\nAre always in compliance with or what you say\nFor you and you look back at your career and especially in early on you had the Singletary moment where you choose you out in front of the media are you also had some early injuries to get off to the start of your career picked early in the first round just for you and what was that turning point\nIn front of the media you also had some early injuries to get off to the start of your career and picked early in the first round just for you what was that turning point in your career where everything started cooking for you and the NFL both on and off the field\nFor like the that after that I had with coke Singletary when he said because of the locker room that was the moment the Cadillac me to be more of a lead it more of a team team player and I'm just turning my career around in general\nAnd it goes back to just doing the right thing like I said earlier\nIf you do the right thing you you treat everyone the way you want to be treated with respect and honesty then you have nothing to worry about and just take it one day at a time\nNow we look so much in the social media climate if a coach is critical the planet ends up right on Twitter and everyone sees it so sometimes coaches are careful with what they said to the media\nKnowing how sensitive some players maybe you don't want to lose the player and a young age how did you deal with the the single Terry criticism because I don't know if we would see that I now a days as we did a few years ago when he did ya\n[noise] um I don't I because I knew was coming from a good place he just\nHe said when he said and I didn't I didn't take it to heart I just used it as good and I learned from it not only that I learned from it uh\nI I looked at it as a as a as a positive and so many ways and once I start to understand what he was doing and why it it\nIt helps it helped me helped me to just move will move forward and and a good way and that's why I say at that moment I I grew up with a clear it was a man\nAnd every moment every moment I look back on that time and he caught me out and that because the locker room I cherish it because if it wasn't for that time I wouldn't be who I Am today\nMartin Davis is my guest right now and the ... show on CBS Sports radio getting back to the office and I've been really impressed with Adrian Peterson and we know he's a hall of fame running back but it's been a few years since he's been dominant you knew he was going to have a good year but you're wondering how good he\nWould be and he's playing hurt right now in a big way with the dislocated shoulders just how about the effort Adrian Peterson is given you right now\nHe's um I'm I'm I'm not surprised because I Know I Know his work ethic I Know what he's done in his career\nOr to get to where he is today so when I see them out there fighting for pain battling working extremely hard he's one of those guys they easily as the difference make it easier for us to go out there and when and how how this team or become successful\nYou're thirty four now and you've been planning this leaks in two thousand and six so a lot of wear and tear on NFL body how do you take care of your body now a little bit differently and then what you did earlier on in your career Vernon\nI Try to think of is that if you deliver it to the craft and taking care of your body that's the big if that's the biggest uh I think that's the biggest\nThat's the biggest key when it comes to longevity and I tried to kill a lot of the young guys start now because when you try to play catch up later on\nYou're in trouble you know ... ... so if you start now with the fact of the week than the ... factor at least once a week you will be okay but you have to continue the carry those things over to the coffee also found that a lot of guys\nDot their routine when the off season hit can't do that you have to pay this type of thing and and treated as ...\nYou look back and I hear your being that veterans voice like we're talking about learning\nHey there's no type of thing and and treat it as a as if it's a business\nWhen you look back and I hear your being that veterans voice like we're talking about with Vernon Davis right now and CBS Sports radio but when you look back to your days in San Francisco who was one of those veterans voices that you really had a good connection with some good synergy went that time to show you the right way and the national football league\nA guy like Brian Jennings Bryant Young uh Larry island go understanding [noise] um for Gore or he was there he rather hear the for me but he was a veteran I mean he was always a pro\nStill it and take my head off to him and I respect it on a hand because uh uh I don't know if it had been through there hasn't been approached the game so I I lean on boats guy to to really show me that way or\nThey were the quintessential leaders you need\nAnd a lot wrong in order to make a team go I'm ... and it's easy to have those kind of ... so I you know I I I had goes off those guys were showing me the way and showed me the boat\nAnd whenever you play in the NFL like you have for so long you're going to encounter some really good teammates but then when you get to the opposition just that your position or when you played Tony Gonzales\nOr outside Antonio Gates and then later on ground comes into the league Travis Kelsey just how about the development through the years of the tight end position and how many great titans are on National Football league\nOh it's so it's often to see that there's so many great titans in the late right now are you gonna run kind of it you have a Kelsey a and not to forget Jordan read who\nHe's got an incredible athletes I mean the I mean the game as if you fall in so many areas especially when it comes to that position or you think guys who are who who can who can really get the ball in the hands and and run after the cat\nA guy who can be take the corner so awesome just to see a hotel where it's going to be about ten Fifteen Years ago but\nUm it's it's a good deal good deal and I mean delayed it could be a part of um just such a a good class of a guy this people an athlete\nI burn let's get to the Dallas Cowboys that come on in Sunday for twenty five pm eastern everyone talks about the cowboys often with the development of jak Prescott and also see Kelly and put that defense continue not to get the credit that it deserves just how about the challenges the cowboys present to you guys defensively\nOh this game is going definitely definitely going to be a challenge foresee every week is going to be a challenge because if we're not prepared mentally or physically then we're going to lose this game but the biggest I think that after like the biggest thing is just being prepared and that's because\nIf you believe you can do something then you will achieve it and if we all believe together and we're on the same page we're going to be successful no matter what but\nPretty you know and again\nRick and John midday which too young for your kid to go in their first date and your son is how old are cars swelled the oldest is ... okay and he did what he wanted to

A. C. H. G. E. L. be coming up been about thirty five minutes we play a game that we do each and every Saturday morning on sides all sides ... still has the task today\nI was asking me five questions in the sports world them we'll see what side of the fence I Do lie on why beyond sides with the question or while I disagree it'd be off sides\nWith the question but before we get to that we got to take a phone calls to we also have to talk about the exciting time in the ... be\nPostseason now with the Arabs see as that's already in the books as the sea ice was surprising\nAs the Boston Red Sox to split the first two games one to use them and we know the red Sox won a hundred and they gave this year and use them and one of the story I would've never predicted going back to use that that the Boston Red Sox\nWould have took all three games were taken all three games\nIn used you just want to start with the ashes line up and what they're pitching too and I know now to base banged up but you just would have thought they would have at least one one game and use them to send it back to Boston but that wasn't the case at Boston's outfield was spectacular\nIn the series with Ben attendee making big catch up to big catch especially to catch that he made in game for I thought it was very fitting that he caught the final out in game five\n... bat shows why he's one of the best players in baseball and Jackie Bradley every year in the postseason you have someone that did not have a good regular season that has a massive moment or moments in the post season and Jackie Brown the junior has done that\nThe three are ... and came to the to them runs after that one of them being a grand slam anyone's the AOL cs MVP so Boston's going back to the world series for the fourth time since two thousand and four\nAnd look at the way that they have done it put aside the one that we would put aside what they've done in the regular season\nBut when you look at the post season they had the Yankees won a hundred games than the Astros who won one of three they go to Yankees stadium when games three and four they go to minute maid park they win games three four and five\nSo they're five at all on the road in the postseason out scoring the Yankees and the Astros\nForty third in\nRemarkable incredible\nAnd then also against the Astros in five games from the sixth inning and on when you look to dominate the baseball game the red Sox did that Fifteen seven they're scored strokes so congratulations to Boston they are going to the world series David Price even pitches well in the culture and the al ... or just in Berlin\nWhich would have ever seen that one coming\nAnd also who would have seen the red Sox taken all three and used it to David Price finally gets the job done as a starter in a post season game and dominant\nNow you get to the other series the I don't see how it will come to a closed tonight hopefully it's not an ... game of it you know and as a talk show host I wouldn't mind that but if you're a fan and the viewer\nYes it will come to a closed tonight hopefully it's not an ... game of it you know and as a talk show host I wouldn't mind that but if you're a fan of the viewer\nYeah you don't want to stay up for a nine hour game and some of these postseason games have been way too long and fortunately I don't have to complain about sort time because they have to go to work the next day but\nIf you're someone had to go to work back there have young kids with some of these games that have played out yeah it's difficult especially when you get some really good games\nAre like that and I'll see a game for or the end all cs Thirteen ending a fair before Ballenger had to walk off\nYou just start to think how many of the younger generation are watching this Amazon working are actually watching this and there's been some good postseason games in the championship series but last night we had a game six between the Berbers and the Dodgers\nDodgers one went away going into last night\nFrom going back to the world series and back to back years they're still one went away but now it's the final game\nOf the season for one of these teams and the Dodgers and the brewers as the brewers get a victory and if you're a brewery starting to be honest with yourself after freeze Mr game six hits home run on the first step out of the game\nThe way the Dodgers employers tonight in Milwaukee\nOne team will be to their tickets to face the red socks [noise]\nAs that World Series I Believe with starts Tuesday for sale on the mound for the Boston Red Sox\nIf I ask you both right now the other side of the glass herself though and\nMake him red socks or the field depending on who comes out of the ... now take the red Sox run out of when the world series\nYeah I I have to what they did just plain too well in your opinion who gives a better chance to take down Boston ... up LA I Want to see my I Want us to Milwaukee get it done but it's Los Angeles and then the more talented team\nI think baseball would rather see LA hearts handle rounds oxide if that gets ... no they don't they don't want the Milwaukee\nBrewers are a better story of course the brewers are much better stare a great story and I would love to see them get their first champions you'd think the Dodgers have a better chance to take down the ... what's the reasoning behind that you would think because an experience a big thing but you would think because of the brewers bullpen that condense is the game and gives them a better\nShot I I Do think the red Sox face a challenge in going into a National League park having to develop their lap because you're going to lose ... Bradley junior hottest hitter has added a line up which is really tough for them\nBut yeah but he felt better attendees still have a brand new jihadi editor\nBats got Bradley here hottest hitter you knew him and your light up and I think I just think\nHere's the problem I think Milwaukee has a good chance against Boston is Christian yellowish gets going crushing debt which I'd like to hitch in this series and this is going from a guy who was nationally nationally ... he is planning this way so if he can get it going ... because you are now starting to get hitting a little bit\nThey have a chance in our city has been unbelievable but they need to get Yellowstone and if they somehow when this game tomorrow and yell at you still not hitting they don't stand a chance and I'm like as you\nMentioned Aguilar I Will say that is the home run early by freeze\nYou would think the crowd with a faded away but the minute Machado comes up because what happened with Aguilar out in LA the fans got back into it and then it also helps when you put up a force spot in the bottom of the first but I thought that was an interesting moment where you'd think the building would have been dead\nFor the rest of the top of the first but they were not because the child came up to the play where several yourself Boston or the field depending on who gets in from the adults yes\nI Know the red Sox have a lot of questions specifically sale specifically David Price I Want to see David Price do that again in a situation where he doesn't have concerned about sale at the hospital visit yeah I'm not I mean just look at it this way he didn't he didn't really\nYou know throw all he has really thrown a whole lot lately for whatever you know and I would love to see David Price do this with us regained cushion your life is on the line now David Price has to pitch you into you know into the promised land on you know the jury's still out for the press\nWhat that when did was it gives them some cough\nAnd get some people off his back for a minute it's all it really does\nIt opens up a little moment for him okay I could finally pitching the postseason I'm grading the regular season I could pitches a starting pitcher\nAnd so it really does it opens up a little moment for him okay I could finally pitching the post season I'm grading the regular season I could pitches a starting pitcher and the post season I can pitch very well and that could out do virtually under which he did in that game\nBut yes am I going to be putting all my shackles on David Price in a big game he has to show it to me one more time and have that opportunity to show it to him and the game too and then if you could go back to back starts then it's tough\nNot say you go all in with the guy but it's tough to down and you feel a lot better I feel good about David Price right now but I wouldn't be going all over the poker chips after just one star\nI Want to see the brewers both and have the shot to do this I Want to see them win the pennant I Want to see if they can do what they've done here basically for the last month you know kind of getting by with smoking mirrors with the pitching staff and have it work that was interesting that's what's so interesting to me here\nAnd it would be fascinating to see that brewers bullpen and go up against this Red Sox lineup which if you look at the red Sox line up\nThe killer bees in the outfield they're tremendous we know that\nWe look at the infield on paper\nGoing the or that sort of World Series infield ... and I picked him to the world series for the year started but they just have guys that produce that was a heck of a player but there's something like ... and planning to go to new yes and Bogart says Bogart but even at second base wondering if the whole night it can be can learn and then at first\nPeers out here in moral inside a good year too yes book pure ... has been extremely underrated\nIn my opinion and you get no production out of the catching the machine or Leone invest 'cause you nothing\nFor you every step of that's just a moment against the ANC yeah but they don't they don't do anything I ever for them I mean that you can get through the bottom three and a Red Sox lineup at the top six that are just relentless ... but they just produce like you've got to check your brothers you did not have a good regular season the shots why I said to you it poses the question of when they go to a nationally park how\nIt's going to be hard to take him out of all I Know you can't take bets are gay DSM oh God you know on line up Katie a Bradley junior is going to be a pinch hitter can you do anything in the in field now right equal you know move around yeah I mean you can't keep at second base no he did it for him to see what well you're not you're not moving ... exactly\nWell look at what ... did in that series against the brewers put aside the the interference call which to me it should have been a home run he went\nInto the stands but the next night similar play and I was a hundred percent going out but he robs it the guy sensational from any throwing down to second base\nThe guy is one of the more entertaining players to watch um baseball he could impact the game in so many different ways and the base paths through contact through power\nWith his glove he covers so much ranged too\nAnd that outfield bending tend to be on the other side and a lot field look what do you do that or teen assist from the outfit to share that\nGame in game for where it's back and forth\nWhat I think the bags were full makes the diving catch to prevent any ... any roads are coming across the play makes it a two run game the bet attendee\nNo fear whatsoever if he does not feel that ball cleanly it goes snowball reruns come in the red Sox lose and then there's the game six regardless of what happened to get by the way of getting sick 'cause the officers would have got one that attendee makes a tremendous catch\nOnly problem is\nCannot like one Fifteen in the morning and it stinks if you're a seven year old or an eight year old if you have school via aboard the next day luckily for me I did it actually it was going to the gym and take some interviews so I could afford to stay on the one Fifteen\nYou're old if you have schools the work the next day luckily for me I did it actually it was go to the gym and take some interviews so I could afford to stay on the one Fifteen and the same thing the other night with the game for me and she asked me the boundary walked off\nI was in my bed at the computer up I said I'm not sitting on the cell phone I go I'll I'll get the TV to the computer but at the game and they go right to sleep\nThat can hurt the brewers more because you use all your bullpen and you had the afternoon and the next day to die that can hurt the brewers\nMore to lose and also the momentum at the time the momentum was big and then the Dodgers sees the momentum with her on the mound pitching the way he did in game five but didn't look out go back home schemes sex\nAllows for sending home run didn't matter he ended up winning the game and then you set yourself up very nicely for a game seven with this bullpen eight five five two on two for CBS let's go out to\n... this is always this is always a trip this has always\nWhen we go down to South Beach we talked a hippie what's up at the\nWhen I ran the water you settle for radio how you doing my young man I Love you\nWell I appreciate it and I saw that you just are tweeted out that good in a few moments\nI good and okay I Want to want to hear this yeah pay\nOr I could still would have a great I missed that okay I missed\nI expect Taiwan or the ... and he was spectacular the other night when he ... he set a nice job me I Am here to ring and when you lose even more getting the ...\nAnd then we warned blackjack okay and then you go back to lose\nThat he's had some problems in the postseason but he's also had some good games as a pitcher\nOkay\nAnd when the moment is brand new every cave laterally brand new no matter how hard and your wife name he liked it when you wake up it's a brand new day and your wife and two completely different we live in a multi first not a you know the bars and I'm moving there\nBy the universe where in right now we're the world series in Corning New forms and wave

a break in eighty six year curse\nAccent and just say oh he's a brand new world for everyone and then you've got to be one whole inflation why\nIt's also a brand new world for David Price so you've

find myself a good radio side hustle\nI mean I feel like everybody else got all kinds of the other stuff going on\nTo use their platform to uh you know get a couple dollars in a pocket so y'all let me know what I Need to be doing 'cause this whole working things overrated I mean severely over it mellowed ah not not to to read on people but I have a client who I've represented for ten years\n'cause he stays in trouble once a year for ten years or the last case he had was a Twenty one town felony case where they were trying to put them in jail for Thirty years\nSo of course he didn't serve a day literally not out we're not a minute in jail um you know most of their charges dismissed beat the other ones and so he ... he told me around thirty thousand dollars now you know former NFL player so he got it I called his brother today he's a man you know\nA man I had to pay my other lawyer so knob broke right now\nAlmost drove off the road so you page or divorce lawyer but then pay your criminal lawyer you don't realize that if you are in jail you ain't gotta worry about No Child support or alimony or anything else that you're in jail for Thirty years I feel like that should be the priority\nIn your bill payment plan a strategy not you know the other way around you know I see your cell phone is still on your on your Facebook page at like eating good you know you ain't destitute living in a box you know\nMaybe I'm the one who's wrong maybe I misunderstand but you know that's part of the job when you were practicing while you kind of have to just do it and then hope that somebody decides to pay you when the spirit of the lord such as him and just the right way in order for them to be compelled by that spirit\nTo have to pay the bill and unfortunately you can sue them and then do follow bar complaint claim malpractice than do end up suing you back and you'll still never collect the money you can send them quote collection agency we all know how well that that works well they do is just keep calling your phone\nOr even if you do get a judgment against them is almost impossible to actually get any money from them\nSo these are things that don't really tell you on a ... bill law and order any of those other lawyer shows you the kind of assume lawyers get paid for the work they do but generally speaking if you click thirty percent of what you Bill you or have done an amazing job for this year going back to the phone lines\nOne thing we decided to them lazy and I decided to look up the actual ages of the people who are talking about running and twenty twenty so you've got John Kerry who was born in Nineteen forty three during World War two who is Seventy years old you got Joe Biden\nUncle Joe who was born a year before John Kerry during World War two in Nineteen forty two who was Seventy five you got Hillary Clinton you know she's a young buck ovum she'll born in Nineteen forty seven and she's Seventy years old\nAs long as these people continue to soak up all the money in the party all the airspace all the room is very difficult for new voices to bubble up remember even an oh eight Obama they told him to just go ahead and be Hillary's vice president because he was too young to ...\nIt's very difficult for new voices to bubble up remember even an oh eight Obama they told him to just go ahead and be Hillary's vice president because he was too young to run then you know be combined ticket he said no no no no go ahead and do this thing now right now\nAnd so it may take something very similar to that in a in twenty twenty and away body will or Obama was running against Joe Biden a senior statesmen Chris Dodd a senior state when Hillary Clinton a former senator former first lady\nAnd he had to go to overcome all of that why can't these people that are still going for the top spot themselves just moving to the visor erode that Graham who bought role you raise money for people you get out there and campaign for them you talk to voters you give them leadership mentor shit when you set the agenda for the party\nInstead of actually trying to be the candidate yourself let some young folks come up we had a on a Presley Beto O'Rourke we got all kinds of a young and exciting candidate around the country who are really ... really really ready to step up into that spotlight but they can't do it\nIf you still have these stole works so the party a standing in the way not to say there's anything wrong with old people I Love old people I'm going to go hang out much Catherine um after the show today because I feel like and he spends more time with her\nBut at some point in time you have to transition over into that leadership role that men to worship role instead of simply trying to continue after these goals dreams and aspirations you may have had from youth because there's nothing wrong with passing the torch on going to go to Vincent on line for Vincent\n[noise] hey ah you're right though you yes you are\nBack on hold I think uh you can't hear us oh a civil Lacey can get him on too many short but all all the same note regarding the ah the historical nature of not moving inside let's understand that with President Obama\nDuring the time that he was president Democrats lost one thousand at forty four state local and national racist over the course of that decade or the that eight years that he was in office\nBecause they didn't bring up those bootstraps under them remember when President Obama left the dean the was nearly broke\nA Donald Brazil's on the show earlier this year and she explained that when she stepped in AS Party chair person it was impossible for them to have a a a a national apparatus because there was no money left in the party\nThen it ended up being they had the basic coal mingled the Clinton money with the DNC money which is why they were able to rig the primary against Bernie because there was no additional money out there for other candidates\nSo instead of the reason for this was the entire time that Obama was a was president these other folks were out here raising money talk into donors solidifying the grass from power\nIn hopes that they will be the nominee and twenty sixteen it destroys the party to prop up this many elder states persons who aren't involved in day to day operations of the part and then we have been some back ...\nGo ahead yeah can you hear me now\nAre All right you're right and said they were a ramp them we're talking the other day about Cliburn talking about being on get out of the way you know I'd rather than crab walking and care a lot you know get out and to make me think of John ...\nI really didn't I don't I don't when I hear him here to talk about is him coming across the table tennis breads and getting you know and all this year but I don't see the champions like you can't you can't be potential fighters or tomorrow he surrounding them and introducing us to generation\nBut I don't see the champions potential champions and potential fighters tomorrow he's around them and introducing us to a generation I'm off ramp had a young lady in our community who is the national Action Network or you meant you know on TALK Mary pat\nGarrett yes yes and even more he'd eat conditioning her and she joined in other you\nEven more turned it over to turn this over to the market and that's what has happened you're exactly right it's going to get it if you don't develop any church you for tomorrow then you will we won't have no help come on\nAnd on that same note just look at the the civil rights organizations as an example\nSo many of the titans of the sixties and seventies or didn't bring up any book strip behind them remember wrote a Dr King raised a Reverend Jackson to follow in his footsteps most of the other organizations didn't do anything like that so when that person died or moved on a retired or couldn't work anymore\nWell there was there was no organization was the cult of personality so when they were gone the organization was going that's what we're seeing with the Democratic party as it slowly dies out because they will not invest in younger people coming up\nAnd making sure they have the resources they need to cite the party that that means no sense to me that the Republicans used to be the old white guy party remember when you think about Republicans do you think of ... white guys on the smoke filled [noise] doing their thing but right now the\nTop three leaders in the house of representatives from the Democrat Steny Hoyer Nancy Pelosi Jane Cliburn all in their mid seventies they are combined two hundred and Thirty Years' old those three\nFor generations or Senator Leahy from Vermont I Believe it's been in the Senate for forty four years that's too long to be on any job I never want a job for forty four years doing anything at all go amateur form as we have ...\n[noise] I don't really\nI'm very well I'm not doing this so I'm going to lead to that what we're we're looking at here when we talk about passing the knowledge on that's that's the reality yet\nIt has to become functional and the format of unity within our our\nUm killer as people um\nDo you do you get what I'm saying by making it functional\nYeah I'm not just you don't just want to pass it on for the sake of passing it on your you know you're thirty eight years old so you get to be the person in line no I'm not saying that but I Do think that you have to start grooming people from a from a young gays from uh like Reverend Sharpton they would marry pat when she was I think twelve\nUh started studying under Janice when I was Seventeen or Eighteen or you have to start that training process to matriculate them through and so then by the time you're a voter age you can start you have the ability to pass it on to somebody who who's still have the same values and that was just you\nKnow we we have to change that dynamic from passing on to living out in growing into the cause I I don't want to pass all the ability to represent a ... with other people to anyone while not\nDeveloping an infrastructure with the remainder\nOf the people\nSee you know politics can make some ... out of leadership when leadership to leave needed at all levels and we we lose focus on the the the wealth and it is an absolute wealth\nOf different levels of border\nCan be maintaining while we'll also utilizing low for would be best suited to be ambassadors to other\nFolks and that's that the difference that we have a highly melon native people\nSharing ourselves from the tragedy that we've experienced says the people over the last few hundred years so our our elderly people have to be functional with a show that we recognize going into that I'm\nLevel of ... and that's what we will be teaching our cells services\nWe've been to that um\nLevel of ... and that's what we will be teaching about what sells services to ourselves we have to understand the things we are not teaching our sales\nFor our students that are are being diminished because of focus on a picture that is\nNot so much of what we are definitely a part of an affected by so we've got to balance to keep while we have ... in young dynamic man like yourself we're right in the mix of success\nIn the outer realm of what our community in the inner realm as well you can do the work to make many more lawyers if we'd meet and hopefully we won't\nBut the point being there was a ballot for our people that doesn't exist with other people's names afraid Mandel they already have a ... in the ... culture\nTo to maintain their cultural dynamic from we are creative people and create chores swallowed dynamic is\nIs coming out of the worst possible situation to create the best possible

over sixty percent of children have witness domestic violence in their house and today in the studio with me I have Roderick Cunningham he is the executive director of the Beverly Cunningham outreach program\nRoderick welcome to the show thank you thank you might as well I saw you when Instagram yes and I see you throughout the community bringing awareness to domestic violence apartment with a lot of different organizations to really informed people and educate them about\nThe statistics of domestic violence is a little bit about you and your program and how you're connected to the Beverly Cunningham outreach program well\nAgain my name is Roderick I Am and I'm the executive director of the Beverly claim him Irish program and I started this program and my mom who was murdered October twenty seventh two thousand mine a ride over in Decatur, Georgia right off of flat shows wrote and a\nShakespearean three marriages of domestic abuse she's she experienced financial abuse as well as physical abuse as well as emotional abuse most people don't even realize is different types of abuse and um most people will just see the rest of our office physical\nSo what we decided to do one is to educate persist on it when I say person is that you started with a middle school high school college students and the job of the community and even\nAdults senior adult experience a lot of domestic violence as well from children or and or their caretakers\nBecause you know they can't do certain things once they get to a certain age so we educate on that as well as part of the forums that we do and things of that nature so we do to teen dating violence as well as other journal body of the community to educate the community on domestic violence\nWow so your mom was a victim yes tell us about your mom tell us about this kind of\nA woman is kind of a ham she was a bright little short woman\nLow feisty you know she love love the lord and she loved to ship childcare for over Twenty years and uh and and home childcare and the children loved her I just recently I went to one of his graduation on behalf of my mom and you know she\nAnd home childcare and the children loved her I just recently I went to one of his graduation on behalf of my mom and you know she she actually cry when she's seen me because it was like my mom in there\nAnd just the ... left nothing Raj FEMA community things of that nature so and she was all over the community as well begin to different churches and just feeding the people in her community you know people just come by Amos badly which cooking the day you know that she was a fine person to a but\nAnd that shows that you will never know what the face of domestic violence looks like sometimes people don't look like what they're going through and her first marriage to a pastor\nYou know and then a second marriage to entrepreneur\nAnd then her third marriage to a regular Joe he worked for a lot a trucking but you know moving you know a box with some things of that nature you know when people are moving and I had been doing that for a while and but he was a big talker though he'd love to hear him stuffed up you know those one of those type\nAnd um then October twenty seven\nHe came in a house our exit process in for the United states Secret Service getting ready to make my career move of thirty five at a time and he came in a house used the microwave heated up some food mother cooked you know because he was a club or almost church school\nShe was trying to change them\nBut you can't change was already there sometimes you just have to let it be that where we came and start argument with my mom next thing I Know my mother saying what you're going to do with that guy\nPow and\nI ran over to mix Rome look I'm not going to do because the doors locked and he opened the door and says she MS mothers' day which you can do about it and we were told him so for a minute and then he walked away from it with the gun is I Am\nI looked over at my mom blood coming out of my mouth\n'cause the the woman in the same amount of springs on the on the ... and\n... and that's why I'm so passionate about because I feel that the creator left me for a reason because he could easily killed me too and my baby brother who's hearing impaired those in the next room so I feel as though but I'm here to serve a purpose\nWow I I'm I'm I'm very emotional right now I mean I'm such a tragic story you know and\nNo Child should ever have to ... is the appearance diet hand someone who just having a bad day yeah and that's pretty much what it sounds like these and I'm just blown away with that you are part of the statistic you and your brother a part of that\nSixty percent of children who have witnessed their parents\nBe abused in the home then you write looking at your mom's hearing her story hearing about how vibrant and beautiful she was that does not look like the face of domestic violence\nAnd I just I I'm I'm speechless yeah tell us how how long has your foundation being in existence I Know your mom was tragically murdered in two thousand nine when did you decide I Want to honor my mom with this outreach programs\nAre almost precisely a year later I I'm just telling my ... one of the ones who went to counseling sometimes you need to talk it out\nAnd have someone just to listen to you and just for you to be able to cry to someone to share your pain to let it out and be able to continue to do that to let that hanging out\nAnd just for you to be able to crowd or someone to share your pain to let it out and be able to continue to do that to let that paying out a so two thousand fan is when I started a program of a suicide in some sense of ... ah in it and I have to tell this little short story with that\nWe apply for a five oh one C. three in July of two thousand fan and August of two thousand three and five but once they threw stamped\nWow that's very quick and three weeks later we had in the mail\nThat doesn't happen that stuff and it takes six months to a year to get longer\nAnd they asked a whole bunch of questions [laughter] so ah but I Will say also forgiveness when something tragic like that happened is very important because November two thousand Fifteen he was then it hangs penitentiary state prison in other words I went there I forgave him for taking my mother's life not on behalf of my family\nBut myself personally so I Would say if you are\nDivorced from your perpetrator\nWhatever the case may be could have been a boyfriend\nLet let it out let the worst come out of your mouth I mean it from your heart that you've forgiven them because what you do is you take that into the next relationship you know just keep going for relationships relationship and what happened in the prior relationship with creep into your relationship and it for only not even which you\nConsciously want it to happen like that to happen so you have to forgive and it would have to move on\nWhat about you are truly a strong example of the good news is that your mom had inside because for you to have that capability to not only forgive him but to go to him you know a lot of people say I forgive him but they do it in prayer they do it in private but to physically face your mom's\nMurder and say I forgive you takes a lot you know her spirit still live strong in you and I and I truly can believe that the story is so touching\nI think that's what makes Beverly Cunningham outreach programs so impactful because it means a lot to you this is personal this is that you love because it's your mom in you're passionate about let's talk about some of the things that you guys\nOffer in regards to education awareness and support in the community here I see here that not only do you address domestic violence I Know your partner ... organization congratulations on getting it a pat\nAnd it's going to be on this upcoming November Las will sell talk a little bit about that as well because I Know I I see on social media you're very passionate about partnering with standing and bringing bringing more awareness to Marcy slop\nYes I Would say martial law has been a breath of fresh air for me from a perspective of\nHowever is something that can help it like you just say there's a chemical imbalance there\nBut they all lead me really is this little tender love and care sometimes\nYou know when you got first got it for the industry ... you had a mental somebody took your hand is what they made ... they don't necessarily all the time they those ... ... and all those different types of medication because that enhances the issue more so it it comes from down yes\nOkay I'll give it a medication that however once the medication wears off\nThey need to know loving care again to walk them through that process and we have mentors within a program that actually walk them walk with them along the way and they can say hey\nMr Cunningham or miss kind a ham or amend or that they help me wow and they look at it at all if you are my friend and they trust you so when I go on through life\nYou're the one that they can contact even if they go to a different state they move on and you help build their esteem\nBecause most of the time the self esteem was very low sometimes\nSome people have a main miss about them because they're covering up something in their ... their mask and you know and we help them to uncover that mask\nYou know and to move on with our life and go forward and enjoy life look okay you don't have to tell everybody your condition just tell me and\nI can compensate with you we talk about if we go out to eat would go to the movies together and make them feel comfortable you know and that's how we get rid of the children just we show them a video of\nAnd make them feel comfortable you know and that's how we get rid of children if we show them a video\nOf sex trafficking we show them what video of exploitation looks like we show them a video or what they should be made all sort of thing for me to all these different things look like in this case is good for them to charter Mm\nBecause after we turn the radio would've Chelsea in this\nLike seeing them so ... once you get them to open up got to be ready for though\nRight because they have a lot of issues that that you probably are not even prepare for dessert\nAnd one thing that you share with me here in the paper that you gave me it says that in Georgia and Ninety percent of those who die by suicide had an underlining mental illness\nAnd that suicide is the third leading cause of death among use ages ten to twenty four in America there so there is a problem here and I think the more we medicated the worse it gets so we definitely\nNeed more exposure and opportunities to do it off and offer food or the free services now\nBefore we and I want to talk more about\nYour monthly workshops here let's talk and its let's talk HIV mental health and human trafficking and the Beverly Cunningham outreach
