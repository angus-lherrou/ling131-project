I was gonna say establish law a day that's not the word that he used it is something law\nI'm a technical term I think technically legal term but basically we don't need to go back and revisit that issue uh-huh it's done settled settled law it is it's already behind us we you know we can make some adjustments some fine tuning to the the uh\nApplication or is it for twenty weeks or after twenty weeks or\nAll kinds of you know stuff\nBut the the actual decision roe weight versus Wade is settled law mhm wow of course there's many out there that would love to see that overturned and in ... in

heating\nAnd electric they'll sell your warm winters and cool summers of warm winter's is\nBeginning to sound kind of interesting is nice and yeah so that we don't we don't want to to wake up in the morning and be frozen no one of the other things that the the fallout that we're facing here is that um everybody now wants to turn the Kavanaugh battle into an election battle\nUh who's gonna win who's going to lose what's going to be the impact and ... you know there's there's several things are we still fickle\nAn answer to that is probably but are we so fickle that that we would let the the a process of selecting a Supreme Court justice impact\nA complete congressional election evidently we are\nWell didn't even Chuck Schumer say you got to go to the polls yup you've got to help you and other Republicans are screaming get out and vote get out and vote there was an article published by a CNN [noise] that should tell you a little bit about it\nA ... of the Clinton news now workers and

Ryan has used the term this is a choice of two futures and I think maybe we monitor might want to consider\nFor just a couple of minutes what kind of a future are we looking at there are three scenario cinder mentioned in this article and the first one is that the Democrats take back\nThe house of representatives\nI'm Nancy Pelosi becomes the speaker of the house or there's some argument as to whether or not she would survive that kind of a a process but the the the current popular thinking is that she would in fact become speaker of the house of representatives again\nThe consequences of that would be overwhelming\n[noise] first of all they would ... the house does have the opportunity to privilege\nTo invest an open investigations into anything they feel necessary so you could expect them to open dozens have been in an investigations\nAre concerning President Trump his family all the White House staff all the cabinet members and everybody in the executive branch of government and these\nInvestigations would be so\nDemanding and take such a ...\nInterim government and these investigations would be so\nDemanding and take such a tremendous toll on all the individuals involved that the costs just in in dollars would be in the millions tens of millions of dollars that\nTo support all of that the people are having to show up for all of these are in investigations and and the staff a White House or a congressional hearings\nCongress would absolutely come to us than still they wouldn't get anything done they would spend all their time focusing on investigations and they would have zero time nor would they want to solve any problems the second scenario that we could look at would be\nThe Republican agenda would be stopped dead in its tracks the Trump tax cuts would probably be rescinded or cut back completely regulations new regulations would be a put back in place\nA single payer health care would be pushed that see a ... Affordable Care Act Obamacare the consequences for the economy and wages would be absolutely profound\nStrong economic growth rising unemployment consumer confidence would alternative wrong direction\nAfter twenty months of robust growth the third situation if that they were talking about the Democrats regaining control of the house of representatives just the house of representatives the third problem that we face now the first one is that they're\nGonna follow open all kinds of investigations the second is they're going to stop all of the Republican legislative agenda is the third one would be [noise] that a Speaker Pelosi\nWould move to impeach Trump and the first Ninety Days of the next session of Congress her liberal base her liberal base would demand that she'd begin that kind of an investigation never mind it's it's a a\nOutcome never mind that they had a solid reason for demanding an impeachment than ... liberal base of the Democrat Party\nWould simply demand that the Democrats begin an impeachment process and by the way a simple majority is all this required in the house of representatives to a act\nUpon an a a articles of impeachment now that could happen in the house um it might be well to remember that Bill Clinton had that very same thing happened to him in the house\nBut and in in ... battle completely paralyzes Washington and the division between the two parties simply gets wider and we'd go back to this ah radicalization of America\nWhile how would you like that now what he actually be impeached no an impeachment the articles of impeachment requires\nWe would we could probably see the same thing happened on the Democratic side this time of Blumenthal thinks he wants to run\n'em a little bit more and wants to run a\nHarris from California's a first name Carla Harris ...
