somebody to show so scared for their life the wellbeing of their family that they're gonna they're gonna start putting let down range and and and that's going to be sad because the reason is going to be really not not just a person beating on\nHer car was hurt or killed I don't care about that person they put they they get that themselves\nBut they're going to that point on that person that pulled

your life to get their point across and these dirty bastards are are are capable of that they don't they they don't worry about the somebody defending their life that don't mean nothing they just want

somebody beating on his car with a baton are trying to get in this way [noise]\nI think that a focus on the difficult issue of child separation a practice that the administration has now ended that

major issue than real benefits of Republicans in twenty days on election day they'd be some good writing to get out of that in there in basically one hundred eighty seconds just the fact of the matter is question is what\nDo Democrats stand for other than we are Trump because somebody do a better job with the economy at the moment probably not\nCan they do a better job with a Foreign Relations and you know brought up in the last hour reasons to defend what's going on\nAnd maintain good relations with Saudi Arabia probably not they're trying to destroy the fact Warren relations at the moment can they do a better job with border security costs not seven forty one we've got a caller with us it's thirty on magic early this morning with Bill ... color Europe next year on the air\nUsing more than ... excellent show there you you know I'm listening to you or I Can't help but think that a couple of nights ago I was watching the video on a report on Venezuela and how that society has just

spoiled rotten neat\nTo eat\nBecause it's cheaper and they can't afford it they don't have enough electricity to maintain their refrigeration units so the ... the meat spoils and I look at parallel that with California on what's going on there and San Francisco down in Skid Row in LA are these the policies that the American people want\nTo be implemented it all across the U. S.\nCalifornia is pro that has proven that Democrats have proven that they're incompetent when it comes to to administer a in a city to running\nGovernment they're just they're they're in Brussels idiots and they want people to just go ahead and vote for them they have no good ideas there I ... their ideas are both for us and will allow you to continue to murder babies\nSince windows two wrongs make our rights yeah you know it's disgusting and I hope everyone goes out and vote it's like I told the other day I have already voted straight up and down Republican because\nOne Republican is is is I I can live with the that even though I might not agree with some of the things they do that by God they're standing up to these people we got to put people in power they're going to back the president implement his plans people are outraged that Saudi Arabia how this one reporter was killed\nWe had drug cartels on our southern border bringing in still to this country and they've been dead bodies and and this membrane bodies for years\nAnd we want that to come into our country is discussed and we're Americans we should be better than that we are better than that\nSo I mean Democrats as far as I'm concerned I have no hope I have family in California Democrats or know what happened to them but are Democrats and they're voting for Trump because they see that they have more money in their pockets\nOkay they're able to pay for for for things and and the Democrats have proven they they do not know they don't have the answers their answers or or money for\nPublic this public that and like I said the other day if we think that we are not paying for illegal to have health insurance because of California wanting to provide health insurance for the illegals through medic cow which receives money from the federal government which comes from our taxes\nWere crazy we're paying for their health insurance okay look into that medical how which is for the low income receive money from the federal government kind of like and there's this into exactly exactly and I hope everyone votes against that\nSold out a good day I got to get back to work\nBut hey thank you thank you thank you
