their beliefs about Trump and uh they're old affiliations most of them had been Democrats but they switched to Trump but here's something even more interesting they were telling her that they support

adopted two are black\nTheir now in the Marines or she says one daughter in law is Puerto Rican another daughter in law is from Mexico and by the way they all support Donald Trump\nSo she said this

all of the old industrial parts of America but\nReally stupid that was back in the late Nineteen nineties when President Clinton worked\nOut most favored nation status for trade with China unless he

um\nWe had good over the winter survival on farms and um I I think it should be a good year out there um it's good to good ... good get things pulled off a little bit and people can get out and have some form\nI grew up in a part of the country where a if you're driving down the road\nGood ... good get things pulled off a little bit and people can get out and have some fun\nI grew up in a part of the country were a few driving down the road ah with all the whitetail it's a little bit like trying to do while you're playing space invaders you know everywhere in the midst asteroids right [laughter] you're season is the most popular season for hunting\nIt well it it it it is in Idaho I mean you've got Ninety thousand al ... and you get a hundred and fifty thousand a ... a deer hunters ah the interesting thing is is when I say a hundred and fifty thousand hunters yet it's a lot but when I look at places like Minnesota or a place like that they actually have a million people\nOut on opening day\nA bigger population of people and things like that I don't know that I'd want to hunt a one thing about those places they get a lot more trees and so you can hide hunters in the woods\nBut I'm a an around here you get a seat folks but um you know get out and have some fun it was interesting do we just got done with a ... survey I'm a meal their survey\nAnd ... and the top reasons for people being able to go out and go hunting you can probably guess some\nIs spending time with family and friends and enjoy the outdoors and those are a couple of top reasons people get out and so now it's a it's a great time you get out enjoy the enjoy the mountains and a half on\nAnd and the people who are out there there's always going to be some safety concerns I was reading a book yesterday were woman talked about first time she everyone deer hunting with her husband and she said I could hear the voices of other people who were hunting and she said so I didn't shoot it anything 'cause I was so worried I was going to hit one of those voices\n... cell and added its property is a man\nTo a tremendous positive benefit to farmers and ranchers or is it a potential path to disaster Dr David song stab director of research and cell biology at save us stocks\nAnd I'm a firm believer technologies this is the next step in that progression of technology it's a new tool in the tool box the plant breeders can use and it's been embraced very firmly by plant breeders because\nIt is a way in which they can do their job more effectively and get a more positive outcome in a short amount of time\nWhen the United States Department of agriculture has done their studies and they view genome editing to be another version of advance plant breeding and they're not going to regulate genome editing within the United states as long as it has no plant past\nComponent to us so in other words if Mother Nature as unregulated why should we regulator technology for the same outcome can't be differentiated from what you can do to make\nSense but the future will tell\nWhat can you really know about proposition one that people who will prop one tried it is the view by making big promises about school funding but when you read the fine print it's easy to see where the gambling money is actually going\nFrom one language guarantees that promoters making nine percent profit from the legalized gambling machines\nIdaho schools will get only half of one percent and\nThat means promoters prop one get Eighteen times as much money and they promised that out of school for every dollar gamble or get half a penny and Idaho is seen this before I report from the Idaho State auditor found that the last time gambling machines or legal money promised his school\nWest taken away and they

part of it up\nOr the thing we've got to remind people there's two [noise] or if you haven't been out and done any physical exertion for the last ten months going out on a hunt may not necessarily be the wisest thing to do\nWell you'll be sore [laughter] you know especially now we always run into issues with you know people hike in for that and they think they can't they further than they probably should net it's tougher on him to get critters out um and so it just be cautious when you're up there I mean ...\nA harvest in an animal is a huge part of that for for a lot of people and so uh just get out and enjoy yourself and and be cautious makes sure somebody knows where you're going and be prepared to spend the night if you need to I mean I I always tell people never leave the truck\nOr you you don't have cell coverage and a lot of places and so you know somebody needs to know where you are if you fall twist leg we had a gentleman a couple of years ago um he has a trucker hunting\nA slip a hurt his leg spent the night on the mountain\nIf it had been any cooler it froze to death because he didn't have any jackets and stuff like that his dogs I got near him and stuff but little things like that can happen and so just be prepared when when you're out there the other thing is I'm a ... you know I\nI guess I just can't stress enough about just having fun and getting up there and doing this you know we got good numbers game animals\nUm but just get out and have fun and don't make it a stressful situation I fell into that category a few times bill over my life um especially when you know you want your kids to be so successful and you're you're pushing pushing pushing\n'em and er I kinda you know made it not as fun um I just got back up a hunting trip my kid and it was like one of the fun of sunny trip had been on because we we senator more around food we hike card don't get me wrong we had some long higher our days we we were had\nSome success but uh you know we we took it if we just didn't feel like going forty miles that day we only went you know ten [laughter] so uh but we had a good time and took a little of that stress out of\nIt just reminds me of when I was a kid and my dad was literally plan Thanksgiving and Christmas and when things didn't go the way it planned that always reminded me of the character and the cartoons you know oh yeah firecracker that blows up or you could just look at him and ... ten seconds\nAway from it it exploded not implode in excess loaded [laughter]\nHey you also want to mention the fact that we've got problems still poachers\nWhen we do you know ... ... and I know the accidents happen I don't classify accidents on the mountain is approaching instant\nIdea of animal you know uh we we do different things but then we do have a certain segment of the population that does try to take advantage of the situation\nAnd so if you see something that is wrong going on call us on the cap hotline it's one eight hundred a cap citizens against poaching but it's one eight hundred six three to five nine nine nine nine for three nights so it was five nine nine nine\nYep and still asleep evidently my brain but no I'm call us if you don't remember that number you'd call the county sheriff or they can get a hold of a sudden dispatch\nOr um be a good witness you don't need to be the ... you don't need to be the law enforcement you don't need to go up and confront anybody\nIf you see something illegal going on be a good witness and get the information to us citizens get poaching um\nHat gives towards uh for the protection of Idaho's wildlife and so and you can wring remain completely anonymous\n'em\nCalling that line and and we can get the information and like I've said multiple times probably eighty to Ninety percent of our cases\nAre brought to us by the public and that's how we ... we discover and there's a lot when you got you know in the ... eleven officers and there's you know a hundred and fifty thousand hunters and the state of Idaho you've got a few more\nWe discover and there's a lot when you got you know in the ... eleven officers and there's you know a hundred and fifty thousand hunters and the state of Idaho you've got a few more eyes out there amongst the hunters\nAnd so a help us out this is while you're talking a little bit about harvesting sports too yeah you know it's kinda I Know it's really early but people yesterday were coming through the ... coming through with their deer and things like that\nUm we've got the harvest report and a lot of people don't understand what the harvest report is harbors report we're going to be setting new regs this year so come December um we'll be talking about on this radio show hey guys these are ... were were needed some ideas for what you like to see change next year\nActually probably started that next month getting some ideas to us I'm On what you'd like to see change and then we'll be talking about the meaning these harbors reports are key a key tool to help us know\nHow many animals are being harvested how many people were hunting in certain units how many days of work they're put an end to harvest that animal um so that we can understand crowding in certain units we can understand harbor success in certain units um and then we can compare that to our aerial surveys\nAnd just kind of make sure that their populations are doing good in certain areas and ... or in these different areas and it just gives us a lot of information they got a new deal on their bill that I can go into real time harvest a harbor stats\nAnd um you go to the hunt planner on the fishing game website and on the side column is really hard to says real time uh harbors reports you can click on that\nAnd see what animals are being harvested in what units right now this year for deer and elk\nUm and I think they've also got the prom horn on there and so are you can see what's going on those units but get your information and as soon as you just have to log on to your website onto the website and um you can go in and fill your harsh report if you're having problems give us called the regional office at three to four four three five nine\nSounds like a a land based fish finder yeah students him or does that oh\nLooks like they're doing really well or not you maybe I had to go over there and look at 'em and so but um it's kind of just the technology you know things going on and so it's kinda interesting I kind of looked at it not a lot going on after the first day but you were starting to see some numbers pop up\nWith this new license vendor that we've had so many issues and it's like I I hate getting saying well it's a new license on his new lives have been\nBut I don't know how to explain it's just the the it's a evidently the heat sensitive paper and so you've got the heat printers that come on and heat up the paper the ... heat laser printer puts it on there\nBut come to find out your body creates heat too when you put it in your back pocket and then the print fades off of it because it and so they it just didn't work right and so hopefully we can get things cleaned up for next year [laughter]\nIf you've got a tag come by and a and a half Irish reprinted\nTwenty minutes from eight o'clock ... studio with us on that took valley this morning on news radio Thirteen tend to LAX who's really ... dot com or forty three books not only with you until ten am okay you says in hot uh that sounds like a lot of you spoke earlier about how there should be fun that\nSome ... and it was we had I wanted to talk about a little bit because we had this last weekend it goes there's a youth pheasant hunting season for kids on Seventeen under they can go with an a license to do they have to have a license themselves they can go to the uh wildlife management\nArea they can harvest pheasants down there that were released and stuff like that\nUntil tomorrow friday is the last day but we had a great I just wanted to thank you know it had falls bran and we had a the a magic valley pointing dog's club and we had\nSeveral other groups that came by and helped us take about twenty four kids I'm Out on their first pheasant hunts and we just had a just a great time out there they really have taken over I mean it's pretty much the southeastern Idaho plenty dogs a pheasant clinic anymore\nBut um they did a great service and the kids learn something and had a good time and so\nThe regular pheasant season opens on the twentieth so if you missed us with your kid you can still take him out on the twentieth\nWe've got a call a seven could be defined seven forty two and color you're on the air with Calvin hats from Idaho fishing game I ...\nOr maybe you've answered this before and I haven't heard\nA short range weapons bill [noise]\nReally confusing\nI understand the shotgun slugs and shot\nMuzzle loader archery are both um\nI thought you could use like a lover action\nMuzzle loader archery I go to the\nI thought you could use like a lover action forty oriental model Ninety four Winchester\nForty thought long cold but now it may sound like it has to be his little only is\nUh the what the deal is on the [noise]\nNo that's a great question it's a question to answer about four times a week and so I'm Glad you called it a a called on it so we can get this out to more people what it was as we had a ... a pistol group that came to us and we wanted to be able to use handguns in a short range weapon\nSo the commission and went through and they okayed handguns\nThe thing that they didn't think about is forty five three fifty seven thirty eight ... a forty four max all can be shot out of a car being\nI've actually got to forty format car being the go my forty ... pistol and stuff like that you cannot use a rifle pissed ... pistol cartridge in a rifle\nSo you can't shoot a Thompson Contender or\nUh any of the Army Corps or any of that that should the two twenty three can't shoot a a or any of that because that's still a pistol\n... that's the problem we we when we we create a new opportunity there's so many little deals that come into play but\nYou're exactly right if you're hunting a short range weapon you can hang out with a\nMuzzle order shotgun a cross bow archery equipment you have a scope on your muzzle loading and have a scope on your shotgun you can shoot paradox pellets out of your show a muzzle or you can shoot is added ... ball because it's not a Muslim literally and\nAnd you can shoot pistol cartridges out of a pistol a straight wall pistol cartridge so you can only shoot a you know like a three fifty seven or thirty eight or I mean any pistol cartridge you you you want to hunt with the center of fire but it has to be shot out of a pistol\nWhen I was asking for the call and we got about ... thirty seconds before the break\nUm I was going to mention one other thing I'm sure that he's talking about fifty three and you know fifty three is the Snake River court or the other question that we always run into in this bill is the prime bridge divides that unit I can hunt to the west over towards buell and unit fifty three with a short range weapon\nIf I went to the east down towards burly\nSaid as a controlled archery only ... you had to apply for that and you can only hope\nWith perjury equipment if you hadn't figured it out we try to make things as difficult as possible you know what we're trying to do is we we just try to make make too many to make people get exactly what they want and then sometimes we get too complicated rules and so we've got to get out and have fun\nWe'd go more coming up with cats are attached a but first we'll check the rush morning update on news radio Thirteen
