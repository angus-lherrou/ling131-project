set to expire after twenty twenty five and these tax cuts protect family and small businesses and\nReally address the appreciation of the estate tax among other provisions so this is a big deal

news radio Thirteen ten dot com or at forty odd magic valley this morning\nYes there is still hope for this country if you home school your children I guess send them to some private institution jak cabinet I went to a private school after all right\nWe've got to get through a break and just about twenty seconds uh but I Do want to point out you can get in touch with me if you are so inclined following the news cast at seven thirty we have a local update from our own political base up\nUh he's joining us from the news radio thirteenth ... just a few seconds also coming up just after the eight o'clock news today we're talking about firearms with forest Anderson and Todd ... there'll be in the studio with us actually Todd's probably already in the building he tends to uh you don't ever\nHave to worry about Todd echoes being late anywhere let's just say he's a pretty prompt about getting places generally very very early\nBecause it was dry\nIf it hadn't been such a dry summer they would've use less what am I getting at the reason why people may be locked up in Idaho is because we may be taking locking up serious criminals much more serious like that it's dangerous criminals much more serious like the writer says Idaho has the thirteenth highest incarceration\nRight in the nation out pacing all six of its neighboring states in that respect for the new study finds\nThat that's the point that this study is is a relative number you know you couldn't find any number you want to this\nBut if you're actually enforcing the laws and put it in the bad guys in jail than it should be higher study conducted by the Idaho Center for fiscal policy\nAnd I'd like to discover who's behind this Idaho Center for fiscal policy my guess is the Idaho Center for fiscal policy it ... you know you get this impression that there is some large government building in Boise and a lot of people walking around in lab coats are getting paid by the taxpayers are state bureaucrats\nBut I'm going to guess that the Idaho Center for fiscal policy\nIs likely an independent organization\nAnd the independent organization may have a particular political bias that's at least think tanks often work\nIt found four hundred Ninety of every one hundred thousand Idaho and ... are in prison I write five times\nWhat it was in Nineteen Seventy eight and twenty Seventeen spending on corrections accounted for almost eight percent well seven point eight percent of the state's budget up from four point nine percent in Nineteen Ninety two Idaho's incarceration\nRate is higher than neighboring state\nWhich historically has incarcerated more people than other states in the region alright historically has incarcerated more people than other states in the region but they're no numbers given here to prove that out\nSo that's just we're supposed to take that at face value\nWell maybe they've had some changes in their their criminal justice system maybe they're letting more people out who shouldn't be on the streets there is a possibility I go through the a P wire every morning and there's generally or a string of stories out Reno in Las Vegas in about a number of homicides and other terrible crimes that are going down in that state maybe there's a reason for that\nThe writer says the increased incarceration rate comes as violent crime in Idaho shows an overall downward trend since Nineteen Ninety six so\nIf you're locking up more violent criminals and violent crime is down late like you to assume that we don't need to lock up so many violent criminals but couldn't you argue that by locking up more violent criminals the neighboring states that's the reason violent crime\nHas been on a trajectory for twenty two years dropping at Idaho in other words the violent criminals out on our out on the streets committed the crimes that they normally would commit hello\nAnd then here's a here's a quote placing more people in prison as a diminishing benefits as a crime deterrent the report's authors right\nBut you just said\nThat violent crime has been going down for the last twenty two years so for more than two decades in Idaho has a high number of people in in prison so I can you make that statement has had a diminishing benefit as a crime deterrent\nWow [laughter] I I\nI'm not quite sure that I understand that statement because somebody isn't reading their own data the right way\nThey know Idaho's crime decrease is part of a twenty five you're a national trend that goes back to uh in the late Nineteen eighties and early Nineteen nineties you may remember we had a crack cocaine epidemic in this country and\nIn the federal federal judiciary system they started throwing the book if people I guess books that people since it would be plural but they started they started taking a harsh\nYour view on all of this therefore you've got more people locked up in federal penitentiaries who are not committing crimes on the streets again it just seems to be a\nTotal these people are totally oblivious as to how this works seven forty three were at forty a news radio Thirteen ten K.
