[laughter]\nIt was the same doctor who in Nineteen forty six wrote it's um the um the book being um the White House physician and that was a rod MRI's mcentire were they in on the murder have absolutely no idea\nI I couldn't say I'd have to say that they had good intentions they were just a little bit little ignorant maybe and\nAnd what happened to ... the Russian painter and her driver and and and um she would tops husband\n[noise] well they just kind of disappeared into obscure I mean at the time or two afterwards well immediately afterwards well\nThey packed up the uh I'm a Robin and assume it's off and they threw rocks\nWell they packed up the uh I'm a Robin and assume it's off in the thrillers Lucy Mercer who he was having an affair with among others um [laughter]\nAnd um they tried to get a Warm Springs Georgia as fast as possible so in her book um her being I'm sure with off in her book she describes the place that they took to to get away from Warm Springs Georgia which I thought was a little crazy because\nIf it was a natural death um you know why I don't know why would you lie to flee the scene right right you know I mean if it's a natural death why still the records you know and then there's a parallel here to the FDR's or to the JFK thing actually\nUm JFK shot in Dallas they break law to bring him to a out of Dallas the autopsy should have been performed in Dallas they break law to bring him to besides the\nNow the law was the same in Nineteen sixty three it was it was a Nineteen forty five they did the same thing they broke the law removing FDR's body from Georgia bringing it to the pathologist so\nBoth you know both the JFK and FDR's body I removed illegally\nThey're both at but says though we're all kinds of fun things happen you know a lot of this besides the could talk you know ... and ... and they they rushed this guy it's it's a little less than sixty nine hours from FDR's death to him in the open being buried they couldn't get this guy's body in the ground fast enough\nNo no I did by the way and no one involving no autopsy no one bombing is just one of his\nEar and crazier and crazier all the way through\nSo I mean and there's other things in history to Richard I mean take a look at 'em you know not just this\nI'm going to be working on Princess Diana coming up next but there are other presidents in history who I also believe that a murder that they glossed over um Warren Harding Warren Harding was it was that was obvious this guy was murdered and there's another one nobody talks about but\nAs far as FDR is concerned I mean the the [laughter] the information in my head just exploded when I started digging and digging and digging and it's still it's still boggles my mind in the book has been published for a little while now and I still even after the book is one published\nYou know I'll find a new fact and go wow I should have put that in the book I mean there's\nThe volume three perhaps uh let me get the calls here ah and he's in Alabama and the wild card line any good morning locked ...\nThank you Steve I'm calling to ask you about some ... music ... well several of Eleanor Roosevelt garden party she said to my aunt who work at the state department and managed man now\nI'd also like a nation that they can experience with the blood dancer strapped for my grandmother which was watering economy should've had things however it looked like she can take college bleeding all in the body is with my band\nOr ... pounds in eight you're from\nThere you go and like you don't you say it wasn't a warfare and with Roosevelt because that would have been too quick\nYeah it was it wasn't people around him they were disposing of with war for him because it and she's right if she's right I mean it's been the blood out to to the point where if you touch a person they'll get you know either their their brains will either bleed or they'll have an ... or something or cerebral hemorrhage\nAnd they'll also of course I Know Dr but you know my parents were both on it they're both on a variety of blood\nOr something or cerebral hemorrhage and they'll also of course I Know Dr but no my parents were both on it they're both on a variety of listener so\nRight my late father was as well\nSure definitely cause ... any thanks for calling on\nThank you uh let's go back in the wild card line is it my dad in New York\nMy asthma Hi there Matt Good morning ah okay as quick a three part and I'll listen over the ad for a look for I heard um I'm a gentleman on the air I heard\nWet said top glee who also believes that FDR with with limited and I'd like to know if he is familiar with him and his theory around it\nA second and what is it the grasses so he would be someone that would talk about the new the new deal as um uh doing the right thing around that that there are for the so called Great Depression\nAnd so I like his thoughts on that and lastly\nHe mentioned about both of the Russian connection and it's a both FDR and is a current stable genius if you will and the White House\nIs clean somewhat different because\nI went to cover them in the ... thing to have more to do with leading up to even now he wound up as president\nAnd of course the money that he had to go to counteract it until they get rabies shot like him to elaborate on ... and and of course the odd that do see a fifty fifty sad you know we know that he has the public's liberties and in\nMy I had if I could just jump in here because we're not talking about Trump I think if it's not to put words in your mouth but I think you are being kind of facetious or about the Russian connection with Trump but let's just stick to FDR way we could do a whole show perhaps another time on on the Russian dusty and so forth\nBut and you're right ... a big fan of FDR I Know Webster a little bit and and I've had dinner with him and and he waxes on about the new deal uh obviously Steve you're you're not a fan did you have anything to add\n[noise] uh no I don't know the man I Would love to meet him sometime uh as far as the new deal I think it was probably the right thing at the time\nI think it was an experiment I don't think anybody knew how it was going to go 'cause it to my knowledge there's never been done before so I mean I have no doubt that they thought at the time it was a really good thing it helps a lot of people um it just wasn't along sustaining campaign so\nAs far as the Russians and the current administration yeah I was kind of being a little facetious as to how how everyone is in whole history you kind of repeats itself what kind of doesn't you know um it's it's amazing how we have the [laughter] we\nWere right back in the same thing we have another red scare and in the country it's it's really it's really something else if ... you know he would he would really enjoy those rising\nRight so I think the point they're making their was that the the Russian connection during FDR's time was overt uh and today it's I guess you would to coin a phrase from CNN it's nothing burger\nRight I mean if I mean if they ever prove it with us from which I don't know if they're ever going to\nUm they may I don't know I'm not privy to that information but it's it's just interesting how how how the two of the history is another red scare starting to repeat itself all over again\nAnd here we are Seventy some odd years passed its funny which is how history repeats itself becomes relevant actually I'm interesting book I think you'll like it thanks very much for calling us\nWill ah we're heading into a break here at the bottom of the hour and\nRichard Stengel thanks for less than I ever going\nWe will ah we're heading into a break here at the er the bottom of the hour and then we will get to a more calls people are lined up in Chicago Pennsylvania Gulfport, Mississippi San Pedro California Sioux Falls South Dakota we'll get to as many of you as we can\nFor having me real quick to think\nOne of if you look at a at Roosevelt a night before you look so bad I have a hard time thinking that they had to kill him because he was going to die anyway that's why they got rid of Henry may prove to buy for the night before or campaign 'cause they didn't like the\nSecond of all I don't I read up on this or that they would call and how I got away with all the stuff we wrote God dollar that somebody to look at ... ... and make sure that if you would call 'cause I'm going to get a lot of that\nAnd I think it would be for the was it it would require you to he wanted Roosevelt with cooking Rick I'm over the cold that the uh Toronto and uh you know and all that and gotten to know he was afraid of but again by the fact that [noise]\nI I think he did not want him that he wanted to learn from our they pop like that's just my my take on it All right interesting John ... bad shape you're going to die anyway are All right Steven you want to reply [noise] um\nI you know there's a lot of people who read up on things and to the Victor goes the spoils okay a lot of the things that we've been told 'em have been slanted okay I'm not suggesting that what you said has been\nHe looks so bad in Nineteen forty four that was after almost two years of being poison systematically poison\nThat's why he look so bad in Nineteen forty four this wasn't from the advance on polio and it spills without very very plainly in my book so it's a it's an interesting time in history it was an awful lot of people who research those and I learned from every one of them I'm not gonna sit here and professor know every little angle that's for sure\nBut um as far as style in style in one of the rule the world he didn't he didn't have any interest in sharing anything with FDR\nSo he sent something to look in the ... in the end of the ... what was going on\nHe was already being where the death was already verified from the two Russians that were in front of him when he died so if if indeed that happened and it may have I'm not suggesting that it didn't\nIf indeed that had happened it was probably just so he could uh you know get recognition of the fact that we weren't giving them some sort of falls propaganda\nHi John thank you for that meeting point there ah let's see how to James in Philadelphia\nHi James good morning welcome to coast to coast\nThank you Richard a back my guess for my question for Mr things just store banning it in your research physical\nOr did you come across or anything about this just to ... an attempted coup against a Roosevelt in the thirties and dad or if it did happen if you came across it how close was it of to happening\nAnd that that causes ... uh it was a exposed by an army general smelly butler into one of the people involved was a I think was a Garth or\nDid you come across anything about the coup how if it if it's true how posted it come to happening\nOr if it if it did happen if there was an attempted\nCoup against Roosevelt\nSaid something that you discuss in the book or is it sees\nA James thanks for calling in I did run run into that information but it was after the book was published so you won't find that information in there I thought it was fascinating when I did run across it didn't make the book I'm Sorry I Wish it did um and ... yeah I don't really I don't know I guess that people say a lot of things I don't know how true that really is\nWhere the amount of people who are around Roosevelt who didn't like him for multiple reasons\nI'm from you know suppressing the uh the the capitalist to holding off as as long as he did it would not would not surprise me but I mean as far as as far as that's concerned I don't have any I don't have any great knowledge into that I discovered it after the book but I I did run into it so\nThanks for your call and sorry I couldn't be of much out there like I said I I I I Would be lying if I said I felt that I knew everything\n[laughter] I like James thank you for that Wayne is in Chicago Wayne good morning welcome because\nYou're ridge or ... you cannot do your job do you feel very returned from Niger nine\nWow

have to look into that um [noise] I guess the question would be why why would he\nUm why would he do that I don't even have you have you ever come across anything indicating that any theory that ... that FDR may have tried to take his own life or do you think he's on like\nYou know that's a new one on me or I haven't heard that but again like I said I'm I'm you know I I Know what I Know I don't know what somebody else knows [laughter]\nI just I just I wrote this book and I thought I followed the line of facts that brought me to it and I found information along the line to cooperate if\nYou know if somebody else has come up with that I don't I don't maybe as quality of life couldn't have been great you know with the with the situation in the head with this polio I mean anything's possible people said that Elvis Presley committed suicide to um I certainly have certainly uncovered and who murdered all of us I certainly uncovered information that the phone to that but\nI guess

she died and his father died relatively young I Believe ... sad when so rich and we have to ask ourselves whether or not it was in the genetic cards for outlets that level I'm Alive\nSteve can tell you that he's and then he talked to the person who held Elvis's ... heart in his hands and said that there was no law Steve you tell there was no evidence of a heart disease at least none that had would be sufficient to kill him I mean it may have developed later but it wasn't present at the time of his death\nRight Hi well thanks again for your call I'm Gladys died because colonel Parker she was ... was she like propose okay colonel Parker told\nObese and I can't film you with Elvis and I wanted to take pictures with you with Elvis because people want to see what was his mother because

enough to wait for any mad\nHow did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an avowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend\nAnd his wife were both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the finding in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did looked at the oil as the leader of the spiritual as\nA matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years and I think the friendship came about through fame just fan crossing pads and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of a discord between them\nThat got so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where she claimed that he brought she bought through Harry's mother\nAnd Harry's mother the spirit of Harry's mother plays an important part in this whole thing [noise] um and Harry was supposedly moved\nBut he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact and that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nI guess he's sort of outed or in public didn't need any out her ... yeah\nYes yes uh thirty taco view um some of this play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nNow no part of this debunking that that uh Harry and Bess engaged in ... would be to sort of demonstrate I guess the audience is how it works so they would sort of do their own\nSort of photos psychic act\nOr on stage and I don't know if they didn't explain to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this secret coated method\nThat that Harry and best could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody methods\nI think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here\nScams off can you explain the secret Cody method\nUm I think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to uh anybody that's interested in this it's all explained in the essay quite clearly\nThere is a list of ten words and the tenth word is actually a phrase in each word corresponds to a number number one through Ken and number ten can also be taken to zero and so this was used to point most commonly\nTo the date on a coin that's how the trick would normally work when Harry invest first met and Eighteen Ninety four that's when they got married they would do this little trick where they would\nHave someone volunteer they'd reaching their pocket ... All right what does the last two digits on the coastline\nAnd they these words which and pray answer say now tell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number and so they would work these words into an easy sent tens like\nQuickly area I Know you can do this and that would be number eight\nAnd so it has a natural in this to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nRight so if the coins a best selling her hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty eight\nAnd because she would say she's communicating you invariably using these code words and she said quickly quickly is corresponds with a number eight it's the eight eight were in in the rye secret Cody ... so you know that he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she why use quickly again so that would be the same number right makes size right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just numbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passing them pretend but the way of doing that\nAnd that's what was used to make this code\nSo they would have had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases praying or say now tell please speak quickly look be quick and as you say all of this can be found in the essay let me just because people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical\nDot com infinitely mystical dot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work the essays posted there sorry I I Know\nThere's a link on the coast to coast now let's talk about this code because after the message was delivered took bath and she said that it works somebody quickly said hey this was all in a book is all already published in a book this is no big deal well\nI thought I had read this on line a number of times someone would say within a book but they wouldn't say the name of the book out of the people were saying it's on page da da da da da da da da da and then I finally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought\nYou know I'm going to look in the Santa Barbara county library and see if that book is there and I was so surprised to find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county\nAnd for all of the twenty five cents they would move at book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out and eighty five year old book\nI couldn't believe it so I got the book and I scan the relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just follow that may not say there's a link inside there to show you scan of this book and so that book does\nTalk about those ten words and how it used to form numbers but not out a form we're so that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not\nIm numbers but not out of form or\nSo that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book and down that see I hear some bullet points about this that the code can be used to form words not just numbers\nHow clever coating method works to form these words that they use this code and the afterlife experiment that the secret message would start with the onion coated word Roosevelt that the secret message would in code word the leave and the actual\nSecret can word message none of that with in the book and the person who claimed that it was in the book\nThis is important to ask you this is he also was a famous magician and he's a close personal friend\nHarry Houdini so in this person says ah it's not a trick it's in the book everyone's you took him at his word did not look into the book and just believed that Ford was a fraud without looking into it anymore\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why it was important for you to point out\nThat this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini a and therefore it may have been possible for so much you know about that because now we get into the say on\nAnd and uh we should back up and explain that on Houdini deathbed in Detroit and\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this is actually true but allegedly he told them that\nYeah I'm a skeptic I I I'm going to a bunker I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way I can get a message to bass I Will try\nAnd then she has contacted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he how did for get in touch with best\nWill\nI'll touch on that in just a minute but I just wanted to point out that I think that this worked because the best and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments\nChecking into reality as if it's a heartless machine and I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and ... we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine\nSo back to your question um Ford was a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise]\nOne of its clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of hurricane Harry's mother intrude into the session and in his on putting the word forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to death\nWell that gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have\nAnd she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul or spirit was surviving death and so we got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur Ford pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford was well aware of Houdini reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the\nTo Arthur Ford was well aware of who's in his reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and\nHe did this I got to jump in here forgive me Thomas I got to jump in we've got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini and best Houdini here's Jean night taking us into the break was do me on coast to coast am [noise]\nMorning noon or night cardio mobile that you take on limited medical great EKG they go ahead and enjoy the peace of mind ... today for just Ninety nine dollars is a cardio dot com\nThat's K. A. R. D. I. A. dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nThomas resentful my gas the author of living the paradox of enlightenment and the the essay\nWe're discussing a Houdini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical dot com at Thomas Thomas so let's get to the to say on a\nAt a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her a so ...\nJanuary of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there the the the medium would reached out to her or so so what happens [noise]\nUm Arthur Ford shows up and he Arthur Ford usually works with the spirit named Fletcher and Fletcher is in touch with Houdini and this ability for the spirit world to communicate to our physical world\nIs a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother the spirit of his mother was also present to make this all happened and they were able to make it kind of a um like a show or very theatrical show where\nHarry would work with best the same way they worked\nWhen they were on stage and use her as an assistant and and have her um well he was very poetic with are very at times very touching and romantic\nAnd ah there were statements like throw open the curtain and all of this but what they did was they put this ten\nKey words on the table and then they decoded them\nAnd after it was decoded the message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I Want to explain that that is a nickname that Harry used for her was Roosevelt and this came about through a popular song right around the time when they got married and this song had a little bit or perhaps more\nOf this song I'm inside her wedding ring and so have you called her Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was Roosevelt believe\nAnd it really really touched bass and she was very very strong and clear and her language that her husband had spoken to her\nAnd that anyone noted does anyone know did or the Ford no that Roosevelt was the pen name for best there was this common knowledge\nIt might have been known throughout the close friends um [noise]\nSo I really can't say about that there's a story going around that I read the other day on the Internet 'cause that's trying to brush up on his kind of set up someone said that out there was a big\nRomance between Arthur Ford and bass who is Twenty years older than he and he saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of it and saw where it said Roosevelt and blah blah blah\nI just don't find this critical so I won't go into it but um yeah there are people that say that it's quite possible that they would have known that he referred to as Roosevelt but the believe is actually came through the decoding of those other ... and ...\nAnd again he just he he didn't of of Ford through his spirit guide Fletcher just just didn't show the word believe they used the secret coating message and we had mentioned earlier using those keywords pray answer say now tell please speak quickly look can be quick in and these all\nWindy coded spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe\nYes yes and um she declared easy access she declared it a success correct\nAbsolutely and I'm In fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who is president to say on set off this is a lot of nonsense that wasn't true and and so that's\nThat's why her statement says regardless of any statements made to the contrary I Wish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence\nGiven to me by Arthur forward is the correct message pre arranged between Mr Houdini and myself and then it's signed by not only herbal three witnesses one of them as a representative of the United press\nAnother one is one of her life long friends\nAnd not only her but three witnesses one of them as a representative of the United press another one is one of her lifelong friends and another one is someone from Scientific American\nAnd these this this letter was reprinted in the New York times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this was a success that had happened\n[noise] yeah I think so in effect of the newspaper articles that I was reading you could clearly see here in support for a good while\nAnd then around ... fourteen months after that there is a hard switch where she suddenly start that they're now denounced it anything was valid that there was any evidence whatsoever\nThat this was a genuine contact so it's it's quite shocking um\nBut before that before she sort of recanted there was another a reporter with a ... a either a magazine or a newspaper called the New York graph or erratic rather than your graphic and tell me about this reporter ... is it ... ... I Can't pronounce the name but I don't remember one\nName but I think the first name as R. E. A. and I think it's pronounced ... right um she had an apartment and she invited\nArthur Ford over to visit her and she was going to interview him and she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in a closet but they're hiding somewhere they're going to witness this exchange well the person that shows up is not really author Fort it's someone that's been paid one person\nAte Arthur Ford and he shows up and he says uh I paid\nMrs Houdini some money she gave me the code\nI'm just here to tell you the truth [laughter] I just you know it's really funny because bats\nHeard about at well the reporter wrote this up and so has responded in a letter 'em to that same paper where she just completely denies it there she's been a party of fraud in any way and if Arthur Ford said\nThat they were in cahoots he's a liar I mean she was very clear in this letter it goes on and on and I had never seen this letter until um yesterday and it's in an article posted on a website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nThis was written to Walter wind chill the great Walter ...\nThat's what I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter ritual and he was um yes the social they go to guy you know and um but this kind of made it look like it was a letter written to this um the Newark evening graphic\nBut it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was very supportive and these these were supposed to be private letters\nLetter starts off saying this letter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity you know I'm just telling you I was no party Danny fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying oh we've got prove there's fraud he confessed\nAnd then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time\nSo Arthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point best Houdini further a muddy the water because although she has been insisting and insisting that had happened then she does an abrupt about face\nYes and you know in the very first days after the message happened in one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way my family and friends they don't buy this you know they don't believe\nNewspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way my family and friends they don't buy this you know they don't believe in their communication you know and so I mean I think that this faster and she was tired of being ridiculed by her friends\nBeing labeled and not um and I think she just folded and said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like\nIf anyone says they get in touch with me after my death and know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with anyone [noise]\nUm so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the sales and twenty nine was she recanted and changing their position\nI think it was about fourteen month\nFourteen months and but also she had at some point she had offered up a an award a reward ten thousand dollar prize to any one to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so we really interesting\nTo yeah because you know if he really wasn't boots with Arthur Ford he could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple of weeks before this happened I retracted the offer well that sounds you know pretty pretty iffy\nWhereas if they were in cahoots he could've said I'm so happy that she is so generous but I don't want my spiritual progress to be hindered by some kind of monetary motivation you know would have been much more graceful you see it I mean but it was just days after where she says I'm not going to pay the money [noise]", "show_name": "AM Idaho", "year": "2018", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "21"}
