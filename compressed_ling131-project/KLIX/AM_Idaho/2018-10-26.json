who work in the news rooms are afraid of Republicans um well you know\nJust how the part of the department of course when you have newsrooms dominated by liberals and socialists at and that's essentially what we've got we'll talk about that later this morning got a couple of things that I wanted to mention because\nMany of the candidates we've already seen come into the studio have talked about all of the explosive growth in Idaho with so many people wanting to come here and in settled in this community a Boise as well Boise was according to Bloomberg the other day\nThe number one destination for people now leaving California\nBecause they find the housing costs affordable and it doesn't matter to them that they've driven the housing costs up Eighteen percent in a year all that matters to them as it's still a heck of a lot cheaper than the bay area San Francisco or certain areas along the coast where they were working in the high tech industry there was a piece today from a writer at the hill by the name of Christian Tate\nHow the hell is a newspaper out of Washington if you didn't know that just passing that long and she is a a libertarian from California\nOn the hill as the newspaper out of Washington if you didn't know that just passing that long and she is a a libertarian from California I don't know that she still lives there but she says California runners pay an average of fourteen hundred forty dollars per month now that's the average\nWhen it comes to renting a place they're fourteen almost it's almost you know Fifteen hundred dollars per month on average that state wide and that tells you that obviously in certain places that's a lot higher than that\nLikely along the coasts under the national average is just a little over one thousand dollars per month so there's almost a a there's a four to five hundred dollar swing just in rental costs from that state to other parts of the country\nAnd she says it's because liberals and they're not in my backyard mentality hairstyle development of new affordable housing in that state from twenty eleven to twenty sixteen California increase spending not administration at more than double that a teacher

this morning news radio Thirteen to ...\nAnd those were the other two ten dot com we haven't seen Janice media and in the studio since probably July or August writes yeah earlier this summer I was going to say that we've been on the telephone quite a bit off and on during the course of the campaign uh how's the bus tour going I mean you're meeting a lot of people there and doing a lot of feedback that I'm sure\nWe are I think we were been two fifty some fifty plus cities and towns around the state and we're I'm getting to know each other very well on the bus and supporting each other as ... as the Republican team and\nSeeing really great turnout all across the state there's a lot of people that are enthused and coming out and um our job is to listen to the concerns of the people in all the different communities across our state that's the purpose of\nOur tour and we're hearing a lot of concern from people in Idaho\nMoney from an opponent or who I haven't heard from it probably will not that it's going to break my heart but I uh uh I noticed in a debate a couple of weeks ago she talked about being this is the latest thing they're all calling themselves the Democrats and liberals are calling themselves moderates\nAnd saying they're looking for compromise and it works well because apparently it sells the folks in the newspaper industry they buy into that and a very easily fooled I guess the adult uh but you see your opponent or some sort of a moderate in any way\nOh well I mean if you take a look at the people and the groups that have endorsed her campaign she is not anywhere close to being a moderate she is she is a very progressive socialist individual who wants to bring her and her\nHer running mate on the gubernatorial ticket they want to bring a whole new\nWay of government to Idaho that is very different from the traditional values and a solid conservative print principles and independent practice that we love so much about Idaho\nI was going to say one area that I Know that has really uh it probably is been fairly start if you know you talk about things like gun rights a\n... they're all trying to solve federal lists are playing well I support with the way that they're trying to massage their support for this to make it sound or appear but they backed the second amendment you know if they were playing twister they would have thrown out of hip already\n[laughter] well I what I say is I ... I vowed to protect our Second Amendment rights and I will do everything I can for us to be able to defend ourselves and\nWe have our constitution is perfectly written I support our constitution the way it's written and it says that there shall be no\nRestrictions on licensing and firearms and and registration of guns and that's what both my opponent and the gubernatorial candidate are calling for so my vow is I I Will protect that\nThat value that right that inherent right that we as Idaho and we as Americans have\nA lot of your job is going to be providing the Senate or right and and then you're going to be filling in for the governor when the governor happens to be out of state if there's anything with data comes\nTone as a legitimate governor and when when you look out and he was a girl could come January I'm going to be one of those jobs what do you start by doing what you have like a checklist but you're going to be going through when you're going to do right off the bat\nWell the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to learn ... refreshed the procedures and the rules of the Senate there are a little different than in the house\nAnd that's a big difference between myself and my opponent I've had ten years of experience serving in a legislature I ... I can hit the ground running come January I Know how to dress solid legislation as many friends that still serve in the legislature so when it comes to advancing and promoting solid sound\nConstitutional policy for Idaho ... to protect our rights as a sovereign state I'm the candidate who has the know how to do that and\nHas the relationships with those that are there now and working with them and building a solid line of open communication because that's how I Believe is the best path\nFor policy is building relationships and having good communication within the legislative branch and the executive branch of government and that's what I really look forward to being able to help contribute in that way\nYou could also point out to the uh the district that has built a model lottery were coming from the eastern Idaho and you'll get a good look every day\nOr you know ... when we can't really say Idaho Falls is to urban looks just like a big town would you do you have this mix where you live\nA very weird recalls rule of some of those highly or drive over there where you are in through the fields are absolutely beautiful but but you you're going to be able to bring a perspective I guess she portion of it often isn't necessarily represented near the top level\nWell and that's another difference between myself and my opponent is that\nUh she comes from the great state of Asia and I am from southeast Idaho and I think that Idaho and deserve to have good broad\nPerspective representation and as I as we are as a team as we travel around the state and we go into these smaller rural communities and I see these hard\nWorking honest sincere Idaho ... many of them who are struggling and hurting because some of the more liberal policies of the prior administration and\nExtreme environmentalists groups are working to shut down our rural economies and these families they just want to be left alone they they're hardworking they don't need the government to take care of things for them they they can take care\nOf themselves and what some of the industry and work that they've done their families have done for generations is at\nRisk today and so I think that it's really critical that we do have good representation from across the state in the executive branch of government and that's what I have to offer\nGot about a forty seconds to go up again we're we're always like there are people contact information Web based bigger like\nYou go to Janice for Idaho that's the easiest you come to my website will pop up please send me a message Janice for Idaho there I have a Facebook page or very active on social media I ask for your ... your support on November six or sooner you can vote earlier I'm\nI'm a solid constitutional conservative I'm pro life I vowed to protect your Second Amendment I vowed to protect the sovereignty of the state of Idaho I vowed to make sure\nThat our government remains efficient and serves the taxpayer and the voter of Idaho and respect your hard earned tax dollars on mixture being a small business owner like so many others I make sure that\nGovernment couldn't function I think without that knowledge\nRarely totally agree I totally agree and I think they need to fill a void in different spots like that and it's a professional\nOne where over the years we've our office we've where you had the Boise cascades and the albertson's and all these big corporate offices there in Boise at the time become instill from us so we'd end up training them and getting them prepared and you have accountants and payroll and technical people on the computer world they'd come and it was easy to offer more money at these other corporate job so\nYou know what the economy the way it is we have a great staff we set a great culture in our office of where family and we are strong in that and so we've been able to hold on to him\nWhen I mentioned it's at six forty end up brand as well for a state controller a joining us uh he's part of the Republican we were joking earlier unfair\nAnd a gun or maybe two that are there is a good care of and and this is the one that's traveling all forty four counties of Idaho hour at forty four I magic value this morning with Bill ... when you're out there on the road and you know you're getting a lot of feedback from the public uh that when he heard specifically ah especially directed\nYou know is it's tied to me bill is and the thing that I've had a passion for his transparency\nAs you look over the last several probably years and even back probably the last couple of decades the trust in government is that an all time low and and and citizens and people are like why why is that you know I think there's a lack of transparency and so it's the people's money\nMoney is being spent and so over the when I first became controller six years ago I created a transparency website and it's been great for the media as citizens state agencies everyone that uses that\nBut I felt like we can ticket another step further and so um you know you had nine eleven you have these different things where we come together as a nation and not in the trust in government kind of goes back up a little bit but it's come back down\nAnd I feel that this is an opportunity even as the controller my way of reaching out and helping them working with the citizens of sharing that transparency so in the next couple of months we're going to create and an updated website they'll have more data more opportunities for assistance to get out and one last point bill is\nUm I Want to work with local governments cities the county say twin falls the cities that are here in the county and throughout the state and even the school districts\nYou may want to look at bill and say hey what are the state or the city in the county employees or how much is being spent on building a new school I ... I Am sure citizens want to see that I hear that and that's the thing I keep hearing on the bus tour as its ties to the state controller\nHow how how how how how important it is it or is it that you have a good relationship with a legislature as well as governor and other office holders in the state\n[noise] well I can just sharing example yesterday we were down with a an I. R.\nS. issue at payroll with legislators and with them as it ties to the end of the year here I can pick up the phone and\nI can call Senate pro tem Britain hail and I can call speaker Becky and I can talk to the governor and and the attorney general real quick some of them obviously we're on the bus but I can call them up I was calling the speaker has gone um the pro tem brand hail and in ... but it's having that relationship that they trust and respect and I think that's a big thing over the years\nYou know yes I'm a younger I'm forty six but I've been through this for Twenty one years in the office but I Hope I've gained that trust and respect because that goes a long way in today's world\nNow we we talked about you know what you're doing on the Web offers wise campaigned buys\nYou can probably find you to they can you can find me a brand wolf dot com or Facebook and Twitter I'm ... I'm On the post and um you know that in many ways that I enjoy that because I think a lot better\nGoes back to what we said earlier though about the fact that I think there's ... there's a more level of trust of a Republican handling money\nI I Hope that's the case and I believe that you know my mom was give me a hard time saying you know I think you're doing a good job or no one wants to do that and I know moms give you a humble pie [laughter] but uh I I\nHope you're right bill I I think that's the case I Hope that that people have that trust and respect me from both sides\nAnd the other part is I Want to show my unity that's why I'm On this bus tour I trust than I respect and I believe in my my teammates that are here running constitutionally and for our congressional staff I Believe in them I Want to see them through on November six and that's why I'm here on this tour\nIs you know I Know that it's a long term but it's got to be fun at times to\nOh yes I Know I don't know if they show do you have music as we get off it's the same song it's a Justin Timberlake a from a trolls we have that music as we dance off get us pumped up to keep us going there are some long days but you

into cello and I hear your ... other people on the bus you know how to get to twin falls uh yeah I did not get too and I grew\nI was gonna say you know it's it's an interesting a group of people that are on this bus because you've got folks from all over the state in Ireland I I've been you know asking them about the reactions you're getting to win the bus pulls into these different communities because [noise]\nUh let's let's face it if you're in a year in eastern Idaho or southern Idaho or north Idaho or or somewhere in the capital district area sometimes the concerns when people are going to be ... maybe ... some of them are the same obviously but there's got to be some variance and\nYeah there's a lot of difference and it's different north to south it's different east to west or the concerns that they have\nThe way they articulate those concerns and um you know the the history of the state is very does while the topography is buried as well that\nTo the to the mix that's why it's really important for us to go out to those communities because we get the here the world from their perspective and as a decision maker that is critical information that doesn't mean that their view is necessarily complete complete because there's a bigger picture\nBut you have to know the smaller parts to see the bigger picture as well just like a television screen\nOr the the pixels are your are your are your computer screen that affects those that come in our small but you need to have them to see the the broader picture\nNow one of the interesting things about your office and uh because just before a steep left the studio or we're talking off ... you made a reference to litigation but you know you do you do some\nBecause just before a steep left the studio or we're talking off air and you you made a reference to litigation but you know you do you do some criminal\nProsecution wrecked but you do a lot of other legal efforts in that offers to and and and I think for from the public's perspective they see that the criminal prosecutions but they that's really the tip of the iceberg correct\nIt's only a one small slice of the of the pie that ... that I Am involved in I have a\nTwo hundred people in my office about a hundred and twenty lawyers give or take and ah\nWe are responsible for two major things number one we give legal advice to a all stayed officers\nThat doesn't mean they they necessarily follow that advice but we are required to give them advice or based on legal issues that's not the policy issues it's the legal issues and secondly then after they make their decisions or if the states sue someone or the state has sued by someone my office is responsible for\nA representing the state in court\nSo we have those two a basic pots of things that we do but uh so we're involved in the litigation we don't actually make the decisions\nBut at the most part there that's the difference between what you see maybe with a local prosecutor's office versus what do you see at the same level right and a local\nProsecutors ... coming in two flavors there when the city attorneys and they had to do a lot of civil war for their for their uh cities but they also then prosecute misdemeanors the county prosecutor\nHas a responsibility to prosecute misdemeanors uh in that occurred in the county outside of the incorporated cities and also all felonies that occur in the in the county\nAnd but they also have a a a work load of civil matters that they work on for the for the county as well they are the county attorney in that in that aspect\nI wanted to mention it's nine minutes after seven o'clock on metric valley this morning and worked forty three a state attorney general Laurence while I was in the studio with us a bill collie with you until ah ten am this morning and uh we one thing I'm sure that you get some tremendous public tour\nThirteen thousand on selected new for the Chevy GMC drugs every used trucking as you being stock has been just kind of thousands of little retail bulls\nWere on base or shatter our rule uh giving away three hundred brand new hunting rifles and shotguns during our mosques and truck sales not only do you see thousands on a new or use trucker SUV you get a gun to take a short drive the savings from anywhere in the valley to any of our settling auto racing dealerships\nMountain home already in Ontario or bigger city the auto ... are only a few minutes away check out all the deals with details on line that go on a ranch dot com customers comply with all federal and state laws to take possession of a firearm\nAgriculture news that affects you brushing abide schooler count on schooler people use radio certain gene ten K. L. I. X. American Farm Bureau federation\nThose changes in the IRS rooms they are the egg information network of the way the American Farm Bureau federation is recommending that the IRS changes and you didn't tell us about this American farm\nJak putting them so the American foreign bureaus recommend in the IRS changed the ... amendment to tax cut because\nBasically threatens the viability of keep programs work to preserve farmland and open space and protecting the conserving farm land pasture Greenwich land is a priority\nFor American farmers and ranchers say one way to permanently do that separate the

jobs were there at to change what our mark Johnson said we are not only edited out the word in their own and doing so they changed the meaning of the center and\nNow the people behind prop one are promising to donate profits to charity but there is no\nOh we were just talking off air uh that our our next guest has done probably a few dozen of these types of interviews or a magic valley this morning we're at seven twenty two and it's forty five on news radio Thirteen Gen\nX news radio Thirteen ten dot com I Would tend to governor Brad little joining us in Studio and it's likely going to be in a couple of months\nOr that that lieutenant isn't raised off the office door and it's just with Governor or they'll probably with you as well this morning a you know nobody that I have enough personnel look I'm a thanks for having me good to have you know nobody in politics ever takes anything lightly everyone obviously\nA when you're doing this you know you're ... you look at things and you realize sometimes forest fallout sky small anything can happen in the course of eleven days but you've got to be feeling I Would think very confident going down the stretch well\nWe feel All right but you know we don't want to take anything for granted or any voter for granted a I'm running for governor of the whole state of Idaho so or you know I'd I'd love to have a hundred percent of the vote adult take fifty percent plus one but uh\n[noise] but I'd love to have a hundred percent of the vote and that's why we're going everywhere\nThis bus tour is so unique and the other candidates who've been in with us this morning of all they're talking about\nIt I had a friend a fishing game on time assess Idaho's really like four different states because of the geography and the different interest and they're like so you've got to be getting feedback from people and obviously the feedback you might get in the capital district versus north Idaho versus the east and then ... south or you know ... if you start to probably put all this together and\nThat was why students and it's like the pixels that make up your TV picture and eventually it all comes together a sort of feedback\nYou get well you know I I've spent my whole life uh you know I had when I was ... we are cousins lived here in twins so I mean my whole life has been going around the state of Idaho whether it was in leadership in agriculture business or education or philanthropies so I ...\nI've this is not my first rodeo ah\nAround the state of Idaho and in fact\nWhen ... when I got married forty years ago she went on the gym a clear purpose I've we came home we got married in the summer and I came home and I went up to the ranch and ah she went on the gym Claire best forty years ago so is my first or\nBus tour either a you know I I I never rode it when I was when I was range and but I always I always supported the candidate so when the bus got into our local area around damn it I was always on the bus there so I've I've been on the bus quite a few times\nFrom what I've seen you know when the real campaign season got started around Labor Day uh I think that people can say that the campaign you run has been a it's been a ... compared to what we may be seeing elsewhere has been a let's say non controversial or is that a good way to put that\nWell I mean ... ...\nI'm pretty much an open book I have ... people do what my positions are and and I I Hope in ... you never want to take this for granted but I Hope I Know what's important to the people in the different communities uh\nThat's that's part of the job is to be able to to put all those different ah\nGroups together I always had a good relationship with the legislature weather before I was serving when I was serving a now and you know that's one of your ... and that's\nOne of your best connections or whether it's the legislature locally elected officials a school board and every one of those are are you know your connection with that community plus come into the community and I've done a lot of economic development work here in the ... valley\nJust know that day and and I see sometimes keep running in politics positions change and\nAnd I have to wonder okay what else are they not always being up front with me about and uh and I know you don't necessarily want to dwell on the opposition\nBut I I don't think that you've had any point where anybody is as you said they they pretty much know where you stand at this point but you you got to look at that and you got to say hey you know for for most voters perspective who do you trust and I guess you'd have to write on you could make a pretty good argument you're the guy\nWell I Hope so I mean you you work at it every day is to you know we people change their positions but so to sort of a lot of things change but I might have been pretty steady all along people do what they get with me\nUh when when this is all over with and I needed plans might be to probably take a little bit of a breather but then you've got to start preparing for that transition what's on the agenda well\nIf we're fortunate enough and believe me we're not taken for granted I ... you know on this trip people want to ask me about ... after the election then why after the election said look we're we're focusing on one date that's getting all the votes we can ah\nA week from next Tuesday and but you know you do have to uh it was interesting when I was in college I took one political science class and I took it from a guy named ... and he was the budget director for Cecil Andrus Andrus got elected after years and years of Republican or\nAdministration and they had to put a budget together in a very\nLimited amount of time after having a pretty hostile relationship with Governor Sam is and and you know for only have one political science class I took a good one because\nThey you know we talked about you know the challenges of starting flat footed not having any people embedded into the ministry and and having to put\nA budget together obviously if we're lucky enough I've got a big advantage 'cause you know I Know most people and it'll be much friendlier a\nBit but it is a challenge it's one of the things that in a a constitutional republic that ... that peaceful change of power is\nIs a challenging time uh there's a lot of you know you've got appointments to make you got budget to do you got to draft a state of the state uh there's a lot of work to do and and uh so\nThere may be a vacation but it'll be a pretty short one is there's a lot of work to do\nRound about a minute or anything I didn't mention that you think people should know going into the last ten eleven days\nNo it's the most important thing is people need to get out a\nMysterious things happen when there is a low turnout and I uh I went to magic valley to be very well represented in this election it's important not only for ... for all the constitutional races we've got a congressional race it's up there is local races and it's really\nImportant that people participate is it's the essence of our of our government\nFor a for people lost their would like to know more about the campaign uh everybody's got the website up right at this point that it probably for a long time by a ...\nA ... that's ... right yep at a widow and a confusing if there's no reason for a for their number for a and and you've got a Facebook presence as well as I understand yes we do\nWe want to thank you for coming by today or we wish you good luck and\nUh uh you know I think that some of us have a good feeling about this I Know that I I'm not the guy on the hot seat but uh we look forward to talking to you again thanks ville alright super a news coming up by lieutenant governor Brad little\nOr that had traveled all over the nation and he sat and listen to me talk about that statistic of how manipulative as it is and how it came from a Washington DC based media outlet and who it's funded by is also quite shocking too but\nThat's a conversation for a different day but he said when I finished speaking to the crowd I said well you're not forty eighth our kids are doing great um\nWe had a a five year plan for education we're seeing those games you know get everybody's doing a great job of course we have things that we need to work on a but you know we need to work on the educators origin safety but any way back to the keynote speaker who had been traveling all over the nation I said we're not forty eight now by a long shot [noise]\nAnd he stood up and he said well that's interesting superintendent he borrowed because I was\nTraveling in Alaska is claiming that they're forty eighth and in the office claiming that there forty eight and the crowd just fell apart laughing so\nAgain another proof that it's a very manipulative statistic\nWondered why not sure either joining us studio a\nA recall it you know from the commercialism director or your super into under grudge superintendent of public instruction you'll find out on the ballot if you're not you're quoted you'll funded election days forty\nEight seven forty one on march it's always this morning on news radio Thirteen to ... it was really owe Thirteen to ... college for a lot of people out there who who uh\n...\nA lot of calls on the public at least for a greater emphasis\nOn on ... and you mentioned your husband's back Romeo force we got an excellent education and and the first one it was a lot of new jobs out there were coming along and they really you know I I uh my background or you know in college I don't do a lot with my hands in\nOur phone when I graduated you know there weren't a lot of jobs available for people are just really I mean just back\nBut at the backgrounds of them so we we have an emphasis I guess a renewed emphasis in Idaho on train those people for the future\nCorrect we used to call a vocational technical education and now we call it the tea or career technical education\nOr and what we've done to really build strength surround keeping our kids in Idaho and a crew technical education has something called badges where kids can earn a badge is as they work through their career technical education or uh like I said it used to be called vocational tech to vote tech\nFor short back in the day when I was a kid um but they can or badges\nWhich tells the world what they can do a career technical education touches every a component of the job market today you know it's an agriculture um it's a natural resources that's in business and so um it's a way to keep kids in school it's a way to keep our students in Idaho staying in Idaho\nI'm an over eighty thousand kids in the state of Idaho are now taking career technical education and earning those badges that show the world what it is that they can do is also on the job training its apprenticeships also the state of Idaho which ah we're very proud of\nRecently just lowered the opportunity down to our middle school students seventh and eighth graders to have the opportunity to join career technical education classes\nAre so we are seeing the gains and that\nUm there's lots of benefits for making sure that we connect the dots for kids the other thing we want to do is make sure our students have a foot in both lanes so we also offer college entrance exams for all students at the same time while if they choose to go into a career technical education at anytime they changed their mind or they have a foot in both lanes for their career path\nI was gonna say or are you know those of us will that liberal arts background there's nothing wrong with that with the matter is you know I could fix a pivot to save my life right those are the key things that we need to look at it\nRight and we're hearing over and over again how folks are saying you know I I Need my mechanic I Need\nA someone in my ... my guy who comes in and fixes my dishwasher I well you can't find those people those days um and again that's how we increase graduation rates that's how we keep kids engaged are interested in and using their hands and interested\nIn those careers specifically and we know as adults that we need those folks I couldn't fix a dishwasher or washing machine and I know nothing about cars\nAre so we we really need to make sure that we're connecting kids to careers of out of that nature\nI Know like a lot about the automobile you put some gas and it turned ... exactly exactly\nAnd and the other thing a lot of that is a motivation and human nature\nUh you know those the our kids have the right to choose the past that they want to take we just want to make sure that they're well prepared we all know when we were Eighteen how many of\nUs couldn't make a decision back then I have an Eighteen year old home at home right now is a public school student who has changed his mind the last three months several times we want to make sure that our kids are well prepared\nWell rounded and have a foot in both laying should they change their mind later\nAnd sure you're very much for coming barge widowed or superintendent of public instruction
