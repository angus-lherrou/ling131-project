L. A. X. the news radio searching ten dot com so Rosie O'Donnell says it's time for a military coup and they all sit around a chuckle about it\nAs well I don't know about oh maybe ha ha ha ha ha oh isn't that go well I don't think by the way that the military which side with liberals have them around the polling data in the military times the overwhelming majority of the troops are far more conservative than the public at large\nYou know people say well the military is just a subset of the uh the larger culture yes uh but primarily a larger conservative culture is what it's a subset of and I don't think that they'd be up to\nRemove a president to it's been pretty good to them\nWhen in fact I think in their view or they didn't much like the guy who was an office before Donald Trump media also very upset now they're trying to say Well Donald Trump is showing this true colors when it comes of course he doesn't care about the show because look what he said while he was in Butte, Montana\nLast night with a congressman great Jim forte Archie and fourteen known for a putting a lot down on a reporter a couple of years ago\nWho says about [noise] you know we've had people who are on live television all over the place and we've had people get up speak for twenty twenty five minutes [noise] and these guys are going crazy that's not that the [noise] Greg it's by by the way never wrestle him\nAny\nGuy that get your body clammy my cat\n[noise] God\nSo media not happy about that obviously when they heard it and they're not happy about it this morning riding at the New York times the Bible of American liberalism oh we have a writer but anyway David Leonhardt who does a daily update at that newspaper on various news items and he writes the voters of Montana elected Gina forty\nAnyway so he's talking about how ... uh what what happened if you recall the story\nWas a reporter from the daily mail a British paper kept pestering him while he was trying to do an interview with someone else and GM Ford he kept saying okay I'm In the middle of something else and finally ... body slammed him and and stopped\nHim a couple of times June forty ended up pleading guilty to the assault and had to go to anger management and do some of those things but it angers\nMainstream media that he got elected anyway well why did he get elected by voters in Montana which isn't it totally wrecked state I mean obviously they've got some Democrats an office there governor and one US Senator so why are they all lead strategy and forty does the media says the media should know\nYou're not terribly popular with the American public media says well that's because we tell them the truth and they don't want to hear the truth is that it is that all of it\nUnderstand the scientific studies they cover yeah there is a shocker [laughter] I majored in science and high school so last time I paid any attention to it I have to admit other than the fact that I took a biology course in college and I did really really well and a couple of courses in a genealogy did really really well there too\nAnd so I Try to keep an open mind\nAbout like a lot of media people I'm sure\nThat they beyond high school they have a you know while we dissect that a couple of frogs and Mr shared in class back in Nineteen Seventy eight that's or their knowledge of science the second thing that whiplash news coverage\nThe writer says of the Massachusetts Democrats self own says about the press is that some newsrooms see more than willing to parents certain legislators talking points I'm critically so willing that they will drop all standards of scrutiny in service of adding said lawmakers in other words she's not Trump therefore\nWe're going to publish whatever she says what amazed me in the early hours of that story when it broke up that morning earlier this week the headlines all where wow like Donald Trump is going to have to pay up as a million dollars wow this is about the war on drugs he actually is I landed American the term they use for\nIndigenous people and and so they they they ran with us and then as the story started to unravel is the day or on the headlines\nOr or indigenous people and and so they they they ran with us and then as the story you start to unravel is the day or on the headlines change do you think they said well what about the war isn't much of an Indian at all no no no the headline says Donald Trump makes fun of Elizabeth Warren Donald Trump is me and again the women\n[noise] so\nThey would not have it and say hey this woman's fall about ... ... no instead it was like here's another opportunity to attack from let's just changed the wording a little bit and go forward with all of that and the worst that I've seen is over at\nMSG and see where there was an anchor of the other day he was criticizing the Cherokee Nation for its objections to war and\nThey say that overall centrally belittles whatever they went through or at six forty one magic value this morning news radio Thirteen chat and kale I acts and news radio Thirteen ten dot com if there's any group of people on this planet who have a legitimate\nPoint\nA about what happened to them it's the Cherokees who were living in Georgia who had westernized who had their own communities you know mainstream stores shops houses they dressed like as the white Americans who lived in Georgia and then there were suddenly up road that marched halfway across the country and dumped in a barren\nLand so they may have a very legitimate grievance\nAnd then they turn around and they say well you know it wasn't about the war is not doing anybody any favors especially us\nAnd the media instead attacks them to defend Elizabeth Warren now\nThe Cherokee and the trail of tears have been a rallying cry for\nPeople throughout the last couple of centuries almost two centuries\nAnd yet all of a sudden they're getting thrown overboard because you know as one might put a hurting on Donald Trump and the media itself into years that's what the media is thinking so we get back to this point why are they so upset when people at a rally in Montana shared last night when Trump complimented\nThe representative from Montana ... for a body slamming a liberal reporter\nWhy do they why are they so upset that the people in Montana than actually two years ago when it happened a year and a half ago I guess it was a special election when those people when those people still supported Jim forty at the polls\nBecause\nThe public knows what you're up to and what your all about

don't get any answers there then I guess you could fan\nOut and you could I'll blame it on Donald Trump or your boss or whoever else but to start their\nStart always do the little stuff criticism\nBecause you don't see that in the media wants to integrate while you know they'll do something it'll be a really terribly botched story and I'm thinking about the one with John Edwards about ten years ago remember when he fathered the baby out of wedlock with a woman or not his wife his wife who was suffering from cancer and it would eventually die\nAnd the media wouldn't go with a story\nMedia ignored it cause Edwards was a media as early and then when it was finally broke into the national Enquirer the media had to say well aware of it is two and then you tune into these these

...\nDid you get older you know a lot of things I ... I I can tell you right now when I was still in my forties\nI felt like a young man and I mean they were mentally I still feel like a man but\nEggs and pains and various things a lot of times because you know you were maybe a bit of a rough house with your kid he comes back to haunt you and your later but it's other things too that start to buy the hearings a good example hearing loss\nObviously is going to affect you at some point if you live long enough which is why we recommend that you check in with mount Harris and all your allergy Rupert where they want you to be able to ask any sort of question you have\nAbout you're hearing they do offer a free initial consultation with one of the doctors have all the allergy that allows you to discuss your concerns and a friend like one on one interview no pressure to buy anything the experience providers there's three of them\nAre able to explain the science of how you hear how hearing loss affects your health and why choosing to address a possible hearing loss happens to be important and they look forward to meeting you you didn't telephone to zero eight three one two zero nine\nFive seven that's two zero eight three one two zero nine five seven their schedule your free initial consultation today coming up on seven twenty four now and a half\nWay with you on them actually found this morning until ten am got an interesting personal story I've got to share but there's a warning in here I guess for everybody\nI got out of work yesterday and I've made a quick stop at a gas station and then up at home and I got home and I was sitting down at the computer at home just to take care of a couple of small things when I got a text message on my telephone and it was from my bank and my bank\nSaid did you make a purchase ... with uh\nYour card ending in such and such a number of they'll give you the last war numbers at Walmart for forty eight dollars and it was forty eight dollars and eighty seven sets\nAnd it didn't say on what date and you know I don't I'm sitting there trying to think well OK have I been to Walmart recently that well it probably was there a few days ago so I got\nUp and I looked around or some papers and what did you know what I still have the cell slip and I had not spend that amount of money so now growing really really curious picked up the telephone and I I called my bank which by the way trying to get a live person [laughter] right here into involves at my bag a\nPunch one for the last two for that three for this for for that and finally when I found somebody to talk to they happened to be far far away you know all of our\nAttendance are busy at the moment please wait which means there's probably just one person answering telephone calls as they come in but within Fifteen minutes a woman came on the line and and we got to talking and I she asked me some security questions and I answered those and then she said well\nShe said we don't actually say well you there today who send these out\nAnd she said but she said it was a purchase somebody tried to make on that card number today at a Wal Mart and I think she told me it was in I think it was ... I'm unveiled Georgia\nDouglas, Georgia that was that and I said well I'm I'm sitting at home and twin Falls Idaho right now I haven't been to Georgia today and I said I'm not sure I've ever been to Georgia I've got to correct that later on but\nThe ... in my mind I was thinking gee what am I going to Georgia\nAnd so she said well apparently somebody there tried to use the card for purchasing the groceries section of Wal Mart she said the groceries actually maybe maybe it was for other thanks to the card got denied and somebody's you know cause modern technology is great in the sense that\nIt'll it'll detective purchased like that 'cause they could they could see that I had made a purchase that the gas station and\nOr they could also see that you know that tried to make a person purchased in Georgia might not necessarily be happening within an hour of the purchase amazing twin falls so the card got pulled\nIn Georgia might not necessarily be happening within an hour of the purchase I made and twin falls so the card\nGot cold I mean I've got to get a new card\nAnd had that taken care of of course just before the weekend that's convenient but we've been hearing these warnings we often have people come from law enforcement into our studio and they they talk about this and you know the security of of these things is is is not always easily done\nAnd we deal a lot with these devices called skimmers now this is the second time this has happened\nTo me in life are about half a dozen years ago or so\nI was on my way to a speaking engagement and I was going to New Jersey of all places and I was on my way to a speaking engagement in Wildwood New Jersey\nAnd ah I stopped to use up at a at a machine an automated machine to get a little bit of it wasn't my bank machine it was one in inside a gas station and I use it to get a little cash\nThat I was going to need for my trip to New Jersey and not long after that I got a call a from the bank or know what happened and I went into a diner to use the card\nFor breakfast and it got rejected and ah and I called the bank and they said yeah they should we put a hold on the card\nBecause somebody that casino in upstate New York tried to use your number to make a withdrawal for forty five hundred bucks a oh boy that's a pretty nasty and eventually that turned out to be a Bulgarian criminal gangs that was behind\nThat but they they had done to one or two things I was told by the the trooper I talked to who who eventually ended up the rest of these people\nFunny because he called me back like a year later on which I thought it was very nice of him but he called me back about a year later he said one or two things happen and they put a scam or on the machine that you likely used at that gas station that day and then the numbers are you know they end up being used somewhere far far\nAway they said number two\nHe said somebody at the gas station they pay somebody a couple of hundred bucks to give them a series of numbers that may have been used as so it could be used as somewhere else and somebody just collected your number and I thought about that that could possibly be true because I had been relatively close to that casino in upstate New York only a couple of months before\nAll of this went down so we don't know exactly where this out but it was funny because I was at a place a couple of weeks ago and I literally got out of the car\nAnd I checked to ensure there was no skimmer there and ah\nAnd looked at all over the other part of this has to you know they they may have a camera hidden and they'll try to read your PIN number to shoot type it in so you've got to try to do your best to cover up that that PIN number as well and so this is going to become increasingly a problem because that the folks who the criminals are getting more and more sophisticated with us all of the time and\nAnd so my situation just as a you know happy\nSomebody caught this right away and\nI looked through all the banking records on the computer and it doesn't look likely that any other issues come up but it could be a serious problem and you could be far away from home and one thing I was doing when I was on vacation this past summer I called the bank and all of these card companies and said look I'm going to be in these couple of states just to let you know\nEight years there's got to be fine a just got to\n[noise] [noise] that's all\nThe time to make America great again like America\nI didn't just Nineteen days the people of this incredible state are going just said you're Matt Rosendale to the U.S Senate to protect\n[noise]\nHad protect your Second Amendment which is under siege [noise]\nI I Do wonder of the president going to be or how they actually got him do is event because a few driven through there lately I was through there a couple of months ago and let me put it this way or the construction going on in that city is massive\nBody that they have they they don't really have several\nExits going off the highway I think it down to one and in several\nAccidents and portions of the highway been completely torn up I mean there's not even pavement there anywhere just piles of dirt I don't think probably that the president's motorcade had to deal with all of that they probably had an alternative\nRoute plan it out which meant that on on some of the city streets downtown everything I had to be shut down while they Kimberlin true and uh and probably were shut down until he went rolling back out which means if if you weren't\nAs we invent that he

she's a doctor by the way the doctor who came to this country legally married a guy here\nGot a child by him but she's worried about going to the women infants and children program to get assistance because Trump will deport her if she's a doctor I I'm going to bet she probably knows better than that and you wonder who put her up to all of this call to Europe next year on the air on ... go ahead\nAnd learning how are you today it's a wonderful day yeah it's crazy guy\nCall yesterday that isn't quite all bear that was against early voting I Want to encourage everyone I'm Seventy eight years old and I'm going to do my early ... I live on Ninety and it is so low that did early voting there you know\nShe just check and you get your vote and it is secured nobody catches that we think is that correct with every thing else so I encourage everyone to go out there early voting to cook it that piece of cake\nI thought so too and none of my co workers was telling me yesterday she was on her lunch hour a Tuesday and she said she decided to stop and do it simply because she said I'm election day she's really busy and and uh this is an opportunity we will ... she said there was absolutely no line when she\nGot right right right

running for\nOffice would prefer that we just confined to that one day because they say it makes it difficult to a political campaign with all of this and I don't know it will ever be a majority of people going out and voting early anyway but it it it it certainly is a\nI Do it because of the job because I Know I'm going to be really tied up on election day and after waiting thirty eight minutes in line to vote two years ago not ... not being a presidential election wouldn't be quite probably that long\nBut but still you know the day for me is going to be about twenty hours of work so I just thought this is a convenience and I guess that's the real reason behind it it becomes a convenience and if you've already made up your mind\nAnd a lot of people have I did read though where in Texas a somewhat humorous in Texas the absentee ballots were being mailed to people apparently by Democrats were mailing them out from the Democrat Party headquarters in rural\nAlready checking off the box that the people who requested these were citizens you you you wouldn't think that the liberals might\nBe trying to pull a fast one would you [noise] know never [noise] so those ballots are going to
