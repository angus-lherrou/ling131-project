Kevin O's I think in early fifties like fifty two or three or something like that\nSo there's a real good chance that he'll be there for twenty five thirty years\nHe's what fifties now he's early

Thirty years and and so it's ... the controlled by even you know the control power there was an argument presented\nIn the last couple of days that said we need to expand the Supreme Court to in love and\nMembers [noise] and I thought to myself um why would you want to do that a Trump is there even if you expand that to eleven he's going to nominate two more\nIdeological judges and and uh\nInstead of having a five and four you're going to have a seven before so the expanding it to end their grasping at every each stupid thing they can get their hands on to try to turn around and our first caller this morning\nI'm the hurricane now takes lead news lead headline position over all the stuff ... yes that's sounds a little bit uncomfortable but\nThe Democrats lost that battle but the Democrats behind the hurricane that Democrats are trying to flex yup there no no no they're trying to blow it out of here [laughter] Trump Trump is global warming Trump is vying to hurricane [laughter]\nThat's why it is that that's how come is that the new considers that is that right there if they if we had subscribed to and and I agreed with the Paris climate accord this would not be happening oh we have another caller already this morning or good morning welcome thank you\nYeah I um I think the Republicans are missing a a real opportunity a\nViolent taken advantage of what are the left to judge Kavanaugh\nIn a campaign ads are because there are a lot of people that because they watch CNN MSNBC and so forth are not aware of a lot of the things that were done to judge Kavanaugh and I\nI really think that if there were a campaign ads that came out and said uh that you know is is the party that you would it be affiliated with and make it a you know just put out some of that stuff that has been put out to the general public because of the news that they watch 'em\nBecause I really get the feeling that a lot of Democrats\nAre Democrats because they'd always happy and they really don't know what their party stands for if they showed pictures of Atlanta ga they show the parts of this mess that are that they pulled on a judge cabinet oh\nI think a lot of minds with fake at least think you know I Am I really you know tied to the to the right party here and there\nAre others that were really miss an opportunity if if we don't\nDo that as Republicans are thank you\nThank you thank you that's good and and you know um I I look at that same thing and I said to myself okay as a\nRepublican person what do we need to do to capitalize on this whole cock eyed thing and and I look at this article by a known and Victor Davis\nAnd and he points out two or three major major problems that I bet there are so large scale that most people just can't get their head around somebody who's ... he's a little bit to intellectual and his ah\nAt article ... uh most people you've got to read it in a couple of free time to figure out where he's going but you know one of the things that they wanted to destroy was the old white male syndrome how many times did we hear that\nI don't like that I Wish we did have more of the exposure to what are the Republicans really pushing and how are they doing it we don't have\nTo do that here in Idaho therefore we do not get the huge financial resources to engage in that particular argument it's it's not right it's just the way it is and and I don't know if we can ever get a change that here we are\nAnd so we'll just kind of plow along down the road and you say to ourselves okay we will hang tough right where we are there are plenty of items in Idaho that causes a lot of anxiety and concern\nAnd and when did we see little tiny fishers into or the foundation that if we don't control them and and manage them eventually they take over and we wake up one morning and look around and say holy Moses how did this happen where have we been that we just sat\nAnd watched and allowed this thing to take over that's

... they call it the city club is kind of it as an informal organization that was put together um maybe a year ago to a\nInvite ended courage a public conversation on various issues that come up\nThe may have a far reaching or reaches across many boundaries\nWithin a dark community I've attended a couple of the city club meetings\nAnd and they have a um so far they've been\nA political okay but they\nCrushed boundary lines and talk on on important current issues um\nThis the are Republicans have a bus tour\nEvery year it's going to start on a October the seventeenth and they'd leave Boise and go north and and uh travel oh they're gonna they're gonna hit probably uh\nIt it goes from the seventeenth till the twenty seventh and ... they're going to hit probably a fifty fifty five ... different cities across the state of Idaho\nThe one that's important for us is on a October twenty six that's our friday October twenty six seems like a long ways away but it no it's not [laughter]\nOctober twenty six the bus is going to a bus tour is going to take an hour from uh eight o'clock to nine o'clock I Would say closer to seven thirty at nine o'clock okay at\nThe twin falls Republican headquarters at two fifty six blue to explore north and and we're going to have the uh all of the present time all of the state white candidates plus\nScrew up our economy our environment so they shut it down\nWell when Trump showed up he said wait a minute let's go ahead and start building some of this\nA pipeline so that we can take advantage of this crude oil coming from Canada I mean why would we want to support the crazies over in the middle east buying their crude oil or we can buy it from Canada who for\nThe most part is our friend out of synch Trudeau showed up up there\nThey have become a little bit more a wayward in their attitude towards the United states but they have another problem in Canada as well there is a thing called the there's a trans Canadian pipeline that comes from\nFrom a bit of Alberta down into the Dakotas or Nebraska and then down to Cushing, Oklahoma or they disperse it and send it to the various\nAh refining facilities mhm [noise] but ... nothing no problem I'm the United states is not buying quite as much crude oil from Canada as it used to because we have\nDeveloped a thing down here called fracking for be careful how you say that fracking for oil and and we have increased\nThe amount of crude oil production in United States by multiple quantities\nAnd the last eight or ten years they do all of that in Oklahoma I think they do a lot in Oklahoma at the box and field up in North Dakota and South Dakota and and and the far eastern reaches of Montana a huge uh oilfields up there and and they a\nShip that they don't need a pipeline they just kind of put it in the ... how do we get this crew to moved around\nRailroad cars and in the past\nFive years the amount of a crude oil moving on railroad cars has quadrupled in quantity\nNow we are currently moving a Canadian crude oil ... at the rate of about two hundred thousand barrels per day it's a lot of oil guy that's almost entirely moved by\nRail car so we don't see it down here so much 'cause you know we don't have any uh why\nHave a refinery so we see these real cars come out of Canada into Montana and North Dakota where do they go well they would go south into the oil refining areas or they would go east towards the oil refineries along in uh Illinois\nThey might scoot around us and go south to Salt Lake city where they have two or three refineries in North Salt Lake a lot of it goes to northern Idaho up through a\nPond to re enter cross over to a Washington yes candidate at and and they're expecting the international Energy Agency is estimating that the annual average\nOf ... movement\nIs going to be three hundred and Ninety thousand barrels by the end of twenty Nineteen year from now ... that's almost double\nOur current a movement\nAnd it's all going to be unreal so candidate has looked at this thing and said wait a minute we're to do something different here let's build a pipeline\nFrom the uh Alberta oil fields\nUp just north of Edmonton and we'll take a pipeline across the Rocky Mountain and drop it down into British Columbia so that we can export dish crude oil\nTo Japan and China South Korea well\nThey're running into the same environmental issues up their building pipelines that we had down here why do you want to build a pipeline we don't need to do this this is terrible stuff we\nWe can we had to change the way we use this\nOr not use it at all and\nSo the the L A Alberta, Canada\nAnd British Columbia are saying wait just a minute [noise] do you have any idea the economic impact that has on our economies um\nHuge extraction taxes paid to the province of Alberta\nOn the extraction of oil so you shut the assault down we're going to be broke and more importantly we're not going to have ... thousand tens of thousands of jobs paying very very high wages they're all going to go way that would have a disastrous impact\nOn the economy in this country so their their\nCosts fighting issue\nBalance those two things\nTrump's still says we're going to build the trends are an Indian pipeline and right across the room and the Dakotas Montana the Dakotas Nebraska down south into a ...\nPerson then\nYou realize
