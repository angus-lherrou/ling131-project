that is really very interesting and the other good question because the the the legend is that our town\nIs constantly flooded baptized by water every seven years and so it seems to be true now I looked into this and I'm like going All right well when's the last time that we've actually had somebody tried to remove the curse and it was back in two thousand\nAnd what happened was in Nineteen Ninety nine we had a huge lead again\nAnd it wiped out our spa building and it was almost going to be demolished the Murphy company came in and they spent uh quite a lot of money to have this\nBuilding completely Reagan got it because it had to get rid of all this this this and that was like three million dollars right there [noise]\nBut anyway just to make sure that their investment was not going to be flooded they actually asked five members of the Native American Indian canceled come here and do a healing right over the town and over this fall building\nAnd I actually read the article in the Colorado Springs does that and it said after they did the healing ritual in front of the spa building that\nFive crows flew up into the air and not even being able to find true not north flew into the building and crashed I'm not kidding you you've got if you want to look it up it's easy to do\nLooking [laughter] is that an omen\nI don't know but you know what in two thousand Thirteen it flooded again it didn't work\nNow right yeah if you have like an elementary maybe they shouldn't build their again yeah I mean not with a concept I mean there are\nCertain things to be said for these history tours and things that are being done in the state could land ... or ... being built and so forth where the fine line there to honor and respect the more of that particular land\nYeah I I say thanks every day you know to the good lord to the spirits that be to the land that be and I give\nThere is a legend about manatees springs that you're not allowed to leave annoys you ask for permission or less you're ready to leave you come here because you are supposed to learn a lesson you don't come here because it's a choice you Marta summoned to this town\nAnd I know that sounds crazy but I have talked to so many people over the years and\nI always ask them I said what brought you to manage to springs oh always the same story well it was the weirdest thing you know I never planned on moving here and my car ran out of gas or something like that and when you hear so many of them you know this isn't a coincidence\nMm interesting so let's go back to the idea of what to do if you are sensitive to those types of energy or maybe you have a ghost\nSo let's go back to the idea of what to do if you are sensitive to those types of energy or maybe you have a ghost in your house or\nSomething that might be visiting you what what do you suggest to people that maybe don't want you want to move to transition want to move on already yeah\nSee I think that when someone dies [noise] now\nI I Want to ... this with make sure that I don't offend anybody is religious or spiritual beliefs this is these are just my feelings I think when someone dies for the first three days\nOr so that maybe their spirit lingers but they stay here some people believe that some you know maybe you just hang around to see her funeral and then you leave if you're not both [laughter]\nUm other stay right but if there is a lingering energy in your home get rid of it or move [laughter]\nBecause it's usually owns that particular person in\nThe eye earlier in the conversation I did say that my house has haunted that I live in now and that I Want to say but the ... that it is it used to be the pikes peak Bible college that has a very interesting history\nAnd anyhow the other day band that it is that the veil association this time of year I actually heard choir and music in my house I've lived here for Fifteen Years have never heard that before when I ran into the dining room and then it it ceased [laughter]\nI Know it was inside of my house I heard it my dogs hurt it they were ... is going on\nI think that's a residual it's like a group in time you know quantum physicist and explain it better than I can but I just think of it is like ... post you can still smell the burnt so [laughter] it's gone yeah I\nLived in time make more sense where it could be a coming back into this dimension temporarily in a split second\nYes and see that doesn't have a consciousness the choir music that I heard\nDid not have a consciousness we mean by that means it was just like I heard it in the room like some it was a group in time does that make sense I didn't have a conscious it's yeah it's just music that I heard like they came through sometimes believe it or not I can hear the trains that used to run behind my house mhm it\nRan in over a hundred years yeah so yeah when I hear\nSo I don't know with other people do [laughter]\nYou have anybody around that you could ask\nA much more in tune with the higher laws of nature as I say delicately they can they can pick up on it too had children especially that's why I Love it when when little children come on my tour is because um I turn it down a little bit so I don't scare them so much but ah the kids have a great time because they haven't been taught not to the\nRight to read so mention where people feel that they're afraid of ghost you're saying that they're not usually wanting to stay they want to move on or they should leave on it\nAnd move on I think it would be like you know when you're hungry you just know to eat\nHow do you help but uh being do that how would you suggest or how would you teach someone to as soon as this goes to move on\nWell you can always try talking to it at all I Swear it works and what would you ask\nI tell it are you you need to move on you know you're not supposed to be here anymore and I notice is your house and you love it that you are not supposed to be here anymore your loved ones that are waiting for you on the other side you need to go\nAnd just talk to them like a kind person would talk to anyone who was scared and confused the beans are just like they were on earth and some of them get hot here it's it's really sad if you think about these ghost hunters that go out and our teasing them like they're\nLike they're like in the zoo or something you know he's not very nice\nIf you think about these goes hunters that go out and our teasing them like they're like they're like in the zoo or something you know he's not very nice\nLooking Ghostbusters where they could vacuum them up and put them into two yeah when you ask this or you say to this this entity that might be hanging around and causing this just move on ... ... why do people get scared\nI think that I you know what those hunting is addicting first of all it is so fascinating we both been fascinating with what's on the other side and then once you have validation I tell you what it does not stop it that it's like gambling or something it\nOpens up a whole new world of possibility and I can't\nBelieve this happened and then you do feel special because so many people want a validation that there is life after death let's be honest and when you do have it happen it blows your mind and you will never forget it and you will never let anyone talk you out of what you saw the that's what happened to me when I was a child\nMy parents told me that it was because they drop me on the head when I was a baby imagine that\nSo I mean they all my life I was told that I was crazy and I'm not [laughter] other people have had happiest\nEnthusiastic I Would say [laughter] but now tell which do you started this wonderful convention this parent over conventions travels to various areas tell us a little bit about\n[noise] well um we call it a mood move all these like I said and so when we go into different areas the very very very first thing that we do is we contact with the local historians and the local goes hunting groups\nAnd we say we want to be your advocate we are here to help you and your community it do you need to get rid of any does we're here we're not going to be like those guys so we're really like I Would call us paranormal psychologist [laughter]\n... yes\nAnd that's what we do and we're very kind and we're and we try to talk them over or do whatever we can write a book [laughter]\nThese so when you do the tours you have a group to comes with you and it's more of an active type of tour right\nMy two words it's because of the town itself is very active and this is how I Do my tour is um if you look at my website manager legends that time you will see that there's very little information on there\nAfter Seventeen years there's a reason for that I don't have a meeting sites because before my tours I actually do a prayer and a meditation on ask for the spirits which one wants to come out and talk tonight\nSo the tourists do change night by night and you never know which there is going to come out and play quite interesting\nThose the juice AOL specific date and time and all that you think are not as validated\nNo I didn't say that at all I'm just saying that's how I run my tours okay there are always different they always change because that's how the paranormal is it's always changing it's always different\nThat there are some spirits that are pretty consistent but I call those kind of as much like fishing I mean as much as I Love to go fishing sometimes I don't catch it's darn thing and that's how those hunting is you just never know what's going to happen and then sometimes you'll it'll be hot and you'll catch a bunch of\nGoes my goodness All right we're going to take a quick break

like a cubicle or a day and a recliner well hell no it's\nA it's a it's a cubicle each person has their own individual cubicle that's the size of like a single bad okay and you can it's you can close it off completely you can block out um\nIt's the whole idea is to create an isolation chamber why is that because you can go deeper with no or external stimulus actions like I'm In many ways the same concept behind um\nThe flu chambers and jumped in this case you're not floating you're you're in this this controlled unit\nAnd all the sound is piped into the room we use special technologies like him he sank and he has headphones on yes everybody wears headphones and I talk to them in their control unit and I guide them through these series of exercises\nSo they don't feel a loner isolated right no that's the idea you are isolated I mean they don't feel alone because you have headphones on you know\nThey're they're listening through headphones and any exercise minor typically about a Fifteen minutes long each one\nAnd and people go on these incredible journey and have a friend who's been there several times on ... where do you think now anything such as all the technology is minority someone into a feta hate\nYes the idea is to get them as deep as possible um and the fate is of course are ideal for many people but the idea is of course to put yourself\nBy Nora beat technology it's been around for a long time that it helps us to go deeper faster that's a concept\nOkay All right and then where do you go on this journey where would you and I know that there's a pattern that you can't keep us you know it it's kind of a formula right\nTo go on this journey where would you and I know that there's a pattern that you can't keep us you know it it's kind of a formula right\nWell there is a yes or the relaxation I use sometimes what would be considered to be light hypnosis um there's different progression setter used but it's basically a meditative type of program\nThat's carded often guided where you would just go along with the program\nAnd um and have your own experience everybody has different experiences\nDuring even my program I'm teaching people how to self initiate their own out of body experience but in my class for instance people have pets fly for aggressions mhm they have contact with all kinds of let's just say a non physical\nBeing different kinds everybody has their own type of experience\nWhen we open up to her inner self people experience different kinds of ah let's just say I opening a mind opening expansive experiences mhm so it's not limited to just out of body experiences\nA for instance past life or ... or regression type flashes are quite common and there's the whole idea is to open up to this inner party yourself where the answers are where you can begin to explore your true self\nInto a open up to that awaken too that multi dimensional self within you\nKnow you had some questions could you ask yourself and then you write them down when you come out of this like write it down right away\nYes what I always suggested that right after the exercise you everybody receipt gets a journal or they bring a journal\nAnd you immediately after the exercise you begin to journal whatever in whatever kind of information may have come to you or imagery 'cause information can be\nTransmitted many different ways it's not necessarily all the boy can be through imagery or through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways so it's it's important to be open to the way that you receive information\nBut uh people have all kinds of profound experiences\nAnd they awakened to their their true self and they're the answers within um\nMhm yeah so the implication that personal growth in the spiritual awakening that are\nHappening in these can really be transformational and I like it because you guide your house and then I mean in a way your experience you William have died in in the direction that I Would have my own personal experience now\nMy friend my friend has been against on the show before she said that she has in the past encountered souls that need help and I think that's fascinating councils that\nSure ah we actually have an entire class devoted to that where people meet and guide those people that just means ... assistance or that's\nBut that will happen in um in all the classes that can happen I that comes up in my class as well or where people have contact and um provide guidance\nThat can happen that comes up in my class as well ah where people have contact and um provide guidance let's say to people that and ... there are people that have died but they are law store\nFor instance someone that may have died um quickly and they were just disoriented and they may need some assistance I Know that that type of thing does happen quite a bit\nAnd um at at ... at the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focuses on that type of guidance it's called guidelines I'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others\nIn that um [noise] and do let's just say a system to go to a higher dimensional space\nMm mhm so to assist him in crossing or have you ever done this after a [noise] a\nTragic incident and national tragic incident where a mask if it's so lean on one\nI have because I I ... I was practicing out of body experiences\nUh during nine eleven era\nAnd myself and I received a lot of contact or during that period of time um that was a that was one of those events where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way I imagine you're having coffee one morning and your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body is gone ... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to even wrap our minds around that\nSo there was a lot of people that we're assisting those um people that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and it it's it's functions in different names and different cultures\nAnd when I went to two we we presented in\nI think I'm more or let's just say I'm very grounded in a scientific waves at least the scientific as we can now that goes for all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented\nIn a very logical way that's um understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great because you really allow the person to have their own experience it in all of that I went to find out a little bit more about one of the culture or does this and what it calls in other countries are going to take a quick break William thank you so much and when we come back\nWe'll talk about what are the consciousness exist and and also a little bit more on how you can do this on your own\nA business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur and thought leaders and what if you could earn that\nDegree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line to find out more\nChecks path to seven nine six four or five that's\nP.

I mean these this is we're just real events that are happening the fascinating people all over the world\nI mean we're a multi dimensional ... that's what we are and are biological body you know we have to realize we're not we're not biological beings we're only here for a very brief period of time and then we exit and we move on to another state of consciousness\nAnd another energy body\nAnd that's what we've discovered without a body exploration is that it's multi dimensional and that death is an illusion really I'm no no that's been said but\nOnce you encounter and experience and communicate with loved ones who have passed and you're doing this face to face this is life changing\nYou no longer need a psychic to act as the intermediary you you you're empowered to discover the answers for yourself and it's really to find out what kind of journey are we all on 'cause this is an amazing journey of consciousness we all share\nYeah it is but you know what I hear you and I just interviewed Raymond Moody and like I show and you know the ... the grandfather and clean to turn a light gas and and he had\nExperience in the answer fifty years doing that\nYou know for sure that that yeah life after death exists because scientifically it's never really been proven even though he's heard thousands and thousands of reports of people who have\nExperience in a life after life ... ... he still doesn't as a scientist as a low decision right has not know for sure this\nIs exactly why self initiated out of body exploration is so important because you get that verification absolute personal verification that you need\nBooks study research will never give you that kind of verification you can read a thousand books you could spend your entire lifetime studying this topic\nAnd it's not going to give you the inside and the verification you'll get\nFrom one out of body experience because suddenly you know you go from being a researcher\nOr a believer to an hour and that's the big huge step that all of humanity I think is moving towards I mean we need to we need to wake up to what we truly are\n... and to get away from this bickering and confusion in division\nI mean once you realize that you're you're not just a biological being you know you're continuing ... and beyond this temporary stage of development\nIt puts everything into a whole different perspective and I'm not the first time I mean this is not the Buddhist or been saying this for a long time\nThat you know we're more than our bodies and that were involved in beyond the body and we are all life is evolving beyond the body this is a temporary stage of our revolution\nYeah and I meant to say that rain and then he coined the term near death experience sorry\nI didn't mean like a afterlife that's his website you know when I did my own Google Search on I just typed in near death experience and it was like twenty five million searches come up on Google were not the only ones that are interested in is this is becoming more and more of a\nA phenomenon a popular topic people are interested in what beyond disorder now I have been good now sort of play so much as senior anymore but I Want to ask you you can you had an experience like as if you\nWere sick and you had this experience for you um you worse that can you use this out of body experience to help you in some way can you tell us about that\nWell in two thousand eleven I I've discovered I had a serious a stage for cancer of the lymph nodes and tonsils and I it was a shock it was um on very quickly out a large tumor on my neck lymph nodes\nA yeah lymph nodes and anyway it was a serious issue and I had to get immediate had to make quick decisions on this because it was a you know it spreads I'd ... broken and kept solution\nSo I I went through traditional ah because it was so quick and so fast I did a traditional medicine but um during my recovery\nI was having some really profound out of body experiences and in a sequence of events which I did not self initiated by the way these are just spontaneous out of body experiences which I was having why was recovering from cancer is a I had a feast\nAnd it's difficult to explain this but in one of them I found myself in this this white queue but it was like a twelve meter pure square cube was segmented balls I write about this adventures in the afterlife", "show_name": "AM Idaho", "year": "2018", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "14"}
