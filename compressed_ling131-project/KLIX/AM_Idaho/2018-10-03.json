later added its initial story to include their missing text while the date line for this story\nNoted that it was updated on October second there was no education regarding what had been updated nor was there an editor's note in the story itself indicating a change and leaving the updated story ignored a crucial part of Kavanaugh's testimony that undermined NBC's claim\nNBC has claimed that Kavanaugh new and advance that the second accuser Ramirez\nFrom Yale University was going to be coming forward\nWell that wasn't true\nNBC though had removed that the wording in order to try to give the impression that in the cabinet did know now going back to the time in the nineties what NBC was blowing up pickup trucks with rockets to try to tell you that the gas tanks were faulty\nOr they have a history at that network of doing these types of things are a member of the case in Florida with Trayvon Martin\nGood example fine example and of course some underlings got fired for that but at the history of that network is just one of\nA ... organization and it continues speaking of Mitch McConnell he was speaking yesterday about the latest hit job on Kavanaugh well the New York times was engaged in a span\nOf twenty four hours in two major hit jobs you're well aware that President Trump inherited some money from his family\nWhen he was three years old other times is now trying to portray that is a criminal act apparently in what Donald Trump who Seventy now two years old\nSeventy one or Seventy two so that would that would mean somewhere around Nineteen fifty Nineteen forty nine Nineteen fifty Donald Trump inherited some money from his parents and the the the New York times is trying to say there's something criminal there\nTrump was still in the play pen for crying out loud\nBut this very same newspaper is going after Brett Kavanaugh\nBecause apparently he may or may\nAnd for crying out loud but this very same newspaper is going after Brett Kavanaugh because apparently he may or may have not thrown some ice while he was in a bar while he was a college student in New Haven Connecticut at Yale\nLast night the New York times on leash this major story\nAnd

proud of the one thing for sure\nThe Senate will vote on judge Kavanaugh here on this for this way [noise] hair on the floor\nThis week you know there's a fellow writing at the Washington Post today by the name of Dana Milbank who was a member of Scotland bones that graduated Yale University a few years after Kavanaugh says their time they're only overlap by year they did know each other but he says that one year he was living across the street in the dormitory\nFrom a bar called I think it's dumb arrest\nThat's where this suppose that ice ice throwing happened and nice at the place was quite a rowdy bar or at least a cabin ours and being clean with us he's not coming clean or less about his college drinking\nAnd you know why because no bank who's a Guidall is liberal says that says that he says I Know what I was like in college and I was a blackout me walking drunk so therefore\nA God fearing judge Kavanaugh must have been too\nSo the liberals as we were selling you yesterday are projecting upon Kavanaugh all of their worst habits so you get that right\nYou got a columnist for the Washington Post season over liberal an atheist and he's out there saying that he was knee walking drunk his entire time it yeah so therefore that must be in the same happened\nFor Kavanaugh no Kavanaugh who had great grades got into law schools and continue having great grades you can't do that if you're perpetually three sheets to the wind it just doesn't work out that way you have to do some studying but they are so\n... and see now that the all the allegations of sexual impropriety are falling apart they've got to have something else so they're trying to hang your hat on wow you know\nHe drinks too much or he did drink too much\nOr the latest he doesn't have the temperament it sounds like a line from Bob the movie the music that doesn't happen temperament doesn't have the temperament doesn't have the temperament\n[laughter] while a roof butter mine off goes out on tour and screams and yells about Trump voters along with Hillary Clinton we should point out did you see where Clinton went onstage and just ran down Trump voters and cabin on Trump himself but mainly the

got to break the collie\nMansions and one of the stories that one of the worst complaints came from a woman and Oregon okay so she doesn't even vote in Idaho\nWe have this reaction I Will add this there was a fellow who serves as the commerce secretary in North Dakota he made some sort of similar wise crack and he's had the ... he lost his job he resigned but he did it\nIn an actual government email from his government email account so I can understand that\nThe joke itself was funny ... than it wasn't really\nIt didn't disparage anybody in any way but he he ended up resigning from his job on the advice of his governor because someone's going to question the use of government email accounts for that sort of thing but Maher begging her and didn't do that again his personal Twitter

developed an inexpensive a coup stick listening system using data from small microphones in the field to monitor bees in flight they're studying ways to show how farmers could use the technology to monitor pollination and increase food production lead scientist Dr Kansas Galen\nFor trying to understand what the busing either telling us but one thing that is very challenging and I'm sure you know that from your research into visas that it's not\nAlways easy even to find them you would think it would be especially when you're looking for one that's not common it can be challenging even to find them and even to figure out\nHow many of them are there and so that's sort of where we're starting and it's like how can we come up with a much easier more reliable and more accurate way to figuring out how many bees there are where they are what they're doing and what they're doing for the plant\nAnd so that's why we got very excited about this hacking the mountain is we think of it\nSo small microphones recording the buzz leads to identification of where bees are\nWhat are you really know about proposition one the people who will prop one try to deceive you by making big promises about school funding but when you read the fine print it's easy to see where the gambling money is actually going\nFrom one language guarantees that promoters making nine percent profit from the legalized gambling machines\nIdaho schools will get only half of one percent and\nThat means promoters problem getting Eighteen times as much money as they were almost out of school for every dollar gamble

even were marching across the river on the river walk over to the movie wasn't it wasn't good but when you're a days we haven't had a [laughter]\nNot quite [laughter] let's go back to this report\nOn the Democrats are and then the\nThe liberals the progressive the or destroy the American constitution at all costs people are are really uptight primarily because Kavanaugh would ah instead of being a\nA swing voter would be mostly if not absolutely a conservative voter and so there would be many many more of these five four decisions but they would all be swinging conservative in nature\nOut it we might it might find it interesting that [noise] um\nHearings before the Supreme Court or not trials\nThey were just hearing mhm they have all of the court procedure proceedings from lower courts\nThat have been brought forward to the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd and uh the attorney for pro and con on each one of these issues can make oral arguments to the members of the Supreme Court\nBut there is no witnesses and no new evidence eighty of that kind of stuff shows up what the Supreme Court is doing is considering um whether or not there had been violations in constitutional or\nTo certain ah decisions now mostly or you don't go directly to the Supreme Court you have to go through a a court of appeals\nAnd and we have a a\nThirteen circuit court of appeals in United States may would find that interesting we actually have eleven federal circuits plus the district of Columbia circuit court\n[noise] so\nWhere we get to the thirteenth circus now one two of the huge major ones are the DC circuit court of appeals and that's where Kavanaugh is currently seated as a judge [noise] um the other one that is real big is the uh New York shortcut second circuit court of appeals\nBecause that handles most of the New York um financial market areas that the downtown New York city area so a lot of your financial\nOr stuff or disputes over government regulations with regards to financial regulations will come out of the second circuit or the largest circuit court of appeals is Ninth Circuit court of appeals and why is that important\nBecause Idaho was part of the Ninth Circuit so we have a nine western states plus all well and including Hawaii and Alaska\nBut we also have nearly twenty five percent of the population of the United states that resides in Ninth Circuit\nThere was some conversation a few years back\nAlthough it's not a\nCommon are prevalent or given much hope anymore that maybe we would create an additional circuit court of appeals and and that which split the Ninth Circuit so that it didn't have a number one as large a geographic area or as large a puppy\nNinth Circuit so that it didn't have a number one as large a geographic area or as large population so that uh they would take certain states and put them over and say okay you guys to become your own separate court of appeals\nPart of the problem with the Ninth Circuit is it is\nA predominantly California\n[noise] and so we get the ... the uh considered the liberal opinion of California people pushing this the decisions out of Ninth Circuit\nWell let's go back to a cabin on again he sits on the DC circuit court of appeals\nAnd and that's an interesting uh\nPhenomena that he is in that particular case situation now in his term as a judge there at a D.C DC circuit court of appeals fourteen of Kavanaugh's decisions\nHave been appealed to the Supreme Court but that's not unusual he's been on the DC circuit for twelve years I think so that's not very many in any one given year here's the thing that is interesting\nOf the fourteen cases that had been appealed to the Supreme Court Thirteen of those decisions were upheld by the Supreme Court\nAnd only one\nOf his decisions was reversed by the Supreme Court so we we look at that and we say okay this is pretty significant the guy\nHas an excellent track record with regards to the ... his decisions as a circuit court judge the Supreme Court I mean Thirteen or fourteen you know if if we were a\nPainting the guy based on performance you'd be a million dollar hitter [laughter]\nHe'd be a ten million dollars a year later\nSo that and that's one of the things that we want to watch carefully well if only Seventy three cases are hurt by the Supreme Court where do most where guys are you boy that was grammatically off [laughter]\nCertain it's early morning they've donor though [laughter]\nWhere where does most of these federal cases where are they ... they are primarily at a circuit court level now so far in his term or the Senate has confirmed President Trump's term\nThey have confirmed over twenty four circuit court judges since Trump has become president ... so that's back filling an awful lot of vacancies that existed at the ... circuit court level that we're getting now getting more conservative and decisions at circuit court levels\nOr if we have ... conflicts between a circuit court number one and circuit court number nine then those are automatically a appealed to the Supreme Court and they make the decisions so that we have a continuity of application of the law so\nI'm several things are happening yeah we want to have a conservative on the Supreme Court\nIt probably is a Seventy to eighty million dollar hit for the state budget I keep in mind we we we ... we raise I don't know two hundred and fifty million dollars worth of sales taxes on groceries but we have the rebate associated with your when you file your tax return off\nAnd and that is about a hundred and eighty million dollars and so the net impact is net net if we eliminate show sex on groceries\nWe just took Seventy million dollars out of the budget well if you pass this medicate thing that's going to cost us a few bucks every year I ... he says oh no it's going to be swell and it'll be great and it won't costs just anything and right and you can jump off the edge of the couch and land on the moon [laughter]\n[noise] so if you believe that stuff you are [noise] Vulcan some funny stuff for breakfast\nSo what do you think if the the proposition passes and what what do you think the legislature is going to be tied to a with all that will come to legislate\nUm [noise] they they want the Idaho application of ah\nHealth insurance too closely paralleled the federal requirements for medicate okay and and we have kind of a Idaho is just simply avoided getting on that train so that this would force has to get on the train quickly an within Ninety Days\nNow the Ninety Days cycle that would be November December January so by the first of February\nAn within Ninety Days now the ... day cycle that would be November December January so by the first in February the end of the Ninety Days the legislatures gonna have to come up with a plan that they can give to the department of health and Human Services\nTo administer\nThe Medicaid expansion within the state of Idaho well the legislature doesn't start next year until I think it's January the eighth or ninth\nOkay um I think that's pretty close I'm not sure that's the second week it no yeah um [noise]\nAnd the first two weeks of that just have a session or the or two bodies spend most of their time reviewing regulatory issues regulations that have been drafted by the\nBureaucrats\nFrom the previous legislative session so they passed a bunch of bills in the January through April of twenty Eighteen and the regulations have all been written and and now those regulations will be submitted to the\nLegislature for approval so that the legislature looks at him and says yes these regulations\nAre are in agreement with our in ten of that legislative process so go ahead and implement or wait a minute I'm this is not the intent of the legislative process you guys are way out of line on this thing\nChange it go back and redo it so that takes up a little bit of time the first um\nTwo weeks of every legislative session now they that's not all they do they're still formulating bills and getting everything coordinated through the legislative services office so that that all of the uh items on the agenda are in place and and being considered and\nWhen the the regulatory issues you're done we have a full list of items that we will work on as a legislative body so it's going to be\nReal tough for the legislature in this Ninety day window to get anything structured and in place before the department of health and Human Services formulates their plan to make it work and and according to the the way this is written no later than Ninety Days after approval of this act\nThat department shall submit well let's do that just a little different that that's that's a major concern for me that puts a rope around ... new surround the legislators next to get this thing resolved\nBut isn't that the whole intend to that and I mean there's some people have been saying that the legislature's been dragging their feet on this forever and we've been working on this thing for seven or eight years right and they can't get the\nWon't get it done uh-huh and and there's lots of arguments both pro and con for why they haven't done this\nBut um it's just kind of like a shotgun wedding and and uh you know\nThey just don't seem to work out all my well\nNo and they ... they probably don't but I I think like I said it's taken nearly a decade to get this done to get to this point yeah\nAnd the reason why we have this particular proposition to just the simple fact that the legislature has [noise] a void that\nFacing a thing and getting a a solution in place and and uh [noise] I can see you read through the argumentation in this particular thing and it says okay here's a here's this article articles in favor and here's the opposition\nParticular thing and then it's just okay here's a here's artist articles in favor and here's the opposition and you read through you looked at it usually
