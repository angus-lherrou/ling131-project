J. LA TV and Washington during the early to mid Nineteen nineties\nDennis had met this young woman she had approached him her name's Julie sweat Nick\nAnd then they ended up going out on a few days now nothing other than a maybe a good night kiss or anything like that ever happened between them but Denis says he didn't want anything more to do with a woman after she told him that if they were going\nFor anything like that ever happened between them but Denis says he didn't want anything more to do with a woman after she told him that if they were ever going to be in a relationship of any sort she wanted it to involve several other men at the same time which you throw a little doubt on the claims she's been making and\nHis testimony while he wrote a letter to Orrin Hatch who was one of his two U.S senators both her dentist as US Senators they serve on the Judiciary Committee US Senate Judiciary Committee or as I think it's technically called committee on the judiciary hatch introduced this into the into the testimony and\nSo it is public record and Dennis did this under penalty of perjury now ...\nSays calling Dennis names publicly but get this I don't believe happened Ali has in any way said the dentist is wrong and I don't believe that his client Julie sweating the test said that anything Dennis or has brought up is wrong\nAnd yet mainstream media hasn't contacted him the Washington Post had a story yesterday and the details of our Dennis lives it detail that he apparently got remarried and twenty Fifteen because his Facebook page says cell\nBut nobody's called mainstream media has ignored him well in fact\nIf you're familiar with the story the former boyfriend of ... ah Christine Blasey Ford manner dated her for six years in the Nineteen nineties came forward\nAnd said she had been coaching various friends on how to defeat a polygraph well he made an appearance on the Fox news channel but you didn't see him over at the the old alphabet networks liberal media that is mainstream media has virtually ignored him and they'd been ignoring\nDentist as well so I had been under the impression that may be Dennis was barred from speaking by some legal agreement or a lawyer I told him not to say yesterday I said to him hey can you talk to me about this on air tomorrow morning and he said sure [laughter]\nNow he's been on the program before I've shared this story or you may remember he was on the show about a year ago telling us what happened to him when he went through a VA medical center\nIn Phoenix, Arizona and he went in for what should have been a somewhat routine procedure and because of a a botched\nProcedure he lost one of his legs so he cannot work any longer fulltime in the broadcast business so he would have some time though to take a little out of his schedule today to join us on this program and he's scheduled to be with us just after eight o'clock this morning and to my knowledge\nGrover electric and plumbing supply home of do it yourself and say\nI was culture news that affects you brought you lied schooler count on school or people news radio Thirteen ten K.

went into the navy I heard him speak at a club event here in twin falls last year said he went into the navy because his family couldn't afford to send them to college and so he did a career in the

needed but I Will be a way just using some vacation time Monday Tuesday and Wednesday of next week in Steve Millington will be filling in so I left the court House yesterday and realize that a lot of time left in my day and I thought I better get some business done\nSo I I thought I got to buy some gas I was down to about a writer on a quarter of a tank and thought I'll go fill up and I stopped at a gas station now in twin falls I think there's at least three places or you can buy gasoline and then go shopping without identifying where I was that\nI bought my gasoline because I thought the price look really really good and then I went in the store and picked up some potato salad a couple of other things as the morals things I Need it for around the house and cat food came outside to get back in the car and the price of gasoline to drop the nickel while I was shopping and they called for a gallon\nNow I probably am fifty cents when you think about it ... it dropped a nickel a gallon and I think I I I may have bought ten eleven gallons of gas but yeah so but still you you think to yourself if I had been five minutes a little a little later five minutes later I Would have gotten the gas a little bit cheaper you know you're a little bit miffed when that happens\nAnd and so then I decided I should go to the bank I have a check from a tenant to rent a house from me on the other side of the country which I have not yet sold and I went to deposit the rent check and I've been doing this for three years\nUh I had somebody in the house for a while and then uh then I started reading it out\nAnd are renting out on a regular basis to people that don't really know but they've been good tablets as I started writing it out and they're like clockwork sending me the checks and they they they said the cashier's check and they drop it on one of the best known banks in America\nAnd they send me the cashier's check and I go to deposit and usually it's you know humdrum or your deposits a check and you go on and of course just wanted to get that out of the way yesterday because I had some time of the bargain only twice in the course of the last\nThree years as anybody ever given me any difficulty about this immediately the woman who was a who is waiting on me as a credit union yesterday says uh do you know who sent you this check can I said yeah my tenets\nWow you know the fact that this yeah it's one of the best known banks in the country well we're going to have to put a hold on this I said how long does the hold all five days butter weekends coming and we don't count that so it will be a week before you get a credited Iraq out\nAnd I said how is it that over the last three years I've been bringing and checks from that well known bank and depositing them here from somebody that I Know and trust and I haven't\nHad any issues to really speak up and then I heard you know somebody wrapping on the keyboard\nFrom somebody that I Know and trust and I haven't\nHad any issues to really speak up and then I heard you know somebody wrapping on the keyboard ... took to cook it and this went on for a couple of minutes and then she said well let's deposited now well [laughter] okay so what happened uh\nIn that span of you typing in rapping on the keyboard did you look and see that this this happens every month hello one other time\nI was I walked into this must have been about six months ago I walked in and there was a man behind the counter you don't normally see a lot of younger men behind the counter as tellers I won't say it's women's work but generally it seems is generally women who are doing the job and I gave the man the check and he said you know who who who who who who the person is behind this check\nYeah it's my turn it oh you're a ton of it so you are you're running a place wires this on an out of state bank to ah because my tend to rent a house for me in Delaware oh is that so he says is if I'm making this up [laughter]\nYes because people would never actually move around this country everyone lives exactly where they're born and they never do anywhere else right\nSo he's got to give me a hard time about it and I looked at him and I said you're right I said I hear that criminals often travel the country depositing money in other people's accounts and was that he just gave me the most dumped struck look and I said I've been catching these checks here going back a few years what's your problem\nCheck cashed in deposited in my account but I got to tell you these people they they they they try to say yeah we're\nA people
