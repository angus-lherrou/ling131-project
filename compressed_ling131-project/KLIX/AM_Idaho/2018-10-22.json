newspaper in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania over the weekend that endorsed Bob Menendez a they did it by saying they were endorsing him reluctance late\nBecause his opponent doesn't a career politician other words we're like Bob you know he's a fellow traveler so will embarrass him even though he's got a lot of skeletons that his closet and I've been under the impression that Idaho media would do the same\nMost people working you realize the news media are very conservative most of them are very very liberal so I thought no matter what Jordan would do\nThey'd be getting behind her saying wow

Jordan is perhaps\nSomebody who would be a fighter for their causes whether it be an Idaho\nOr anywhere politically up substantial the writer says a substantial will get that out it's Monday morning after a percentage of Jordan's fundraising call has come from small individual contribution some small is five dollars and many less than one hundred dollars\nNow she managed to collect a million

Washington Post columnist who was killed in Turkey the remarks came during a discussion on the murder of ... at a political on Sunday\nI again I'm not so sure that people are showing up at Trump rallies with bones sauce but they like to give you that that impression\nTo show the wasn't really a journalist by American Standards and the first place that just this was an opportunity for them to claim him so they can continue to bash the president Daily Caller also has this story today\nThe Washington Post falsely suggested that Georgetown preparatory school was hiring a new worker to deal with fallout from the judge Kavanaugh hearings\nWe should say justice Kavanaugh now despite the school directly contradicting the Washington Post report now if you didn't know at Georgetown Prep is where\nCapital I went to high school way back in the late seventies and early Nineteen eighties Emily high all reported October Eighteenth that Georgetown Prep that was just last Thursday right was hiring a director of alumni relations and wrote that the school posted the advertisement for the position\nThis week however she was informed prior to publication of her\nArticle by a spokesperson for Georgetown Prep\nThat the position was posted all the way back in July\nAnd yet the post still went ahead with this because the post wanted to say that they were doing this too that there was so much for a lot of negative publicity about Kavanaugh that the school uh decided they had to bring in this person to clean up the mess and that's the narrative they wanted you to believe that product on the Potomac but it's not true\nThis job has been open for several months before any of this controversy really got ginned up\nAnd just to back all of this up Daily Caller literally has a whole chain of communication between the school and the reporter and they published all of it all of it back and forth as it went on so they can't hide from this why\nAnd yet they scream and yell no we're not fake news you're just being me you conservatives in flyover country here dum dum de ... we need new instruct\nYou and what the news is and then over at ... which is a publication that tries to claim that walks down the middle\nThe editor of that publication has a piece today called for ways to fix news or to fix fake news you've got to realize he's coming at this and saying again there is no fake news from us but he just in case you were wondering it might be on your Facebook feed is what he's suggesting in his shoe\nYeah and there's no fake news from us but it just in case you were wondering it might be on your Facebook feed is what he's suggesting and this shows you how ... people and media happen to be getting\nHe says stop using the term fake news if you're a politician and he says one day soon something bad is going to happen and it will take faith and information to fix it don't question of course what you're doing just blamed the politicians in this case now certain politician certainly have never had\nNice things to say about the media as long as there's been news media but you gotta look at it this way and you've got to realize that perhaps when I just told you what the Washington Post did they've got to start looking in the mirror as well\nThen he went on to say this this one I thought was the most important\nNumber two a warning for the media itself news organizations he said he said should ban their reporters from doing anything on social media especially Twitter beyond sharing stories showing your hand and it always seems to be the left one makes it impossible to win back\nThe public is spot on about that these people are overwhelmingly flaming lefty\nHere this is where I see starts to get off the rails though he said social media companies should radically self regulate are a lot of government regulation to come in and take over what they're doing in other words forget private enterprise were from the government didn't wear here to help you I was listening\nI have to confess over the weekend I'd gone to Boise and I was driving home radio is spotty so I caught some public radio there was a program on\nAnd it mentioned just how difficult it is for Facebook to even police itself I mean I Can't imagine\nHow government would do this without hiring an army of people do it at your expense Facebook started out in its early days when it had about Seventy million users that's a lot and it had\nYou know a large number of people to monitor what was being posted now you have billions of users and you've got several floors in my building who are and even all around the world they've got offices or they're trying to monitor the contact because some of that context posted by ISIS and other really nasty people and it's not\nNice not nice at all but this guy's recommendation is the government should come in and take over first he criticizes people in government for calling on the news media\nThen he says government should take over social media\nYeah I Know it it it but it his mind it somehow make sense\nAnd finally I wanted to add this to end this segment of from the blaze Arizona newspaper blasted for cartoon showing the Democrat in a Senate race shooting down the G O P candidates playing the Arizona Republic news outlet\nHad a cartoon was drawn or illustration if you will that shows\nChris didn't or semi using a rocket launcher to shoot down a plane named after her US Senate opponent Republican Martha mix Sally\nAnd it's got to remember them as a former anti war activist by the way the the opponent the Republican or is the first woman in us history to fly a jet in combat and also was the first to command a fighter squadron so they've got a cartoon\nI'm thinking it's funny depicting the liberal the anti war activists shooting down the plane of an actual American Hero this is considered normal by these people were at fifty two at six thirty bill collie with you on a news radio Thirteen\nOr about

exact same point\nObama's approval rating in the aggregate polls was forty\nFive percent Mr Trump's as at forty seven\nAgain media doesn't want to tell you that and you could say well you know if we took in some of the era that could be a baked into the ball it's a tie but still Donald Trump is about at the same place after two years or Iraq Obama happened to be don't let the media tells you

attention they have one on the big bird\nIt's like an entire video wall it's all done through computer graphics but it's realistic looking and it shows you some forested land in North Idaho of course

timeline what exactly happened and how it got started it was dry\nThen there was a couple of lightning storms the winds picked up and you start to see smoke pouring from various parts of the forest and then you start to hear the sounds of people who are fleeing and the sounds of horses and then as it progressed as you see buildings burning and it gives you a\nGreat look at all of this what must have been like and then at the very end you see the chart forest and it explains the results and what happened\nAnd how we had a huge change in forestry\nPolicy afterward in this country but that itself has also been changed in recent years are starting to think about how we do this again and we might be getting back to a bar scene way to manage forests so I got to see that\nPart of the exhibit and are the only place you can't take photographs there's a big color where they have a lot of paintings some of these paintings I mean gosh there are a hundred and forty years old and\nI can probably understand that I don't want flash bulbs Greg off because they discovered in the great museums of Europe\nSeveral years ago that all the flash bulbs were actually helping peel away to paint on a lot of the paintings by the great masters and there's a whole series of paintings that were done by some of Idaho's earliest artist going back into the early part of the last century that\nWas to look at some of the paintings to landscapes and paintings wagon trains bringing pioneers through was just beautiful\nAnd so I spent a good probably twenty minutes in the painting gallery as well walking around and checking all of those out a main for a pretty good day and I just wanted to say I would highly recommend\nThat you visit the place that I was glad that I was leaving\nDisagreement

took a peek at a\nTV story a so called caravan which is just a lot of people walking a caravan always in my impression was something either was wagons or or perhaps vehicles but that the so called caravan\nComing from central and South America is up to seven thousand people that's the latest estimate even though we were told only about two thousand of the initial five thousand made it past the Mexican border who again\nIs allowing these people is clearly Rush Limbaugh I thought so summed it up last week when he said who's feeding them after all styles of people walking along the road get pretty hungry it's it's not like you could walk up to the local McDonald's drive through and say hey I'll take seven thousand cheeseburgers\nNot going to work that way we're at seven twenty four it's forty nine on magic rally this morning news radio thirteenth ... news radio Thirteen tend to cop so clearly this is an organized effort ended his soul timed\nElection day is just Fifteen days away and the ... the rate that these people will travel coming up through Mexico should eventually if if indeed they are allowed to continue by the forces behind this march should put them at our border just before\nWe go vote ... those are some voted early one out of that issue but this is what the people behind the effort are banking on that you're going to say oh isn't that terrible they're turning these poor starving hungry people away but they're not all that hungry because if you walk every day and you walk several hours per day\nYou do need some sustenance you wouldn't be able to go on much more than two or three days if you didn't have anything in your stomach so they're not hungry I'm also told him that it costs them sometimes thousands of dollars to join one of these caravans\nSo they're not the poorest of the poor because in that\nPart of the world we're told some of these people only get by on a few hours a day or if they've got thousands of dollars to go pay some drug cartel to help them move up through Mexico\nThan they weren't doing all that badly were they happen to be all of this has to be taken into account and I'm afraid that mainstream media is going to focus on oh\nYou know Jorge amateurs or haven't had a bite to eat since this morning and it's got corn on his face Jorge says he needs freedom in his life well [laughter]\nHe needs to come here and feed off of us taxpayers what he's got to be doing President Trump speaking about this at the airport in alcohol I add up when he was there the other day and says he's not going to mess around with a liberal stunt\nMaybe not far\nYou have some very very bad people in the caravan you have some\nI Will seal off the voter before they come into this kind of bring out our military that are reserved hammering\nDown the argument among the ... but he can't do much with the military certainly can he can station that but a number of different checkpoints and while we're told well they can open fire on people if this is deems that invasion I think we can do whatever we need to repel it\nAgain the liberals are hoping that actually happens so they can show you bloodshed it's a little bit like those Palestinians who have been in Gaza who've been storming defense in Israel and the media likes to say oh look this poor child shot dead do\n... been in Gaza who've been storming defense in Israel and

Lee left out well for a time constraints we were unable to show you the violence committed by this is what we're dealing with now we're dealing with the situation and it's a generation of George Soros drug dealers\nAnd mainstream media in this country of course in league with the Democrat Party when the president said there are some dangerous people in this caravan he's not kidding secondly I think it was the foreign minister in Guatemala who said over the weekend and let it slip that they believe that there are some ISIS and al ...\nOperators who are in the midst of all of this\nLet's be honest they have darker skin in some cases darker shape the skin and dark hair\nAnd in some cases can easily pass themselves off as being someone from Guatemala or Honduras and when they get to the U.S border and they say that they don't speak English it might well be true if they come through that border then what are they going to do once they're here\nEvery nation in the world has\nThe right to defend its borders if this were happening anywhere else\nYou wouldn't be saying much about the the only place you you see out of the liberal whining going on is here and Israel because the two

a\nMajor concern of the officials here like chief imam al ... is this sector chief here in the Rio Grande valley he says if Kevin gets here they will be ready\nNow does anybody ever think about some of the contradictions Celeste says they'll do the jobs that Americans won't do and then America has a labor shortage but at the same time the leftist talking about providing a guaranteed\nIncome for
