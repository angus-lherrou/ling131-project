[noise] uh on most days is that\nWhen you're driving in a pretty much a straight shot to work the the thing is I Try to count red light comedy stop lights I had you know only twice on that roof have I and I've been taking that route for about three years only twice on that road have I ever\nEncountered days where I was able to catch all the lights green\nMet a friend years ago he was a police\nCaptain and a small city where I happen to be working and he shared with me he said you know if you wanted to get through downtown without hitting all of the lights are\nYou said you know that as you want to eat them all green you you could drive a thirty eight miles per hour he said I've timed it I said if I drive at thirty eight is that our the money will you give me a ticket he said yes so I didn't I put up with a red lights and and of course the way things are now timed computerized or ... what timing someone's coming the other direction you know they're coming from the\n... perpendicular is that it's coming up to the intersection um the little center there we'll flip the light for them for a moment soon as you have ten cars coming down Washington street one car gets to pass quickly well ten stop and idol seems to be a junior solution to all of this anyway I I saw\nA story yesterday out of a Philadelphia newspaper where women was complaining about how the lights have changed over the years and her experience in the last Twenty years tore it seems that she stops at a lot more red lights and the ... the newspaper looked into this and said it's true the paper said\nAnd I posted something about this with a link at our website as well the paper said a few things there's a few factors that are involved in this more pedestrian traffic which means more people are hitting the button and so they can cross the street you've got actually more traffic on the streets in most cities\nAnd thirdly you've got more construction going on all of these things mean that you're you're kind of just poking alarm going up and down the streets and that's why you're heading more red lights so if you're interested that's at the website I also noticed\nThis morning I got a Google Alerts somebody a head to head rated one of my blog posts is irrelevant well when when people reading stories\nOn the Internet things that a new Olive Garden opening up his news uh then that's what draws eyeballs and that's how you sell advertising now the Web\nIf you sit down and write a political analysis piece not many people are reading it any longer so with only two people still reading on our community apparently uh we finally get far more hits about a Hobby Lobby or Olive Garden or um how to make a ham sandwich\nAnd those are that's how modern media is trending six twenty five bill collie with you on magic value this morning a news radio Thirteen to entail I exit news radio Thirteen tend to come down to twenty seven so I was reading a this morning or some stories\nOn the direction of modern media and I got thinking as well about talk radio and you know for most people are listening to talk radio if you say talk radio they have an image in their head when they turned it on\nThat it's something like this and you should be happy that you are no longer in the grip bumper rock Hussein Obama I'm not power\nMad Democrats that's what it often sounds like the people listening to talk radio but you know and it sounds like on this end it's it's it's a different perception it's like this I'll say hey we've got sixty seconds before a break I'll squeeze a collar and I'll pick up the telephones they call you got one minute\nAnd the color will say hello\nTo your caller you're on the air\nHow are you today oh yeah oh well I was just saying oh I think as long as you are talking or\nThe other day or what not to visit my brother and we're all you know you kind of a quiet town\nUh not much going on there I don't much care for it but my brother was always a bit of a wet blankets and he likes that's so anyway I like I was saying I was going out there to visit my brother color we got thirty seconds oh right yeah yeah yeah you know what my brother said you can I tell you what my brother said to me would you like to hear what my brother call you got Fifteen seconds\nSo it's the talk radio means different things to different people the perception of it from the listening audience is one thing or the perception of it from the the host there's a completely different thing coming up now on six twenty seven on magic value that's running bill collie here with you until ten am at a friend\nSent me a story today I used to work for this guy and a super nice guy who's been in radio off and on for fifty years his son and I share a birthday a son used to run a couple of\nReally big radio stations in Tampa, Florida there there there are several generations of radio now in the family but he sent me a link from something called the Poynter Institute and it says that about half\nOf America's counties are now living in what we call the news desert that\nIs there's there's nobody doing news there is not even a weekly newspaper there is no TV\nStation or even a radio station giving a news updates and that is because of the changes we've seen in media and it it details how the recession and two thousand eight especially took out a lot of newspapers\nAnd again I don't think that people feel they have the time to do a lot of in depth reading any longer so that's why they go to the Web and they look for something that's just two or three paragraphs but\nYou see this was figured out long before the Web even came along in the early Nineteen eighties we had something introduced called USA Today I had a professor at college in the eighties and said they even were smart\nEnough to make the boxes they brought out on the streets boxers looked like TV screens when you walk up to them\nBut if you if you look at USA Today they were four sections all one was sports one was news and that they dealt with all these different one was entertainment forgot what the fourth was but if you look down the left hand column there were these short\nThen yet whether the grass\nYou know well people were polled and they responded this way or just was a little news hats and then if you looked inside there was a fifty state roundup of news but most of these round ups were just nothing more than a paragraph collected from each state because they had determined\nThat Americans themselves we were changing culturally and no one was going to be sitting down and reading a long long winded various news stories\nAbout government and politics the things that might actually impact your life and they were taking it in a new direction\nSo the the latest from the Poynter Institute is things are very very bad out there on the media landscape and yet they've really been bad and and people tend to look at this and say wow things have really changed but keep in mind radio is not quite a century old TVs while under a century old and\nEven what we call a modern newspapers really only date back to around Nineteen hundred everything before

attended an event yesterday where there was a lot of discussion about proposition to now I don't\nI don't make a big secret about my politics are supposed to talk radio show devoted to it I voted early yesterday I voted no but a lot of people out there are still aren't sure this is for the Medicaid expansion in either right with the idea that we still have a lot of uninsured horror that we could cover we expanded the program\nAnd and they pointed that out a a ... in the it was not a debate it was more like a for a ... if you will and and so they had did ask questions and and they had a

issue of this campaign rather than the candidates on the ballot interesting so it but they ... you know they talked about okay\nWhat is our problem where where do we ... why should we be looking at this thing all the department of health and welfare state of Idaho I contracted with a company called\nThe middleman report and they submitted this report to the state of Idaho and and uh or to the health and welfare department just after the a number of uh\nPetitions were validated indicating that yes we could put the and should put this thing on the ballot so they run a couple of of of studies and they said okay here's\nHere's where we are so they said okay the state of Idaho is going to have a deficit of ever of about a hundred and five million one hundred and five million dollars over ten years so that's approximately\nEleven million dollars per year I'm federal pointed out that the a\nLegacy money that we get from the tobacco industries over their landmark settlement here a few years ago with the various ah\nAttorneys general in the United states we get about Seventeen million dollars a year from that fund he said all we'd have to do is reallocate the expenditure of that\nTo cover this Medicaid expansion now there's all kinds of issues with is this thing and that is that the middleman report\n'em like all statistical functions they do not build in any um what if they take the current statistical information and projected forward on a ten year platform assuming no variations such as economic\nDownturns yes as a land and and the unemployment rate at two point nine percent in the state of Idaho and so we're going to have extraordinarily good economic times for the next ten years in the state of Idaho\nWe would all like to think and hope and maybe even some of his pray for that kind of a situation but history tells us we're\nAlready about ... the eight or nine years into a an economic expansion and they don't last forever we're waiting for the next shoe to drop and\nAnd the one that does what's gonna happen to this economic base in the state of Idaho and middlemen does not take any that into consideration that's not their objective they are given a set of facts\nConsiderations and they just simply push it forward through an economic model no consideration for\nUm eventuality Z or downturns or on knowns so everybody's gonna throw rotten eggs that they're at their report and say aha they didn't do this therefore it's no good well nobody else does either so get off of it is just a distance what'll happen\nIf things remain the same and they they indicate the mailman report indicates\nThat uh we could be and we could be in good shape your uh this is not that big a deal now there's a\nApproximately a Ninety seven million dollars of of a a health funding medical funding that this local governments\nThese because if you are considered to be an indigent chair person you make your application to the county government and if they validate them to determine desk correct then they will pick up your costs like for example at the hospital\nOkay so how does a wealthy comedy like Lincoln or cameras to come forward and take care of all of these people um\nI did they because because the state reimbursed as the county okay for these indigent costs and and so with with the uh\nAdvent of an expansion of Medicaid these people would all be
