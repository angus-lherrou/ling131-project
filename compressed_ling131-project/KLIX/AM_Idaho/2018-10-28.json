Paul Miller a could've killed starting an Eighteen Ninety eight until he was willing to lead stopped um but what we have\nIs we have a name and we have a description curious to see whether that my jogging anybody else's memories of a local story in their community like it did with me earlier in the show we'll find out next uh coast to coast am this is Ian but [noise]\nThe natural habitats a creepy ... is a horror movie that compound being creepy it's that small fixed smile on his ... guys which more can you sing\nDid he use word they lumbering type of axes\n... uh mostly uh like an axe that was found in would pile ...\nAlmost all of the house and I see the murders\nWere uh uh we're houses burn wood times\nCoal a buddy either water coal use an ax to split the wood or break up the coal right he would he would use the coal actually the boy that would actually whatever you found outside the building\nWas you know the answer is actually to my previous question about dropping the X. I wasn't so much thinking in terms of\nFingerprint evidence I was thinking that could lead somebody to find out where he and purchased the acts but you're saying in every home he picked up the acts from the nearby would pile and use that so whenever a type of actually had in the house that's the one he left behind\nWhich is another point about Nineteen ten and I think than it was very common for people to have an ax oh yeah and it wouldn't mile outside their house oh yeah I was going to is why I connect to the story I grew up in a small town in the Nineteen fifties and sixties and we have an accent what Bob that's not our house and I\nI chopped a lot of work with him to ah to a burning out\nYou know my dad till the similar story but then he and his brothers you know they would have to fight over who's going to be chopping wood and and when we were growing up we had an ax around the house that we we did a lot of ... jumping for some reason my dad was attached to it All right so let me bring in Paxton whose in Chicago\nAnd the first time caller line for Bill James author of demand from the train very interesting Paxton\nGuys fascinating\nI'm an English teacher and naturally I I lean pretty heavily how how this time of year and I I wanted to ask your guest village feet he noticed any ... any parallels between pose a vision you wrote about it that says\nThat the murderer always has a guilty conscience and really tries to get caught and some of the more famous stories like the black cat well ironically the berries and acts and his wife had right that's what he describes it\nAnd and when it leaves calm he is not going to be caught so you know you hear all the cat in\nWhen he describes it and and one of the least calm he he's not going to be caught so you know he will he at wall but the cat up to the wall and uh you know we tried to get brought them into the basement and said look how solid that well but he always called the given so what\nThe ... by the way while doing research on the crime book I I happen to find a a story in a Paris newspaper in Eighteen forty six of which is apparently the original story from which the casket with ... among the autos\nHis base the uh the poll also of course was it was a avid reader crime stories as as I'm sure you know\nThe uh anyway the answer is no ... is the absolutely was not trying to get caught in ... many many many cereal murders are sort of playing games with the police and sometimes they want you to know who did it\nUh but they just don't want to because I don't want to be convicted of it\nBut that's one thing that's quite unusual about this man is the had a very unusual or aversion to being caught he didn't he wasn't he wasn't he absolutely was not trying to get caught and he was taking very intelligent and very well thought out evasive action\nNot ever to be caught one reason he never took anything from a crime scene even the you know if there was a hundred dollars sitting on a shelf there\nYou wouldn't take it because he knew very well that if he was caught fleeing a crime scene and playing a scene with or something that could be tied to that scene he a lot of people were executed for that\nThe uh so no he was he was very nice to uh quite unusual extent yeah have a an aversion to being caused\nSome serious restraint right there for a guy who didn't have any money that that that shows some disciplines um beg your pension as good a marine who's in Athens, Georgia until she goes for Bill James Marie\nHi in in ...\nUm well I was calling because I I was kind of curious first of all you got just now talking about the acts and um my my brother and I we were investigating murder happened it was after the civil war in our family um\nAnd he was my great however many that grandfather that was he was killed with an axe\nAnd then they think that his wife and maybe a fan did that but it ended up being a brother in law that was convicted of it and\nUm he was right out and I feel I guess they have that same field workers would be blamed for it anyway and so we were investigating that and then my father was murdered a year ago\nAnd then his son is in jail for killing a guy about two years I guess right now so it's just there's been a lot of it around but um\nAnd I was wondering you may you mentioned earlier about\nIf a person you know if they didn't make a lot of mistakes and the person that we believe that killed my brother he um he seemed to be [noise]\nHe was so far he's gotten away with it and then how do you find out about a person if he is um you know where that found that\nThe obvious one or get maybe he had done this before you know what I mean he was\nBecause every little detail he sang she may have now and when and\nWhere does it seems to perfect for the first time this is what you're saying\nI I certainly feel for you I'm very sorry about your brother meat you are and and uh I Wish there was so good help that would be helpful to you but I I there really isn't\nBecause I said in our case we were just very fortunate to uh to find this treasure trove of information about the about the first crime the ah but I I it's not something you can and we ... we could ritual and I were to sit out so in other series of\nCrimes like this we wouldn't it wouldn't happen for us it's because he wasn't something that happened because we were smarter because we knew we were doing it was just the way the crime set up the way the story's set up that broke for us\nUm again ... ... to my ... in New York for a new genes into Tuesday um\nYes good morning gentlemen and when the light to a a C. E. on your back in this adolescent where a good luck with that Web looking forward to it but I have um a a two part question with some comment\nAnd I'll listen I'm over the uh well it's not the ad in New York it's it's over the Internet [laughter]\nFirst thought is now we have especially with all these cases at at hand uh people at the FBI or consider that profile is so I like to know if you put this in a more modern contacts\nHow a such a a FBI profile of might might slashed this guy out much further um also I like to hear more about and whether it's in the book\nIn terms of so many innocents that got caught up including the black people who um [noise] wound up but not even going to trial but getting Lynch and the last part\nIs uh I I you mentioned about the state of the police at this time at the turn of the century\nThat saw the um [noise] uh\nI recently read a book by um\nNo ... it's called how the I which became why this is on the Jacksonian Arab pre civil war\nAnd he actually describe the police besides the fact that you know they had to I was looking for a fugitive\nBlack folks but they off this but then as basically\nCompeting gangs and basically street gangs wouldn't volunteer fire departments\nThat had competing fights and and demonstrations and I like income that whether he's familiar with the gangs that came up as as a that formed in the police and I'll listen over over the Internet thank you so much for\nYour for your most intelligent questions yeah I'm somewhat familiar with the firehouse gangs are from New York and brief civil war because they\nAre I wrote about them in the most popular crime or the war in a there was a woman this gets back to pose there there was a woman named Mary Rogers who was murdered in a New York and I want to say in Eighteen forty five or thereabouts\nA poll home fictionalized says the murder Murray rosy but the actual woman's name is Mary Rogers\nThe uh in the uh there was speculation that firehouse gangs were responsible for her cry for that\nCrime that they they it really is an odd thing that there were these fire houses that were really just just a a housing was assembly Joe's of pretty unruly people uh and they and they were kind of terrorizing the city\nSo yeah I I Do the that's an odd story isn't it\nYou would opinion you're right there because you need to get back to ...\nAnd then the lynching fees which is definitely in the book and\n\n[noise]\nWe've got callers coast to coast leading to talk with Bill James give us a minute here's we wrap up the last question\nUm we talked about how there were in fact gangs of a fire departments and\nAnd I I think if anybody wants to know more about that too it's handy to go to you can watch the movie streets of New York right to Scorsese movie and they think that there's a lot of that that's illustrated in there that's kinda cool but uh she left it because the question about what it if you had a modern police or FBI profile or take a look at this case\nI haven't had to do that because the that would not be in my nature I mean\nYou know but this is\nMy book is written to say that's what I think and if you think something that's up to you I I but I wouldn't ask them a John Douglass modern ... father has spoken and written about Alaska or one of his observations was\nThat ah the um\nWell he had several observations about all of a crime that lined up with what we believe for other reasons one was\nBecause he is extremely organized I mean he is on the chart of how organized as this burger this guy is unbelievably organized a the a and and also he\nHe um he said that Robert ... Kelly who was accused of murder is it for us to really couldn't have done it a because his mind is very disorganized but also because\nHe was not physically strong enough um we know that the Paul Miller was physically extremely strong and extremely agile the um uh so yeah there's something\nThere's something there but not a lot I mean I haven't I haven't asked profile or for his opinion I frankly wouldn't care what they have to say because you know they got their opinion I got mine are a lot of the book is about\nInnocence accused of the crimes that I'll tell you briefly just one of those stories and murder in Maine and Nineteen oh to\nA man named Henry Lambert who was quite obviously MSN was accused of the crime [noise] he was just a a he was a a I'm not around me was I got a an an educated illiterate French Canadian who uh who uh you know ... borderline homeless drank quite a bit\nHe was accused of the crime and was in prison for Twenty years uh before a it became a cause for lab in Maine and a very good lawyer eventually work work trying to free him and the free him the governor of Maine eventually\nI grab it grab a full pardon to him on a on based on a ... on actual innocence a buddy\nThat happened after he spent Twenty years in jail there are a lot of stories like that in this in the book it's it's quite a it's a a terrible side effects of what happened then again\nBecause they are police are are not relevant to this story because they were by Nineteen ten in the New York city police were relatively organized relatively sophisticated\nNot relative to know how but but relative to the places where these crimes occurred these crimes occurred in places it didn't have a place to park they are they are they had like a city Marshall and that was it\nThe er so it's not it's not really the the uh not really that connected to my book\nYou know fairness um but it just to illustrate ... in that movie of of how those gangs tied to operate within government is the where everybody was vying for jobs even if the ... getting insights to keep them\nOn and in the end by the way I think ...\nOr ... indoors what you've done I think you know I don't think you'd be a very proud of the way in which they might help so it's a nice of you to say no I really did I don't think I think they would endorse it and I think they would find some interesting insights in there but this is the first time caller Jay does in Chicago on coast to coast am for Bill James ...\nHow can\nI go ahead and say I'm I'm Glad to hear you back I call it calls\nThank you yeah thank you\nUm I have a couple of comments for Mr james you're a large and I think and you you um didn't do your homework Bill James basically invented favor metric for baseball\n[noise] so I have heard and yet at the ditches advisory capacity I Know I I had heard about that on Twitter but I I really I didn't want to get too deep into that but and I feel the to bring it up in in law him for that\nBut yeah I yeah I I I think he needs to be lauded for that he's out of their visor initial paid advisor for the Boston Red Sox now but he ... his\nFor that I use out of a visor who are paid advisor for the Boston Red Sox now but he ... his entire life and I and what is China than about my this book\nIs I think you're kind of listen to the bottom of why I I'll forgive him for that because I Love you\nI went to a broader point you think I'm missing\n[noise] I think you're ... [noise] you know that you're topical alleging okay\nWell in the bill is going to happen if I had been a ... a appropriately treated you as the legend you are please accept my I'm up all that the\nAverage age you're saying that that gave it's awfully nice of you the uh I'd hear them before I go back to the McCain but uh I my both my career has been working in baseball and I appreciate your knowledge that and a researcher kind comment\nI understand that and I understand why you wouldn't want to make screen connected to what\nI just think that needs to be sad that he has a lived in a bag and he's very very far more enjoyable to me throughout my whole life and they have your ... or you know you know what I'm saying though\nBut anyway the the reason I call them is just silly thing as time of year by you pointed out in Nineteen Ninety or eighty nine game was the first smarter than Boston around you are\nAnd and then I was curious I started thinking about what was your barter murder the exporters and if there's any connection to them to\nSee it it's a fair question the question we get a lot is a cause he's reconnected to New Orleans ... murders and and the answer to that with his easy no they're absolutely the knock connected to New Orleans sex partner\nThey are but the Lizzie Borden case is not as easy to uh to reject because of a time and place\nHowever it's quite a bit different than our murderers aperture committed with a heavy acts\n... in the middle of the night the Lizzie Borden murders committed with really a a hand hatchet hand held a hatch it in the middle of the day and and they do not have really any of ah but I don't have very many of the signature elements of our crime so I don't think they're connected all by camp\nOr couldn't say that uh you know an odd connection between the two crimes is that uh\nThat you probably know that in the Lizzie Borden case there was a man staying with the uh\nUh the board and family are on the night before they were murdered and he was a farmer who had a farm maybe ten miles from Alaska so that's an odd connection\n[noise] uh and uh ... I think the Lizzie Borden pieces interesting I think it was the first thing that came to mind for a lot of people and in ... speech to the idea of going into a ... does connect in the sense that it was a family\nIt was a house it was ... and then it was a it may be a crime of opportunity um in in grabbing an axe that was near a hat you know that was that the property that to inside on any idea that it was in and out really quickly and then nothing was stolen\nWhich is another piece because you know that was you know like why would somebody going to the house and killed were it not for that that was the part of the motives piece it was presented you know against Lizzie Borden was that she stood do inherit property which makes sense\nBut it did it did give me a moment to where I was thinking about the art let's go to a dentist is in New York on coast to coast am for Bill James author of the men from the train bill then is\nMore than you know\nFor Bill James author of demand from the train bill Dennis Tom ...\nIt's been a wonderful program um thank you for taking my call I really appreciate it\nLed us um\n[noise] and you know I'm Glad you're back I listen to you for years and I I Know you went through to the problems there are a little ...

it's if it's a Halloween all year long would you do special for Halloween\nAnd the people go out to grade arm which is a local farm and ranch community is about seven miles out of town where they participate in the corn me a great family at the coordinates together like the hieroglyphics that\nWere supposedly on a UFO spaceship that landed in Nineteen forty seven at Eighteen get every single year and it is a great opportunity for people that go out and really tried experience aren't about hunter feeling of getting our NFL like you're a\nCrack in Nineteen forty seven other people go out to fight on my bike and car\nA wake up and has a mystery at bottom layer and [noise] and it is our ten miles from Roswell beautiful a great place they are in camp and things like that I\nLike that and I'm more more of the star and the color of can people get dressed up and they feel that they become one or they may come down and ah you know the fact that there there is something here that landed in there\nThey feel that they become one or they may come down and uh you know it's just that that theory of there is something here that land it and they're trying to connect with them especially around Halloween and during the UFO festival in July\nSo I ... I'll be traveling through rose while I'm moving coming up I'm In a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through rose well on my way to uh my new position will be teaching a Kansas State and my my ... my younger son and I always wanted to go to Roswell right so we\nWe we mapped it out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of our way to dip hunter Roswell before we come back up again and it seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people tour when they're out there is anybody we're interested in in being able to\nGo to the crash site or ... or to go to any of the other locations that are ... to the famous story of the crushing Roswell were what can they do\nSo they can go to the rival on international year from him and Research Center which is a great opportunity to really dive into their historical and the research a part of the clash\nI'm definitely what check out the library for those who are really the seekers and do you believe\nA and it isn't it that we have a UFO toward that is done by a local researcher he's been doing research on the crash and your first for over twenty plus years and he will take you to the exact location of the timing of the incident\nAnd on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival for the first time last year the baroque or families where the crash occurred allegedly they will take you out to the crash\nSite where a Mac rebels rent a house is still kind of in in place and you can see where the crater landed in in the land\nAnd so those are just a couple of of things that I Would definitely recommend that people check out and um you know search for the troops themselves\nOkay so ... to use the word allegedly which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened you know something we don't know\nI I Do believe there are some people still are kind of on the fence and so we invite people to come and find out for themselves [noise] uh we you know there's a lot of research there's a lot of\nA local people here that um people can talk to you when you go into the museum uh the locals know who the tourists are because at the sticker and you will come and walk down our main street and go into areas that new one which is a great story\nOr bring your camera to take pictures stop in the ... visitor center we have two amazing alien that we'd decorate a for each holiday especially now\nFor Halloween [laughter] he puts on a big fall festival with\nOur police officers and things like that for the community but\nI'm the they're about six foot alien and uh people love to take pictures with them and they'll hear the story of you know are employers them on his name is Bob and ... and\nUh you know people really come here searching for the truth and we as local we we don't want to say one way or the other we want them to figure it out for themselves and and you can research\nWell that'd be great thank you appreciate the let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in Raj well or the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the UFO days\nUm so our population has doubled in size we're we're account about forty thousand and especially on the\nOr um you know ... ... ... ... ... are high on average per year for Korean family over two hundred and thirty out in ... at ... center [noise]\nPretty good pretty good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts uh and so I'll I'll bring in our next guest next but thank you honey to and if I'm if I'm driving through time I get a chance they'll say hello okay where are you there and care\nHoney to Jennings is the uh the the the director of tourism a public affairs in uh Roswell New Mexico a season with the which GW Oscar\nThe subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a Gemini let me just tell you it's very funny book Yuri great sense of humor really enjoy all the sort of a comic sides on a serious subject because\nAnd we'll get to this your second this is this is a very unusual place in America but it has\nAn even more extraordinary place in the timeline of American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people that come to visit during the month of October is that about right [noise]\nYeah that's about right there are about forty thousand usually I'm On Halloween just how itself about a hundred thousand people come um and of course the month than a quarter million so the massive amount of people for that small city to have a set of orders\n[noise] well I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of bugs it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's not it's not a narrow subject but you picked\nHalloween in same subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative and we just did a guest a couple of weeks ago\nAbout a on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views on Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that\n... that there are other places around the world outside of Salem that had massive hangings and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\n[noise] yeah I always try to tell people that failing wasn't the first ever which trial wasn't the last ... into a trial wasn't the biggest wasn't a stranger for the you know there are [noise] you know the first for trout America you're a victim in Connecticut and in Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims centuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which is killed\nIt is and it's honestly it's really a problem today even in ... and I'm also developed countries are still being people are being asked you for being with us but the the strange thing about that to me of course is that all the things on the planet that I've had this problem and it's pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and I fell in Massachusetts\nIt's which city usa so we'll get to that a season with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem and Salem at Halloween and the way um I liked the rub zombie story there in the book to and then coming up next our on coast to coast am\nThat can be confusing my advice don't go at it won't get unbiased help to find a plan that may cost less and cover more with our co payments more choices like dental and vision and the freedom to choose your doctors with the enrollment deadline only weeks away it's important to act now\nOur health markets Medicare assistance as freight\nThanks Mike this is Michael method for health markets\nAll year free Medicare assistance coal eight hundred six nine for forty five forty two that's eight hundred six nine for forty five forty to eight hundred six nine for forty five forty two\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nSo er Jay W ... author of a season with the which I just had to look up some of those steps that we had mentioned\nMore vaguely two thousand eleven Largo Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt link a shirt England or long ago turned its ... which is incident in which ten people were hanged and sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw\nIn Sweden which memorial for the more than Seventy victims who were beheaded and burned in sixteen Seventy five\nIn Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in the late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused\nAnd that's just some of them and not even all that happened\nIn America but its Salem that sticks out and so why why do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous\nOne that sticks out and so why why do you do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the craft\n[noise] it's it's really a mystery honestly even that's one of the big questions I had gone to the book and I think it's a combination of probably two dozen different factors honestly that gets Salem as which city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing\n[laughter] yeah that's a big part of it but I mean I'm not a big part of it that's a small part of it but it was about a dozen other reasons why kind of Salem grabbed onto that moniker and kind of held on to it you know over the course of about two centuries\nBut it's kind of like you know it's a moniker of shame ... right I mean it's not that's not usually one holds onto you know that even you know it's we just talked to somebody from Roswell in and that that was an incident that was that happened\nThere but\n... and they they take advantage of that for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually it's words you don't hear about Chicago's celebrating the fact that it was the home\nOf that crazy serial killer famous worlds exposition right you don't know did he do go on their way to put up signs and go it happened here folks\n[laughter] right through it I think to to fight for that one is that\nYou know the tragedy in Salem itself was both basically just to the court happened in Salem right it was a civic part of the trials right actual family members and you know the people who really bear that shame over the course of generations were around Salem the actual the actual stereo started next door in what's now Denver's\nWas at the time and sailing village for sale itself doesn't really have a kind of kind of a generational connection to it it was justified of the proceedings\nUm and then on top of that today which city means way more than just the victim of the trials I mean the actual which is a live there today it means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween since ... sounds kind of become Halloween count as well so it's a determine which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today and twenty Eighteen\nYeah I guess it and this is important in a ... this is the great distinction\nCan't help but feel do and sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering that this this really is about innocent victims of murder [laughter] that they were executed and did they protested their innocence until the end and there's a whole industry tend to build up around them now\n[noise] yeah and that is a big ... dealing with that responsibly something the Salem is kind of ruffled with for you know probably two centuries and a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy that's kind of underneath underneath or for board so to speak and part of it that's left connected to the tragedy it's more just around\nYou know city identity and all these other kind of thing just become and and twenty a team\nWell go back to my central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nAh with with absolute pandemonium [laughter] it really is so they they don't celebrate Halloween day I mean they celebrate a season basically so that they thought it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first and October thirty first um but really has bled over into longer than that\nSo if you want to experience Salem don't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year [noise] do you want to visit film at Halloween you're just gonna get pandemonium crowd with a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city of failing itself\nMardi Gras basically it is it really is um I hear talk again a hundred thousand people packed with this\nAnd one of the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know five or six blocks\nAnd you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes a freaky each other out to you know go to go to bars washed the fireworks all kinds of stuff so you're you're definitely there for you know again Mardi Gras is a good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans Mardi Gras you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras [noise]\nUm but ... and I imagine for a lot of times in October ... which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get the same festivities educated Mardi Gras anyway but there's probably some amount of alcohol that's consumed during this celebration\nHeld definitely actually right now or in the middle of a nor'easter so that they'll cuts how many of them right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween [noise] booze is part of it but this is within the party\nOkay so ... ... you mentioned haunted happenings but I mean is Salem known for being hunted ... which Denver's former Salem Village who are seeing them are there are a lot of haunted houses or were there are there still visitations from the victims of the original Salem trial\nOh yeah there's all kinds of algae around that is it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again\nEverything you need for what the classic haunting right you're innocent victims you have monsters 'cause of the film which trial then just involved which is in the story involves Siemens and empty and shapes sisters and goes everything we're in the trials for the big monster mass\nSee all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has you know four hundred years of history or up three hundred and Thirty years of history so that is just you know a lot of dead people over the centuries [noise]\nSo yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening in ... um ghost tours there's spooky places there's the other five executions you have everything you need to build the kind of spooky mythology around the city\nYou know you've been there and most of these I should say you've been there right you go there so oh yeah all the time I was there two weeks ago\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seem to be still situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but it's that's my fault so I I built a career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the band that asylum and murders things are all kinds of things and I've never had an experience\nSo my interest that that is more in the stories themselves you know until the day I have an experience my interest as more than the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know goes the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me yeah\nWhat's the what's the best the best spooky story that post Salem witch trials that you captured while you've been there\n[noise] um well what are the ones that really creepy ones is one of the Boston stream of victims happened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real\nYou know real actual store or vent that then I can reverberate and have kind of thought around that Houdini also visited Salem and like escape from the jail they're so all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know macabre kind of events happened in Salem that nothing to do with the witch trial\nSo all that kind of some kind of feed into that kind of cauldron of a of a mythology around Salem\nYeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was there somebody to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm curious do wizard attempt to for him to do like ... or something while he was there\nNo no it was a the building actually still stands it's a it's a condominium or apartment complex now but it used to be the original jail there there was real police station and he was just there doing one of those things that used to do what he was in towns are performing who go to a local police station or somewhere and perform\nThere was a police station and he was just there doing one of those things that used to do what he was in towns are performing who go to a local police station or somewhere and perform a quick active you know escape as PR move for his next big event so it wasn't down there doing more of a say on busing but who is doing is a is a scape escape retain\nLike ... ... ... you you mentioned that there are still which is in Salem how did they get along with this idea of the the ... celebrating painted the victim who did these innocent people who denied that they were which is where do they how do they play into this", "year": "2018", "show_name": "AM Idaho", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "28"}
