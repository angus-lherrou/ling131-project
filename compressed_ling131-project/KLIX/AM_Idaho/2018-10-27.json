uh go with you I'm In and talk to the senator about we're going to run\nI'm In and talked to senator about we're going to run out of time uh I Would like to invite you to do a um an hour and a half uninterrupted podcast with me under when you have time um because I think your boys needs to be heard and understood\nAnd parts of it challenged I'm sure but uh I I Would like to just pick up on this point so the number one driver of happiness is vocation your one guy that will understand that if that's true in the next ten years we're in deep trouble\n[noise] we're headed toward a really interesting time in human history it's scary and fascinating so somebody some people's shorthand for this ... of the economy I think the simpler way to think about it is just um the average duration of people's jobs or their relationship at a firm\nIs going to get shorter than ever before in human history so let's go macro for a minute hunter gatherers throughout most of human history\nYou don't have any conception of what your job is you pursue that buffalo right and then ten thousand years ago people settled down and started planting and harvesting and we began to farm on a on a regular cycle and from ten thousand years ago to a hundred and fifty years ago nobody had job choice they just did with grandma and grandpa mom and dad and aunts and uncles would ever had done forever eternity past\nWith the industrial revolution we get jobs specialization and it was really disruptive but when people took a job they still kept it till death or retirement not everybody graduated high school at the beginning of the industrial revolution by the end almost everybody does\nBut you still get one job at some time between Fifteen and twenty two years old and you keep it for all of your life I was born in the Nineteen seventies average duration that affirmed for a primary breadwinner then it was still twenty six years now it's four years and getting shorter and it's going to get shorter forever more McKenzie a farm\nI used to work with believes that fifty percent of the American labor market by three years from now\nThis is not Twenty years in the future three years from now they think fifty percent of the labor market will be primarily freelancers meaning that most people will cobble together a bunch of different jobs not all of them are going to be ap enabled tech jobs like being a new driver with the right software that makes you more efficient than an old school Gabby but what's really going to happen\nIs we're going to head toward a world\nWhere people are going to get disrupted out of their jobs at aged forty and forty five and fifty and fifty five forever more we've never ever done that in human history and so it means all of the banks\nOf what's often called now the quarter life crisis the sort of late adolescence crisis of trying to figure out your your role in life and how do you go from just being a consumer and mom and dad's house to being a producer that can not just put bread on the table for your kids but can\nActually have a sense of meaning that you're serving your neighbor that disruption that most people know in late adolescence working experience that again every three to five years for our whole life\nAnd that means there's a lot of new potential for upheaval and frankly for unhappiness\nThere's going to be more economic output than it's ever been produced before in human history but it's not at all clear that it will redound to the median family and the median household and the media and worker\nOr going to have to become a civilization of lifelong workers able to get retrained when you're forty nobody's ever done that before\n[laughter] okay so there's about an hour of questions uh just on on that one uh but I've got about three minutes left can you give me\nA ... your take on the first real political upheaval that we're going to see that I think by twenty twenty ... could change everything could start global wars the fakes\nYeah so one of the reasons I wrote them is because I spent a lot of time on intelligence issues and I'm In the intel community there are people who talk about the perfect storm of deep fakes that we have coming and the storm is these three ingredients number one new technology makes it possible to\nThe audio and fake video where lots of people can be susceptible to being sort of um a spoof or persuaded the things that are real are real there's always been enemies doing malicious actor\nYou know information warfare since the beginning of time you can find it in ... states to sow discord in an enemies tent\nBut it used to require a prostitute now honey trapping effect business\nPartner and a bribery scheme and more for\nYou to get people around people number one is now we can use technology to surround someone and give them a fake experience and ... are fake audio and fake video that are going to seem really gonna make that possible number to Russia is already trying this constantly against us they're just bad\nAt it the real reason we need to take the Russia type investigation so seriously as because China's right behind them running scout team off since I'm On them and ready to do\nBig deep fakes a hybrid war information operations against American leaders and business officials and the public at large and number three we have so many internal divisions about geography about race about um gender about guns there are many many issues where Americans are so divided\nThat we are susceptible to these kind of campaigns like Russia is already trying to run on social media they're just not very good at it where they\nTry to exacerbate and inflame tensions on every side of every issue the NFL kneeling controversy majority of the stuff on line on social media and the for Seventy two hours after that flamed last fall the majority of it on both sides stand for the anthem and taking the NFL most of it was Russia on both sides\nAnd so we're going to have a world where you're going to have things like the cabinet hearings were all of a sudden the audio will appear of Schumer's strategizing with Michael ... or video will appear it'll be fake but video will appear and it'll be Kavanaugh partying hard as an undergrad at Yale it'll be fake but in our echoed silo chambers\nOf the way we consume media right now it's going to be a potentially much more divisive than what we know today and so one of the reasons I wanted to write them\nA why we hate each other is an awareness\nThat there's actually national security exposures for this country and how much we hate each other around politics we need communities of people that live in the same neighborhood that believe lots of stuff in common even when we differ on politics\n[noise] [noise]\nHow come we can't get anybody in Washington or in the media to talk about this than\n[noise] ah it took us what twenty five minutes to unpack some of it and the business model of selling so three minutes from now\nIs let's just say who the bad guy is you know there's there's some nut job somewhere at a McDonald's right now who probably slap to an old man wearing a mock a hat and or that person is a weirdo\nAnd did something wrong but they don't actually stand in for all debate and that's really the way we're consuming most of our media right now is that kind of not pecking and so it's harder to do ten and twenty five year out issues but that's the that's\nThe strategic stuff that Washington should be focused on\nHow are you going to do that when you have about thirty thirty seconds I'm not getting even ask you I'm not even ask you I Would like to ask you to come down a Ben and and really unpack this um because I think your voice needs to be heard and understood and I think in soundbites\nUm it's not a not always understood I'm so thank you very much for them that good to be with your going but\nSenator Ben Sasse um why we hate each other and how to heal I really wanted that you really want to get into him on taking on your\nOwn side how do we feel if we're taking on our own side\nI Hope that he will come down and uh [noise]\nWeight she just said it at one point [laughter]\nOh the first of all the you know the press is a collection of individuals some of which do a good job some of which do not ah so it's important to make those decisions I think um and you know look at that is a this was just this is going on at our founding\nYou know people were ... at our founding and I know and and it at our founding but we but we we realize is when we were in a gauge and informed populace which shows correctly\nRight I mean I I you know if we're not\nWell we know what the ... we know a Republican you can keep it right and if we if we don't choose to keep the republic well then of course it's going to fall apart we knew this was an experiment and that was the risk of it\nAnd I think we are seeing some some of those risks pop their heads up but I mean the whole foundation of this country is to let people come out and make their arguments\nAnd we have to make ours back that does not mean I'm ... and I was so encourage I Hope you are too so encouraged by the ... ... a reaction from conservatives she Nancy Pelosi shouted down a and I did not see a\nPeep of support from conservatives\nOver the actions of the people protesting hurting I didn't see I was disgusted by I was disgusted by it as well and I didn't see any I didn't know I'm not saying there were no no I'm sure people will show me a tweet if some you know\nBye I was disgusted by it as well and I didn't see any\nI didn't now I'm not saying there were none I'm sure people will show me a tweet if some you know not job who was like I think they should harass Nancy policy at dinner but I didn't see one prominent Republican or conservative support those actions not one you could see if we can we played dozens of Democrat and you\nKnow here's here's here's one from Sean King I've said it before but I Need to say it again I'm grateful for ... it's weird that it's politically incorrect for me to say so but I'm Glad we have people in this country who stand up to a fascist and a bigotry and are willing to confront ape face\nTo face right and that you can there's nothing on the left there even prominent politicians yeah I I have not seen one prominent conservative support what happened to policy and that's right and I'm Glad\nI mean that's that shows that there's still you know even though we're divided and even though a lot of things come down to ... minute an emotional politics that go minute to minute I'm Glad to see that there's still principles there\nSo here's where I think than was wrong when he said to deal with that to a um he was right when he said you know it's a small group to group them\nShe's right it is a very small group and they become very very loud because of social media and because of the media but it is a small group where I think he's wrong is ignore it\nAnd he said part of the solution is ignoring yeah and I think you know because you can't get to the point where like I Would say the same would apply to the alt right right you know as a Charlottesville situation um you know\nThere's obviously a crime committed their that dumb you can't ignore 'em but generally speaking when well bunch of Nazis or KKK members this has been I've been forever at least starting back forever but your ticket gate members walk through your town like ... you know largely speaking it's great to ignore them\nBecause they want attention and they run they most that's not what we have now we have to a breaking laws you can't ignore them not came you know you can't ignore though I don't care if it's the Nazis or ...\nYou can't ignore enough excess would argue nor the right I mean like I think he's saying that we get a little bit too wrapped up in the back\nAnd forth of viral videos and people who are not even really engaged in politics for getting freaked out over things that they're never going to have to necessarily deal with a few ... a group like as a photo though that's how they grow or and\nOr at least arguably that's how they grow their own oppose you're seeing it happen in Portland right in the mayor is largely just ignoring what they're doing and it's getting worse and worse and worse and worse that does not mean our lives have to be ruled by anti father and I think that as the generalize argument he was going for\nWell the the\nThe key here is what do you do about it and the solution is to not to do what people did in Florida when dancey policy you don't do that because that doesn't give you\nDecide to run to yeah you don't do what the Proud Boys are doing I'm Sorry but it's so I just\nWhen you talk to gabbing about that and yeah and I think Gavin is even you know looking at things going again you know look we were we were doing things because you know it's funny a\nMedia yeah he's a comedian um but you know this this will grow out of control you just don't do that 'cause there's nowhere to go when you're watching that you're like well I don't like or Nancy Pelosi is doing but I don't like what they're doing\nSo who do I go to and look at look how the press is treating Donald Trump because the press treated capital everybody kind of hard and their positions to me everybody just hardened their positions and ...\nHave a everybody kind of hard and their positions to me\nEverybody just hardened their positions and got more outraged\nThe only the only thing that might have happened is independence looked at that and said you\nKnow what I don't want to be with those people left the left and\nAnd I don't want to be with the I don't want to be with the left and then looked over to the Republicans the words misbehaving during that but what are we doing to welcome people in if you're kind of saying I don't want to be with those guys and then you see\nYou know you ... get out get out there pounded on ... and you're like okay I don't\nWe can't we can get to a place where people disengage because if they do completely disengaged\nThen it's just run the country is run by radicals we need to be a safe haven we need to be a place of real thought real actual timed this um and real principals\nAnd we have to present a rational logical alternative I mean that that is one of the reasons I'm a conservative right right I saw the left you know early in my life as a group of people who made decisions emotionally yeah and that's not something I Want to be part of snow\nAnd we can't be a part of that we can do that ourselves let me go to Andrew in Florida hello Andrew you're on the Glenn Beck program\nGland that morning first time caller longtime listener high out during the day very good\nAll right yeah you know I I just wanted to let you know I mean I'm here from Florida I'm In an independent or most of my adult life and I'm exactly what you guys just said\nThe vitriol on both sides it's so ridiculous I think a lot of independence just stay out of it because it's so immature and it makes everyone on both sides both bad because they just can't talk to each other anymore it's just\nAt our God now that being said\nEvery one that I Know that's an independent in the state of horror will be showing up for the conservatives November\nReally are and why are you\nA simple reason she you've got people in the office it off just right now out there that are fighting for lower taxes I might I'm bringing home over three thousand more dollars this year than I did last year which is a huge\nDeal for me I've got two little girls and I've got one more finally I got my first son\nCome in and they only [laughter] uh yeah I mean the U.S\nAt ... ... there's there's things like that are going on and on and I'm a conservative Christian\nShow up at you when you're when you're talking about\nWhat these people represent and how they forced themselves into a restaurant to confront people when they're eating with their family or most dependent and that's exactly the way I Do they just so disgusted with some of the rhetoric on both sides\nWe just ignore it and we've always been independent thinkers are we are going to stay that way but we also know what's wrong is wrong and what's brightest right as far as\nThe big picture is concerned I think a lot of people underestimate that\nWell Andrew I'm the EU is what you say is true ah than people are are ... ... then the Republicans will keep the house most likely\nA because it is so close and levels we've never seen of interest in participation in the mid term election ever a and it's it's within the margin of error between the two that if the independents come out and\nTo make all the difference under which direction we go thanks so much Andrew\nWeekdays at noon eastern kisses banana republic which free markets the blaze welcomes the D.C show we\nHave a record of him screwing us so many times before this moment principle conservatism just needs to be grounds for an ethical just farm it perhaps serve daily you can always count on Republicans to try and do whatever it takes to preemptively cave on every significant fight us deep dish out their own food as strong\nWeekdays at noon eastern time the blaze [noise]\nMm\n\nIf you experienced pain on a daily basis I
