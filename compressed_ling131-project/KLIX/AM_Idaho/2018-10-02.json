way through a little bit warmer temperatures today is wearing a steep just came back from a place where there's not a lot of rain that was Arizona oh law and let me tell you enter of course we've got while we were to dry spell ourselves but a vet is home state of\nJeff Flake [noise] oh yeah and there's a lot of people down there who wish that he would go somewhere else they don't like it all away um\nWe were just south of Phoenix so that did not the major metropolitan area but close enough that that uh you can reach out and touch it from here\nSo you know you just see people in stores are visiting and and and you'd ask him about ah I'm Sally how can remember her first name Martha Martha that they are you are\nAnd then her race for that the Senate seat and and the response would always be well anybody is better than flight and so you would just ask him well what do you what do you think about I Can't imagine what was wrong with us so we elected him in the first place that guy lives up to his name he's a real for like\nSo you know he he saw the writing on the wall a year ago or whatever it was when he decided that he was not going to run for reelection it was obvious because they run a couple of polls down there and and he was drawing less than thirty percent\nAnd he looked around and said boy that's a lot of territory to cover if I'm going to be reelected especially when I have alienated the president\nAnd so he's not going to come down here and campaign for me I'm done and and so now as ... in his exit strategy he wants to be just as obnoxious and and a hateful ... and\nA self serving\nReally tries to play this role of all the time I Would agree to individual and give\nMe a break you know ... how can a guy served two terms in the United States Senate and and then be so foolish to think that people are going to buy in on this idea of woe is me woe is me look what you people have done to me full consciously nobody's buying that stuff\nI get the impression that he thinks there's going to be this great shift in American public opinion and then he's going to be seen as some sort of heroic figure and use that to propel insult through the primaries and into presidency\nHe I've heard that same speech a while I was down there in Arizona and they just laughed their heads off at that the total light and and that the other thing of it is I'm I'm Sorry Mr Jeff Flake\nFormer\nSenator from Arizona that alienated all of the Republicans um where are you going to get to kind of money is going to take to do that and more importantly\nThere isn't anybody who really believes your message you have to have alienated everybody in in all segments nobody down there was anything to do with him and and even the uh\nThe opponent to ah Martha McSally\nSo nobody down there was anything to do with him and and even the uh\nThe opponent to a mountain bike Sally or can't think of her name I looked at her science for five or six days down there by whatever uh she's only running about four or five five to six I think it was five to six points ahead in a real clear\nPolitics there would be a vote today on Kavanaugh if ... hadn't thrown a monkey wrench into it friday\nExactly exactly and and a Fox News is reporting yesterday that they thought that the FBI investigation will be finished later today Tuesday and and that the a of a\nSenate did go ahead and have their a vote later this week and Mitch McConnell yesterday on the floor of the Senate said we are going to vote this week and and so he he's putting the heat and the people you know you got to get with us here now\nFlake could be a turn coat and just say no but\nAnd uh if he does um the good news part of that is I think the Republicans still have enough votes to win a and even if if a\nFoil America's already been mentioned will go along and and unlikely a Heidi Heitkamp\nI camp is they absolutely positive she's down by a five or six points in ah northern or don't go to an end up part of the process there is that we got to have a decent Supreme Court\nNow media isn't talking about this a lot because they think that everyone agrees with their position on this as opposed to cap and I'll put it in Missouri Claire McCaskill and now she would not vote and suddenly the poll shifted companies now behind\n... I I I think he was behind by three points on real clear politics yesterday morning and and it's going to get worse as the week goes along so there's a a good possibility that we can can shift a jar McCaskill of Missouri a high camp out in North Dakota or\nThe guy in Indiana I Can't think of his family ... family are all three of them could get tipped over big time and I'm\nMcCaskill's gotta she's already made her public statement I Am a high camp in North Dakota has not made as from public statement about to vote on Kavanaugh as did McCaskill down in\nMissouri know their wedding and index finger sticking into the air so much with the wind is blowing\nThat's right and and and a high camp could switch physicians and vote in favor of high camp and hold her seat but McCaskill she didn't have a choice she has cast her vote\nRight there in ... if you ... getting re elected was the most important thing to her she may have just ... might have just wash that went out with a dirty laundry but that's the point to about a guy like flights and so you don't have to worry about reelection he can do whatever he wants all John McCain and there was a mentor and just by the president\nYeah well as an end to a certain extent I think that that's kinda where he's coming from and and although there is a a quiet [noise] level of reverence for John McCain I mean many years and and uh uh uh\nEverybody wants to talk about the ... the great things that he did and and what a great public servant and ... but underneath of that just another bad people are saying yeah but and and so if ... was kind of his uh\nProtege but that's over McCain is now gone and buried in his ... he didn't even come home to Arizona to be married they they buried him in Arlington I Believe it was All right so we don't have to pay any home each him any longer\nI just it'll get to me it is\nI did it buried him in Arlington I Believe it was All right so we don't have to pay any ... any longer\nI I just it it'll get to be an interesting week but when Kavanaugh is confirmed a there was a great point made by forgot who the writer was today that uh if you really have a worry about this going from him and then if you find out later on that it was all true you can always impeach him but\nAnd and that's that's a three hundred million dollar deal 'cause you're gonna have to build a bridge across the canyon\nOr to handle that truck traffic well that takes a lot of the traffic from the Pacific northwest off of eighty six and pulled down Ninety three through Nevada in Southern California and and that like it or not there is an awful lot of of of trucks that handled Ninety three and that's why it's\n... it's easier faster to go straight down Ninety three and into into Las Vegas in Southern California\nWell Harry Reid has gone and the the big push for federal highway funds to redo Ninety three is kind of call if you\nWanted to take truck traffic simply out of twin falls you could try to build some sort of a belt way maybe not entirely around the city but a portion I passed so I guess but then you have evidence demand coming in and you got farmland and you've had that's the problem\nNot that far ahead Twenty years ago and so we have in built subdivisions and commercial and industrial to the point where we do not have open space unquote to build a even a bypass around the city\nComing coming up for thirty though you'd have to sort of swing you'd have to start to bypass before a grand view looping around and still across canyon to get a to the south side of the city for these deliveries these trucks going back and forth on the other hand you're still going to have vehicles coming in from the east too\nAnd uh in from other directions when they go\nThat well the guy guys coming in from the east or on the freeway on ... on a sex could get off at the Hansen bridge and come down Kimberly road or Addison avenue and and and pick up the belt wrote that direction but\nYou know ... to linger and so you really don't want too much truck traffic on Edison when you get east of twin falls after the supply out there and heading east ... ... it's a two lane or and and so you put a lot of truck traffic on that and and you got problems and additionally\nAnd here's the other thing that we've got to take into consideration this is part of the unintended consequences we got a hundred and twenty nine thousand pound vehicles on roads that were built for eighty thousand pound vehicles\nAnd so we'd have to go back through and and not just re surface these roads\nYou're going to have to tear him down and rebuild the sub base to accommodate a hundred and thirty a hundred and twenty nine thousand found vehicles and that's huge expense in fact you might be better off to build new construction than it would be to try to renovate or remodeled\nThose roads\nSo ... and is this a consideration here what are we going to do with the truck traffic into involves\nUm this is a couple of answers\nOr the number one I'm eliminate all the truck traffic from twin falls send all of the commerce and industry and all this kind of stuff out along interstate eighty six ended your own county and get it out of twin falls in twin falls county altogether\nStupid idea rather when is get your check book out we're going to have to spend a lot of money to to get something built that is going to facilitate now\nTo traffic this this notion of some sort of beltway or bypass though could also though the remedy the situation with the airport being on the wrong at a town but as federal wrecks the airport now has easier access in and out and that can help the air force and that that could and ah\nWould would to\nAccelerate the girls in the southern end of twin falls city and and that whole area out there and I'm One of the reasons why it has not developed is no roads\nThe infrastructure out there is just not available and so if we had a bypass than would kind of ... all that stuff up you we would see tremendous growth in in that particular area\nOne mentioned messy gonna try to get a caller in here very quickly we got about a minute and a half before the break cholera Europe
