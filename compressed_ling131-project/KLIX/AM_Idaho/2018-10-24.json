because according deprived of on the Potomac sometimes known as the Washington Post\nPeople keep joining and the Washington Post kit that says no one's really sure what's attracting all of these people and then the writer goes on to say about a lot of them are they seen it on TV or on Facebook or on their apps\nExcuse me a fair living the mud huts in Central America in abject poverty why do they have TV sets computers and smartphones\nOh I Know that's a lot to ask but if it would seem to me that already this notion that these people are living in the stone age certainly isn't true as making a profit on the Potomac there is a writer there by the name of Megan McCarthy and she uh she came over to oppose from Bloomberg News she's generally I think someone right\nOf center when she uh she put something in the paper but she also\nNews she's generally I think someone right\nOf center when she uh she put something in the paper but\nShe also is not one of those people are on the right to choose a fan of Donald Trump it seems that you know all the people that the newspapers hire the Big East coast\nNewspapers higher that they call conservatives none of them are really a fan of Donald Trump they're all from the never Trump gang which pleases the editors at these cars the editors then say oh we've got some conservatives sought staff yeah but they all agree with you they want to see Donald Trump card\nShe has a column today and she says something about one two three four five six paragraphs down that I think is worth mentioning and that\nIs she's talking about how people you know that they see the pictures on TV here is a crime or a little girl ... says he separated from\nHis family is old woman who has been living in poverty poverty and she's only ever been able to eat bananas her entire life she'd like to come to the usa for a slice of cake so they're trying to tell you that your heartstrings\nWith all of a story so she says All right let's open the border and let these twenty thousand people in the course that will be more will come here and we could eventually double the size of the country with all of these people come in here from central and South America and they would overwhelm us not only culturally but economically but they put the government out of business\nAnd liberals she says have to know that and she writes the United states would be vastly more on equal income and opportunity\nMigrants with languishing the kind of squalid poverty that America hasn't seen for a century in numbers a doubling of the U.S population is probably a conservative estimate that it would defeat any conceivable tax and transfer program when you're working with long strings zeroes the restriction is position seems overwhelmingly compelling of that\nIs a yes it is they're going to tell you that your emotional heartstrings but when you realize what the cost of this is going to be it's like oh no I mean even a liberal I mean his goal dang dumb as they are\nHas to be able to figure that one out which is probably why they're not saying a whole lot about this at the moment as a columnist riding in the Chicago Tribune this morning he makes a great point and there's little Latin phrase and I've forgotten the actual Latin\nOn it but it means silences consent so if the liberals are below sea and Schumer and their gang if they're not saying

and or make steel in this country and build automobiles and and all of the labor unions across the country and they're not really pleased about somebody come in here and taking their jobs that that was the Democrat\nParty of my youth that I remember way way back that's a long time ago within the last century yet over time the Democrats\nStarted to realize hey if we brought all of these people here and granted demand dusty they'd go wow Oh thank you very\nMuch Democratic Party what else do I get it in a free lunch well are you just vote for me Jorge for the rest of your time of the United

air go at us meaning liberals\nWe don't really care about the country obviously they you know we've cared about ourselves that that's the liberal as you point out all of this the thing is the media which found all over Iraq Obama as far back as the middle of the last decade before he even announced he was running for president\nThe media followed the Democratic\nParty down this line just suddenly saying amnesty would be good and it would be mean if we don't let these people come here you need any more evidence that the media is nothing but an appendage an auxiliary of the Democratic National Committee\nThe next time you encounter someone from mainstream media and they try to tell you they are biased and it makes makes them they get you can see the smoke coming out of their ears

national me to actually some I Believe she's got a shot at winning well and then there's a few things in the article that I I think if we don't as Republicans if we don't look at them very carefully and take them very seriously um we're going to regret it and and one of the things that have pointed out in the article was that\nI'm In ada county they have already seen a huge rush for mail in ballots are this article was written before the early voting process started last week last Monday\nSo we're we're you know this is a little bit dated in that regard\nBut they said you know give us a break we have seen tremendous interest does this year in the voting\nA ... that they see it from two ... two sources number one the mail in ballot issue is much more ah advanced larger in scope than it was four years ago when it was a\nMuch hotter in Asia booth off [noise] and the voter registration has increased or you can register now until election day but the voter registration is also increased\nAnd and uh the ADA county clerk\nI'm Chris rich told of Idaho press on Monday\nNow the people behind prop one are promising to donate profits to charity but there is no accountability and no guarantee they will actually donate money they lied to us before they're lying again and get the vaccine yourself at\nAll not at ... dot com vote no on ... on paper or by Idaho United against prop

[laughter] who we if we wanted to point out of ... I have and he was a chance to ask the doctors that we deal with on the air their thoughts on a prop too but I got to tell you I Know a lot of people out there are getting a little bit because the polls show which doing well potentially up\nUm but the fallout from this could be devastating front over Mitt\nUnreal unreal forgot but and and they had a lot of Medicaid expansion we should point out yeah we're we're talking about Medicaid expansion which is proposition number two on the November ballot and and I don't know whether it was in this morning's newspaper or yesterday's newspaper where they had the uh the traveling bus come through here encouraging everybody to vote yes on ... green\nBus yeah scrub the thing is terrible [laughter]\nWest and and we're getting major companies jumping on board and backing the the implementation of the proposition number two um so I was at and and you know we can kinda understand why they they want to do that and and that I I've been gone a couple of days\nKind of a a\nInvitation only high level conference and and they will never get invited I knew what when I walked in and sat down I thought to myself oh holy smokes you talk about being out of your element out of your realm what am I doing here and so I\nSelf holy smokes you talk about being out of your element out of your realm what am I doing here\nAnd so I got a chance to visit with the they've got a guy who uh round the conference and I said I you know I'm a I'm I'm honored to be here and he said just chill out Millington sit down right over here and take good notes\nAnd this is the speaker who talked about what this is going to cost us if it becomes\nThe speakers his his primary focus and he's got a list of things that he's done this a mile with it is still new to go through the whole thing but he is extraordinarily well founded and well versed in health care in the United states\nAnd and if you go to a um ... dot com that's Dennis triggers website ethic as go ... you as in in a university abbreviated you dot com\nOr this a gentleman ... his name was um [noise] land he chin L. A. N. H. E. E. land he chin Chinese I think\nAnd and he has said about six or seven minute video that he talks about a health care and what what happened\nWell what really happened was that we started out with the employers providing all the healthcare insurance that had happened back in the Nineteen thirties when there was wage and price controls as a result of the forthcoming or a while you were still trying to get out from underneath the great ... D pressure\nAnd and we had a war staring us in the face and that employers could not increase your wages because they had a wage controls so they provided you health insurance instead of a wage increase and then we see this how it expanded to where we are today\nAnd now we've got to the point where that we want government agencies to pay the whole thing\nAnd he had multiple multiple charts that showed\nA why this does it work is just not sustainable of what it is a constant arguments is that we pay so much more for health care in the United states and all the rest of the world and he said yes that's true but who provides all of the innovation and all of the research\nAnd all of the medical advancements in the entire world who is responsible for that the United states of America and we pay the upfront costs for all of that advancements\nAnd then it is given to the other nations um either through a a theft or whatever and they take advantage of it we're paying for it he said I can guarantee you that if the government takes over\nSingle payer program so there's not going to be any more pharmaceutical advancements there will be precious little medical advancements and we will vote downhill like you would not believe you know\n... ... ... this Medicaid expansion in Idaho would not be would not cover everybody obviously a no it won't be getting us to that direction however it's still would be quite costly even though we're only talking tens of thousands of people have he referenced\nA study that was conducted in the state of Oregon just in the last year or\nOregon past their Medicaid expansion a few years ago after the uh Affordable Care act offered that possibility that you could expand it uncover\nThe people who fall in between the two income strata that the ones on the very low end of the ones uh above that there's this group in the middle here that doesn't qualify Oregon took advantage of that a few years ago so last year\nThey had some academics runs studies at a new analysis on this thing as to how\nSo last year they had some academics runs studies at a new analysis on this thing as to how well are we doing in Oregon as a result of that change\nWell two things surface number one we're not seeing the um major advances in health care to the individuals to the people\nThat we thought we were going to see is just now there are multiple reasons ah people don't take advantage of it they still would rather go to the emergency room that is scheduled unemployment at a doctor's office or a clinic\nAnd and so we have an accomplished what we really wanted to do and most of that is is a a habit thing people have become accustomed to just going to the emergency room I'm ... I'm going to merge and she will\nThey don't go to the ... care office they don't call in scheduled appointment at the doctor's office they just go to emergency room and that's extremely expensive the other thing that he pointed out was the initial projections on the cost of implementing the ... a\nChange in the Medicaid program and the state of Oregon where horribly sadly miscalculated\nWe've got to call her with us was a caller in before the break and then get back to the subject to a collie you're on the air with sea Billington German Prince Charles county Republican Party on ...\nAnd ... how you doing bill excellent shows all these you know\nUm I got to be truthful with you live uh I haven't always been a the the wealthiest personal life you know um but uh I Am totally against as medicate crap I\nI'm not a rich man by any stretch of the imagination but I think a lot of the problem is we got a lot of people\nLike you just said would rather just go to the ER instead of getting out there and do whatever it takes to be able to afford the insurance and that goes along with food stamps and any other is a entitlement programs around the world can you ask\nA population here citizens to vote for something that you can't even tell them how much is going to cost ... yes you know it's irresponsible not run my farm that way I don't run I don't know anyone who does that\nYou know you can go out there and get a job get a second job if you don't have enough to eat cut the cable TV cut the cell phone get out there and get a job give your children\nOr young ones on a an example of what a an adult does know just have your hand out and say give me this give me that it's disgusting\nAnd I just I urge everyone to vote against this you know and like I say I'm not a rich man by God I have my pride and dignity as far as as long as I can work and\nI have two hands and I can walk I'm going to get out there and do that because it's important for me to show my children or the man does to provide when the decisions he's made his lead them to children you know that's the way I look at it thank you for your time\nThe technology industry in the bay area\nAnd and uh she said the prices are just reached the point where that she couldn't even think about\nOwning a home and and the rent and just a very modest apartment was running a two thousand bucks a month and for some strange reason she just took a trip to Boise idaho yeah right strangers\nIs sure she ... she price of houses and she said to herself I can own a nice three bedroom two bath attached to Raj ... for less than the two thousand a month almost half\n[noise] and I can afford that I can actually have my own home\nNow she's liberal and she ... states that right up front I'm not a red red red Republican in Idaho I Am in California liberal but I'm done with California because of the personal economic crisis that I face down there I Can't live down there\nSays she's a liberal and she she she doesn't seem to understand that the reason is that liberal governance in San Francisco in California brought about her dilemma is creating her ... her\nPersonal economic problem she and I ... I Can't figure out how can people can put those things together and say holy Moses reason why this is going upside down in my face is because of the ... government interference in my life see cause I can walk down the streets in Boise and I don't have to walk over human excrement yeah\nLike they do in San Francisco and you know and I think that that's the big challenge because they were to come here and you've already got liberals controlling the city government there\nIf they want to come and tried to expand their their their\nBecause if they were to come here and you've already got liberals controlling the city government there\nIf they want to come and tried to expand their their their values then you'd end up with the same social ills that you have in California so at what point do they say well wait a minute maybe I have to think rethink my political philosophy is there a moment where they might bomb goes off well\nI you know it may given some time but right now the thing that's driving them is their pocket book is being pinched severely infected it's non existent it's just not there\nAnd so they say to themselves oh my goodness this is stupid what am I going to do well get outta here and and in today's environment where you can do a distance employment you don't have to be in the office building in at a desk we can do it remotely\nAnd and I remember Twenty years ago when that was first being discussed white whoever heard of such a stupid idea well it not only is ... ... ... an idea whose time has come it's being encouraged everywhere\nWe've got a caller I think what he joined us color you're up next year on the air was the military will Collier magic selling this morning on ...\nGood morning hey um I Know all about this subject to me that you guys got on it because I came from California in Nineteen Ninety and I've been doing business up here since oh\nHeck high school in Nineteen Seventy five hall potatoes and the trucking business anyways all over the country but bottom line I came up here to get away from the traffic and stuff and I reversed 'cause it was better for my family I still do business in Southern California\nAnd central California northern California all the time and it's about a fifty fifty split all all the guys that grew up with they're calling me now more than just a week ago he's moving up here it's kind of the year\nAnyways they just had enough of the seven hundred dollar license plates for the card but and different things like that and they're looking for homes up here and they're kind of\nHigh these days but that still buried where they are now\nThe problem is and I see this long term I've seen city after city the route the state's played in short term gains\nAnd that's what I think it's happening here they're trying to pay the bills off they created by living in California the handfuls of overcharge charge counts and and the money they owe the bank so their father in law or brother in law or whatever and\nThen there's no way to do after you get the twin falls like my son's already moved to Montana and it's moving up that way now I think in the long term\nHere we're all shooting ourselves in the foot because most of the people regardless of who they are what nationality or what they do for a living\nThere over living the ability to earn the money to stay at the level of education or hard work or whatever the case may be there in over their heads and they come up here and that gives him above\nWater again pretty soon and water always comes back to shore and you're you know what so I really think that it's a short term thing like the streets and stuff here\nThat are not keeping up with the growth here when it said that money is not a problem all you have to do is drive around you see the interstates the same thing it's not just in our part of the country it's nationwide\nGood luck to run on that note because we've got a heartbreak for the rest morning update or see him in
