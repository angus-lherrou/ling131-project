out of high school but I recall would [noise] please do on Sunday afternoons we would watch football with dad\nAnd then when football was done [noise] we would watch sixty minutes that much of America did it at the time back in the day before you had five hundred channels like you didn't even have fifty you had you know just a few choices [noise]\nSixty minutes was one of the most popular programs in the country especially during football season because there would be these leaders from some pretty good games that would be played later in the\nAfternoon Sunday was the type a day um [noise] I I loved it from one perspective see when you were a kid and you're not really happy about Sunday because you know the next day you've got to go back to school it's not like Saturday when you know all good golly this could be fun I got a little time off away from the classroom\nHowever\nSundays I can remember before noon we would be we had a small um little grove of apple trees and I had a grandmother and there would be apples that would have fallen from the trees and these were not you know harvest dinner picked but grandma would actually use them for Apple sauce and apple pies she would if she could just say the\nQuarter of the apple you know being a Depression era individual that's what she would do so I can remember that we'd be out on these fall mornings raking apples and it was not fun it\nJust was not the most enjoyable thing to do but the thing that I loved about Sunday's is the NFL today is to start at twelve thirty they didn't have these long shows that would drag on all morning like they do now\nBut at twelve just for twelve thirty we put away their breaks my dad would say come on and we'd go inside we'd watch NFL today and then we'd watch six hours of football and [laughter] and late in the day it was usually the back in that area of the Dallas Cowboys because they were very popular team\nAnd so they would generally be the lead in for sixty minutes and and so that would be high ratings for football and then for the show looking back\nOn that yeah it was an interesting time I don't watch sixty minutes anymore at all I don't think I've seen an episode of sixty minutes and over it\nDoesn't interest me because it's the first of all the shell has gone so while legal laugh now it wasn't always a lot of us that are always had a little bit of a left or center bent to it but now it's\nJust another one of these uh these news magazines that staffed\nBy a lot of very liberal people who would like to spoon feed you they're liberal ideology cloaked in news President Trump was a guest on the program last night with Leslie stall she's been working I think for CBS and said what our\nMoral hired her a back though at Nineteen thirty eight but she's been there are very very long time she's known Donald Trump since Trump was up a developer in New York and then I teen Seventy says so they already have somewhat of a lengthy history and he's done three of the sit down and if he was with her since being elected president\nSo this is getting to be somewhat of a common occurrence between these two people\nI've heard mixed reviews today about the interview some conservatives are saying CBS tossed him some softball\nBut a couple of my friends who watched it last night sent me there on reviews and they see that wasn't the case and these are conservatives to they say that it was kind of adjusting match between style and the president know a lot of people out there have said over the years that Lesley Stahl isn't the sharpest\nToo in the shed Mike Wallace was a bit of a bulldog when he was doing this\nSo as a at Bradley yet there have been people over the years have been roundly criticized\nOr she has been roundly criticized for some of the interview she's done a can remember one back in the Nineteen nineties she interviewed a guy named David Harding who had planted phony evidence when he was working as a state police investigator and he served prison time and it was said afterwards that he is so charmed her uh\nThat that she hadn't asked him many difficult questions you'd be the judge on that\nYou know we we all have our we bring our own prejudices to this when we do look at the media's work here a couple of things that I wanted to share with you from last night's discussion the president and Leslie stall it aired last night the interview was shot a few days earlier she of course it was CBS News and sixty minutes appear surprised\nThe president doesn't believe that he owes her anything ah and and why would he\nMore slash

L. I. X. and Israel Thirteen ten dot com [noise] and as I understand it early voting begins today in most parts of Idaho that includes twin falls county so if if you ... your conflict it of course\nAbout who you're voting for us and go do that yet\nBut some of us included after the Kavanaugh hearings so if there's nothing to do but go voters straight Republican ticket [noise] couple of things I wanted to know a politically I was just chatting about President Trump's appearance on sixty minutes last night\nThere is a writer by the name of Andrew Sullivan Andrew Solomon is a is a good writer I mean a writing skills\nYou know they can cross party lines that ideology Andrew Sullivan a long time a\nPolitical prognosticators we'll call him that he was one of these talking heads you see 'em a lot on ABC's This week pops up on some network programs elsewhere offering his uh his views are not necessarily\nI I think that the man he he's a he's part of an effort in this country continually de dum de Vinci down\nBuddy you know when he talks about politics generally not talking about moral issues he's just talking about straight politics he had a piece at a publication called the intelligence there and the headline I saw this over the weekend the headline was the danger of Trump's political accomplishments\nNow celebrated a fan of President Trump not at all\nFears some of the highlights of what he's writing this is a long piece he says there comes a point at which laughter begins to falter under the simple steady weight of events\nAnd he says you know as a liberal he uh he looks at Donald Trump then and he finds him to be comical as as as I've noted before Trump's record as a force of destruction is profound whether it be the sabotage\nOf Obamacare the devastation of democratic norms are the rattling of NATO but as the months tick by there's a decent case that Trump's proactive accomplishments\nAre beginning to add up as well a huge tax cuts to Supreme Court justices wholesale deregulation renegotiation of NAFTA isolation of Iran at a broader record of bilateral nationalism out of the world stage\nAnd then he says this\nIs also shifted the entire policy more decisively toward the authoritarian style of government and this respect yes the Trump White house as indeed accomplish much more than many\nOf us walk to believe her back to the\nDescription a couple of weeks after three weeks out from election day of Trump the dictator and if you support Donald Trump and you're going to be supporting the dictatorial\nPower you understand where they're coming from on this they're trying to throw everything they can at the wall just see what will stick he says the Kavanaugh Ford showdown also help to offend the overly simple view that women somehow form a monolithic block all United around women's\nIssues with those issues being defined by the left women are no more single ideological blocked and mad as a majority of white female voters approved and that's what he's sixteen election I was at a a federal courthouse one time covering a story in federal court\nOne of the lawyers involved in the case she had been the woman who who was given credit for coined the phrase\nBack in the middle of the Nineteen seventies her name was carrying the crowd and she had been a longtime leader of the national organization for women and it was involved in all sorts of liberal causes and there was another woman who was working the other side for the federal government just a prosecutor and I was I was talking to the prosecutor\nAnd I mentioned something about well if you know caring represents women's viewpoint and the prosecutor said she certainly doesn't represent mine now that is something you've got to keep in mind because we keep hearing well\nThis is how are people of Hispanic background thing but they don't all think that way or you hear this is how black Americans think but we know they don't all think that way and then when these people start saying the war on women the war on whether the war on women well a lot of women don't see it that way\nAnd and so he's making a valid point here even though he's no fan of Trump he says you know if they're they're not a single ideological block on the far in front of me says the key issue motivating the evangelical an activist\nWriters Israel and Trump has delivered responding late and he's making reference to the embassy relocation to Jerusalem then they're simply what\nHasn't happened last week the New York times published an exhaustive magnificent details that Mr ration of Donald\nTrump's long it outrageous business career and then nothing happened\nNo one cared\nThe polls barge not an inch\nPeople already know that Donald Trump was a businessman\nThat big businessmen that you know they they have loopholes and this is how things run in this country this is the big surprise to anyone the writer says Republican senators likely to be elected this fall will if anything be even more pro Trump than their predecessors there's a new essay in the New York\nReview of books called the suffocation of democracy it deals at some length with the parallels between the disintegration of Weimar\nDemocracy and ours now you see where he's getting\nWeimar, Germany of course which fell as the Nazis took control of the country\nIn the Nineteen thirties so again Donald Trump dictator Germany Weimar Republic Knox as you get it so he writes this is a lengthy piece he writes all of this to lead the reader to come to a conclusion and that says well I'm not really trying to make a conclusion with Nazi Germany however\n[noise] so you get the draft of what these people happen to be up to coming up on six twenty nine bill collie with you on a news radio Thirteen Gen ... news radio Thirteen ten dot com and I thank you for spending some time with us tomorrow\nSee Millington will be in Studio with us between seven and eight o'clock just after the eight o'clock news will

people who actually work for a living and they're making you know sixteen Seventeen Eighteen dollars an hour and that puts them above a certain lines when we talk poverty but it's not a lot of money if you got a couple of kids and you're trying to get by in life it's not\nAnd that's my point there's the left doesn't seem to have any sympathy for those people the less assumes to think you can just keep getting blood and get more and more and more and more that eventually it will kill you\nAnd and so if you don't know if the conclusion is we don't know why would\nWe vote for it you get my drift if they can literally say well it's been done in twelve states and here's the results and by golly it saved a you know half a billion dollars in total and these twelve states and there was no downside then\nI might consider voting for it but if they come back\nAnd and you see these contradictory stories like the one out of Montana and nobody can really going to get good handle on cost I'm Sorry you

need to be compassionate and get this initiative pass\nBecause they have a right to healthcare too and I had to kindly remind them to health care is not a right it's opportunity\n[laughter] yeah I Do drink you go\nIt's not in your state constitution and it's not and your federal constitution you will not find that there are so right the lake Charles\nCrowd hammer at one of his last TV appearance is that the liberals have managed to move that ball far enough down the field that most Americans now do consider is that it's the rights and but again most Americans if you told them hey I'll come along and I'll give you a stipend\nThat will pay for your house that will buy your children's clothing that will buy your groceries or that will completely take care of your house from a cradle to grave\nA lotta people are going to say well I'm In ... but again we get back to the point what's it ultimately going to cost and they cannot answer that\nQuestion as the caller pointed out they just say it's about compassion\nIn other words if you don't want to bankrupt the state you're just being mean I'd throw that one out there for your consideration today but I Do give credit to the writers of the story because I I didn't expect it but I think that they gave this a lot of you know they were\nWilling to go out and talk to people on the other side I criticize one of these newspaper reporters last week I think from the same paper who went out and she talked to a number of people about a global warming\nWas going to bring next year to Idaho yes next year coming to a state near you immediately global warming was going to send us into a severe drought next year and a tailspin and nobody would ever be able to live here because it would be like uh the the planet Venus which is a lot of smog\nAnd heat and dust and and she didn't talk to anybody else who might have another alternative idea on that well that might have taken some time or you might have had to pick up the
