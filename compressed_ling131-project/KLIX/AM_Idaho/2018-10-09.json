N.Y noticed that again when I came in some of the [noise] they went past some of the fields I knew exactly which\nOne should be looking for work and but there was a little bit of mud and stuff on the road she'll kind of be a little careful don't get carried away\nUm remote and rain so will you know my my statement is rain in the valley San ... mountains which this looks like the ... going to get some snow too so that that's OK let's jump up\nThere they need to start on the snow pat let's get it up there in the in the snow where we could however\nBe much worse off oh we we could be in a a Palo tiny Florida Florida yeah\nBad they're looking at a storm surge off the Gulf mhm of about eight to twelve feet ... ... um by the way in case you're curious that's probably just up over to the eve of your house [laughter] and uh\nOther eight to twelve inches of rain so dramatic starting I think tonight and tomorrow so that'll be interesting to see how that little deal works around um we don't need quite that much moisture we wouldn't know what to do with it if we got a hazard shakes\nSo let's just be grateful for what we got we'll just take it and say okay we'll take a little bit of rain and that'll be All right yeah I mean I Know we wish we could get it earlier but All right that's okay we'll take what we can get so here we are\nAnd and a lot to do yesterday we asked the question so with the ... thing behind us only it's not really completely gone right what do we have to talk about [laughter]\nA couple of things there was a study out yesterday published yesterday\nThat are listed the median household income my state okay now this is not individual income this is\nHousehold income okay so why for husband dies right they make the other day a primarily they're looking at the adult um\nWage earners in the household I'm so this does not include any income from a working uh children in the home if you you know the one question that they could not answer is up do we have the uh kids living in the basement\nOf the mom and dad's home is rooted in this household you know it's just two adults perhaps [laughter]\n[noise] so it you know the the the the interesting thing is the national average is about sixty thousand dollars household income\nUh okay that adjusts just an average er\nAnd and uh the the highest and then this is the most disgusting thing in the world the highest median household income is located in Washington DC oh well\nAnd you have any idea who works who lives and works in Washington DC [laughter] that's right federal government employees and and I think is wrong career yeah I did too obvious [laughter] yeah obviously I talked to\nAn end over the weekend there was lots of noise and and screaming and yelling about the Bush should uh Bush\nThe Trump Administration approving a I thought it said one point nine percent in wage increase for all federal government employees\n... might have been a seat at one point nine or two point zero so that it it's close to to just real close it let's just call it to them we can grounded off a little bit [laughter] I don't feel good about ourselves so everybody's screaming and yelling about the you know that's not nearly enough and we haven't had a raise in three or four years and as a da da\nDa da da da da da da da da da da da da da\nDa da ... household income is Washington DC ... did they make more money than all the rest of us so the worst or what's the cost of living\n\nAll the weather is outside this morning\nWhich is a good thing we don't want to\nIt would be nice if you will happen to those eighty degrees temperature there there is that we let them in the summer it won't be that no not for a while I'm a man maybe April maybe\nAt least is just rain like you said [noise]\nOkay I guess we'll have to settle for rain yeah so we're\nTalking about the median a wage in a household Idaho's a forty yes and and and this household income household and now it's come to mind between my husband or whatever the uh what's the word I Want to use a combined\nAdults in the household\nSo that we uh you know look at a husband and wife income and and the statistics say a lot of things and so we're not sure just exactly\nWhat we want how how those work mhm but uh we can uh [noise] it'd be nice to move up on that list\nWell Idaho used to be way down and and frankly um the the Idaho number is fifty two thousand two hundred um Montana is thirty seven and they're numbered is only fifty three thousand\nSo we median income Romney didn't encounter\nWe would not have to increase our number\nVery much to move in a ... not just real quickly okay and so so it's my new to for some states that were just a couple of hundred drawl and we're not yeah we're not really that I mean West Virginia is only forty three thousand\nSo we are almost nine thousand dollars ahead of of West Virginia and and even those right behind us a South Carolina's numbers only fifty thousand oh do you do worse were still ahead of even\nA several of those right behind us ... um [noise] so well into I I Wonder how it compares and matches with our\nUm cost of living in the state because that's a big factor too well how far you're money goes that is right state if if you got family two thousand three hundred dollars um what what can we do with how far can we scatter it out as far as our living costs\nAnd and study after study shows that Idaho is one of the cheapest places to live in the United states when it comes to taxes you till the housing cost utilities\nUm transportation is a high number in Idaho as you'd expect we're kind of scattered out yeah and you have to have to drive everywhere ass right you got to get in your vehicle and drive around so it's you know that's that negative but not burdensome\n'cause we have our housing costs in Idaho are still a very moderate compared to most other places in the in the country and we were talking about growth\nAnd gosh in Idaho are still a very moderate compared to most other places in the in the country and we were talking about growth and twin falls yesterday in to help people building and there has there is a noticeable increase in what rental cars yeah rental costs have gone up a\n... and ... that's a good thing that's that yeah you're the landlord as while you're like that a lot\nNow that's the supply demand situation and that kinda helps explain why we had a a nine percent increase in a new home construction permits new permits for home construction in the past year\nOr because people are coming in here and and they got to have some place to live mhm I'm In twenty Seventeen we had twenty seven four Plex is constructed in the twenty Eighteen when I say twenty Eighteen or keep in mind that the city of twin falls\nA statistical reports are based on a September thirtieth year enclosed and they have a fiscal year\n... rather than a calendar year\nSo um we had a I think the only had two four Plex is constructed in the ... year ended a September thirtieth twenty ...\nAh but that's still a tremendous amount of of uh in in flow into the area and keep in mind that does not count anything in the county nor the adjoining cities like fighter and Kimberly and be a little\nUm those ah would account for most of the other growth so we're seeing a lot of growth now Boise treasure valley is out of control he has\nSaid everywhere you look you'll see something new Year's Day or building like crazy um I go up the freeway and I get off on that ten mile exit which I think is a I don't know exit forty to forty three or something like that\nI'm three years ago there was nothing out there\nNow held a field dirt field ... ... a farmer was raising crops now a developer is raising high rise commercial buildings [laughter] ... two or three of them this completed and probably three or four more this under construction right on that corner\nAnd if you go up to go to a mile there are several four storey apartment complexes huge buildings they must have a hundred and twenty to a hundred and fifty apartments in each one of those complex is just the growing like crazy\nSo I don't think we bought quite that much growth down here we'll\nTake our you know two hundred and fifty new homes this year that there'll be ... that's enough [laughter]\nWould you would get that in mind now there was another poll that they put out that said okay what is the best and worst states economically\nTo live in ... Idaho is number thirty one okay about midway so about midway now\nAre wage growth no no no job growth job growth was three point one percent which is the fist highest number of the fifty one units reporting ... so that's extremely good the per capita\nAs individuals the per capita GDP the other one we were looking at was called household incomes okay\nThis one is per capita GDP I'm only forty three thousand but that's the third lowest so we're we're not forty is on the list were forty seventh on that list so we're still way down low a part of that is that\nA wage\nSouth on that list so we're still way down low a part of that is that\nA wage median income is going to allow individuals to accumulate assets and and that the access and so forth are going to be part of the GDP okay settled film faster that we can grow wage growth so fast you're we grow the GDP and and so we fall out of this\nA bottom tear and move more into the the er an upper quadrant so that we have a little bit more GDP Growth as a state\nUm keep in mind that the the household income thing and the GDP are somewhat relative um we do have a high level of poverty and the state of uh Idaho the poverty rate in the state of Idaho strong point eight percent\nThat's a little bit too high or the national well as the twenty fifth where I'd square in the middle adult joining us at\nA rating so we're not you know we're not the worst or not the best we're kind of Red Square in the middle right um when you look at the GDP number however\nUh Idaho at forty three thousand than national GDP is sixty thousand nine hundred so we're way behind that number and that's\nI'm the kind of be expected you know we're not going to see anything really that much different in Idaho simply because our wage growth does not drive that particular uh\nA dynamic so we're we're going to be stuck\nAnd there's there's nothing really all that wrong with that\nJust it would be nice if we had a somewhat different uh can't get it moving too far it's going to come with time at the other thing is keep in mind that Idaho is growing from a rather low base and we have seen\nVery\nConscientious at significant growth the last four or five years\nThat has moved Idaho forward in many of these are a little formulas simply because we have had this dynamic growth it within the state\nUm shows our population number is somewhere in the neighborhood at one point eight million\nI'm by twenty twenty when we do the two years from now would we do the census report there's an awful lot of argument that we're going to be in the one point nine million range which is going to be pretty handy that's got to put us\nWe're not going to change any huge numbers in the world but that's a real change in population growth ... for the state of Idaho yeah so a lot of that is in ... county um most of it in fact right is ending up in the what I called a treasure valley court or that\nAnd that would be a great state of beta yeah Retta it comes to the legislature [laughter] and that that's keep in mind that's going to be\nCreate a real political dynamic uh when we get done with the twenty twenty cents is where is the power structure going to reside in the state of Idaho when that since this is done and we read district the entire state of Idaho\nNumber one they are very very\nMuch more inclined to be independent and their political leanings then either Democrat or Republican but they have twice as many Democrats in that category\nAs we have Republicans as well and I'm curious which way the end they the majority of the independent lean um it doesn't have an indication here where they'd leaner which direction they're going\nOr the conservative independents are liberal independents moderate independents that that's the\nHow many of them might be leaning towards the conservative side of the road as opposed to a middle or even to the left\nUnfortunately it would not take very many of the independent millennials to align themselves with the Democrats that they would absolutely control election outcomes they'd have\nI mean if if just one third of the uh millennials who identify as independents\nFifteen Percent of them would vote democratic they now have a majority whereas in order for the Republicans to when we have to have almost forty forty or forty of the forty four percent forty percent of those have to vote with Republicans in\nOrder for them to carry an election that's going to be extremely difficult if not impossible to do in the next few years\nOut when when does this begin to have an impact\nProbably not in Eighteen or twenty but by the time twenty four rolls around twenty twenty four rolls around\nThe this millennial group is going to have uh\nBut by the time twenty four rolls around twenty twenty four rolls around\nThe this millennial group is going to have a\nA significant a impact in political decisions and political operations and um for example in most states you can run for state office holders\nUp by the time you're twenty five you can run for the United States Congress at age twenty five you can run for president of the United states\nAt age thirty five\nSo you're going to have this this group of millennials which is going to be a larger percentage of the population than the boomers\n\nAnd they're going to vote for people their same age and we could see a tremendous demographic change in who we elect and as a result\nTheir political ideologies are going to be different from far different from the rest of the a political landscape um do do the boomers the millennials I'm Sorry that they think the same way that boomers do\nFor example one of the real major questions we have to face is\nWe're not solving the problem of the national debt ... not at all\nOne of the things that has to happen in order to resolve that issue is what are we going to do with the quote entitlements unquote Social Security Medicare Medicaid ... how are we going to resolve those problems 'cause they're beginning to drain the general fund\nWell or the millennials going to have the same mindset or vision or those objectives\nAs the boomers the older generations\nWell there's going to be as more millennials in voting age than there are boomers and so some of what we consider to be a entitlement issues the millennials could just wipe away and said no I don't think so\nYou guys should have done a better job planning not it's not her responsibility\nTo uh take care of you you should have done that yourself\nSo as we look at the the millennial involvement coming into this thing um they're going to change\nThe the ... the political dynamic probably not till twenty five or thirty maybe twenty thirty about by the time they reach their their numbers are going to continue to swell and expand and and they will have almost a\nHave a large enough percentage that they could control the destiny of all political elections that's going to be a major problem how do we face that\nWhat kinds of issues do the millennials focus on as opposed to those who are much older and are they going to be focused on education or they're going to be focused on infrastructure roads bridges et cetera\nAre will they be more focused on a medical costs higher education costs mhm yeah I'm Better paying jobs [noise]\nAnd more leisure time [noise] uh so we see the conflicts coming in between two ideologies him and that that's where we run into a problem with who's going to govern and how are they going to get that done so the millennials\nAre very well

B. campus\nIn Boise I'm it probably makes long term very good sense to consolidate state offices into a common facility\nOr that a Hewlett Packard campus I don't know what they're gonna eventually ... they don't have a name on it yet they just call it the old H. B. campus so\nUm we're gonna save enough money from rent to make the quote mortgage payment unquote\nOn that a hundred and thirty nine million dollar bond well think of it we didn't have to build a building you know a rose to everything that was already baking 'cause what were you going to do with it the campus um ... it's not a business could have come in and get you to vote for H. P. 'cause they were able to dispose of the whole thing in in one piece who's now they're still\nA H. P. still has\nThat the remaining remnants of their operation on that campus and they have a a couple of buildings overeating dislocation over here\nAnd they are for the foreseeable future they plan on staying right there and using those buildings there's a couple of other tenants that that HP had that were located there and\nTheir plan is to stay and with it but the buildings that they are currently occupy stay there and continue to\nReside at the quote HP campus and\nSo the state will move in there in a in a very a measured specific time frame and and that's probably a good thing because they remodeled the buildings to facilitate a occupancy by office workers because that's basically what the state individuals are going to have\nUm we had something similar to that although not exactly the kind of close\nIn twin falls county oh yeah when when we sold the hospital to a St lukes [noise]\nAnd the agreement was to begin with that St lukes would occupy the old magic valley regional hospital non blacks on Addison avenue while they constructed their new facility out on a whole line wrote and whether they completed that and made the final\nMove transition to Poland\nYou got the old hospital back well they were ... people were kind of scattered out because they didn't have enough room in any one location and so they started consolidating county operations at what is now called county west ...\nAnd and uh that's much more beneficial unusual to the county uh uh operations than being scattered all over town\nAdditionally they've got a lot of space out there not hospital and they just keep running it out to other government agencies that one a little bit of a need space in this area\nThey can go out there they've got plenty of parking got good access so it is very useful and very beneficial for the county to be doing that\nOr is it dollars and cents why he's a good deal yeah probably we've consolidated a lot of functions in one location and\nAnd uh I just time will tell but okay for him it seems like it'll work but we'll have same situation for the ... um and and the cities is ... ... is not ... is currently in the process of building new city office

is still a good chance your brain a little ...\nThirty percent chance of rain and winds do by two and mostly cloudy skies a breeze around the fourteen miles per hour\n[noise]\n\n\nA little bit of a break some more music [noise] you know a few minutes ago we had a caller that\nKind of jumped on me a little bit of the Republicans and Democrats not taking charge of the looming an ever increasing [noise] yeah [noise] that we just kind of close our eyes to the problem and\nAnd let it continue to run wildly and and that just grows exponentially forever and ever and ever and and it's not necessarily a good thing\nSo there was an article isn't that your vote isn't that the vulnerability I mean that that as far as I'm concerned is is a huge huge issue and if you listen to Senator Mike ... I'm One of his uh\nA major points is our debt\nDeficit spending added as a result of that ad that debt that the United states is completely out of control we are not watching it we're not taking care of it nothing ... and it's it's on a run away and we can't we won't we won't take it\nAnd and fixing [noise]\nThere was an interesting article that appeared in the Weekly Standard magazine and if I remember right it is a in the ah October first issue of a Weekly Standard\nAnd and it is that that headline is Washington fiddles while the entitlement problem metastasize\nAs metastasized as\n... the the premise is that we have got huge huge issues with our debt\nThat nobody wants to face\nAnd and the ... the writers of this particular article um well they have their names here a ... eleven and James Clapper Retta they say we have to blame everybody we have to blame both of them\nThat the Democrats are because they want to keep doing this forever and the Republicans failure to lead ... and and I thought to myself wow um that's a pretty\nDifficult indictment to have to face failure to lead so they go they go through this whole thing and they say huge huge numbers and\nAnd uh it it's only going to be very soon very quickly we're going to find that the vast majority of of the federal budget is going to be occupied in paying entitlement costs\nUm Medicaid Social Security Medicare and I had those backwards\nSocial Security is the biggest force in that race right Medicare is a ... right behind it and Medicaid as just come on in the last um half a dozen years doesn't years so that that it just keeps expanding and growing and it's not going to get smaller\nOf regardless what we think about the uh\nUh millennials and how they're going to change the landscape of political ideology\nThis thing is not going to go away if you want to get that if you want to get the baby boomers in lock step and voting as a solid bloc why don't you just suggest you're going to eliminate their Social Security check [laughter] how you're going to see a lot of people who really come to the polls in a hurry\nUh-huh and that's one of the reasons why well they look at it and they say oh this is not good what what is that we should be doing about this particular issue and and how can we resolve it they have two or three suggestions in their article\nIf we made some changes not radical\nBut they would be systemic and they would cause a structural change over a few years five to ten year period of time it would change the way that we look at this thing\nAnd and bring the cost of Social Security Medicare chair admitted Cade under control\nNow that's a long range planning to a politician is the next election is going to say it doesn't go past election doesn't always the next and so when you're talking about a long term arrangement in government it actually is only just a matter of a few months\nBut they have a couple of interesting charging here one\nThat uh I found really interesting is that\nAs a percentage of the GDP between Seventeen Ninety and two thousand forty eight I'm back quite a ways that's a few years she had sure is we had a huge spike\nIn the federal debt as a percentage of GDP in Nineteen forty five and forty six right after the world right at the conclusion of World War two edits spiked up to about a hundred and Fifteen Percent\nOf GDP at the present time we are running at about one hundred percent debt to GDP ... if we do not get under control some of these major entitlement issues\nBy twenty forty eight [noise] we're talking about\nMoney I just [laughter] panicky or start getting sick I get sick or\nThe projection is that we will be at about a hundred and fifty percent debt to GDP\nThat isn't on manageable an untenable situation [noise] it's we can't control it we have a love sold ourselves out to whoever wants to buy our bonds\nAnd at that point in time why don't you just go to your mortgage holder at at the bank on your mortgage on your house\nAnd tell them ... ... you decided to take a little vacation and you'll be back in six months and you will start making your payments again when you get home uh-huh see how well that works and and if we become in ... to which we are\nVery quickly becoming other people they're going to control us they won't have to fire was shot ... no one we will have literally sold ourselves to the devil so the caller was\nSpot on both Republicans and Democrats are guilty because the the problem requires some really demanding difficult\nDecision now as far as [noise] total debt on right away a job in the sense of crisis quite a bit during the Ronald Reagan years\nIs the process by which we elect our president we called that the electoral college to lose [laughter]\n... say that if you lost a lot of shit that's exactly that's exactly right and that's what he says the only time that we attack\nThe electoral college and one is the way we're lawsuit when it doesn't work in our favor fun we lost and we want to destroy it well I'm Sorry you should not have thrown that flag for any legal block in the back\nThe guy was falling down on that and and so he just kind of fell on the other player he didn't block him in the back\nHe fell down and you should not have thrown that flag\nPick it up and let us scored a touchdown I'm Sorry that ain't the way it works [laughter] you know but they want to change all the rules as\nThey play the game because they want the rules to always be in their favor right and then if they're not change of the changes for disregard them nor them at ...\nAnd that's what he says that the real dangerous threat to the institutions that we know of in this country as the process ease of government ... is that the Democrats want to throw all of these things out\nBecause it didn't fit their particular narrative or their desires therefore we need to destroy it or change it or do away with it\nAnd that's what we saw two large\nMay well almost exclusively the we witness that with the confirmation of Kavanaugh they can't stand the thought the idea of having a conservative Supreme Court\nUm Kennedy was kind of the swing vote mhm\nSo sometimes you lined up on the fence and sometimes he was on defense but you didn't know which way was going to go until they snap the ball yeah well now they've got a pretty solid core of conservative judges and that was\nSnap the ball yeah well now they've got a pretty solid core of conservative judges and that will change all the way a lot of decisions are handed down\nSo it was about ... was never about Kavanaugh's credential it was never about his personal background it was never about whether or not he had a value structure and immorality that was not the issue the issue was power ...\nAnd we will ... we we brought to destroy him because we cannot let him be seated so he's saying that the Democrats by pushing this narrative ended he uses the cabinet thing is that a a\nGreat reference point but he mentions several other things that they have done that are not quite so obvious and not seen in the public eye but they do them nonetheless\nAnd they always come back and hit us because they are destroying the the basic foundation and framework of our republic and democracy we have another phone call or what this morning good morning thanks for calling\nThat morning people um you know I I think we need to watch how we keep say conservative justices\nBecause all we're doing is inflaming the other side and really all we care about is is that said a whole lot of laws as stop trying to make laws\nThat was not their job their job is not to make a law their job is to make a ruling on in a state law or the constitution as\nIt should apply and that's\nWhat we're concerned of what we were worried about when the left was slowly inching their way in is they were using that branch of our government to enforce and make laws so they don't have\nTo do because then they're not the bullies they can play in the court it's no different in roe v way and everything else all these people having\nA fit and governors in in left is a communities in and the whole nine yards they don't want it to go away because then instead of the government is forcing it they'll have\nTo go to the states then it becomes their off and then they have to answer for that and they don't want to they don't like answering for problems they just like creating ...\nJust a very very good point and and I I use the term a conservative and I think a a by my definition that is people who would it here too deep the foundational doctrines of the constitution\nSo you're correct we want people who will ah you force the constitution that is currently a written\nAnd the two of them at our laws comply with that particular thing I'm\nSort of an ... standards and then unfortunately ah losers ... I don't want to do that or some real from there we are going to take a little break\n[noise]\nMm\nMm\n\nThe here and climbing in butler with the medical field met her operate fall\nWell the here and fly minute butler with the medical field that are operating fall savings options for your irrigation need for the five hundred dollars off any end got baser combination or upgraded a second ... by adding a free\nField net pivot control like with the purchase of a field that enabled pit received a one year subscription to feel met advisor for the two thousand Nineteen growing season or with the purchase of a field that it able to get a six or eight and slow meter at no additional chart fall savings are here so stop on it and see what's going to bother with the ... the matter can do for you\nIf you blew it nail it screw it faces plug it freezes wash it rabbit saw it put it this way\nIf you're looking for the elements that hold your world together you know the metaphorical nuts and bolts\nJones hardware E N view we have everything you need at the prices you want with the help you would expect from a neighbor ... been fined do most ... thing to do all these homeowners and do it yourself first come on in Jones hardware ten twenty nine main street and view\nIt comes to running your farm you have enough worries marketing your grandchildren me one of them for over one hundred twenty five years in school or people I've been committed to understanding your business than providing superior service let them find the most competitive option so you can focus on what you do best\nVisited them on line at Idaho dodge schooler dot com that to Idaho dot S.
