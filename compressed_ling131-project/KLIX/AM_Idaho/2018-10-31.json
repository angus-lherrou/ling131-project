getting the job done and the Germans realize in order to keep the economy going\nThey got to burn coal we should point out that if you're looking to sell coal one of the greatest reserves of coal in the United states is just to our east in Wyoming and Montana\nAnd they'd be glad to sell it to the Germans if they can get it there because in some cases that are being blocked from shipping it down

with but I think the bigger warning here is that the United states has been able to produce oil in quantities not seen in a forty forty I think it's Nineteen Seventy almost fifty years and because of that\nIs the competition that it's going to be heard in the old up OPEC powers and Russia and and they can't\nAfford that I mean these countries many of them is the only business they really have they have no other experts at any consequences so it could be a collapse of the Iranian regime it could be a collapse of the Russian machine and and that by the way which might sound good on the

farming technology that everything we got we we've got\nA certain part of the population that that doesn't want to take advantage of it they think we should still be buying stuff from China and and we

oil and gas exploration and it could completely shut it down in that state or even many of the liberals they're saying hey wait a minute this little wipe on our state autonomy\nSee that's what I'm saying and we're doing it to ourselves it's not because they're drilling holes oh we didn't find nothing we know what's there they know what they're doing to them do I couldn't drill old beat the

God given gift to this country\nAnd they needed it needs to be taking care of they need to do or right yes absolutely you don't want to do the wrong way and that stuff up but for for us to sit here and just leave it in the ground and keep buying stuff from other countries it's it's ludicrous to pass a night and\nIt just doesn't make sense in any way shape or form and I know damn good well in my heart the liberal know this does not make sense but yet they're not gonna give anybody else credit for for coming up with technology and coming up with the ability and the the fortitude to go after
