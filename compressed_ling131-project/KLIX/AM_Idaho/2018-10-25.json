at the time for inciting that man in fact they likely tried to blame that on Trump to wow you know he started it\nAll I can remember when I get into a fight in school and I have been into a fight in

didn't care when somebody said he started\nYou're off that was how that works so I'm I'm not going to buy into this that this is somehow Donald Trump says something because you see the liberals think

there's a vegetables out of the garden and and his turkey and I mean it was it was pretty funny just to see that\nHappen but you know ... it's fun to provide for yourself and it's a good time of year and hunting season right and that's the the swing of things and so it's a good time to go out and enjoy yourself and I still have a ham from last year and the ... yeah well you better get that kill and eat and ... says you can find something else in their free [laughter]\nYou want to talk a little bit today about big game hunting you know big game hunting has been going on um it ... a lot of the areas close yesterday we had fifty six we had almost all of eastern Idaho for the general deer hunt\nUm has closed we still have a lot of units up north and in in the western part of the state that will go till the end of the month and some out actually go longer but I guess what I'm I'm getting at is people really need to\nCheck the regulations closest time here because we're having a lot of change in seasons and a\nLot of ... ending and some are starting and so just to get a copy of the regulations you can swing by the ... regional office for about two and a half miles north of the flying J I'm there on Ninety three heading toward shown or you can stop by any of our\nLocal sport sportsmanship or stores or vendors in the area and pick up a copy of the rags just said that you have those handy with yeah\nYeah and a lot of people who are middle they may have been hunting all their lives but if they're just relocated Idaho things could be different here than let's say even Wyoming\nWhile they are in there are a lot different and the interesting thing is I've worked for the department for several years now but um I still carry a copy of the ... because\nThere's just there's so many over the years we've made so many adjustments trying to make everybody happy at the regulations\nOf the cascade Idaho cattle rancher Phil Davis has lost dozens and dozens of his own cows to wolf deprivation over the past few decades and he has advised fellow\nRanchers eleven wolf country too carefully examine any dead cow that they find for science that it was taken by a well a science are not always clearly evident when Davis finds a dead cow he skins at to see if there are any telltale bite marks and trauma that could be associated with a wolf attack\nWere losing too much live starts in itself I knew more and more every year because necessarily there's more ... just because more\nAre learning when they find a dead animal\nWildlife services can look in determining for was killed by a wall and more and more people are recognizing that\nItself and because you go to the evidence\nAnd as the losses continue to mount and more ways than just dead cows activists Davis has new ideas that he wants to have better about an executive order from the president allowing on obstructed control methods year round\nOn public lands what about a state legislative mandate allowing year round legal control furthermore designate the wolf as a special predator rather than a game animals all three would allow more options in control\nThe management is mandated now isn't working\nFrom a rancher who for twenty two years as lived amongst the wolves pretty good ideas\nPromoters and prop on our back at it lying to hide out they say money will go to school but if prop ... passes prop one promoters take Eighteen times more money than schools get Eighteen times even worse according\nTo the state auditor the last time gambling machines or legal money meant for schools were taken away a misspent illegally promoters of prop one are so desperate that they Dr news footage and they're teeny add to deceive Idaho voters listen to this from Kate DVD\nSave Idaho horse racing edited the audio from our new gas were there at the chain would arm our job since then I had not only edited out the word in there um and in doing so they changed the meaning of dissent and\nNow the people behind prop one are promising to donate profits to charity but there is no accountability and no guarantee they will actually donate money they lied to us before they're lying again get the vaccine yourself and I do not it against Trump on dot com vote no on\n... on a four by Idaho United against prop one\nDavis ... permission network of the west\nMagic valley whether Roger

or comment for customers ... fishing game you can give us a call at the two zero eight seven three six zero three hundred that's two zero eight seven three six zero three hundred four seven twenty two it's forty three on magic valley the smartest hunters radio thirteenth\nAnd if I'm going through puberty all over again I say let you go [laughter] I'll break out and yeah you can you\nBelieve this whether it's ridiculous Seventy degrees isn't that forecast I just turned ... and it's like wow\nIt's just a little warm for fructose it's nice I mean the farmers are getting their harvest in and and uh and things I'm I'm guessing the beat diggers you like it a little colder though but um you know it's just crazy to me to see Seventy degrees is late in October\nBetter next week a for a for typical whether people like it a little cooler because ah maybe only ... in the middle of the week next week in the middle forties we'll get to a telephone call the first thing we can get back to the hunter report card if you like it sounds good\nOh let's go to the phones and called her Europe next year on the air on kale I exit seven twenty three and a Wisconsin ... bill ... go ahead\n[noise] ... go ahead you're good morning at a at a question for a skeleton when you're in a year that's a good can you hear me yeah you're on the color guard\nColor we hear you yeah you know forty one where you can use electronic calls for mount alliance\nIf you're if you're in another year\nThat non electric calls and your ... your guy out and you call it a mountain lion and we take that animal\n... by the letter of the law no I'm ... and we we have instances like that um\nI Know it's hard especially if you're out the ... I mean I'm sure your whole tone dogs and coyotes and so in a cat comes in I mean it it's tough not to do but legally ... if you're if you know you could your body can turn you in and get a reward for through kept\n[laughter] for because it would be an illegal take up an animal okay thank you bet thank you\nWant to thank him for the call a that's a great call\nIt's really difficult I mean we we love you you know you folks get out and they get colon predators and and you get a non target a animal coming in that you have a tag for\nI mean it is it's an ethical dilemma because you're out in the middle of nowhere and so basically uh you know your ethics or what guide you at that point you know your ethics or what you do when nobody else is watching and so\nUm that's the way it was hunting in general or fishing in general there's lots of rules out there are rules are out there to protect the overall population not individual animal but overall population as a population base\nAnd if we get too much poaching Henri legal take of animals that does start having an impact on the overall population and so that's why we have these different rules and so that's why hunting is kind of a different type of deal you just have to ... you have to live by the ethics that you you hunt with\nAnd you were mentioning on a report card and telephone number affiliated with that\nYour bed and the center report card autumn outlined you've got ten days I'll just jump back to that on you got a ten day check in period\nUm but our beer or any of those but for the center report card I Wish we could put a mandated ten day hunt after your ... you had to have it in but we don't the reason we use is how to report card\nIs we're getting ready to redo regulations is next year we're on a two year cycle so regulations so this information is critical to us\nBecause we want to know if you're harvested how many days you hunted the unit you hunted in um how many different weapon types\nBecause all of that goes into play on us establishing next year season what our harvest was water population number was from our or aerial surveys and flights\nWhat hunter successes so that we know what to do and how to manipulate tag or tags especially for it\nSurveys and flights what hunter successes so that we know what to do and how to manipulate tag a tags especially for elk\nUm in our southern units um if we need to increase the harvest on them\nUm or if we need to decrease or if we need to increase the dos and still get that hunter report card in as soon as possible you're supposed to go on line just like you did when you're logged in um earlier this year to check to see if you drove controlled hunt you go to that same log in\nMany cook on the hunter hunter report card area and there and you can go in and you can fill it out on the line or you can call one eight hundred and get a pan out it's five five for eight six eight five five five for eight six eight five and that's a one eight hundred number\nAnd you can call and give your how to report their and so but please get those in some of the seasons are closed if you've harvested and you're not going to or if you haven't harbor started going to go back out get that done in the early and we get that data the better we can analyze it\nDoesn't do love the taste of a bird and you wanted to mention the pheasants hot as\nWell oh you bet you know present season opened last week we're looking like were\nYou know no we're not\nBack to what it was in the sixties and seventies I'm never probably will be just because of of the change in the environment around here however we did see good numbers of pheasants this year on our\nOur a road routes um if you don't have a chance to go out and hunt wild pheasants and you're just wanting to get out and do some we do stock\nThe Hagerman wildlife management area it's twenty three Seventy five if you're in price lock if he had purchased your license if you're um it at twenty three Seventy five and that gives you a permit for six birds\nUm at the Hagerman WMA we Stockbridge down there twice a week and go down and have some fun down there you can get a few more a little more information if you're in that original office\nIf you didn't get into pies price like it's like twenty eight dollars which is still really reasonable uh for the W I may have to wear hunters orange the hunt starts at around ten I think is what it is down there you may want to check that\nIt's nine or ten I think it's actually ten of starch down there\nAnd uh just have to be cautious because there's a couple of other people that go down there\nAnd we're going to take a break in about a minute or but again for people who are maybe jump back to that hundred report card or just to give the number one more time 'cause I'm going to benefit or like me some of these people needed a good couple of minutes to find a better handle\nYou know you don't just always have one in your shirt pocket [laughter] no it's white hundred\nFive five for eight six eight five and it's also\nIn your big game proclamation so if you go and find the hunter report card or you can go to fish and game dot Idaho dot Gov\nOnline and uh\nFind out how to report card number off on their also\nWe've got to take a short break we got another half hour coming up with cats and hatch from Idaho fish and game or at forty two and a the news is on the way from ... to buy a local update they'll probably would too as well on a mattress value this morning until ... am on a news radio Thirteen ten ... news radio Thirteen ten dot com\nA look at at the map looked at the roads and things like that and we can see if we can do something that way or you can go to a uh the local sheriff's department because they can also with us new trespassing law and some of the things they do a lot with a private land access and things like that and so\nThat would be another avenue and so\nI Wish there was just the way we could wave a magic wand and it not happen but it happens all across the Idaho and other states\n[noise] is there a way that we can somehow petition the LA him to quit selling the land of you know Jason ... foot hills those kinds of things um if so what what we have to do ... what do we we got to do\nKnow typically what they're going to do things are going to have a public hearing on any ground before they go in and you know had there till Nelson cheese or the public relations officer over there at the ... office\nShe would be a good contact I Know my Courtney as the the manager over there in any of those those people are very good at their jobs and if you got a hold of them they could probably give their what they need exactly but I didn't know they usually have a public hearing for any of that happens\nI don't know of a lot of land or if any that I Know of recently that has been sold or I Do know they've done a few they'd done a few exchanges in the past\nWhere ah things work out but they usually have that opened up public public a comment also but um I Would give them a call the ... the bill andme office and they could probably help you more of that but no I appreciate your concern I appreciate your ear drive\nA lot of these things like that because there's so many issues that we're facing really need to be publicly driven and were there to help with what we\nThings like that because there's so many issues that we're facing really need to be publicly driven and were there to help with what we can we get our officers involved but when you find a piece of ground like that that is blocked off and especially if it's got a public road or if it's got a a ... access\nHas been closed down has historically been opened we can help more with those one of them for the call you've done a great call and it it it's an issue that we face for\nFace for years I've actually uh have seen chunks of dirt or that or be a limb that have been blocked off by other hunters not the landowner the landowner he may never make it to the fans flying but you know Joe blows up here and goes oh I bet if I put a no trespassing sign right here um\nI can climb over the fence because why and honored in there and I'm not going to get in trouble but I can go ... have all this to myself and they're blocking off and we had some people over in eastern Idaho when I was over there that\nWould actually park in front of public land gates so that nobody could walk in I mean they're ... they're pickup shot you know because people will be trying to get up there in the morning but there's a lot of things and it is sad\nThat people get to that point that they they're taking rights away from other people for their own selfish selfishness but um we see it all the time\nYou wanted to mention of maturation because there's been some more of a change their rights well\nWe did we actually are received a the ... were were running the national hatchery now down at I'm Down in the Hagerman rally youthful setting it is it's a it's a gorgeous setting it's still had setting a\nThe U.S fish and Wildlife Service dated that over to us is going to give us more control over over the fish will still receive some funding from them to be able to manage the facility but we're pretty excited about it um so if you get a chance and you want to go down there and you're the Hagerman state hatchery\nUm stop in there's a a little uh viewing area there that you can see what's going on still had production one thing I Do want to warn folks is it is illegal on any fishing game or federal fishing game hatchery\nOr private for that matter to wander around race ways um we've had some real issues this last year especially the state has to get a lot of diseases issues and so there's a reason there was a fence around the race ways\nUm but last week was down there and there is a well almost every week we have a group that just let themselves in and gets wandering down there we actually had\nA some people that were fishing in the Tel way\nAnd um which is also illegal um and so you know just because it's a state hatchery doesn't mean it's just free range um in in your part owner in it um and because we're really have a lot of bio controls down there trying to protect the health of those fish\nAnd so but you're more than ... more than welcome to go look at him but you can't walk through the actual facility without somebody else there with ya you can get guided tours we have a lot do a lot of guided tours in a lot of rafters\nGot a break coming up we've got more
