major news organizations like the New York times and the Boston Globe they do and but it's bad news\nA lot of major news organizations like the New York times and the Boston Globe they do by the bad news is that a Glenn Beck dot com uses Google Google Analytics and so\nWhat that means that everyone who has ever visited your website is tracked every single thing they do on your website is tracked by Google\nSo here's a here's the problem is a business owner Google Analytics or the best\nNow do you how do you how do you do business without Google at times that's that's always the thing that gets you in the yeah\nFor sure but you know you know this is this convenience thing over and over and and their products are so good so but you don't realize that these aren't real products they're just surveillance platforms that's the only reason they run them every single service they provide as just another surveillance platform [noise]\nUh I Do have a little bit more good news though which is a film that you mentioned the creepy lie as a when ... when you had a my ... one of my new very good friends Peter ... your show recently of is a uh he's the one who would who really got that film running\nA it surely wasn't available but now as of right now it is available both on Amazon and iTunes for for rental or sale and it it and it really is a fabulous film\nAnd builds Google it just goes to the freebie lie dot com when you came out about some of this stuff and again you were a Hillary supporter when you came out about this ... were you you were blocked by Google for a time where you not\n[noise] well when I when my research a first hit the news in the Washington Post\nA you know I found that starting the next day I couldn't access any Google products I couldn't even access to Google dot com so [laughter]\nI have these amazing screen shots that like they're just shocking to people because you can't even imagine not being able to access Google yeah I've screen shots showing getting these time out saying no you know you can't get their sorry\nIt's amazing okay let's go through some of the\nUh some of the uh affects that you are monitoring we have about about a minute here so why don't you just take one of them on you say there was the last seven ten or ten of these that you're following can altogether okay out and all the other okay so let's take on one real quick\nBegin very good when Harry go this is called bath as the er the search suggestion effect when you start to type a search term into the Google Search bar\nYou are being manipulated from the very first character that you type so if you type a depending\nOn your history and other things chances are you'll get Amazon right away they'll start slashing suggestions at you and Amazon and it turns out is Google's biggest advertiser paying them three hundred million dollars a year and Google sends\nMore traffic to Amazon than any other single source but beyond that we've learned through our experiments\nThat Google can use search suggestions that their flashing asked you to turn a fifty fifty vote among a fifty fifty split among undecided voters into in Ninety ten split will my one having any idea they're being manipulated\n[noise] oh yeah so they can they in fact they know who's unstable they know who's undecided they know who is Republican and who is gay and you name it they know far more about it I mean ...\nI mean unstable mentally\nYeah yeah yeah oh no you're you're absolutely right they have it literally unprecedented power or two is shifts to people's yes shift to unstable people's shifts anybody\nUh and and they know they have this power\nUh one of the leaks from Google was a a a ... a little internal film their eight minute film called the selfish ledger you want to get cranked out [laughter] botched that film that's an internal film there were there they're talking about their power to reshape human kind\nOf seen it it's terrifying so before we because we're going to run out of time what do we do\n[noise] ah well there's there's things that we can do at the individual level especially for parents I which I Am an\nA and there are things that has to be done at a at a much higher level of governmental organizational so the individual level you know we can take some steps to protect our privacy and privacy of our kids so I have an\nArticle very easy to find on line that's called seven simple steps toward online privacy um\nI have an article very easy to find on line that's called seven simple steps toward online privacy um you know I can give your ... your staff a link to it\nYeah we'll send it out in our new letter is not ... uh seven ... [laughter] that's okay we'll send that I'll sign up for our newsletter if you don't have it not direct by Google um but ah we'll ... we'll send that out and also make it available Glenn Beck are come um\nYeah so there are some things you can do and one of them one of the many things I found them at West says you shouldn't be using Google Analytics which Glenn Beck dot com is using [laughter] so that the individual level now as the as the organizational governmental level there's other things uh you know so\nHey you shouldn't even be using a Google Chrome browser um eight but even if you go to is it in Microsoft browser that it's powered\nBy Google or information\nI mean there's no\nNo no matter what no matter yes I Do know which I have no matter where you go Google is there a Google Now pays apple\nComputers nine billion dollars a year to be the default search engine when people are using safari\nWhich is which is apple browser Google is paying apple nine billion dollars next year they're supposed to pay them twelve billion to be the default search engine on safari this for any any apple device at all so Google is everywhere\nWhere do you think Syria gets its answers from\nIt gets his answers from the old theory is is you know Apple's personal assistance so I mean I could go on and on and on but Cathy\nAsked the institutional level there are things that he has to be done\nUh one of them which I'm helping to work on with people now and we need money so you know if you if you guys have money out there you know step up a but we we are building monitoring system as it says you know basically it's a little ... with people's permission to look over people's shoulders and see what\nThese companies are actually showing how they're manipulating people\nIf I Would love to I'd love to be a part of that or how can people donate to that\n[noise] well they can go to my Google research dot com my Google research dot com that's a very simple way to donate that supports the research shows that I Do but also a that's helping to\nProvide funds to build monitoring systems which which must exist they don't exist I did build one and two thousand sixteen but we need large scale permanent monitoring systems to keep all these these creepy arrogant people under control\nSo [noise] I Am very I'm concerned I'm about a GI and a a sigh I'm and I'm I'm concerned that in two ways\nOh I feel as though we need some sort of a Manhattan Project to make sure America is the one that gets at first\nBut on the other hand I don't know who I trust to have it I mean you cannot put the genie back in the bottle but when when we had a GI we are in real trouble are we not\n[noise] ah ... you have no idea [laughter] if if if no seriously if you if you knew the stuff that I knew and you were looking every day at the numbers I look at you wouldn't even get out of bed\nOkay All right well I'm going to go back to bed no I've I mean I've I've I've read a lot\nWhat do you what what what should we be what should we be as in I mean I mean Congress has just useless our government is just they're not paying attention to this at all and it's moving so rapidly by the time they would enact something it will be too late\nThat is correct so regulation in law is not going to help us too much because I just moved too slowly and and ... it was extremely fast [noise]\nSo uh you know that doesn't mean we shouldn't you know contacts are are are are are kind of a congressional representatives correct should just try to keep the pressure on\nUh I've I've been a speaker uh at at meetings of the attorneys general the state attorneys general in there and those guys those guys and those women can move they can move fast they as you're saying so [noise] you know\nA lot beyond that you know you you've got to start at the individual level I mean if you're using Gmail right now that's insane if you're using chrome that's insane if you're using an Android phone that's that's all Google\nThe ear nuts you're crazy to use product because those are all just surveillance platform that's all they are that they're they're they're just ... feet up surveillance platforms they're just they're just excuses Google has come up with\nA for us to just tell them every thing about ourselves you know how much information Google has about you\nKnow\nThey have 'em just based on your age which is I Know roughly a they have the equivalent of about three million word pages of information about you\nOh [noise]\nSo I mean\nI I guess I mean I guess I made a point to where you don't get up out of bed like you I mean I ... ... so it's overwhelming so what does that mean what I mean how do we there's no way to get it back are you familiar with solid let me go here you familiar with solid and interrupt\nYes\nHe is there any chance that that is going to play a role in the future is that a\nA ...\nI it's hard to tell him I'm going to have to say probably not because uh it's it's very very hard uh you know Google and Facebook meticulous are\nAre are so powerful and so imbedded\nThat you just ... you can't really cut into them people people don't want to leave them people are ... you know they they love them and so it's hard you know I Know lots of people working on alternative kinds of you know ... services and\nA and a lot of people are talking about block chain and so on but I mean the reality is you know we're talking about Ninety percent of search around the world is done on Google\nUh these two companies are serving right now more than two point five billion people that will be passed four billion within the next three years they're just growing and growing and\nGrowing and found so it's concerning what they're doing in China I mean I mean I don't know how I don't know how they sleep at night\n[noise] [noise] well that's outrageous that is ... because they're actually they're actually partnering with the Chinese government to participate\nAnd the Chinese government's a aggressive a program to control all of its citizens and Google is ... and that I mean literally making it easier and better making that kind of the easier and better that's and that's

U. L. I. X. [noise]\n\nThese now published studies are just tremendous I mean I don't know how if you guys had beers before you came up with this or how you guys came up with these ah but they're fantastic oh let's go through some of them one by one let's start with the first one dog park\nThe ah the thesis is dog parks are really rape condoning spaces tell me ... tell me about it\nWas kind of funny actually um I tell ya story um when I went to we we all got together to to have this ... public as best we could so I went to Portland we all went to Portland, Oregon too I'm\nReady for this project to come out publicly went to the dog park on the first day I got there I'm not sure I got off the plane I took over next thing you know I'm walking\nCaters to the dog park with a filmmaker and uh we get so dog park and there's this just dogs they're living out the pay for it was crazy this dog was fighting the other dogs ending them down housing them left right and center the the\nSoon as the ball thrower at the dog gently I'll point out he wasn't being abusive and then he says stop hunting\nAnd then we get to as a lean over to the filmmaker and kind of monitor I guess a little too loudly and maybe we should start interrogating people about their sexuality given the money is going down here and then this lady yells out to me oh no no it's okay she's the girl dog and I was like oh man it's papers happening for real [laughter]\nSo what is what is the thesis\nSo the thesis for all the original idea behind a thesis was that we should write a feminist paper arguing that we should train and the way that we train dogs to prevent rape culture and\nSo I thought that they thought it was pretty funny when I was brainstorming ideas for papers truer to Peter Peter takes his dog the dog park every day I'm most it said let's work and some of the stuff from the dog park and as we started working and just\nYou know absolutely absurd ideas from what might be considered the most ridiculous dog park in the world\nOr the paper grew into that and so we made it about so called queer performed a pivotal in human reactions to the park\nAnd then ended up concluding things like the ... we we should be able to leash man likely least dogs to fix to prevent rape except it's not politically feasible\nAnd uh gosh it would be great if we could could push shot colors on men but that's not okay either so we have to shock them out of you know hitting on women by screaming at them to scare them\nAnd it gets them to desist from their behavior the thesis of the paper was though that\nThat humans reacted differently to gay dog hunting as opposed to stray dog hunting\nAnd men were far worse about this than women and then we concluded that this is indicative of race culture and we called the dog park rape condoning space when we leave and go to nightclubs we said rate nightclubs are also right condoning spaces was no evidence for that whatsoever\nWe [laughter] um\nSo that was pretty out there um that one was was really out there I think it's I don't know maybe the one about the the feminist spiritual spirituality meetings and poetry is a little more out there but it's probably close to the most\nWell LOU LOU finished the dog park this one was accepted and reviewed uh some of the reviews is a wonderful paper incredibly innovative rich and analysis extremely well written in organized a\nYadda yadda I Believe this ah intellectually and imperial ... exciting paper must be published and congratulate the author on the research done and in the\nWriter and in the right yeah yeah\nThat was one of the most disturbing parts of this I feel like because again it wasn't like these ... these journals looked at this and didn't really go through it and kind of just ... it made its way through the process there are very specific comments from dozens of reviewers who ... who are doing the review insane specific things that you wrote\nThat are completely ridiculous are amazing new accomplishments in the field I mean that had to be wild funny and improved your point had to be really disturbing as well\nOh yeah that is by far what we consider to be the most important evidence that we gathered\nIn the process of of this project without papers got published or that they got awards in some cases they're one case\nAnd all of this is fine and it says a lot and it's disturbing but the reviewers comments show that they use ... which really worked out between two and four or five or paper so we ended up with something like\nA set of comments they they really did engage with what we did they really looked at it they said our analysis was good ones are analysis was terrible he didn't raise an eyebrow about the data we gather the idea that um you know the dog park paper contains\nA bit of completely irrelevant evidence about where dogs go to the bathroom and unauthorized\nWays as we did it and it's completely irrelevant to the paper but nobody raise an eyebrow about how ridiculous that is um they were concerned however that we can indicate that we're human about dogs so that we can be sure that we don't claim that when a dog\nThere was a ... ... thing of another dog whether or not the dog they go home to want it or not because how could we know that as\nBeing [noise] ... [noise] and they were really concerned as I Hope everybody's seen in our little\nVideo we've put out to announce the project they're really concerned with the fact that we respect the dog's privacy and the process of inspecting their genitals and\n[noise] and going out so well what specifically were they concerned about I mean the ... but what I mean\nYou got me man\n[laughter] and then it was done in the privacy of a of a veterinary office [laughter] okay um let's see you did fat body building which quickly is wide\nBut the idea that what needs to be added to the professional sport a body building is a category in which fat is displayed politically so that fat as just considered another to issue a equal with muscle and to say that that's not true is\nTo be mean to fat people fat phobic as they call it\n... and that was accepted\nYeah that was accepted that was a pretty pretty exciting acceptance um especially because uh we actually had a real scholar who let us use his identity ... who wrote that who we claimed wrote that paper and he actually has a professional body builder\nOr Mr northern hemisphere in Nineteen Seventy eight or something I mean this guy's Seventy years old and just stack and the picture in my mind of this guy being the author of this paper for fat body building was just kind of hilarious\n[laughter] me [laughter] but that's another thing to do a lot of these papers you had a completely fake organizations you had completely fake scholars coming from colleges that I think didn't exist in some cases I mean some of this would have been easily just provide basic checking when it when it wouldn't have had\nI think so I mean it was kind of a this is a tricky point and I don't want to get too far into the into the weeds here but honestly scholarship should stand or fall on its merit not on who did it and so a lot of people are are making that point and we deliberately chosen names that would be hard to find in a Google Search in specific\nWhich was very common names on purpose I actually used a a a I roll dice to pick up for off of a list of\nSo the only thing is is a really complicated I'm there would be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at the University of Pennsylvania\nWho was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom and got in trouble for it a late last year\nSo they decided it didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting in classrooms and so there would have been some some uh educators primarily working in\nSocial justice side or the fields topics courses I guess that's the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general ed stuff\nWho would take up some degree of the suggestions as you know experimental but but what was your intimate to use in the classroom and this was being submitted to the gold standard journalist wasn't some fringe of journal and education this was the gold standard feminists philosophy journal Asia that we were working with here\nWhich is where a lot of the literature that like this already exist\nWhich you don't mind me going on a little bit this is kind of what's happening I'm we think that what's happening here is kind of in the equivalent with ideas of money laundering called idea laundry\nOh so they take they take these these bad ideas some of which are just opinion some of them are prejudice some of them are genuinely terrifying like this vegetation will thing and then they\nThem through the academic process and they come out with the stamp of academic approval that makes them look like they're real knowledge so you'll hear people say oh well there was a study or we've base this program on studies that show\nWell that's fine when the studies or could but when the studies are coming from a place they can't tell a truth from from prejudiced in opinion it becomes a real problem [noise]\nAnd um disturbing or was the uh H. O. H. two ...\nTwo was was accepted can you explain the explain this one\nYou know for was accepted by a show at the center and I was just mentioning that\nPatriot stood for hoax on hoaxes so it was a hoax paper we wrote that was about writing academic hoaxes that code namely gave for convenience\nOr they argue is that you can only properly criticize\nThings that go against social justice and in particular you can only use humor to make fun of or or do satire to deflate\nThat which goes against social justice if you use humor against social justice if you criticize postal jobs that what that means as you never really properly engaged with it therefore we don't have to consider your criticism and that's one of the huge problems going on and this is a set of of\nFields because that they don't accept criticism if you tried to criticize them they say that it's a privilege preserving epidemic pushback that a scholar named Allison bally hoos huge in the education of literature\nThey say it's white fragility that's Robin to Angelo who has just had a big book published on that is here to introduce the concept in twenty eleven\nWhich says that if I'm somebody with privilege is in particular white people for her work uh is challenged so that their privileges point and question that they are fragile and don't know how to deal with it because of privilege and made them weak they don't know how to psychologically deal with having that challenge and they act\nOut in anger or grief or something like that and trying to maintain their privilege and so\nThese ideas are already getting out there who just took him to step further\nAnd didn't do it is interesting guy because the one about hopes as it is interesting in that if you have to criticize what you guys did they would almost half just cite your paper as\nThat was the idea yeah and it was definitely to put them in that position and I've asked a trip to stand by the paper that they accepted and publish or right names they haven't responded yet but we'll see what they do\nI'm that way indeed people who want to criticize our project from a position of introspection or feminism will need to fight off in order to criticize us\n[laughter] I can we get one more to go on and on the Utah is on the scary front at the feminist mind Tom\nAre you also did the white man my income for you to to one of his was accepted in the white man was in\nPrice correct correct tell me about them\nSo I'll do though the white one first because it didn't get in it was much more frightening it was written in from the position of an auto West Nile graffiti where the researcher is reflecting on in the states her own experience as a white lesbian women coming to hate her own white mass\nAnd they was rejected partly because the scholarship wasn't quite er which is a case in all of the papers but also because the position is the author as a good white rather than\nBeing sufficiently supplement or whatever to critical race on your age\nI'm so there was in there was an explosively political reasoning behind why it was was rejected and it was that the\nThe author as a white woman was trying to make herself look good by criticizing her own White House and was was one of the main reason the feminist one was\nWell hold on just a second hold on just saying then that took mind the parts of my income where he was talking about Jews and replace the words Jews with a with whites\nIn that case it was either whites are white and this and then we edited the tax around it and added a whole a whole bunch of literature and reward if things get passed plagiarism checks and things like that\nIt started with scanning through my income picking out\nPassages about the Jews and replacing Jews with whites are white ness\nShifts and editing around it uh this having just one didn't do it quite the same way as soon as one was not about it didn't take the Jews out and replace it with with men for example there actually is the chapter in my income where Hitler explains the need for the Nazi Party\nIs trapped are twelve and what its members would be expected to a halt to and including especially the sacrifices that after make could be Nazis\nAnd we were placed our movement the party et cetera he doesn't mention Nazis specifically in that chapter or we replace that with intersection of feminism nor solidarity or ally ... something to do with with the feminist movement\nAnd criticize the idea that uh some feminist to do what they called choice feminism which is the idea that if a woman is living her own life the way she wants to end considers that to be a statement of feminism\nThan she is doing feminism that feminist for women to have you know full agency and make their own choices in the world that's what this paper was criticizing saying that no no the responsibility if they really want to consider themselves feminists is to be\nTo make sacrifices him stand in solidarity with other oppressed people particularly of you know women of color or women of color marginalized status is\nJames [noise] couple of quick questions um they\nDid this had to be one of those things that you entered into and hoped that you were wrong and when they were accepted you had to celebrate and then short time later going\nGood God this is bad am I right\nThat's exactly that is exactly right so especially with the ... paper I think the one that got accepted um the idea there was that we were trying to it's very different from mine cough of course do I mean as you get a one to one thing uh but the ... the politics of grievance\nCome through I really am glad I get to talk to you about that I can because all it takes the grievances everywhere and it's certainly being used in the academic left as we were trying to demonstrate we called this stuff grievance studies\nWhere we see it everywhere right and I think this is why we're so divided a politically right now I was really happy to talk to you because I mean and we don't want to get you in touch with you but you're a real dude and that's why I wanted to talk to you thanks you know you had this all May of ... about\nHow things were going for you under Obama's time and I thought that was huge and I was like you know this guy Glenn Beck is is is a bridge he's looking for reconciliation it's on your on your Twitter bio we need to be talking to each other again\nSo our project was you know or people on the left for left liberal so I'm not ashamed to say that I Know when you consider yourself a classical liberal and your conservative on the right that's great I'm we're on the left me to take responsibility for our own lunatics and so our project was kind of that\nYou know we're left wing people who want a left to come back from the from the edge and we hope that you know the same things happening on the right and we can all star I think you know people in general I get a lot of sense of the people send me emails about this now all the time especially\nUm all kinds of sick of all this nonsense all the fighting all the polarization and we can't get anything done I think we want to get back to productive politics and as long as we're relying heavily on this grievance stuff which clearly the academic left is I think we see a lot of it coming out of the right wing media sphere as well from my perspective\nI think as long as we're focusing on that we can't have productive conversations we can't ... remember you know you are an American I'm an American you're a person I'm a person\nHave ... most of my bed\nAnd even though we have to probably pretty serious political differences but I think we also have in common that we want to have better conversations we want to move society in a direction that benefits us all and it's just a matter of working out the details and I really hope that you know that our project kinda reaches reaches that point does that make sense", "year":
