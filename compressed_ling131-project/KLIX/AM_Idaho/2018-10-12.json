thing for me I Am voting a straight Republican ticket\nI don't care that some of those people may not be in my view is Republican as I Am but after a while I witnessed happened\nDuring the hearings for judge Kavanaugh before he became justice Cavanaugh I made a decision in my mind and that decision was I'm going to be voting a straight Republican ticket it's my message to the angry left in this country\nRoam the streets promising that it's going to do violence to the rest of us to show us give us a lot for so that will come on board with their their opinions I guess if they feel they have to even kill us they'll go ahead and do that\nI I again I I I I look at some of these things and I got to be honest with you as am just so gotten off what I Would call the deep that they are so absolutely\nLost that I don't know that they can ever recover their sanity but I really don't think they're going to be all that dangerous I discuss some of these reasons one of the year yesterday

have a problem with early voting because the thing is is I mean someone passes away in their time or if it's really important to somebody actually vote they're going to take the time to get out there on the day of I mean unless there's a storm or something like that but\nI Do feel that we need to reform the early voting\nI don't think it should be a thing I think they only do on the day of I I think we can arrange things to make it so those that can't get out and get out and do it before we can do it but I think that it actually true the vote if we got rid of this right in voting and a early voting\nThank you actually call I have had to do I write in votes in the past\nBecause some election days I was I was working and media many many years ago and I lived in London county but

half of one percent that means promoters prop one get Eighteen times as much money and they promised Idaho schools for every dollar gamble\nSchools get hassled penny and Idaho is seen this before a

issue an invitation to a cat a candidate running for office I'm here in uh that well call it the area the main part of her her\nDistrict unfortunately sets in Blaine county and she went to a debate there the other day and when she came out all over science had been stolen so are the liberals of course are\nAdding savory too a lot of their bad behavior lately not just punting on doors and smashing things are trying to beat up people are there now are involved in the outright theft\nCouple of things to note about this I I've been talking the last couple of days on air all of these people keep saying oh we're on the cusp of a civil war civil war is over war I was at an event a couple of years ago and the former\nChairman of Idaho's Republican Party ...\nWhereas the guest speaker and he was explaining that when he was a little ball you came from a really big family but when he was a little boy he said he had a lot of older cousins and he said ... the family was split some of those cousins were involved in Vietnam War demonstrations you head\nCities burning at the time you had on on campus you out of ROTC buildings being bombed us labs on campus being bombed US government\nBuildings being bombed\nWe're not at that stage and I really don't\nThink that today snowflakes are good to go out in the street and get involved with that federal told me yesterday he used to be a a newspaper reporter in Montana a shared this story\nThat he had to go cover a pipeline dispute and he got\nThere and all the demonstrators were were you know hey hey ho ho pipeline has to go and they start to interview some of them in the first guy I talked to said well I don't really think about it I was paid to come out here\nWell I don't know that it's going to be enough money out there to pay them to create a revolution of any sorts I I just I don't see that happening\nI think that that that they're sort of just the you know [laughter] wishful thinking on their part\nIt rains a lot of these snowflakes aren't going to come out of mom and dad's basement it's just not going to happen I mean they're all sitting around saying they want someone to pay for everything they're not necessarily willing they don't have the ambition to go out and tackle these issues themselves\nI just a couple of things I wanted to know President Trump was asked on Fox and friends Eric Holder the former attorney general of the United states Eric Holder worked under President abruptly saying Obama holder was saying the other day\nIt oh and Michelle Obama said when uh they go low we go high or whatever\nIt was he said not all all when they go a long way kept on [laughter] [noise] yeah there is a tough guy he's right up there with Chuck Todd and Chris Hayes\nPresident was appearing on Fox and friends and the president was asked about this and the president said you know I think that Eric Holder should choose his words more carefully\nSomebody who is Ali is not going to vote for you is Eric Holder the former attorney general the United states [noise]\nTea or not crazy about your agenda and then he said this just a day or so ago wasn't as Mr President needed time for us and Democrats to be as tough as they are maybe an dedicated as they are to be uncommitted in say someone says that you know when they go low we\nMay go low we can't [noise]\nIt was his Democratic ...\nWhat this new Democratic Party is about he said Mr President an accurate that will come up\nThe whole room started clapping and cheering what does that say to you about the tenor of politics right now\nHe'd better be careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's going to discuss things safe and for them to make\nA it's a disgusting statement for him debate one of the President's Day just the other day you don't hand\nBatches during our students I think he's bought on with what he's saying so the left is now on happy Jerry I can go to the president's remarks Chuck Todd over at MS DNC he decided to chime in and it's a less argument as well you you started it\nAll we can all agree the current political environment\nIsn't toxic and at times dangerous\nParty under President Trump arguably created this current environment\nOr Shasta by incidentally lob style display and even a violent criminal knock the\nPay for the legal field you know what they used to do the guys like that when\nA place like this can be carried\nA punch him in the face I'll tell you [noise]\nIf they ever do whatever you have to do to him I don't care and you know what I think I'm totally within my rights to say that it is from the hell out\nOld days out of that seat so fast the legendary folk a hundred and get that son of a job appealed right\nEnemy so this is this has got the lesson and well wait a minute you know he started it so therefore it's again I go back to the old adage mom and dad told me when I was a boy\nAnd what I had a lot of friends in the neighborhood and I would say well you know Jimmy or mark or Joe you're going to be doing this and you know my parents would be sitting there solemn scholars on their faces at the dinner table that's how they work solemn scholars\nAnd they would sit there and they would look at me and it was almost like a a race to see which one could say to me first yeah well it Jimmy went and jumped off the bridge would you have to jump off the bridge to\nTo go in the street and play the role of law enforcement it's not\nThat's why we pay the guys with the badgers and guns\nThe ride it goes on to say is is he says the\nTruth is and always has been that the resistance marching in the streets led by armed and trained editor for gangs in America streets or the menu ends of the left and by extension the Democrats [noise] it's just that phrase mostly peaceful let you hear what you said they're always reports on network news about this\nLaw that ... know Lafayette Park in Washington today home mostly peaceful demonstration\nOr what does that mean he [laughter] he says\nTells you everything you need to know about the media's duplicitous approach to the violence we've had to endure since the election I mostly peaceful protest he says as my talk radio colleague Chris plant points out is by definition of violent protest\nMostly peaceful yeah they they they ignore the folks on the French who are causing people over their heads you have to go is the Internet and find some alternative source\nTo pick up the details on all of that having attended some of the largest Tea Party rallies in the country I used to see the photographers the liberal photographers walking around with the cameras on their shoulders trying to go ... literally trying to go to various people at the Tea Party\nRally in the misbehaving they were ... or they would try to put words in your mouth they would ask loaded questions\nSo they can hope they could get a response and take that out of context and then embarrass people we were in the march one year and we just come down Pennsylvania Avenue and we eventually got to the capital and we were just rounding around through this is that the the big reflecting pool out there and we were running around the corner and we're headed for the Capitol\nLawn and all of these guys who is asking people some questions that way and I suddenly confronted him and all and there are a big guy but all of a sudden he just kind of like kind of shape is look on his face took his camera off his shoulder and ran\nOff and everybody else who in the immediate area had witnessed all of this started clapping and cheering for what I had done because they know what these people are up to and what these people are trying to do but they think they're the smartest\nIt's a trade and I just sort of the other day one of these reporters screaming on one of these alternative networks I said I'll turn to that because I don't watch them CNN or honesty and see about how awful the Tea Party had been so what's the big deal about all of these pay demonstrators that George Soros kind being in the streets now\nBut where do you find evidence of Tea Party violence\nYou don't I mean heck if you have more than a million people in any particular area to take a big city\nYou're going to have some average behavior during the course of a day you have ten thousand people you're going to have average behavior but you know I was that these Tea Party rallies to just once the two big ones and I was at the Beck rally where they had more than half a million people\nIn twenty ten and and and no one got beat up nobody got raped nobody crackdown on a police car none of these things happened so the media is peddling a myth and outright lie and you gotta ask\nYourself is a managing editor I worked for many many years ago he was told by the name of Dave white really nice guy but man you didn't want to put anything past them there was also a rock rib Republican now it didn't it did not let it bleed into his work\nHe was tough on everybody when it came to the way he did the job but a letter or get him one time uh we were talking about a competitor and a competitor done a story and we are a little uncomfortable with the way it had been done and they looked at me and he said there's a lesson in this for you he said if they're lying about that\nThen it raises the question what else are they lying about so in media told you all of those stories about the Tea Party movement almost a decade ago and now they're repeating them because they think you've got the first round of lies and I think you might say their goal I guess there was violence back\nThen they're lying and again it goes back to his question if they're lying to you about that then what else would they be lying to you about\nBecause it has to at least raise that suspicion and your mind or coming up on six forty four or thirty eight to ... news radio Thirteen tend kale I accidents radio Thirteen tend to have caught a little later in this program that share a story\nWith you the biggest newspaper in the state of Idaho did a story\nAbout global warming\nAnd yet I went through the whole story this morning nurse lengthy and they didn't talk to anybody who might offer a contrary in point of view not\nAs elsewhere in fact one of the scientist was trying to say he's quoted you know hey we're scientist you got to listen to us but it ignores the fact that about forty thousand scientists in this country have already signed onto a paper that says they don't buy into all of this hogwash\nAnd and you know if it's in the old days they used at least try to get an opposing point of view now you could have fifty points of view because you've got so many different nuances out there [noise]\nBut media any longer doesn't even try to get one opposing view [noise] because they've concluded no this is the story and you're opposing view isn't worth as much as the one

somebody told me one time I thought it was a great time that it might have been cherry Kramer or one of our county commissioners that said people will continue coming here as long as we have water\nYou know when they get to the point where there is no longer a water supply or their state missed out on the southwest linked to stop coming but people keep coming here\nKnow the caller I thought in the last half hour made a good point when he said that I'm not looking for affordable housing you know you're talking about subsidies or what they do in places like New York city where they

tax skills into a palatial home she's a filmmaker and dad lived in in a very expensive home out on Long Island my friend and his sister continue to live in the apartment because it was rent controlled and they didn't bother to tell anybody\nA mom and dad that long ago been divorced and moved out so they were still getting this bargain basement\nAnd to tell anybody a mom and dad that long ago been divorced and moved out so they were still getting this bargain basement apartment in Manhattan for a few hundred dollars a month that's what happens\nWhen government comes in and starts rent control now the market if you let the market take over the market will get probably a few thousand dollars a month for that apart but it's in a prime spot it isn't a beautiful spot I Know exactly where it is\nMy friend is one of those conservatives he's a conservative as long as it comes down to it satisfying for him right ... when you look at it that way I I just wanted a reference that because if you

could bring the Idaho thanks in large part to the warmth of the earth's atmosphere the University of Idaho scientist says first of all being treasure valley\nCentric uh the state has much larger than just the treasure valley I realize that people in the state and they don't realize that\nI thought that the smoke or last summer was worse than it was just this past summer they wouldn't know that though because apparently they don't get out of the state of eight are too often as she talks to a couple of professors who go into some detail about just how bad things are going to be in Idaho and how much worse it's going to be\nAnd uh you know the drought in debt certification\nAnd this will go on and on and on and one of these guys are says to the reporter you know well you were a scientist you have to listen to us except\nI've got a scientist friend or in Kentucky and he was among the forty thousand scientists and the United states who says this is all a bunch of bunk again these are all mama climate cycles that happens throughout history\nBut they don't interview anyone like that in this story there's a big thing going on and media any longer we're media says well you know there always are two sides to a story or what they mean is there is basically just decide the fate you agree with so they talked to a couple of uh you know of\nCollege professors who are very liberal or worse\nAnd they talk to them as a college professor say oh this guy is while they're going to do that will be much much worse next year what's going to happen\nIf it isn't the worst next year wow you buy that your forgot the forgotten a story that we told you I Will just tell you it will be worse than twenty twenty\nOkay\nFine with me I agree that you know in the way they say there's two sides of the story actually that can be a ten sides to a story or fifty sides to a story or a hundred you know you can nuance thanks a lot of different ways and for\nReporter that's probably will be difficult to track down all of those points of view but couldn't you just try to find someone somewhere who might say I don't agree with that and here's a logical you why I don't agree with that how difficult would it be to find that argument the other part of this is ...\nAnd here's a logical you why I don't agree with that how difficult would it be to find that argument the other part of this is and I've read the history of magic valley why is it called the magic valley well because it used to be drier than uh\nI don't know you have you ever take the turkey or remember the drumstick and that's where is that what they call it ... there was a district that you and you'd have that competition with your brother or sister your poll on that's each one of your piece of the bone in your poll on it and\nAre you make a wish there was bought and that's what it's called yeah there we go on excuse me I've been a long time since I've played those games with my siblings but you you make a wish and yet it is that sometimes would sit around the house for a few weeks my mother would let it dry out before we do we have a competition and snap\nAt to see who got their wish which I don't recall it ever coming through but my mother and let the same thing they get really really dry southern Idaho was considered part of the great you know the whole Greg basin was considered just one last\nDesert and then people came along people human beings and they changed the way that life was lived here ... by digging canals\nAnd irrigated things which is why you have so much grain I was\nOut for a drive on Monday Monday was maybe the most beautiful day of the week chilly but it was just beautiful blue sky lots of sunshine that was out looking at some of the leaves that are changing and you realize a lot of those leaves that have turned yellow\nAren't from native species those trees would've never drawn here a hundred and Twenty years ago but people change things so that this was this story tells you it's going to be like that again where we're not going to have all of these options in southern Idaho in other words we returned to what had been\nWell normal edited been very dry here and you couldn't draw a lot of things here\nSo that that would be what we would be returning to according to these predictions but because of the ingenuity of mankind we overcame that\nAnd that's the other part of the stories\nThey don't ... that scientists don't talk about the fact that we are very ingenious people\nThat human beings know how to solve problems they've been doing it since well their first as I said yesterday called a\nCrowd down from out of the trees the likely when they're up on the trees they figured out what wait a minute I Want to get that piece of fruit over there but they're branches a little weak saw just used this stick that I snapped off to reach over their poll that brash this way\nYou see are problem solvers they don't mention that\nBut mainstream media just
