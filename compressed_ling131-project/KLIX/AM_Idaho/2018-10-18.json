in the past decade can be attributed to fracking\nThrough technological developments total greenhouse gas emissions from fracking plummeted\nThe writer says even as fracking has expanded in the past decade methane emissions ... emissions have dropped the result is that the u._s. which has repudiated the Paris treaty avoided the Kyoto Protocol and refuse to impose any sort of national caps on

P. N. sometime\nYou become the charge nurse during the shift\nAnd then they're just working with nurses aides and some some other folks who might be able to\nStep in and assess now and then with some help but it says up for instance in the pediatric medical and surgery units a nurse would care for no more than four patients patients' deemed in stable condition and the critical intensive care units will have their own dedicated nurse advice as what others in labor and those under anesthesia gosh\nThat sounds just great doesn't it\nBeing you're going to have more\nEnds a veil a bowl if you're at the hospital and if you're sick and if you're in ICU there'll be wasn't standing next to you all the time\nThe nurses' union ah the nurses' union claims these rigid ratios will improve the quality of hospital care which although Massachusetts already claims it's terrific question ones quotas go further than even what California's put in place the patient to nurse ratios we'd be near\nOr wherever with no waivers for rural hospitals are words rural hospitals who are already struggling at the margins\nTo succeed would have to be bringing in all of these uh these nurses to and paying them now one thing it will do is increase the number of unionized nurses who pay dues to the nurses' union\nSo there's there's union says who's going to be great for everybody but when you consider what you already pay for health care\nIf I'm I'm running I'm an administrator hypothetically at a small town hospital I my little hometown which is the size of Kimberly had a hospital what I was a kid growing up it's been greatly downsized while they'd had when I was working there or to make money for college\nI Believe they had a bad dirty war devoted though to skilled nursing that is the third floor\nOf the building was a nursing home so they had fifty bats it's not a big hospital it was we had we had to hospitals in the entire county none of which were very big but that hospitals now just a an urgent care facility and and and so it it's been greatly downsized and it took a took a big chunk out of the local economy\nBut that's because they simply can't afford to deal with a lot of modern healthcare costs and a lot of modern regulations that also make health care a lot more costly if you're running a hospital so if you're running a rural hospital and all of a sudden somebody comes along and says you know you're gonna have to add\nI see you only got one registered nurse on duty on this floor while you're going to\nHave a couple of more and I see you at all times at one for every patient so if you've got\nTen patients you'll have to have ten Iran's in there and you're probably going to have to have a quadruple the number on the floor again what do you think it's going to do to health care costs and number two we'll rural hospitals be able to survive my guess is not\nBut it benefits the huge and these are all the unforeseen cost nothing in this mentions anything about what it's going to ultimately cost like circle back\nTo our discussion about Medicaid expansion in Idaho again no one can give you an accurate estimate\nRight I was just thinking a couple of days ago the story is kind of felt I I'm not sure\nWhy we flew ... to Riyadh and it's all a you know to deal with Saudi citizens I mean if this was an American\nCitizen I could understand uh you know ... but we can't police the entire world concerning how different countries treat their own people\nYeah and we still don't really know enough in the way of details and the Turks by the way you know when I told well they have a tape well not many people have\nActually heard that tape rather than state controlled journalists in Turkey who claim their sons of show the having fingers chopped off and screaming in pain and agony ... all we know about Turkish presidents they could have done that to anybody and taped it and then claimed this was signed up to show the being you know this whole thing\nThey're lower lawyers to peel back here\nThat are apples every Tuesday night in Riyadh as well so yeah yeah it wouldn't surprise me from those [laughter]\nUh I just I I don't know why were we were in the United states is you know drag end of this is the great because it's you know it's not one of our set of yeah that that was my question\nA thank you thank you for the call Cal Thomas writing about this today and he spent the first several paragraphs saying it is a pretty serious matter\nIf if you know you got an ally and they're embarrassing you like this and they're doing things like this\nIn such a what might be considered a lawless way but then he adds this John our Bradley a British author and journalist who has written a Middle East issues spent decades working closely with intelligence services and that part of the world\nLessons from the Washington Times today and Bradley says\nWorking closely with intelligence services and that part of the world\nFor the rest is from the Washington Times today and Bradley says we are told he was a liberal Saudi progressive voice fighting for freedom and democracy and the martyr who paid the ultimate price was telling the truth to power this is not just wrong\nBut distracts us from understanding\nWhat it tells us about the internal power dynamics of a kingdom going through an unprecedented period of upheaval in truth says Mr Bradley ... never much had time for western style pluralistic democracy he championed the moderate Islamist opposition in Syria was in moderate in quotes\nWho is crimes against humanity or a matter of record ... frequently sugar coated has a lot as llamas beliefs with constant references to freedom and democracy but he never had\nThat he was in favor of a Muslim Brotherhood art throughout the middle east\nIs returning play to been Solomon and his columns was to embrace not western style democracy but the rise of\nPolitical Islam which the Arab Spring has ended ... given rise to the show veep secularism was the enemy Islamic extremist know the words westerners want to hear and they often use them to fool us into a false sense of complacency rides Cal Thomas\nAnd the belief that certain factions within Islam do not want to impose sharia law on everyone and the jihad or something other than what it looks like anyone who says or write such things as denounced as a big it and\nThat Islamophobia so in other words to show the again or the bad\nDude and we've been making this up the last several days on this program they believed in ... here believe I Believe that a worldwide caliphate he was unhappy\nThat young prince been Solomon has been trying to normalize relationships with Israel because they wanted Israel destroyed wiped off the map\nHe wants to force he he wanted to or wants to we still don't know what happened to him for all we know he's running around in Anchorage right now are trying to hide from various\nOther sources but I doubt I I\nMean I assume he's dead but again I don't know that I assume he's dead I don't have\nEvidence and none of us do but the fact of the matter is he was a devious man\nAnd the fact that he worked for the Washington Post or at least was writing for them as a guest editorialists doesn't excuse his his views which were fourteen hundred year old views we would consider that my cat so he he was the type of individual who would have been a threat\nTo our view of our government should operate\nBut because he actually had the imprimatur of the imprimatur of the Washington Post behind has worked in the last couple of years or you've got all these people saying oh this journalist was killed just as awful as this Donald Trump would like to do that all of us know he was not a journalist he was an Islamic radical\nIslamic radical and he he he was writing it was a platform for the Washington Post ... probably\nNever should have had in fact most good conservatives can't get anything published in that
