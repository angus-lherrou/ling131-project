and I try to go to go into an open mind and I tried to use science and look you know look at it from a critical thinking folklore point of view\nAnd so one so partly the answer your question one thing that often happens is that if I'm traveling somewhere\nLike for if I'm traveling with my friends and family they just sort of know that all\nBeen looking ghosts again All right you know it's like they're like we're going to be going to go to the beach and like that's really cool are you there is a monster there so I'm Wondering over they're interviewing people taking photos and so that that that's part of it is I've been able to double up\nA lot of my travels in South America and Africa notes where are you know I I happen to be there any way and so I turned into investigation one I can\nLove it love it do I do the same thing you know I mean it just is what it is you just can't help but he is in your mind you that's what you do you you would if you weren't that beach hanging out there with them you would just be you're just dying\nTo swim and I mean I can relax a little bit the despite you know just by one of my friends will tell you I can relax hiking trail but you know I'll give you one quick example I was in Newfoundland or about ten years ago\nAnd I was there with a friend of mine were traveling around looking icebergs and part of the reason that I went there was because ah there's been a series of lobsters are the that have washed up these you know mysterious\nMasses of you know sea creatures or whatever they are and they wash up there but uh so I wanted to go investigate some of that and there's also Spring Hill jak signing up there but as I was up there I came across um up a place called lake crafts and\nUm and it's this little you know new Finland is it's beautiful it's just you know it just Craig crevices and everything and it turns out that there's there's a local lake monster there and so and they actually have a like a twenty foot\nA metal sculpture thing this thing as you enter the town and the town is the populations like three or four or something\n[laughter] I went to the car I'm like I put on the break but I got a I I Can't pass a lake monstercom on site and you know my friends rolls her eyes like [noise] All right\n[laughter] well it's better than stopping for the biggest you know world's biggest a ball of yarn or something like that right that's right I'm with you [laughter] that's great stuff okay so I'm I'm before I go on you know this week I was like okay you know what I Want to talk about the origins of Halloween so I\nI Google that boom towns your article that even written 'cause you you do a lot of writing your author of course that you do a lot of writing for our life science\nThat ... pounds your article that even written 'cause you you do a lot of writing your author of course that you do a lot of writing for our life science dot com Discovery News skeptical inquiry magazine and um and some others out there too\nBut I saw this great article for a meal and I was like oh my gosh here's the game you know and solid looked into your background so you were legit you weren't just somebody his most writing from somebody else's book or anything like that you actually research so\nSo tell me about the origins now we're ... we're just learning the origins of the willing saline the jealousy or use a lean\nSee this is ... I I I Want the two hundred years from now when people were researching the orders as well if we and they're going to come up with this conversation at great I'll love it my grandkids will be be all over it they'll be like that\nI Know I was one of the things that I Love about about you know to to to be honest with you I'm not I'm not big on the on the holidays meaning of Christmas is fun blah blah but but you know to my mind the one that I really look forward to Halloween\n'cause it's it's you know it it secular a you know people of all religions can enjoy it\nUh you know sometimes the fundamentalists gets all the the the conservative sometimes get all touchy about that 'cause they think it's really the the the ... which is not\nBut it's it's it's basically something that everybody can sort of jump into and that's why I really love Halloween is it's it's more than just costumes and candy has a fascinating history\nI'm so basically Halloween a ... you know as as with most of these sorts of sort of folklore work these events and holidays there is not just one street line back right I mean there's there's different influences that come in overtime\nBut basically we can trace it back thousands of years to an October thirty first a Celtic or deal with festival called a so when [noise]\nUh and uh we don't we don't have that much information about just because it was that it was so long ago and there is no the film the records are pretty sparse fragmentary\nBut it was basically an annual communal a meeting at the end of the year of the harvest and it was a time when of course you know it's wintertime the solstice ... and it's a time when I'm you know the the the snow is falling and you know plans are dying\nUm so it had this connection to uh to darkness\nBut it wasn't sinister by modern standards mean when we ... we think we think of the darkness as being you know something faster but to them there was a very it was more carbon an analyst\nPoint of view wasn't about death or evil it with the changing of the seasons um and so that was so ... so to the people that were celebrating it so it wasn't scary it was like yes there was a time to you know to a store or grains and to you know give thanks to to to to the gods and and the the spirits and this and that [noise]\nUm and it was believed that uh that on that day that the um uh the the the separation between the world's with a sexually thin and porous\nSo the rest of the year you know we we were in our happy little world and you know the the other creatures the other Ken [laughter] you know the the ferry folk or what have you there in their own world and they leave us alone and we leave them alone but on this day\nThe the the er the barrier between them becomes more porous [noise] um and so this is why are the the began talking about how spirits would a would come come forth on this day and it was people were much more likely to be able to uh see spirits and they were basically all around us\nAnd it wasn't just the um it wasn't just the the idea that the the world's were porous um you know the barrier between them but also um in leader incarnation\nIt wasn't just the the idea that the the world are porous\nUm you know the barrier between them but also um it leader incarnations of Halloween it was also that uh time it's porous\nAnd so what you find is that a pool would later become Halloween I'm there would be a it would be basically a time when I Would be for a time for prophecy\nSo it was this notion that uh you know there's our world and that there are there other world but it's also the barrier between the present in our future\nAnd so uh for example in the Eighteen hundreds or there were different custom that were there were involved Halloween which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them but there were ideas for example that the that uh for example woman born a Halloween would be able to tell the future [noise]\nUm and there would be this a coffee and oftentimes the prophecy\nA was um either dealing with like people who might die the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage so if they were often times there's there's very superstitions about young women who would on on Halloween Night\nOr for example they would uh be with a white a candle in front of a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with a look in the mirror and midnight and they would see their future husband reflection [noise]\nUm and so it always there's another one example was bobbing for Apple you know if you're not near the apple bobbing and there was there was a particular holiday tradition that if you cut a pie appealed an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken\nAnd he talked it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell the initials of your future husband so there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and past and present coming together\nOn my way may I got to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night [laughter] so I Do it at midnight right\nOn I Will if we night\nThat's right will swing and well what about\nUm you may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to\nYou know 'cause I I get there are people that say Halloween a saint saint saint ... and and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that that that they're cool with it you know um but um you know I always see it as fun I see it as a I\nI mean if you say Halloween I immediately saying a cold Jack o lantern that you get to make I think those fall whether I think of orange and black colors I think a fake little cartoons that we would watch like which isn't the goblins\nAnd and very fun fun things that's how I see it and it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and all of a sudden they take the fun out of it and the traditions out of that and\nAnd uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're going to have to take a break here but what we have is a banner rapper with us he is an investigator and and into all the things that were into a as coast the folks here that want to learn everything\nUm but he also you know does a lot of writing and he looked into the origins of Halloween and we're going to learn more from him about that and also goes hunting too so stay with this kind of well let's hear it's Willis wean hanging and you don't know what you might hear tonight\n[noise]\n\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am county Willis here discussing the origins of Halloween on Willis wean talking with Ben Radford then so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have a um an interesting history\nVery rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get say panic and gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the ah\nTelevision shows around the time of Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanuts you know characters that's always fun with the ah great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff um but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that they can do that any time of the year\nOh you don't have the TV to go to targeting put on you know bad men can we make make I'm I'm Out of it you know\nYes agreed and and and do you know make a Jack o lantern and put a real candle in there and let smell that smell of burning pumpkin so cool I Love it love at all [noise]\nAbsolutely no I mean that that's one of the you know that that's how we would of course these days um although you know\nNo absolutely no I mean that's that's one of the you know that that's really what's associates course these days um although your Halloween was never really mainly children's holiday and it really didn't become focused on kids until about Nineteen fifty\nBefore that it was I mean kids were involved but it wasn't really a kids it wouldn't kid centered as it is today\nA it was more of a community thing again sort of you if you go back to go back to solve when and the the the early a Celtic versions of it which were very and the mystic and and again sort of dealing with the the changing of the season and darkness and snow and all that [noise]\nUm but you know so you you had that and then that sort of what happened was that um that that someone got mixed in along with all saints day which was November first which was you know ... obviously the next day which was a to honor that the church a church members who have gone to heaven\nAnd then also got wrapped up to a whole whole day which is November second which bills are wrong for the soul in purgatory and so there was this there were it was interesting transition from an early purely pagan\nUm um you know ritual which died out long before you know the church was was even writing about devils anything like that and then you have the the influence of the Catholic Church\nWith all saints day ... day and and getting there were there ... or bells and sometimes the bills are wrong to keep away or demons and scary things could loud noises we're such a scare away the evil [noise]\nUm and that's where it transforms a little later on into the modern costumes because what would happen is um ah you know because we were talking about you where the cost and you come from and one one part of it is that uh it believe that a drink so in the ... leaders would where animals skins I'm\nThere and sometimes the animal heads like antlers whatnot during the ceremonies and they weren't there and they weren't doing it to fool anybody of course everybody who they were but it was it was a ritual thing in terms of honoring the land and the animals that were given to them [noise]\nUm ... but then later on during the late Eighteen ... hundreds in England who was customary for the wealthy remembers in town to offer a small payment or food um to the poor during Halloween praying for the dead and this again the ties back into all day because the idea was that\nUm that on that day or the soul of the word predatory you know there were there were basically trapped between heaven and hell they needed to be prayer prayed for a and so the the the wealthier members of the other communities would basically\nA higher out there were ... sub contract the prayers if you will to these numbers and so these these people would go from house to house asking for what were called full cakes where which type of bread and in return for paying for praying for those in purgatory so they would they would do dances and songs and rituals\nAre going from house to house getting little tokens of of of food or coin\nHum and often times they would care with them how to turn it of course that would lead or translate into uh the the the the uh the public and um but the candle at the land for the candle in it\nAnd the candle light represented the soul the person they would pray for the idea was that they were these numbers go as far as to how say you know yes will pray for if you have a member of your family who's a who's passed on I'm with you know holding up this this turn up with a candle and I\nThink of this late as the the soles the coach wants to pray for them they would say yes\nAnd then of course when that came over with the Irish immigrants to to America\nUm the tournament ... sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if you ask me\nTo read that one that's when the ...\nOkay um the turn of the sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if you ask me breed that's\nWhen the pumpkins came in because the pumpkin associate course they're they're bigger they're they're more fun to carve and our associate with the harvest and that's that's sort of how the the trick or treating after I came along\nOh I like that yeah I agree with you turn it's now move on [laughter] ... says Munch on little olive oil salt pepper I'm so worried about the candy I guess I guess it all turned into candy at one point in is that like right after the fifties like you were talking about\n[noise] yeah well I mean of ... it was interesting because because again the sort of the the things sort of parsed out along gender lines for a while because what would happen is\nUm that if you think about it you know again there was the the mom and going on this that and then uh the the ... during this time or the the jitters had pretty strict social and so um and as I mentioned earlier during Halloween was a time when when young girls would\nWould would pining away and with ... think of you know who which which cute boy they would marry and the next town over who probably had three or four of the time he knows I'm going to that's what they did um but you know so that that's what they were doing so so ... if you think about like\nDuring this time this is when people would go from house to house look into the mom and get sort of gone away but the tradition of going to people's houses to knock on the door and you know sort of trick or treat and give us give us a little token or something\nYou would be inappropriate for young women to do that they wouldn't really go out alone by themselves during during that era so that was typically sort of a young men you know using a mixture of this young man's project and the the the girls and women were tend to be\nMore indoors and that's where you get the apple bobbing and rituals in terms of you know the prophecy in those sorts of things so [noise] so you know by the late Eighteen hundreds the tradition of playing pranks on Halloween was pretty well established\nAnd and that's when ah you know as as the religious aspect sort of faded away right I mean they were\nPeople were no longer you know going from house to house asking for little bits of bread to to pray for you know soul in purgatory that's that's ... that's a little a little bit of outlandish for for a little too much work for these days\nSo that's when this sort of came down to treat a and even even today I mean I remember when I was a kid or not so long ago I like to say uh you know there were it was a member of you know every now I get to get a silver dollar or are you sometimes you get an apple you're like really really\nA capital okay and I like it was it wasn't even like it was like some really tart apple was like you went out of your way to find a nasty apple did you I didn't say that and like you but anyway [laughter]\nYou know well I you know I remember when we would go a long time ago it was great you remember the good houses together too there were there were years where you would get full size candy bars and by the way if you came up to our house which was on a hill and it was scary and we would play that'll\nHaunted house record where you heard in the ... in which is right and it was very dark so if you if you were asked if you were brave enough to go to our house you would get full size bars you know marathon bars and you get a handful\nNow you're the only perimeter marathon runners I Love that I Love the marathon bars but they were like growl and chocolate and they they're like a foot and a half long yeah and they were just great they're just going to have those I I haven't heard anybody mention those in decades oh now that's a horrible ... you got a full on you got a full one is you can't replace a wish I'd been there\nBelieve they don't make those anymore those are fantastic but but we were when we would go trick or treating and and we had to go\nI Wish I had been there\nI Can't believe they don't make those any more of those are fantastic but but we were when we would go trick or treating and and we had to go kind of far up one hill this way money all the other way and you had your son that's when they had those nasty nasty you couldn't breathe or anything but at the time [laughter]\nBut we would never say one house and always had homemade popcorn balls\nThey were delicious it was the only time we ever had on there were awesome and you know back then you could trust the people\nAnd then of course you know you hear about razor blades in apples and things like that but then there was another person's house that they were a dentist and they only gave away toothbrushes like we don't want to go there you know thank you yeah trick or treat thank you [laughter]\nI should mention that because of all three answers the the ah the more modern scares a and you know you mentioned the the the the classic a poison ... and the reason the assets yeah\nAnd the fact is that that I mean that's that's there's there's almost no truth to that uh it's it's widely talked about a friend of mine Joel Best wrote a book about that I'm In and you know so when you actually look at", "year": "2018", "show_name": "AM Idaho", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "07"}
