power and then with all of that money\nBill and they were smart enough to put it all together\nAnd they accumulate this power and then with all of that money comes corruption and they start to control everybody else's lives and start making all the decisions because they have all of this money how do you how do you reconcile that because I don't want to take the money away from people\nRight now I got a glass and you know it is distressing when you see something like a family where there was a patriarch it was a good entrepreneur\nBut then kind of built a moat around the castle and that kept a bunch of wealth in the family for six generations and made it harder for other people to rise through crony capitalism that's a big problem that's actually not capitalism that's a different system that's a\nThose basically that's a system all wired deals you could find in any socialist system any monarchy any place all around the world\nAnd that's something that we have to fight whether it's capitalism more or whatever ... whatever is on whatever economic system that we've got we have to democratize opportunity of the problem is not that we've got very rich people the problem is people have a hard time rising and we have to be putting our resources and our energy in our law in our initiative toward\nPeople that are at the bottom not so they can all get to the top but so then they can get to the middle the essence of the American experience the ... the moral basis of the American experience is that the the you know three generations ago the Brooks is in the backs\nWere who were just like scratching out potatoes some place they're they're nothing more than ambitious riffraff who came to this country and wanted to get to the middle and support themselves and their families and we have to be warriors\nFor system to make sure that people can go from the bottom to the middle [noise] you know right now it's a very distressing thing you know you go to any good Ivy League university and you're gonna find that there's a system of preferences for legacies you know if you went to university is four or five times more likely that your kid is going to get into that great university which all it is it's just saying\nYou got into the lucky genetics club\nYou know that's that's actually not compatible with with a system of American opportunity with a system of equal dignity of experience and so that's actually what we need to be thinking about story about Google\nWere a lot more about the fact that people at the periphery of the bottom of our society can't rise today that's that's really an American thing\nIn camp they rise that can't wise because we have a discriminatory system unequal education were poor kids are all locked into public education systems are parents who don't have choices number one number two\nIs we don't have skills training in our communities we tell people that if they don't go to college there somehow losers we don't have a vocational and technical education systems which is the ultimate educational reform we don't have an apprenticeship system in this country and most importantly glad we don't culturally value\nThe skills that come from actually not going to college where people actually homework skills where they can get when they can get ahead if we do those things we can really recreate the opportunity society\nHow did The Apprentice system go away\n[noise] but in a way for a bunch of different reasons but part of it had to do with the fact that you know back in the Nineteen until the Nineteen sixties there was a parallel tracking system in America\nWhere white kids would be tracked toward college and black kids especially in the south will be tracked toward the trades and and you and I know that one of the great advances in American society was the civil rights movement where we did away with stuff like that unfortunately there were some things are way through the baby out with the bathwater\nAnd then make the positive case for capitalism and democracy and free enterprise and entrepreneurship because lifted more people out of poverty in any system in human history it's created a system of of equal opportunity that nobody's ever thought of in the history of humanity and say [noise]\nAnd now the problem is not that this is an equal but what we haven't actually tried to make it as equal as possible and push it all the way out to the periphery of society let's do that together\nCan you give the argument because most I think even most conservatives um hold on the the Netherlands or Sweden when people say I want socialism like Sweden and you describe what that is\nSo I just this movie the pursuit that that that you mentioned in the last segment of coming out in the spring\nAnd part of it is actually filmed in Denmark and Denmark has considered to be the happiest country in the world it's a\nIt's a social democracy it has the highest tax rates in the world about Seventy five percent of your income goes to the government [noise] and so I went there I went to Denmark and hung out with some families there and the truth is if you're into that you know more power to ya\nBut I don't see very many people were actually trying to move to Denmark I Do see lots of people in Denmark that are trying to move to America why because it's the antithesis culturally\nOf what it means to be an American that all you know Danish society Scandinavian society is built on the idea that don't stand out\nDon't be different don't think the IRS something special don't try to do so if you're\nIn this country America is built by oddball like you know like Glenn Beck and Arthur Brooks we're due to actually tried to do different things and in Denmark\nThis country America is built by oddball like you know like Glenn Beck and Arthur Brooks we're due to actually tried to do different things and in Denmark if you [noise]\nYou know if you want to get rich or you want to start a company or you're really super religious like you and me or or you want to have eight kids forget about it but then to look at you like you're a freak\nAnd that's a big problem so if you want to just socialism is not just a social deal\nSocialism is actually a cultural deal and so and and and basically wherever it is the same amount of money everybody has to be awake as well so if you like being a weirdo if you like being an oddball if you like being yourself you better stay in America and you better make the American system better don't try to get the data system\nAnd that is one reason why it has been successful one reason why it is now falling apart and one reason why would not work here is there was no diversity there was no diversity now that they have open up the borders there's diversity and people don't want to live their life that way and it's falling apart my wrong people\nAre different people are different is look at the country of it's a boutique society of five point three million people to the Danes they basically the hobbit ill they they kind of live in the shower\nAnd then when there's a whole bunch of of immigration look for in America you know despite the fact that we have these ... Neal controversies about the wall and about the immigration system\nAnd then a lot of people listening to us today disagree on this fundamentally we all come from immigrants and we all like immigrants we'd like hard working people who come from different places and integrate into our society most most Europeans that they can't handle it\nThey don't know how to do it they don't think of themselves as fundamentally from some other place like a thousand years ago the Danish ancestors of current dangers were\nVikings living in Denmark a thousand years ago I have the slightest idea where my family was but I think God Knows they weren't in Seattle\nUm Arthur ... one less sought people's came into it and they saw what they wanted to see one way or another I don't think it changed anybody's mind um it was all about politics and the politics of destruction I think um\nBut we ... you know when when Lindsey Graham spoke yesterday kind of feel good do a lot of people in this audience and I thought it was righteous indignation myself I think there are a lot of people that feel this way knock it off this is shameful what is happening\nUm but there is a difference between righteous indignation and and playing the game the way others are playing it um they're they're playing for destruction\nIf we reach out and play for destruction as well I think we lose and we we have in our own destruction people think that that is surrender you what you want me to surrender you want me not to say anything\nThat's not what I'm saying I'm saying fight the right way people kind of given up on being able to win a without playing dirty and you make a case that shouldn't do that\nYou know Glenn Beck speaks truth right everybody's got to listen this is the truth you know there is not a longer term or that comes from being a bad person that you know here's the key thing here is the most people listening to a city or conservatives like you and me and they're watching the the the and they have a\nThey have their own filter bubble look we all hear things through our own experience and through our own biases I got it I got it [noise]\nBut standing up when in in righteous ignition look if you're a senator and you're in a hearing fine but for the rest of us standing up to the left standing up to the other side when they're wrong around the Thanksgiving table or on social media is a very limited impact why because\nWe're not going to actually be taken seriously unless we hold our own side of the same moral standard to even ...\nBecause we're not going to actually be taken seriously unless we hold our own side to the same moral standard so if we really want to be effective All right what we need to do is we need to look at contempt and hatred and mockery and sarcasm and derision on the right\nAnd call it out and said these are not these arguments are not living up to my own moral standard\nAnd we hold ourselves to a higher moral standard we will not lose I've got the data on this one is and in the long run the the moral high road which doesn't have to be weak don't have to give in to anybody else's argument but the say\nThrough love and respect I Believe that you are not living up to your own objective and said our own side we will not stand for hatred\nThat's not who we are that's the secret to long term success I\nI Believe that we're entering a time and yesterday I didn't only hastened it where people see this and they don't want to be a part of either side they don't want to be a part they're good Democrats who do not stand where they have to enter bothered by that\nUm but I don't think they have anywhere to go because uh we had been painted as heaters\nBut also um we are we shut down people not the way they do necessarily on the left but it feels good to do that do you see any movement on the left that common sense Democrats are starting to say wait a minute I I'm not in lockstep with this\nI Do this is this is not what gets all the publicity screaming ladder is what gets all the policy on the writing on the left I look at the data I Seventy percent of Americans hate it they feel that they're being out on that and again this is half right wing and a half left wing Seventy percent of Americans believe that were being held hostage or being terrorized\nBy powerful people who are profiting from us hating each other and saying terrible things to each other and they don't like it they they they they want to fight back we have uh\nThe the the opportunity to create a new moral movement where we can bring are brothers and sisters I'm a center left and even on the left together to try to solve some problems in this country and where we can say\nI don't hate you these kinds of these what's going on in the Senate right now what's going on with these hearings right now as a proxy battle it's like an angle and the civil war where the Soviet Union in the United states are sending troops against each other than the Nineteen eighties to fight it out on somebody else's battleground Americans have to say enough\nWith these ideological this ideological warfare between right and left and we're we're being the ones in the middle of World War effectively being held hostage we want better than this in this country we we don't have to back down from conservatives at all we just have to recognize that we don't have to agree\nIt's okay in this country to have actual disagreement that's the basis of our excellent you know your message has always been so good glad because you don't hate anybody and we have to as leaders we have an opportunity to help Americans to love their enemies and in so doing to find the basis of our strength\nArthur Brooks thank you so much for being on the program\nA well spoken well

most important election of your lifetime that's the most important election of your lifetime\nHere of the scenarios that icy Kavanaugh they're moving the goalposts now on Capitol and if I'm a ... let me just give me a couple let's say he is confirmed okay he's confirmed but this kind of perjury stuff is percolating and they just make hay out of it um\nWe go back to normal and ... the GOP loses the house to the Democrats\nThe Democrats than are going to demand testimony from Donald Trump because they're going to try to impeach him they're going to demand is tax records because they're going to be Jim and the White House responds by going to the Supreme Court and says that the president of the time to do this yadda yadda\nUm and the Democrats than a lot a capital to recuse himself but she goes to what you all do it doesn't happen\nA and the the house then moves to impeach capital guy so we've got a year or ... or ... or let's say he's not confirmed because flake or Collins or Murkowski or Heller\nOkay they just don't believe him and the Republicans\nNO PLAN and they just like whoa you know and where do you need your vote because we're a repeal Obamacare do they lose the house and possibly the Senate worst case scenario if they don't get they don't get them through because the Republicans and because of this week with Jeff Flake\nPeople are just like okay the Republicans are worthless and they don't come out with a huge play yeah I think you're right they'll try to turn that into a reason to get to the polls but if if it's the Republicans that cause it I don't know how they're going to I don't think it'll work okay\nAnother scenario he is confirmed as a house in beaches Trump the house or impeach his cabinet or on perjury [laughter] think that is\nThe day when the house you know they're gonna at least attempt to they will attempt jump and probably Kavanaugh to correct if we lose the house and the Senate\nThese things are happening and they're well there's no chance of them being removed but you will have the next two years of non stop impeachment hearings of both capital and Trump\nOK mhm the only one that seems good to me is I'm a ... if Kavanaugh loses the vote\nThe only one that I think works out is Kavanaugh loses the vote which could be really bad because it'll be the Republicans that do it\nUm however Donald Trump comes out and while he says yeah that's over here's the guy she ups the ante and you get a guy that all conservatives are rabid about\nGuy somebody who you just know oh my gosh that's a skill Leah\nRight now Brett Kavanaugh has not been a lot of people's favorites I mean they're okay with him but no I always willing to die in a sword for em em remember remember Kavanaugh was not on the initial list of judge right from Trump and there's lots of them he asked them later I personally think the best course of action\nIs to nominate let's say let's say flake and Collins Colorado you know what I Can't do it I'm not going to vote on friday I Can't vote for him great\nDonald Trump with in ten minutes should be on television and say in my opinion Mike Lee is the next the nominee and you know what he's already been vetted for the FBI and every senator knows them\nSo we're going to be calling for a vote next week easy easy you know that\nThe thing to do because then you have them battling just on abortion right there at the same place they'd have about everybody correct and that's not going to hurt conservatives getting to the polls\nIf if you put a staunch conservative somebody who says yeah I think abortion is wrong and if it comes before me I'll look at the case of course but I think it's wrong I think it's murder and that and burgers this way it was a terrible decision you then have\nKavanaugh said the name Kavanaugh even at that time yeah\nBut ... and I mean you I mean you don't have video tape ... tape\nNow we haven't seen it yet though are now there is allegedly videotape that exists some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the cabinet thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing that we have to take her word that there is video with the\nWith the Ellis with veil and right and we don't have that evidence yeah I mean we have a a ton of evidence and in fact\nI don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence and the forties so we as I told him out we have a preponderance of evidence in the Alice in case there however\nUm what's interesting about this is that fifty six percent of Democrats believe Christine Blasey Ford's allegations fifty six percent only eight percent say they ... they believe Kavanaugh fifty six to eight is a split there so you assume that if you ask\nPeople and it wasn't a partisan situation what do you think about the Ellison situation\nYou what do you believe from her 'cause she's got a more recent allegation she's actually brought it to the attention in real time to multiple people people around her have seen evidence of this there's text messages there is a there are medical notes all the evidence that we just talked about there's an infinity amount\nTimes more evidence in the Alice in case he had only five percent of Democrats believe Allison's accuser we're told over and over again that women are to be believed it only five percent of Democrats believe the allegations against Keith Ellison and here's\nWhy this is really important I'm just like I don't want an abuser on the Supreme Court\nIf if there was the amount of evidence on Kavanaugh that there is on a Keith Ellison I Would not be for Kavanaugh would you if there was amount on cabinet and how would I Would if if if the evidence was the same\nWith a lot [noise] we still have a standard here in this country um called innocent until proven guilty and preponderance of evidence\nAnd I understand that um my issue here would be you can\nOnce there isn't the legal standards because people will say well this is just a job interview or this is just that this isn't a legal proceeding once you have the absence of a legal standard you'll have to choose the standard you apply I Choose to apply a very high standard because people who are in relationships many many times\nWhen he relationships breakup or someone feels guilty to say things that are not true I hadn't even isn't all that I agree with that I live in this case\nI'm Keith Ellison should have the right to defend himself\nAnd he should we should assume his innocence unless I agree point\nAnd which are he is and if especially with the case like this where it's very recent that should just go through the legal system and when he comes out of he's guilty then he should get thrown out of that job and you can factor that in in your vote if you wish but I don't think he should lose any job because of this at this point he needs to you need to be able to see\nWhether this case goes through and and claims are proven someone has said they have video we need to see the video we need to see everyone\nA ... in investigated we need to see an actual police\nAh investigation and go through and and and see whether the evidence leads us to a belief that he actually committed these acts if we do not get that you do not ruin people's lives over it I mean think about the amount of times of evidence\nThat there is a wiki Nelson overall anymore which everyone I mean even at a lot of people on the right where like look ... really looks like he did these things his answers are really bad\n... you know there's much more evidence for ... much more there's people you can interview right now ... children who went through traumatic moments where they had to read about their mom being abused or you know sure her telling other friends at the time\nThat being said however you didn't you he went through this process with the presumption of innocence I agree\nSo but what I Know about Keith Ellison is the evidence against him mhm okay\nAssuming this was not current day and it was thirty five years ago if Ford would come with that evidence I have letters I have a photo of lead bruises on my arm I have\nUm ah I can tell you where it happened I told my friends and here they are they verify that I told them after the party mhm\nWould you not would you not go okay I think that's good yeah I mean I think that would be enough and it was the only way we can judge the situation erect correct here it is with Alison and again this is why it's important\nJust like I don't want to have a Supreme Court justice that is an abuser or a liar or whatever I also think it's extraordinarily dangerous\nTo have a guy who may have beaten his girlfriend may have mentally abused his girlfriend assuming the evidence is real and checks out\nYou can't have him as the as the the the chief law enforcement of the state\nAnd does anybody care no fish shows you that nobody in the media cares at an iota\nFor this woman and her story they don't care if she was abused\nAnd they don't care about any of it what they care about is stopping Brett Kavanaugh if they care thing would be just as passionate as a guy let's not to throw him out as the Minnesota attorney general this is a guy who's second in charge of the ... what the the DNC ... this is not a a a ... a peripheral figure\nAnd politics he's one of the most powerful\nIt's now going to be a chief law enforcement officer for state and you could say oh well it's all you're what you're doing is what about is um no no it's not it's not what about us and I apply the same standard Alison that I applied to cabinet you weren't doing this to Canada I Would still be saying this about I'm I'm a\nAbout I was looking to go back to ... why was bronco by my president right broke about was president because he won a presidential election in two thousand eight\nPreviously he made a heck of a speech and what two thousand four and a two thousand four ... election he won a Senate seat a Senate seat that would have been incredibly close if he was going against\nAlan Keyes who they flew in the last week to just started a campaign but it was a Jack\nJack Ryan but it might be thinking of John Christmas Day at this point um I haven't seen too many Amazon commercials but uh Ryan was his last name and he was a legitimate challenger to Brock\nObama in that Senate race it was a close election and he may have won it as a Republican in Illinois and what they did is they went through his divorce is sealed divorce or um hearings and hit and paper work\nOut at it to the public and in there there were accusations by his wife the actress who said they went to swingers clubs and all this sort of shady stuff do we know if that was true in added horse proceeding divorce proceeding people make all sorts of yelling Ames yeah and that's why you don't just believe them\nThat's why they're on the old because they went and got them unsealed in a democratic state and they they they ... Brian eventually dropped out there was no real opposition for ... and you got eight years of him that\nSort of thing should be always viewed\nSkeptically every claim of a crime should be viewed skeptically by people on that side\nYou're supposed to give the presumption of innocence and they all close to start with skepticism of a claim on any side on any side on any side of all people who are accused and here we are in a situation where Democrats overwhelmingly believe the accusations against capital with almost no evidence\nAnd they only five percent of them believe the woman who is a Democrat who does not want someone up a ideologically opposed to ... to a Keith Ellison to have that job she's a Democrat\nAnd only five percent of people believe her the the platitudes you hear from the media and the left I mean nothing on the story they do not care about whether Ford was abused or not they don't [noise]\n\nAnd this shows you how fast that standard is applied and how [noise]\nAnd how your life could be destroyed [noise] you are on the wrong side of an issue and by the way\nI think you've seen the issues to change and a physician's what's politically correct changes and if you don't abide one hundred percent and you're not on the right side will destroy your life [noise]\nWhile they'll let somebody else be fine\nThis is why we must have a standard we must have a standard [noise] getting dangerous to be an American [noise] that's a frightening thing to say [noise]\nThose are the least progress on demand has a ... flash TV you can watch every episode uh for the record and watching to see documentaries one of those ... house for terrorists come to see actually actually competition there", "show_name": "AM Idaho", "year": "2018", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "06"}
