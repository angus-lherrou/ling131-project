watching some of the coverage and then realized you know I I'm not accomplishing much\nOf anything else uh I've got to go do some other things and then yesterday really for me it was a rare news

sometimes you just feel that you know that there's there's got to be a little bit of a breeder in your life and that's exactly what I did I stepped away from it yesterday but I knew right away what was going to be happening\nWith coverage in mainstream media whereabouts seven minutes now after six o'clock I knew what was going to happen because it wasn't going to be long before the folks working at the Washington Post and the New York times\nYeah amnesty and see CNN [noise] we're all trying to tie the shooter to President Trump justice they tried the clown who are sending out the bombs that didn't work they were trying to ... tired of Trump because he was an admirer of President Trump didn't you know I'm obviously but an admirer\nBut when it came to the guy who was who is responsible for the for the shooting in Pittsburgh apparently\nHe didn't like President Trump viewed him as a global list and remember the president has Jewish members of his family the guy just ...\nAnd why he decided to attack us in a God maybe because it was close to where he lived his main beef lately had been with this caravan\nAnd marching towards the U.S border somehow he felt that the Jews who were

can shoot down a woman who was Ninety seven years old who lived through depression and war and it seems so many changes around the world you and you hope for the better\nBut it's my guess that there's this it is we get closer and closer to election day and the liberals need someone to pull them across the finish line\nThey'll turn to their friends in mainstream media who will try it by the by the time we get through the next couple of days over at NBC they all have the shooter caucusing with President Trump at some point\nMeanwhile at Fox News\nThis is supposed to be an outfit that according to the rest of the media is allied with President Trump but you wouldn't know that if you were to watch sometimes Neal komodo and other times if you were to watch Shepard Smith that these are men to

correct that the horrors well persuaded up voters in key districts in states\nThat the president is to blame for the rise of political violence so a bandwagon a belief is rolling in that direction but nobody needs saved me a seat\nBecause he says I'm not convinced neither suspect was a solid citizen who suddenly turned to violence because of politics in other words they had a long history of trouble behind them the speed of events these days means no one storyline\nDominates for a long Goodwin says even in the anti Trump obsessed media the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle looked as

Clintons themselves but none of these ever got to mailboxes why because the secret service in the case of the Clintons on Obama's surge through all the mail long before it ever gets sent to the actual

to make it work and we were in an awkward tuna dean had some space that we can rent them out of county west and I think it's really neat partnership and\nAnd that it gives us a you know you'd walk up there and you look around and and you feel thankful for what our country is and what are we get to experience here because of these men and women\nJust around the corner David sparks with the egg information network of the west a key debate recently took place between two congressional candidates in Washington state Dino Rossi and Dr Kim\nSchrier First Listen to Dr schrier when the topic of the age to a program came up\n... program does not work well for either the farmers or for the workers and\nCan lead to a pattern of indentured servants had to wear a worker is actually held hostage by potentially abuses farmer or farm owner that's how we have to have our farm and make sure that our labor that protected that we have some faith as like an ashtray that are formed H ... workers are protected and farmers are protected and can't get the labor that any\nJohn ... president of the Washington state tree fruit association was in the room watching the debate at the time and his reaction\nFrom watching the debate of when I was shocked when we talk on the H ... really important to keep in mind that we're talking about\nGo on the state and federal agencies for us to waive security in state along with Washington state department are appointed security in on how all over the use of that\nUsing regulations are written by the Obama administration there's a lot of content screwed me\nThis is not only about a Washington state congressional debate it's an example of why the national ad community needs to be on top of the upcoming election\nWe already know that proposition one is an unlimited expansion of gambling state wide and we also know that the promoters of prop one who claim legalizing gambling machines will benefit schools made the same promise the last time Idaho legalized gambling machine\nBack then the state auditor found money promise to schools with misspent illegally and never reached the classroom the same thing will happen again promoters intentionally wrote prop one so they take Eighteen times more money than Idaho schools we're seeing now we find out that the deception goes even deeper\nOne was also written to include a glaring loophole that immediately legalized gambling machine the greyhound parking lot shuttered dumb track\nThe Las Vegas group that owns the ... make hundreds of millions of dollars on blonde machines across the country will make millions more is probably one passes\nPaid for by Idaho United against prop one\nDavid sparks ...\nMagic valley whether brought you by Jones hardware and the furniture Roman build\nNoticeably cooler today was a ... to ... to guys it's gonna be reviews well wind up to Twenty one miles per hour there is a very slight chance of showers this morning thirty two for the little tonight wins around Seventeen miles per hour a day to day [noise]\nJerry Johnson is a twin falls county commissioner she's joining us in Studio this morning between seven eight o'clock and uh that he's off to work for the day what forty four on magic valley this morning\nAnd ... and a new video Thirteen ten dot com I Will just having a discussion off air uh gosh it was a year ago maybe a year and a half ago we had a conversation on this show about the\nFeasibility of potential of a of a a ton of gun range because there's a huge need for it uh on friday I was talking to the gun guys on the show and they are pointing out they say in this day and age\nEven if someone wants to you know even in in in general property set something up or that they have a lot of hoops to jump through because there's a PA and there's all sorts of other regulations that become involved in this but you know you haven't given up on it at this point have you\nKnow and it's going to happen bill um I I was hoping you would have happened in my two year term uh it hasn't I've got four years now um\nBut it's gonna happen we've got to provide a safe area for people to shoot and ah you know we've met ... we've been working on the ah the old National Guard a ... gun range out south of twin by the landfill\nAnd you know every time we have a meeting I think I get more questions than answers on that it could probably be worked out still um but it's a you know you've got the uh the national guard ... county\nUh you've got multiple people involved in this and last week I found out some or agreements were made because there was some communication towers on top of her Butte out there\nAnd ah when those were put in they were put in by private or interest uh there were written agreements that are basically shut down the shooting at the national guard range\nOr because they didn't need it or use it really anymore for that purpose and they are here but it's shooting out there so that the ... towers are safe and so there's a that was some information that none of us were aware of until we had a meeting\nAnd so there's a it could still be worked out probably but we would be about a third party in there and wouldn't have complete control over it [noise]\nAh so we're going to look at some other options and uh we're definitely not giving up all all three commissioners I think are on board for this um [noise]\nYou know we don't know what's gonna happen on the north side I'm not involved in the meetings over there or anything um so we don't know what's going to happen over there but we're going to move forward over here and and uh we're gonna get some figure it out so\nThe need has gotten I think a little bit more critical because we had a you know private rains that did a lot of training but now they're going to just narrow their focus I Believe too to a military training in a in a neighboring county\nAnd so all of a sudden you know that it's not just about the public but it it you know maybe it's finding up because you've got a couple of indoor range is for people in law enforcement but still if you could get them outdoors on a wider range and maybe even do some tactical training that way too [noise]\nUm than any number of things you know if you have some space a big space you know a bigger space and let's just say a basement somewhere um that would really be good for everybody involved I mean from from law enforcement right down to just people who like to do it you know a nice break to get away on a Saturday morning\nYeah yeah and there there are a couple of uh you know private entities that that run those uh you know our sheriff's office has their range set up on the landfill ground out there\nUm you know there's some things involved in that that would be the easy thing to do is is the get that are opened up and working towards a public but\n[noise] historical grazing rights and things like that that are impacts some of those saying so\nWe're we're going to try and work through some different things but yeah the division at least and you know and Jack's head okay it may not be an everybody's button jacks is a ... they we have a a public shooting range area uh that that meets the needs of our public\nAnd that we have a law enforcement uh shooting area also as part of that and have enough ground incorporate this on it\nYou know most of our municipal uh partners in in law enforcement are slowly getting averaged out of you know the the rangers that they've utilized for years\nUm because of growth and development and different things that are happening and so I think it's come time that we look at a consolidated law enforcement shooting range um but we really need a public shooting range also does a company that I think we can do it hand in hand\nAnd and again it's just a matter now of fun in that space I Want you to find a space that it'll move along so fast I mean this is something that will get done and could you say in the next four years you can probably you know have there's completed by the time that term comes to an end\nI I sure yeah I Believe so you know we've got engineers that are\nAre are ready to donate time architects that are ready to donate time ah people were dirt movers that are ready to tone it you know the public wants this and uh they really do and you know I'm an outdoor enthusiasts I outdoors shooter\nI go up on our public lands in shoot guns and and I clean my trash up when I'm done but I'll tell you what I get so angry when people use our public lands for dumping stations\nAnd are we generally haul off a lot more than just our garbage when we're up there and it and it's and that's and it's not going to stop every day you know don't get me wrong if we have a public should people are still going to do that [noise]\nUh but I think it'll minimizes ... but it'll also create a safe area\nIn which busy enough people may not a ... they may decide I think the better of dumping managing their ... and they'll clean up there'll be better stewards of what they've got\nRight yeah you hope you know and and again you know input from the public on any of this would be welcome right oh yeah yeah and like I say I\nUm I haven't I haven't run across anybody you know and I talked to a lot of people that say that we don't need a shooting range of public shooting range from twin falls gotta have\nHeard anybody tell me that there's probably some folks out there I've just never heard it yet so I was thinking forest addresses backyard but uh [laughter] I don't know that he's got that must not probably not\nAt a manner as I'm Glad you mentioned four she asked me a question a while back on a fundraiser for a a veteran that I and I need to get by back with him on that I forgot to call him back about that so I'm Glad you mentioned\nAnd you know there'll be calling you anyway so yeah yeah like a short break we've got more coming up with twin falls county commissioner Jack johnson worked forty six and seven thirty Gokhale magic valley this morning news radio thirteenth ... news radio Thirteen tend to come local news update coming up with a needle in just a moment\nSo next year you know we're looking at probably a million dollars a year now to county house and that's a scary number for our tax dollars to be going somewhere else\nWe wanted to point out that Jack johnson is in Studio with us this morning is a twin falls county commissioner coming up on seven forty\nWhere at forty six on magic valley this morning on news radio Thirteen ten ... news radio Thirteen tend to come with Bill collie and a telephone number if you'd like to reach us to zero eight seven three six zero three hundred\nI have a friend in the sheriff's department had a few I mean ... I got a lot of time with the back seat you know\n[laughter] and I asked my friend and so I'm not going to throw him either ends there don't put me in the ... yeah [laughter] I'm not going to or anybody under the bus but one of them said boy it'd be great to build a new jellies right ever behind county west because there's a lot of land\nAnd uh you know the whole court system could go down there and everything else in it and it and I you know you look at it he goes yeah that would be beautiful\nBut it would be the cost of going with an entirely new facility\nThat makes everyone go whoa wait a minute and and so that's why I guess a lot of the discussion has been just about\nUpgrading and expanding correct facilities but that was a good\nOf it um the the recommendation from the citizens committee is they don't want that expanded down there they think we should build another facility offsite their\nUse that existing facility for um you know could be additional programming space it could be a female housing 'cause female housing is more of a premium statewide than anything else and that could help pay some bills you know towards some things\nUm it could be in custody for arraignment um it wouldn't be cost effective to tear the old jailed down because uh uh you know that's all concrete and steel on a lot of it and and so utilizing that for another purpose\nOr was there recommendation and moving it off site now the county does own some ground\nWhy is that for another purpose a was their recommendation and moving it off site now the county does own some ground um the ground I Know I I'm sure the piece of ground you're talking about is the field just directly north of county west out there which would be\nAn absolute perfect place to to start doing things that uh fortunately the price of that ground is extremely high um that has been looked at before\nUm and if you know if we have existing ground that the county owns we probably ought to look at the feasibility of that before we look at uh being the the price tag purchase ground somewhere [noise]\nUm but we'll see how it all plays out you know I'm a I'm not a independent decision maker and this it'll it's all three of us involved in this I end the public\nSo you know and and being that the ... the current facility is downtown I imagine some people in the city would like to actually see it move from that particular area or\nJust because it's ... it's not like there's an escape issue but just because I I don't know maybe they don't want it you know across the street from city park\nYeah there there there is a a I Would say a growing a majority of people that\nAre at least that enjoy our downtown area you know in our business sector and things like that down there that really don't want\nA jail down there any more um you know those were ... when these jails were originally built that's where you did it because you know we didn't have the spread out population and the city's weren't as big and\nUm but uh you know that's probably not the most conducive place to keep a jail that down there and\nYou know we tack on to that we've got to go ask the city to close the street down um and go into a parking lot but bill it in twenty or Thirty years there's nowhere else to go that that's it there is nowhere else to go\nUm you know I'm ... I Will be doing this they hand but I'm not a fan of imminent domain I I I absolutely am not a fan of imminent domain but in the future depending on what happened down there\nThat might be government's only recourse if they were going to expand that is imminent domain and I can't imagine taking somebody's house from 'em to add on to a jail you know that's unfathomable than me so\nYeah and and so there's got to read I'm just as there's still a lot of space in the county it's just trying to find it near a highway I assume and uh you know and if you can sort of you know build court and jail together\nYou're probably going to save some money but as you pointed out Thirty years from now you got to be thinking about where this growth is going to go if you end up with a city at eighty thousand people in the metro of two hundred thousand or you're going to have more inmates just the numbers will go up and\nYou're not going to have as much space you got to find a spot that's going to be that sweet spot and kind of project out where that is going to be yeah\nYeah and you know and I I [noise]\nThat will be I think [noise]\nHard to do um but we do have a piece of ground and we can talk about\nAs it sounds like breaks coming up or music or Rush Limbaugh factor and just a moment\nA Jack johnson as a twin falls county commissioner he's joining us in the studio this morning it's almost seven forty five where at forty five on magic valley this morning on news radio Thirteen ten K.
