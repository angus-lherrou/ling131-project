five seven as to zero eight three one two zero nine five seven\nA reference obviously there too that that they will work with people who are Medicare and Medicaid patients\nWe have a proposition on the ballot in two weeks will know what the results are proposition to honor the Idaho ballot statewide is for the expansion of Medicaid a\nLiberal say that we have to do this because the working poor are caught between a rock and a hard place and don't often have health care although you would think with the improving economy\nIn the state a lot of those people may be and jobs now are they actually have benefits wants more a lot of income has been spilled in mainstream media about this and you'll notice that all of your newspapers around the state are generally on board with it\nAny program that smacks of socialism therefore and yet they will not allow certain people to offer a bottle he and his Eighteen years and the U.S Senate Rick Santorum and he was a senator from Pennsylvania became one of the foremost experts on how these programs\nWork around the country Santorum wrote an editorial a guest editorial what color the column or a commentary whatever you like opinion face and he submitted it for publication here in Idaho in advance\nHe would have felt this get better help the public make a decision that you got to realize he is a conservative Republican so his view is a expansion of this program is probably not going to be good\nHis piece was rejected by the state's newspapers Janice began who's a Republican candidate running for lieutenant governor in Idaho then posted it to her Web site and that's where I came across this\nSantorum says Idaho voters are going to face a choice on election day about an issue that is fraught with emotional and political consequences\nVoters are going to be asked whether to follow thirty four other states and expanding Medicaid or safety net program designed to finance health care for the poor the initiative would allow non disabled childless adults to qualify for Medicaid the program\nComes with a big financial incentive since federal taxpayers will pay Ninety\nPercent of the cost for this Medicaid expansion population because other states already have expanded Idaho can learn from their experiences about the pitfalls of this deal now we keep hearing the supporters say oh well this is a federal money all cost us a thing well I pay federal taxes to buddy\nThe writer Mr Santorum says the federal money doesn't come cheap the study found that every state far surpassed projected enrollment in the first year of expansion of this is from a study by the foundation for government accountability in fact\nThey surpassed projections by an average of Ninety One percent think about that for a moment almost doubled expensive as a result state costs are much higher than projected in Ohio Medicaid expansion ran one and a half\nBillion dollars over budget and its first Eighteen months in Washington state they had to find an additional two point three billion dollars to deal with higher than expected costs with for the deficit expected and the extra costs mean that less money to take care of traditional Medicaid recipients\nFire than expected costs for the deficit expected\nAnd the extra costs means that less money to take care of traditional Medicaid recipients happens especially seniors for children and people with disabilities state spending inevitably is curtailed for public safety transportation education and other needs\nThe Goldwater Institute in Arizona in a state that did expand examine that claim and found Arizona's expansion not only failed to deliver on its promise to alleviate supposed cause burdens on private payers it made it worse\nProponents of expansion said the private plans paid fourteen percent more because of cost\nShifting from the uninsured to those with insurance however the study found cost shifting actually increased after expansion\nWith employers paying twenty seven percent more these people who are providing jobs and now all of a sudden I got to pick up this huge tab\nWhich means they may not hire as many people proponents also claim Santorum rights hospital emergency room use would decline instead utilization has risen as politifact concluded after surveying\nThe experiences of multiple states a no vote the former senator rights to Obamacare as Medicaid expansion doesn't mean voters don't care about the vulnerable in Idaho or that insuring affordable health care is in a worthy goal but there are better solutions he says that would give Idaho more flexibility and new resources\nTo expand coverage the health care choices plant he writes which I Believe Congress will soon consider what led Idaho find\nIts own solutions to help the working poor state would receive a formula grants and gain new flexibility to uproot policies that are more\nAffordable than Obamacare if Idaho votes instead to accept Medicaid expansion taxpayers to privately insured and especially those who need traditional Medicaid would pay an unfortunate price that from a\nFormer Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum\nAre giving us a warning about proposition to and Medicaid expansion in Idaho the problem is you got a lot of people out there and we've been they're being told this has got to be just great there'll be able to walk in and\nIt goes back to that promise it'll just be free don't worry you'll just show up it will be free but again nothing is free and that's the rub it's being and they're trying to embarrass conservatives and Republicans saying if you don't vote for it you're not compassionate\nHe says this is a symbol of rebellion\nIn other words sometimes a symbol of one thing or a hundred and fifty years ago is an entirely\nDifferent representation as assembled today\nWould which and and the people and media should know that you know that there are a lot of symbols out there or they get adopted by various people and you know sometimes I'll give you a good example two thousand years ago the Romans used to now people the trees and then allow them to dangle their and die\nAnd eventually somebody came along and said you know that's going to be the symbol of my God who was crucified that way so it is today if you if you have one hanging around you're not you're not celebrating Romans nailing people to trees you you're telling people you're a Christian\nYou see there's a there's a huge difference from what that originally meant into into why did they ended up becoming it what it represents now\nBut liberals are on\nTo eliminate anything that has a historic nature in this country if they try to rewrite history and I was thinking about the story that broke as a black woman running for governor in Georgia probably not going to win probably they'll have a better chance of\nGetting close to the governor's mansion and let's say Paul that Jordan has an Idaho there's this black woman she burned up a state flag then there's pictures of it it's not an end video it's not a secret back in the Nineteen nineties because the Georgia\nState flag it's a time in one corner had an old stars and bars the Confederate flag\nAnd we say Confederate flag we there are a lot of different Confederate flags there's one though the the old battle flag of the army of northern\nVirginia or that we tend to focus on a and and that's the one that has it gets all of the attention so she she burned the flag and I don't really burning a state flag is probably a say this is burning the American flag and I think a lot of people might understand why she did it she was part of the civil rights effort to eliminate that flag and then eventually\nBy two thousand and three of the state of Georgia dropped it altogether I don't know that it's going to have any impact on the overall election but this is the same woman her staff\nHer staff she's altogether office right now but the state level but her staff went out last year and harassed up up a candidate for public office because he was white simply no no other reason other than he was white so that might imply that perhaps they're\nActually racist she'd also like to eliminate other carvings Stone Mountain Georgia and there was a time when the Klan used to rally outside did they call that as if the you know it's called the Confederate Mt Rushmore and if you look up to watch\nIsn't there carved on the side of a mountain but it it is truly a historical artifact but she'd like to have somebody go up there with a Jack hammer and knock it all down\nSo does is it lake they continually are trying to eliminate history isn't pretty ... that's the point of it I mean sometimes it's good and it's noble but other times it's not\nAnd that's why you still teach it are you supposed to teach it warts and all but these people were like Joel ... all of this\nSo I I how will they ever be able to claim victims status again once they eliminated all evidence that they were victims is that ever crossed their minds apparently not\nSeven forty three fifty one on magic valleys this morning on news radio Thirteen to entail I exit news radio Thirteen tend to calm I remember a story that broke when he was still in politics but George\nAllen junior it was said that he had a a Nazi flag in his home he had a collection of collection of old flags from all sorts of places memorabilia World War two memorabilia but his his his opposition use that to claim that he was a closeted Nazi\nDespite the fact\nThat when he was growing up as a kid and he was helping his dad out with his dad was coaching the rams Redskins or that he was exposed and was very close to a lot of the black players\nBut the left needed that
