environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm\nChip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is I'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans May New we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affect certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nUm there was a researcher out there Michael J. our who categorize these environmentally sensitive people um and what he found was people who are environmentally sensitive have you know long standing allergies chronic pain fatigue migraines fibromyalgia and just an overt sensitivity to light found my\nCity and smells more than maybe me and you do so I could walk into a room and be fine other people could walk into the same room and they smell cologne from all over the place or get ashes [laughter]\nSo these environmentally sensitive people actually way way way more paranormal experiences and the general population um there's those higher it's a really high number\nAnd with the thought is is these environmentally sensitive people are picking up on whether it's ex federal magnetic fields more than the general population in other words they have a battery antenna or biological radio\nAnd the electromagnetic spectrum than other people so we all are we all have radios with basic equipment to tune into things but some people have really really really redefined are sensitive radios are and they're picking up on things in it and detecting things in the environment that normal people don't pick up or the general population doesn't it\nSo this ability to truly experience paranormal phenomenon\nIt's it's more likely to be detected a registered among this group and I think that's a fascinating thing so we have environmental sensitivity which there's a lot of research suggesting obviously it's viable and it's real I think in Canada you can be on disability for certain types of environmental sensitivity\nSo there's science behind it and then there's also sign saying these people are having way more ghostly encounters why is that and then that's kind of where we go a little further into that\nTo some of these people didn't realize how sensitive they are picking up these things do they know they get it\nI I think they do it in and when I go out there and I my research was done I had I talked to a lot of people who are environmentally sensitive\nAnd what you find is you know\nNot only or do they pick up on things or have way more paranormal experiences but it's genetics so their mom did to wear their dad and then their grandma and so forth and so on so this is something kind of like most you know genetic diseases or or what not this kind of passed down from generation\nAnd listen they know they're sensitive to the environment um just by walking into places some people you know like I said get rash\nListen they know they're sensitive to the environment um just by walking into places some people you know like I said get rashes um they can be under neon lights some people almost allergic to electricity\nOr so these types of people just experience a different world and and believe me they know it affects them probably more negatively than it does positively\nYou know you talked about some of the reality television shows brands and my criticism of them\nBecause they always seem that they have to have some kind of goes Leon known or\nBecause it's television and you know they don't want to do their three minute or one hour program and not have anything happen so looks like they create these things and I think that kinda hurts the credibility of some of these ah episodes don't you\nYeah I think yeah I think it it it really does too because it implies that either people or misinterpreting normal things or there's over fraud\nAnd um you know every ... those those people who do this on a regular basis and are genuine do you know out of ten locations that you go to you might have a one experience\nIt's really impossible to have you know thirty or forty experiences every time you go to a location 'cause then it's your money in the waters and I and then you kind of lean towards that that fried type of\nThing so we've we've talked about the individual who might have the ability to spot goes to fuel ghost more than others but what about the ghost itself ... does not come back more often than others or because they have an ability to do that\n[noise] um I think it's really I guess which one is stronger and when you think about it is the person's ability to sense that goes if if I'm really sensitive to it I'm going to pick up goes way encounters a lot more than everyone else\nSo I might pick up on a ghostly encounter a civil war soldier I'm very often if I'm really sense\nI mean a good a good radio or real good radio probably from she crane is the ability to pick up a weak signals from a radio station\n... isn't that much that way with the person that if that person is a receiver he or she may be more apt to pick up these ... things\nExactly yeah exactly so you know ... and ... and that that kind of boils down to the environmental sensitive per se\nUm they're going to have way way way more votes encounters and um so I think it has to do fear prior question I think it has to do mainly with the person not so much that goes for encounter the environment\nBut you have to ask you know hey I'm an environmentally sensitive person I pick up on all this stuff\nYou know I go from place to place to place throughout my day however one location I'm picking up a lot of um having a lot of ghostly phenomenon happened to me um the places pretty active whereas in other places it\nSo then you start asking yourself why why that place and and why not the other places um so then you have to go into why is the location have more um paranormal phenomenon\n... out of the other locations you know it's like those antennas we had the rabbit here was\nYou know why is this configuration picking up channel thirty three and this configuration is that\nYou know what I'm saying you have to figure out the right combination of things that happened for um the TV to show up in a clear picture and the same with ghostly encounters you have to figure out the right sort of ingredients\nAre variables that line up the habit goes to counter location is one person is to um and then there's there's probably other ones that\nLine up the habit goes counter location is one person has to 'em and then there's there's probably other ones that I you know we haven't really identified at this point but the person not only their sensitivity but their\nInternal ... electric a consciousness of all this stuff really plays into it and it's really fascinating to me it\nReally is I remember when my dad brought home a better Tv antenna you know there was the kind that didn't just move with the rabbit ears when it had like a little uh knob on it\nThat you clicked in a broad into signal better that way too and I taught for use this technology amazing how times have changed Brenda\n[laughter] and I remember those two [laughter]\nDo you do or have you come across demonic spirits in your work\nI Know I have it and I get that question a lot though the the theme of question and seems to be getting more and more prevalent in the last five years or so\nI think you know when you have a ghostly counter or you have some sort of phenomenon happened to you it's amazing it's great uh and then you want to start maybe putting labels on it you know this experience what the\nGood the bad with a positive way that this was at that and I think when you start putting negative to it then you start feeling like it's the Arctic ... demonic deem it as more of a religious perspective than it is sort of um\nYou know like a a scientific perspective\nSo usually whoever classified this is a demon or um you know a regular goes\nI think there's more of a religious pills to it um that's why I usually when I meet David knowledge is they're they're very religious as well um\nI think there's a little little that labeling going on to me it's an experience\nUm and some people perceive it as good or bad I might perceive one experience being really positive you might have the same experience to be terrified and the way the negative\nAnd then kind of you go towards more demonic part effect so I I really just enjoyed not joy but I have the experience I research experience and I don't try to put the theme and label on anything\nWell with Brenda ... his book is called
