[noise]\n\n...\nDay\nThese towns in chances do [noise] but\nAs we go you know what they can [noise]\n\nFrom the gateway to the west coast to coast am with George Nouri\nWelcome back to the coast to coast as we continue with the supernatural in a moment are very special guest professor slim king joins us\nTo talk about Harry Houdini for a moment Harry Houdini was a Hungarian born American illusion is stumped performer noted for his sensational escape actually first attracted notice of vaudeville and the U.S\nAnd others here we had ... on a tour of Europe where he challenged police forces to keep it locked up Sunni extended his rump all toward to include chains ropes slung from\nSkyscrapers straight jackets underwater and having to escape from an old his breath and sort of sealed milk can with the water in it Ninety dull for thousands watched as he tried to escape from special ... cups commissioned by London's daily mirror keeping him and suspense for an hour\nAnd another ... buried alive only just able to ... himself to the surface or merge you know the state of near break down\nNow what many suspected that these are scrapes were faked Houdini presented himself as a scourge are fake spiritual is he was obsessed with trying to communicate with his mother and went through all kinds of mediums and people to find her\nBut I think he was had the onset of a appendicitis and when he was hit it actually broke the\nBoston trail that bacteria comes out and just ran through his body\nRight and they had no anti bacterial anything back then in twenty six so he uh had stuck in seven days to die\nWho do you have little substances that what happened\nYes yeah I was a ... so it saps us all through they had two operations\nAnd then they gave him some mysterious serum that they'd been working on but nothing seemed to work\nDuring those seven days he had time to go over this afterlife experiment that he invests it worked out and they'd had it since the early Nineteen hundreds or since before Nineteen Thirteen\nThey had this it's a two way code they worked out if one of them died that they would um uses code contact each other\nAnd so he had a week it took him a week to pass away he was so strong and so they had a week together to fine tune this code and then about two years later she gets uh the actual code from Arthur Ford\nHot as hard to forget the code of a medium ... what happens\nIs Arthur Ford was a trans medium he wasn't like I'm a Marjory I'm you know the er which for ... and\nShe's like was he was he liked Whoopi Goldberg ... in a post\nThat he just goes into he puts on a blindfold and goes asleep okay like like Casey all righty goes into the trench right he just\nGoes into a trans state they have to write down everything that happens and then he read later he doesn't really always remember what goes on attendance subconscious but he consciously doesn't really remember uh all the time what happened so they transcribe these fans\nSo he started having these senses and in one of them he contacted Houdini some other about a year before this and then he starts having these than says and he starts getting the code now the Houdini messages actually in three parts it's one word than a nine words that\nSpell another word and then she it's a two way code\nI'm Beth has five words in French that she says back to him\nNow does that make sense to you or everybody I talked to a Ninety nine percent of them only think of a one way code you have you're on the other side one word or something you're going to get it across and then they're going to know that you're there\nBut Houdini was sharper than that Houdini said listen I'm over on the other side I Want to make sure she gets the code\nThat she's the one who gets\nRight I Want to make its shirts her so she has five words in French that she gets back that come back to him [noise] so this was an ingenious code really it because it's taking the ten it's like Fifteen words well\nWhy why was here we professor obsessed with either trying to come back spiritually who to even let everybody know what was going on\n[noise] well ah as you know Harry had to be first\nHe was a ... a sky apologist he had to be first I don't know if you know that Harry was the first guy to fly an airplane and Australia\nShe was not sure I heard him so\nHe had to be first in a matter of fact he did a great movie called the grim game about that so uh and he did several movies he he was a really multi talented guy\nUm I think he would have been I think he would have had a movie um career mogul yeah how do you survive he invented what they call now the dailies\nUh in in the movie industry he invented that he rushed cuts right\nYes so he was a you know awesome\nAnd all these different ways so he was going to be number one and if he had to come back from the grape to do it he was going to\nDo was going to do it and do you think it was successful\nI I Know with successful I Know that the code and the message that he gave was exactly the same message that they that they had agreed upon you didn't know that for a fact\nComfort professor bass his wife\n... best was in tough shape ... best was pretty depressed that ... you know her husband had died\nAnd bass was um she had developed some what I Would consider bad habits she spent money like crazy and she uh\nWhile he was alive and ask died while he was alive and after\nHe died and so\nIf you remember Nineteen twenty nine when a message came back ah all hell broke loose the none of her\nMagic friends really wanted to believe that in any way and then later in the year the stock market crashes and she loses not only all her friends she loses all her money\nShe was arrested in the stock market yes\nShe loses the majority of her friends the majority of her money and now she's got this bad habit of spending money like a grows on trees she just\nAnd I guess here we left are nice little sum\nYeah he left her a part of the uh they pay double a condemned lady or whatever for his ah\nInsurance insurance the insurance was twenty five thousand dollars\nWhich in Nineteen thirty six that's probably a lot of money that\nRight ... probably that's close to a million dollars um so they doubled that because\nThey said it was an accident because this guy punched him and so it was the insurance company that came up and said ah that can't happen you can get appendicitis from being punched and so they were proven wrong in court\nSo she got fifty thousand so she was rolling in do\nNow and then she they put it all in the market and she lost at all\nNo you have heard of the crash that killed Houdini yes what is the curse\n[noise] know Houdini had a three part show\nThe first part of the show was magic\nThe second part was skipped college easy a scape he would do an escape that was where the water or a Chinese water torture cell or the uh the milk can escape and then the last part towards the end of his career he would go out for the spiritual life and he would have\nHave this um\nConfrontation with them launched himself like confrontation right\n[noise] well at some point in time he would say I've had enough and he would get up during a third part you would go out to a palm reader or something\nWell at some point in time he would say I've had enough and he would get up during a third party would go out to a palm reader or somebody or a [noise]\nA that he considered fake and you would go in there and all the reporters and everybody to be following him and he'd go in and you'd find a couch or something any poll out like an incandescent down that goes in the dark or sometimes the I I don't know that I got you you know and\nAnd they're probably attached to a string or something like that\nRight so uh and of course the the medium sort of just what a what do you do that I didn't I have nothing to do that\nWell they honestly didn't because\nI I'm a magician and a magician always have what you're calling out the way out you work it into your magic trick if you have a magic trick\nYou might have two or three different methods on how it works and there's something else he switched to the next one and you switch the next one and and it works so you're assured of success\nAnd so in his magic that's built in in his escape so of course I'm I guarantee you got two or three keys in there\nYou know and if all that failed and it couldn't get the T that would come out and kiss him and she got the appropriate key in her mouth\nAnd just put it into his mouth\nExactly uh-huh he always had an out he always had a way out well it was the ... the same thing for the spiritual spirituals because he had an agent\nAnd she would go into town and she would find some low hanging fruit she would ah find some a medium that were obviously tricking people but some she couldn't find what they're doing French couldn't catch them\nSo she would pull out something from beneath her clothes and like stuff it into the couch\nAnd so later Houdini I had a sure thing that he could come back and expose them even though they didn't know anything about it\nIt seems as though that somebody somewhere puts a curse on it\nRight so he did this with Marjorie Marjorie was the uh the which from Boston [noise]\nUm hold on for ... seconds a professor we're we're in
