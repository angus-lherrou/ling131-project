really showed even more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools are as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place sort\nOf more than sort of hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em out to publicly think Alan he's the one that pointed out to me that the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition inflation I already knew that the more you subsidize the lungs especially the taxpayer on the hook\n'em it's going to crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total that his college dead OK I already knew the doping that hypothesis but now there's one thing that I wanted to mention and that is that the I'm a conservative everyone knows\nThat I'm the guy that almost won I lost a four to three split decision in the shadow case I'm pro life pro gun I'm a sport right conservative it as Rush Limbaugh and most of it's not even the liberals want a free hand out okay but the college tuition is technically and legally attacked because it's money go into an arm of the state government college and were being over tax\nThat don't are liberal as a matter of fact the private colleges about ten times when you adjusted for inflation what it was back in the fifties and here's the thing okay we spend a lot of money on our military and it it's too much really we spent all in you know even as a conservative we spend a lot of money on Social Security\nBut we can only cut those things a little bit\nThe on the third or fourth thing is probably the tax dollars are being used to make er Yankee college loans and we don't need to spend any money of that not only does it put the tax dollar on the hook\nAnd it's going to crash the dollar like Greece or Venezuela Georgian and I'm Alan by the way I'm Alan was good enough to make me the leader of the Florida group and\nI Hope I'm he's gotten on an equal talking a little too much in this and I\nI Know the reason is here's the deal OK almost ten percent of the tone that his college dead and it's going to crash the dollar that the only thing if we get rid of that you would let him get a credit card out okay with the loans but let them get a credit card it'll save the tax dollar and it'll save the student is college will drop like a rock\nAnd the I I look I Love my rates man 'cause I'm a conservative and they provide jobs in hospitals and police who can hear it can get and I and I would vote for Trump if I had a chance to get but look if he can get bankruptcy repeatedly for millions in bailout can handouts\nAnd if all these rich banks and these colleges can get the rent on the students looking here that that that that\nThose are the two beneficiaries here and\nThen okay and they usually served All right we got your point there Gordy Allen\n[noise] you know I I have a lot there but\nOkay and they use these are All right we got your point there already Allen\n[noise] you know I I he said a lot there but I appreciate all those points and he's exactly right\nYou know if we can throw seven trillion dollars into Afghanistan and Iraq I\nThink we can throw maybe a trillion or so at the student loan problem but but more importantly from conservative point of view you know if the government was to drop out of the lending system tomorrow I think on balance that would probably be\nA good thing it would return prices back down to rational levels uh and you know it would it would um really clean out a lot of the sort of socialistic\nUh nonsense that's been allowed allowed to creep into the system ... but ... but in particular it would it would lead to lower price as\nLong as you do with all the debt right now Alan would you are just a white could clean\nWell I Will say that if at a minimum bankruptcy protection is or not restored so that people can go to a judge and according to the wisdom of a judge I'm settled that debt according to their means if that does not happen\nThen we're looking at something like a full on jubilee soon you know the Democratic and I'm a nonpartisan guy but I Will say that uh the Democratic socialist particularly in New York are starting to win elections on the promise of canceling all student debt\nAnd [noise] you know I don't think that is maybe the best solution because there are you know forty percent of the people are out there are able to successfully repay their loans but that is exactly what we're looking at very soon if at a minimum a the bankruptcy writes that the founders demanded aren't returned\nWhen you do have salaries and teachers' salaries and things that you have to keep the university going which should be reasonable right\n[noise] yeah that's right um you know my best estimate is that the colleges are so flush with cash right now there are so badly overcharging their students by and large\nThey could probably suffer eighth thirty percent if not forty percent reduction in the student loan income that they are currently receiving and still be able to keep their doors open not have to lay off one person a and you know be able to service all the students that they do today\nSo I think there was a lot of capacity there for price reduction in academia\nUm so yeah I mean ending the student loan program tomorrow would I agree probably be pretty devastating to a lot of schools [noise]\nUm but certainly there's got to be a middle ground you know and with bankruptcy back with the department of education having to contend with the same bankruptcy laws that every other Linder has to contend with\nA that would go a long ways towards compelling them to crack the whip on the schools to lower their prices improve their quality and decrease the amount of time that the students are having to stay in school now to get a degree\nFirst time caller mark in Provo, Utah Marco ahead\nWell George you said they can't or they don't force you to take student loans but when I started school I was on a full scholarship they even pay for my books but the federal government makes you go to the student loan counseling so I went\nAnd I told the lady I'm I don't know why I have to even be here among full scholarship and she told me Will Hunting if I were you I Would borrow as much as you can put it in the bank and earn interest on\nIt oh boy I Would love to sue her this\nDid you end up doing that oh yeah and then life happens the money disappears yeah you know over fifty thousand dollars just in interest on my student loans and loan balance is a hundred and three thousand dollars a gallon ever paid off I Will die owing money do they harass you mark\nDidn't loan balance is a hundred and three thousand dollars a gallon Heather paid off I Will die owing money do they harass you mark [noise]\nNo I'm right now they've got me on some ridiculous thing where uh my payment is zero [noise] um I did a double major in a minor and some point I did need student loans but uh the irresponsibility um I just I I Would have never tasted that crack had she not pedaled it\nTo me actually exactly well what do you think Yellen these loans are\nPushed on the students way ahead of any scholarship or any other um any other aid that where you don't have to pay it back I mean the college and some of the colleges are making money on these loans by the way they're they're making these loans and then reselling them\nA private banks and so the colleges are in on the action as well and it's just it's it's just disgusting [laughter] you know I might actually add um the repayment program that that a mark is on a is probably the income based repayment program\nSo a bunch of government programs out there that sound like they are forgiveness program so there's public service loan forgiveness ... income based repayment but what all everybody out there needs to know\nIs that all of these programs are failing the vast majority of people who try out for them so we now know that the success rate for the public service loan forgiveness program where you\nWork for a you know if you work in a college or a hospital at a nonprofit get your loans forgiven only about point three percent of the people trying for that forgiveness are actually getting it\nSo the rest are being disqualified and they're being left owing far far more so mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments well interest continues to accrue on that loan so so that loan is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about ten percent chance\nThat mark will make it through to the end of that I be our program\nAnd actually get the loan for given a and I might add that any amount for given under the I'd be our program is taxable income so you were twenty five years\nYou get a nice little thing in a sense of the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals or probably even exceeds the amount that you were originally borrowed [noise]\nSo the federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that has you know seeking to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a day\nI was gonna say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was [laughter] ironically was bankers that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and uh many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nUh they have no public a benefit the inspiration they jettison all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many years ago\nNow and we're gonna come back and take final goals with you in just a moment here and coast to coast am [noise]\nThank God I found out on time no bank I don't eat that program or insurance protects you hold tight lock will\nFor pennies today how tight lock puts a barrier around

E. R. dot com\n[noise]\n\nAnd we'll come back this is our final segment with Alan ... as we talk about these student loans scam Ellen are the student loans that are out there now hurting or helping the economy\n[noise] [noise] well I I think it's clear that it's hurting the economy at this point\nUh you know interest alone on one point five trillion dollars more than Ninety billion dollars a year\nOr so that money that gets taken away from home purchases a you know business formation a auto ... you know other ... big ticket items that improve the economy [noise]\nUh so certainly is hurting in that respect a and you know it's it's also hurting in a number of ways that are really harder to quantify you know when you've got forty four million people\nA straddle there's you know strapped under ... this these sort of debt levels typically the sort of oppressive type of debt [noise] um this really can make people do bad things um you know make people do things for money that they wouldn't otherwise do\nI'm also forces a lot of people into the underground economy a and certainly those people pay no taxes and and et cetera so so it's really hurtful in many ways that are maybe not a parent or to the naked eye\nLet's go to Paul Fresno, California to get things started here west of the Rockies ball go ahead sir\nHey I'm very grateful you take my call thank you very much George Allen I'm graduated from college two thousand Fifteen just before it closed down [noise]\nI'm I'm One of those fortunate case who are at one point three to aloe was talking about that actually got um most cars that were given I uh got thirty four thousand thirty seven thousand that I got you know that I owed forgiven\nWow how'd you do that and regulations and\nI appreciate that thank you\nWell I I did a little bit of an hour away um [noise] there's something called a the findings and what that is is that like a lifting of\nPretty much like a course of your book or a trait that trade you chose yeah and what it is is um if it of course ... uh the reason they're in the situation is because they falsified job place where it\nSo if you are from a certain time period to a time period at the end of the school I'm pretty much that's when they committed a that broad so it actually took me from\nI Would have to say December two thousand Fifteen to around August of two thousand and fixing to get it all but given what I did is I actually will Kamala Harris email um she surprisingly bonded um but the the avenue that I went to get all that ... had to write a cover letter I'm\nI submitted a pretty much with a cover letter I had to put a bloody awful and I had to pretty much just a political out there what I'd gone through a ... at the summit transcript\nHad to uh a cover letter transcripts and pretty much all the information that I actually had to prove that I went to college\nYeah it was the fraud that got it reduced I guess right\nAh yes so that's one of the main things I put there because if you see many of the hill college commercials whipping they problem with this life long job placement assistance [noise] so what how I false\nAdvertising you exactly so when the schools shut down there goes your fall on the job place there goes your life long drop like what if the right you got that right or interesting Alan isn't it\nThat you know and that's a good point and I maybe I should have brought up a at some other potential there is some breaking news now where if you went to particularly for many of the for profit colleges they get caught lying just like the just like Paul mentions\nSo they'll misrepresent their job placement rates and you know say oh you know average earnings for your degrees this much and\nThere actually is a rule that was put in place by the Obama administration where\nIf your school ... you then at least on paper you have available to you an avenue called defense to repayment where you\nAt least theoretically you can get your loans cancelled and I\nI think I'm Paul is probably one of the very lucky few that has seen does work successfully for him [noise] ah but I Will say that even just yesterday I'm One of the federal court struck down an attempt by the department of education to\nSort of delay and slow walk this this program so as it stands now today there's a bit more hope for people who are light to buy their colleges are then there was a a couple of days ago um now I Can't say for sure what the results of this will be\nBecause believe me the department of education has no desire or intentions of forgiving anybody's loans if it doesn't absolutely have to uh you know under gunpoint practically by the legal community but [noise]\nUm but there is a bit more hope today than there was before so you you were lied to by particularly for profit college or you may may may possibly have some avenue for record snow\nSo you know with all these credit card fraud that's out there and just credit slot indeed I mean if you get a letter from a collection agency for some day you don't even remember could be yours maybe it's ten Twenty years old if you ask them for a copy of the ... and they don't provided to you they're up a creek aren't they\n[noise] well that's right and similarly for student loans we find a lot of a private loans the underlying note uh well first of all the loan has been bought and sold so many times that whoever says they owned the note actually does not owned the note and they have no business collecting on that loan I'm\n... now there are other there are some avenues that the lenders can go to they can say that the note was lost and they have other avenues to prove that is a valid note but that certainly is something to be aware of\nAnd I should also say people who have private student loans are not federal student loans they do have statutes limitations so somebody comes up you Twenty years hands and starts demanding money from you for a private loan than almost certainly that loan is not\nLittle suspect little area\nSuspect um and you want to look into the statute of limitation laws that govern that particular alone depending on where you live or where he took up alone\nAnd it's going to patent Minneapolis east of the Rockies Hi Pat go ahead\nI worked in a Social Security office for a while and I figured out that at ... at least one of the agenda is\nIs the destruction of the Social Security program because there are families with co signers\nOf grandparents parents and students none of them are ever going to get any thoughts as security forum on a question and I think Justin alright if I own a house and co signed on one of these student loans\nIs that does that lean on my house so that when I die and fit in my ear is getting at it's collected for a for a student loans\nThat goes to the lone first doesn't it\nThat's a yeah that's a great question um to her first point\nYes Social Security wages are being garnished as we speak for student loans and what is even more disturbing I see legislation out there right now it hasn't passed yet\nBut I see legislation out there right now which offers a loan forgiveness in ah in return for people for going their Social Security when they when they reach retirement age uh so there are so\nIn DC very busy trying to figure out how to take away Social Security benefits down the road from student loan borrowers\nInteresting is that what did you have what are those who joined families\nAlready where multi generation the grandparents the parents and the kids are never going to get any Social Security but my question is that if you have if you want to help the students\nAnd tear ability you write a check to the school or a money order or travelers check or whatever and when

what he says in these sorts of situations only as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't\nFrankly we don't even know where the eight tip is still an ongoing project I I think people like who Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission\nIt's still continues he of course all though he's resigning from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going now other people I think have disputed that and certainly we have been told that the\nFunding plug it has been polled well I was on his head so it doesn't matter you can continue approach jak\nWith you know using can count on resources which is absolutely\nTrue but you know it is it is a mystery what do I do suspect that's happened is if it is\nStill an extent program it was probably changed twinkles again this is typical government um alphabet soup\nTerritory we're not even a hundred percent sure about the name of of a tip Lou has said it said phones aerospace threat identification program a Pentagon press officer said one time it's advanced aviation\nA threat identification program and then we learnt that\nWas a tip them in part from another program called advanced aerospace weapon system application program so it's it's an absolute nightmare to try and\nFind out what the things even cold let alone whether it's still running and and you know that you're dealing with some pretty secretive stuff when they weren't even come clean about the name of the the program\nThe course of course is still interested in all of this is he still funding a lot of projects\n[noise] again we don't know and the problem is that um we we know that the Robert Bigelow guard I'm ... I was going to say through through um his his friendship with Senator Harry Reid but that's not\nThat's not entirely correct and I don't want to do him a disservice hair he beat for the tip contract quite quite openly and legitimately and through the the the standard contractual\nProcedure and he going to a large chunk of that I tip work but of course justice the the government requires that people\nHe'd go on a large chunk of that hey tip black but of course justice the the government requires that people sign their their secrecy oh it's\nSo Robert Bigelow and and um his organization\nHad everyone on the moon disclosure agreements so actually the people involved in this work what kind of um stone twice so to speak they had they had to have government security clearances but also the commercial non disclosure\nAgreement so so again there is a lot of this story that we don't know and that's the other thing in in aliens at the Pentagon and I've seen a lot of\nYou know you pick up the the media um you reports of this you go on to the blog some forums you see a lot of speculation\nI was always taught at the ministry of defense you know when I was doing analyst where for example in briefing you must always differentiate between ... you know and what you're saying\nAnd that's not a skill that everyone practices when they they make films documentaries but I Try to be rigorous on that and and we don't even speculating I say I'm speculating on when I'm not I'm not so\nHopefully even though there are large parts of the story we still don't know I'm only ... where we don't know that these things\nAnd what's the bottom line you know\nI I didn't want to I I don't want to get too far into spoiler [laughter] I I think one one thing that I can say which I think it's a pretty good summary of of what I think has gone down [noise]\nIs it I Would say their flaws\nAnd I use that would deliberately I Believe a faction if I can call it died within the U.S government and some of those people were permanent employees\nAnd some with ... and this believe a function who the phenomenon was I salute the rail and and they were to write and that of course\nDidn't entirely know what to think of it did not rule out the possibility that they were dealing with something extraterrestrial paranormal\nAnd actually then I Believe a faction became or or certainly interacted with overlapped with with a tip [noise]\nAnd they effectively I I guess gotten the chance to use those those beliefs and those hypotheses\nWithin government we've taxpayers' money and and that of course gives us in an interesting opportunity to find out about the asked because and I hope we'll we'll have time to get into this late but there is now of course talk of congressional hearings to to get to the bottom of this but\nBut the bottom line to answer your question is is that I think there was a believer function they made them move they came up against some road blocks couple of different road blocks one right bolt was simply going to a point where you know they they looked at this and\nAnd they investigate it but because they didn't get a definitive on so the feeling was that they taking it as far as as they couldn't what else can you do the other sort of wrote blow up but they had this is very controversial is they have\nA cold is a religious road block from from some see any of ...\n... is they have a cold is a religious road block from from some senior people in the Pentagon who frankly for the UFOs from the paranormal with demonic and therefore didn't didn't think what we should be having anything to do that\nWell what do we\nDo or do we want anything to do is oh well I mean um it it was studied whatever the it was but I I as I say that there were people in the Pentagon and probably ... who who is deeply conservative religious\nBeliefs lead them to think that that they are dealing with that they don't make a demonic phenomenon here might come up I've come up again and that's a couple of times in in the u._k. as well at the ministry of defense in fact one of\nOne of my bosses was I'm a ... you know they're pretty extreme with the S.\nAnd indeed the the individual who wrote the detoxify\nIntelligence assessment on on UFOs in the ministry of defense code name project called nine he without one week to go to go too far down that road he had some play the old beliefs as well and there's a passage in the Bible\nIn the ... so I think it is where it refers to cite as being the presence of the power of the air and black I think he's where a lot of these conservative religious people get the idea of the UFOs might be demonic\nAnd there were a lot of religious folks Nick that believe that\n[noise] [noise] yes and I think it it's frustrating in a sense because and and it's almost ... combing clay ironic in another way that ... you know you have a bunch of people\nIn in the cod that the IRA elsewhere and and in the u._k. and the ministry of defense you got a bunch of people who thought yeah this we're dealing with a real phenomenon\nAnd we should be investigating it researching it ... scientific manner and we come up against skepticism you might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect\n'em ... that skepticism isn't the sort of Nicole or intellectual\nOr humanists skepticism but I think most people\nI associate with that concept it's actually it's a deep probably trying to believe a trip and skepticism itself I mean it to to have effectively was so cold UFO skeptics in the Pentagon um\nSay that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things demonic quality just in one sense it's swapping one arguably fringe belief\nFor another so we'll at least by these people when skeptics told they will believe those but they would you believe us in some some great Warren having with angels and demons\nMagic valleys first choice for users are drawn already
