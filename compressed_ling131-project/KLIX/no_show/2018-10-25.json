they're not lying whatever happened to them both of them on under hypnosis separately to the same story and they they believe whatever they saw happened to them\nAnd he said based on that I cannot say what happened but I can tell you they aren't lying to me in a what an amazing story\n... ... we have to remember that the doctor Simon ran a facility for three thousand shell shocked war veteran yes

nearly fell off of my chair I spent three years in Syria biblical studies\nI Know the scriptures and when I saw that I'm telling you right now I couldn't reconcile that I just couldn't believe what I was seeing and there it is\nAnd again don't take my word for it if if you're out there listening I get a hold of a King James Bible or punch it up on line and you'll see it for yourself\nYou if you go and look at your own Bible a hundred and fifty seven year old one yeah we'll we'll let's say the walls\nAbsolutely and I've taken pictures of it and it's there that is what it is bizarre George it's I have no ax the only explanation and I still don't understand it and I have it in the in the new book the only\nThing that I can take over this\nPerhaps this is linked to CERN which is the Large Hadron collider\nWhich was French boy yes in the work they're doing I Believe they're opening up portals she dimensional doorways\nI mean I I remember as a kid the lion lays down with the lamb\nYes then if you can get Tom Didi or somebody to punch up for you and show you on screen what I'm saying and you'll see for yourself and it's shocking it's really shocking to see it because anybody\nWho is heard that scripture you know it by heart it's one of the most popular scripture than the entire Bible and now it says the world\nCan you find it anywhere where it says the lion lays down with the lamb or is it just isn't the wool over the place\nIt is the wolf ate in every Bible now however a friend of mine\nUh he has a YouTube channel ah ah his name is Chris and I thank you very much for finding this for me he actually found him and his YouTube channel is a become one that can see\nHe actually ... thousand something for me out of an older encyclopedia of biblical encyclopedia and he found the passage with the lion and the ... that is the only place that you will see it as something that had it will be in my new book stranger than fiction\n[noise] and that's it everything else George says the wolf\nI Wonder if it's going to change if you look at it every day for example in one day it's going to change to the ... some ah\nOh it wouldn't surprise me one bit and further\nAnd change what happened the last ...\nThe Lord's Prayer is our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name kicking them come that it will be done on earth as it it's going to happen give us a stared at him forgive us for trust passes as we forgive those who to trust pass against us for the latest nodded the temptations deliberately made will for the kingdom and the power and the glory forever more right you've heard that a million\nDollars of cocaine it's changed now so now it's our father which are in ... and I never heard it like that yep how it came to come I Will be done in earth in or near\nNew Year's as in or do you live in or the is there some\nThing that changes nice things\nYeah and I do believe without really knowing the answer and even if I saw it in front of my face I don't know I wouldn't know what I was looking at\nAh but I Do believe that it is sun and these the wave quantum computers that are working in concert and I think that it's er and that opens up the for all and it sees the wave computers\nSomehow some way whether it is some way as crazy as all of this sounds I assure you it's true that they have this ability to go back whether it's going back in time and changing this\nI don't know but I can assure you of this for anyone out there who would say oh well\nThis is just the Bible's that or you know they make these changes coming off the printing presses and all that I'm Sorry I'm Talking about a hundred and fifty seven year old Bible that has changes in at a Bible this fit in my possession for years\nThat has changes in it now so that can't be resolved we be in human understanding we can't resolve that\nAnd another thing that I find very interesting is that the Lord's Prayer I have it on paper and a frame on my wall that was changed to what I just told you [noise] ah but yeah I have the Lord's Prayer it's carved in a stone in my home\nAnd that is not changed and it has not been changed so it's interesting to note\nThat what ever this technology is apparently it cannot make changes on something that is in stone border of some type of metallic substance or something like that another bizarre thing George\nOr do you have any Roman numeral clocks in your home or do you have a watch with Roman numerals\nYeah I think I Do I think I have a couple of watches what that\nOkay well I Want you to look at this the Roman numeral Nichols and it all turned upside down ...\nWhat is what has happened to them\nThat this this effect has now turned them opposite so they're upside down now so where you would see a in the five o'clock position\nYou know that would look like a of V. that's now turned upside down to where it looks like in a weird\nAnd again for anyone who thinks that this is crazy talk just look at your watches or your clocks and and and another ... and I've taken photographs of this as well and people from all over the world are noticing this\nAnd and other interesting thing I have some watches with Roman numerals that have been affected and changed yet I have a clock a Roman numeral clock\nOn my wall it might have living ... that have like metal hands for the a Roman numerals and that has not been changed\n... you know we're going to have are in school back on our website as we get some new software and I'll be blunt\nAnd I would love to pull people on the lion lays down with the play 'em and see how many people say that they agree that's what it was and then compare it to the statistics are you arguing that show the overwhelming people would say that it is that it was low lying lays down with the lamb\nNo question about it I mean the offers ridiculous it doesn't fit there's no way when you say that it just\nIt makes no sense George when you look at it it just looks so uh it's not right now let me ask you the [noise] the the ... you're familiar with the\nDrug Enforcement Administration\nWell it's interesting that you say that because it was known as the drug enforcement agency that's why they were ... agent and now it is the drug Enforcement Administration\nWow why ... see I've always thought of it is that we're going to come back with more built you know the moment on coast to coast am your phone
