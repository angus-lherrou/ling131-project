example someone phones you and you're thinking about that person then you say oh you must be ... I was just thinking about you where he does what does that very common\nUm and I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or the ... cents but a lot of people are interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic grown out there in the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better at it than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important\nCertain people are better at it than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they're paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families [noise]\nUm yeah that's true someone who say let's say well my mother or my grandmother had that ability\nIt seems to come more from the female side doesn't it\nThat's right that's right yeah I in fact I had a great a great aunt had an experience where she\nFell asleep and she woke up and she said have rather had died he was living in another country and shortly afterwards she found out yet to vet he died while yet but I mean it does happen to men as well and I suspect that men don't talk about as much as women do [noise]\nBut you know people talk about a woman's intuition so it does seem to have that connotation that it's more common and women him I think that's probably true plus the fact that women are more likely to talk about it than men are\nDo you think Dr these psychic experiences are from the brain or outside of the brain\n[noise] I Would say both I Would say that they are sort of um cooperation between what's going on on different levels are different dimensions and these experiences a protest in the brain\nSo for example if you take the example of an out of body experience which I have had myself and it was just completely spontaneous and I was quite young\nI had one at eleven I've never been able to duplicate it again but it was one of the strangest wonderful little ... I've ever had I mean are there I was bouncing on the ceiling\nMay looking at my body and bad I had stayed home from school I never miss school but I had a fever that day and I didn't go with my mother said uh\nGeorge you don't go stay in bed\nAnd I I took a nap and I woke up again in this time I was looking down at myself I thought it was a dream Matty are at that point it's lamb ... back into my body and I woke up I was jarred uh\nI'm eleven years old I don't know what the heck happened to me now but eventually I got my way into a library you know weeks later\nShe has stumbled into the um psyche grown section I guess and found a book on astral projection and sure enough I said that's what happened to me but I've not been able to do it since then at least in my awake moments\nWell in my case also with the ... it was completely spontaneous I wasn't trying to do it I didn't know anything about it\nUm I just like you I just find myself floating on the feeling letting down at my body and that that you know there there are ways to produce and out of body experience how there was a neurologist in Montreal Dr Robert Penn field was able to his mapping out the different areas of the brain\nAnd he if he put on a pickle stimulation on the right temperature attacks he was able to produce and out of body experience [noise]\nThat that doesn't call me the out of body experience originates in the bay and that tells me that the that ... will protests the out of body experience\nUm and you know the types of out of out of body fences we had was quite straightforward\nUm they weren't complicated but some people as you say it can be called astral projection around novel people can leave not just their their body but they can leave the room they can leave their house you know they can actually traveled to different locations\nAbsolutely now do you find that to the people who tend to have these kinds of experiences are believers in the paranormal or not\n[noise] I'd say no not at not it\nBecause when this happened to me I certainly wasn't a believer I didn't even know such a thing with possible [noise] and I've just kind of learned about the paranormal as I go along and as I have these experiences\nUm another strange experience I had when I was a student um when I was Nineteen years old and has the second year medical student at the U.S Rajiv exam the night before the exam and when I went to the exam the next day the first question on the exam at the same as the first question in my green\nToss you have the answer that you knew\nExactly so I felt like that dream helped me past my exam but I didn't tell anyone about it because it seems so unbelievable in fact if someone had told me that story I probably wouldn't have believed that\nThe name of the book is called the borders of normal with the subtitle a clinical psychiatrist you by the way these stigmatized says paranormal phenomena tell me about the book\nWell one of the reasons I wrote this book is you know as I say in the subtitle I'm trying to de stigmatize paranormal phenomena\nBecause what I found and this is my own experiences raw when people have these experiences they tend not to talk about them because they think people are gonna think they're weird or their stranger there's something wrong with him or they're losing their mind is something like that\nBut I'm trying to say that a lot of people have these experiences is quite normal to have these experiences I mentioned that the word heron or ... for example the ... pero mean beside so we have paralegals working beside lawyers have paramedics Paralympics and so on\nThe parent normal I mean beside normal it does mean abnormal\nAnd there is still to this day a lot of stigma attached to talking about these phenomena and I find when I give her reading or if I give a talk somewhere people come up to me afterwards and share with me things that have happened to them which they've never told anyone\nSo I'm trying to make it more acceptable for people to talk about these things and that was really what motivated me to read the book\nDid you ever come across research from a psychiatrist who has died named Dr ... curricula\nNo I'm not familiar with\nHim or her oh her in a it was my aunt and she was she went to a Oxford University and she got her degree in psychiatry yet and specialized in all kinds of things and then decided\nShe was giving all that up to study telepathy and when that's all she did she wrote a couple of books one was called breakthrough the creativity\nOr but she was convinced totally convinced that a lot of the was the real deal and and again the psychiatrist seen that and so you're the only only other psychiatrist I Know\nThat has really jumped into this\n[noise] I don't know I'd like to look for that ... that sounds very interesting breakthrough to creativity I'm definitely gonna look for it but you know they're being on a written by physicians but near death experiences for example even Alexander ... who's with having the up\nAnd he's a neurosurgeon and marry the Neal she loved to have it in back to the north and the the surgeon and of course Oliver Sacks he's in ... he wrote a book called her these nations so physicians have written about the things that I haven't found another attack as to who's written about paranormal\nYeah you're going to enjoy that I mean she she just do the the devoted her entire career to that uh she uh she passed away in a very bizarre way she was in the bath tub in a\nRadio filled in their own no I Hope to God I wasn't listening to my show no you that's terrible it was just oh I'm well how does he get so interested in philosophy she just always was\nSo it had happened to her and she just decided to do something to do this and she's going to study it and she she went into it in a big way\nWell that's good well I Know there's been some studies done on telepathy at my monitor his medical center in New York where they were studying dream telepathy the ability to transmit information to people who are dreaming and in that study they had Sanders and receivers\nAnd the receiver it's we're in a sleep lab\nAnd they were hooked up to ... to ... G could measure what we call REM sleep rapid eye movement\nAnd then once the ... state the Centers for giving random images and they were told to concentrate on those images I Try to send them to the receivers and they found that people were more susceptible to lead to telepathy when they're asleep and it's also true that people are more\nSusceptible to a lot of the when they're under hypnosis so there are ways to augment telepathy but in my case and in most people's cases it just happened spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to take a quick break we'll be back with the more Dr mini majors with those his book the borders of normal\nStudents ... new renewable coast to coast am is now
