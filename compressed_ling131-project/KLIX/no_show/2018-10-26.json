entity that was giving instructions I can describe it and see to you as a very thin\nVery white pale entity I couldn't see your face all I Know with very skinny it had a very long fingers\nHow many I don't know how many fingers that had it could have had five it could have had three I just remember one finger because I had the feeling that it was touching me with one finger and it just freaks me out in the rain\nI remember the environment being very luminous very white almost to where he was squinting your eyes\nBut I remember that being listened to the strangest thing about it\nI was standing before it it was sitting in a very large thrown like chair but it was so then it seemed like a rope would've just dangling from mid air with Whoopi arms and it was just really creepy ...\nYou've had this as a repeating dream yes\nAnd the ... that you were describing needs stream center is it possible that this very white being is in fact a reptile a snake\nI got more that it was

through it\nWhen I Lived in Florida when I was a kid we lived there for a short time in Jacksonville and I was always outside and I loved collecting animals and things like that but there are a huge praying mantis as they would hang out on the bushes and the same boat arms and the shape of its neck and its body\nAre you standing in front of this praying mantis lie\nYou standing in front of it and it is in some sort of a crouched are sitting position\nI wanted to say at the city position because like I said this big huge thrown like chair that it's heated that it's very very very large\nAnd so this is perhaps an eight foot tall praying mantis\nIt possibly could be\nAnything specifically coming into your head from it as you stand there\nI think I can smell it I think it smells like rotting wood or something to that nature like the fence until the nose\nDo you have a sense that there's any kind of closing or garment\nNo I don't think there was any clothing\nAnd the caller that is this praying mantis in front of you\nVery pale almost like a die you know Gary pale\nAnd there are praying mantis says that can be white\n... I don't think I've ever seen when\nDo you see anything in the eyes\nI don't remember the ... it's almost as if I couldn't look at them I think I was terrified to look at them but I had a feeling that this entity was in ... something to me because I wasn't a grade\nIt was almost like it was getting the instructions very strange I don't remember a voice it was almost as if it would tell a path ethic\nAnd the the being the praying mantis essence seem to be growing like a pure white\nIt wasn't glowing had modeled skin but it was very white you could tell that it had a lot of texture\nYou know if it was why it had like old I Would say you know how they would be like model skin like someone who had black holes are almost like an albino salamander skin\nIt sounds like you're describing every Chilean skin not a praying mantis skin\nWith texture was like that yeah\nBut the swarm was like a praying mantis insect\nThat's how I Would describe it because of the arms they were disappointed and they were long that you could tell that they were joining could very strangely as I reach puberty\nI remember I started having a lot of growing pains\nAt one point I did find a spot on my groin and it was like a puncture area that western I've just had the ... that maybe they were doing something with me to recover or um or something\nBased on everything that you have experience with the praying mantis what would you speculate could be humming further\nI think everything is speeding up now\nSomething about to happen that's the feeling I get I get this feeling of urgency I get this feeling of

Charles hazard and other even mailers who are saying that this is not the only person last night on my YouTube channel I had a dialogue with my audience\nAbout has anybody whether they were in a duck the an experience or meditate or had they had any insights about water a lot of water affecting the planet between now and twenty twenty six\nAnd that was a year that had been presented to me by a real whistle blower this is a science we said that he had worked on a project having to do with this exact time period between twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty six\nIn which there could be some either a natural cycle or something that is going to now it's like what Charles hazard when he was saying I feel like it has to do with the rotation of the earth that there's going to be like a shift or a jolt\nAnd that it would cause tsunamis in tremendous amounts of flooding and I have had now several emails I'm going to be doing stories on them\nAbout exactly this kind of thing and raising the question could there be a natural strange cycle\nInteracting with planets in our solar system that could relate to know is flood that has written about in genesis\nAnd that is how woven and a complex\nAll of this seems to be going that every single question is leading to answers that people are raising more issues and scientists are also coming forward and saying that they have information
