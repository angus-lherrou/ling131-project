protection against evil forces and I want people to listen to that very carefully because we're apt to overlook familiar things we're apt to overlook simple things\nIf you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there is an esoteric and a cult dimension to the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt really had to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of scientists from cyclical research to quantum theory rising we have made the determination over the past eight years\nThat time is not what we think it is linear time as basically a very powerful illusion that we use\nTo organize our lives and it's a necessary illusion but if it's an illusion that means that we are selecting events all the time from across in and finish to to possibilities so I don't use the term manifest I use the term select\nAnd you can select events under the right circumstances within exquisitely focused and the motive Lee charged thought and that's what's going on we are selecting and the same way that when you take a measurement and the particle lab you're very decision to take that measurement will affect what you experience the same is true in our life\nCan you use these powers to affect your health\nWithout question and and I have to emphasize that we live under lots of laws and forces or one of them is a lot of physical declined one of them as a law mortality there's never been an exception to that but one must never feel that you're without devices that year without tools\nIn the book I write about extraordinary cases of spontaneous remission of diseases which doesn't mean that is going to happen to people all the time I Would never extend false hope but the cases are there the occurrences are there and we have to probe and look at these things very often they correlate with intensive\nA meditation people who have meditative three hours a day have recorded instances in the medical literature of remission of diseases not all the time but it has occurred\nYou say that when you were writing the book or something weird happened with the rock band the monkeys\nOh it was one habit on George talk about us all being loose in time a couple of summers ago I was getting into the music of the monkeys just completely out of the blue and my wife thought I was going nuts my kids were memorizing\nThere I Would think you were going nuts yes you would think no one could imagine what they did have a few good songs\nDid they had some beautiful pop songs [laughter]\nAnd I was playing them all the time I was getting into them everybody thought I was going crazy I couldn't figure out why I was getting into the monkeys George it was months and months later that I got a call from an editor at the Washington Post who said to me do you know Mike Nesmith who was one of the members of the monkeys I said no\nHe said that you know Nesmith just wrote a memoir and I said no and he said did you know he was a Christian Scientists which is a a a a healing and and mentally based um a form of spirituality I said no he said well we'd like you to in a a review Nesmith a memoir\nOf course I'm interested in I told him this story of how month before without any for thought about any of this\nI started getting into the monkeys and I actually put this into the review and the Washington Post to its credit included this material that was just the weird thing that it was almost like retro causality in a way whereas if I was loose\nFor money or time this is why I'm saying that time is not what we think it is I was completely prepared for that opportunity because for reasons that no one could understand I was getting into the monkeys but the reason seemed to be off in the future so to speak but my contention is it wasn't the future it's that everything is happening all around us at once\nWhich is why mental focus is so effective\nI was sixteen when the monkeys started playing with\nThat right in a long long time ago and if I remember one of the members was Mickey Dylan's that's right who played circus boy on television right that's\nRight and and still touring still touring\nHere who is still going that's absolutely nuts I Love them [laughter]\nDo you know the name ... gallon burger money chance I don't ... wrote a couple books one called liquid luck oh of course All right I Know the book and okay he he would conduct experiments still does in Las Vegas with groups of people mhm any which is\nTrying to prove that positive thinking in the mind has a lot to do with influencing things that happen that's Ryan and he is totally convinced and he's convinced me too\nThat if you go into a situation like Las Vegas upbeat and you know just you know positive about things\nThe odds are really high you're going to win\nYes and you know what's so fascinating about that is that outlook has been validated by Syria CSP research my hero J. B. Ryan pioneered scholarly ESP research at Duke University in the early Nineteen thirties J. B. is now deceased\nAnd one of the things that Jay be found that he just buried this in the foot notable book with its monumental\nThat when his subject in the ESP lab and these were people tested under very rigorous conditions when they had a feeling of hopeful expectancy when they were upbeat when they were enthusiastic when they were positive their scores bike\nWhen they were bored when they were down cast when they were fatigue their scores debt and it was inevitable\nSpike followed mood it's the same thing that he says and the book\nIf you go into a situation any kind of situation doesn't happen to be Las Vegas down in ... you know putting that black cloud over your head for whatever reason yeah he's not going to happen for you\nIt's not going to happen and the thing that I always tell people is\nAnd again this one of these familiar things but listen very carefully to it you must really wanted you must really want it if you're a person who's attitude is neither here nor there about winning in Vegas or the lottery or money or whatever it's not going to work\nIt has to be something that you really want which is why it's so important to truly identify your most heartfelt desires there's real power there because the power comes from an emotionally charged thought\nKentucky with Mitch Horwitz his latest book is called the miracle club as a matter of fact we are going to tell you how you can get a membership in the miracle club a little bit later on in the program his website is his name all linked up for you at coast to coast am\nDot com it's amazing how well how did you decide to write this kind of a book\n[noise] you know it's funny I had written a history of the positive mind moving a couple of years ago called one simple idea and I began to realize every chapter that I wrote every person who I talked about in the book I was using their methods I was road testing these things myself\nI'm experimenting with these methods myself and if that's what's driving my historical research a lot I write about the methods why did I write about the steps what am I right about the techniques and it was a big step because a lot of historians are afraid to mask themselves\nAs believers in what they write about but I've never been afraid to do that and I just really wanted to share with readers the actual hands on things I Do in my own life\nHow powerful is our human mind which\nIs powerful in ways that our generation is only coming to understand look we are realizing that things work out there like placebo surgery we're realizing that people can lose weight literally George\nAnd lower their blood pressure just based on the thought that they carry with them things that we would have thought were unbelievable a generation ago are being validated in clinical experiments today I think this universe is ultimately mental that doesn't mean that we don't live under many laws enforces\nBut if one can understand how much that means your thoughts are more powerful than anything you've been brought up to realize\nIs that the power of the brain or are we dealing with something outside of the physical body\nWe're dealing with something outside of the physical body and I think we could say that conclusively today because we have actual experiments but the thoughts change the brain\nYou were sustained thoughts will actually alter the neural pathways the electrical pathways in your brain that's demonstrable by brain scans it's literally mind over matter sort of thought changes the brain and fought has to be something that's extra physical that goes beyond the brains\nWhere human beings sometimes things work sometimes they don't that Iraqi if they don't work what does that mean\nYou know it's very important that that's an extremely important point because people will sometimes try a method it works they're thrilled they try it again it doesn't work and then they feel dejected one of the things that I read about in the book\nIs that we live within a cosmic framework where we experienced many different laws enforces the law of mind is constant as a law must be but so is the law of gravity but you're going to experience gravity differently on earth\nThan you would on the moon around Jupiter doesn't mean gravity isn't there doesn't mean gravity is an operative but it's affected by mass the mind is the same way circumstances are\nGoing to intrude upon how we experience these things so we were ordinance that we experiment\nVery clearly in very carefully\nMeasure gonna come back and talk more
