linked in his living at that but what really connected with me was how passionate Oscar was about something a logical as operations\nSo one of the things like you know society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially or we will have to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple false step process the sharing a dream of a story that makes it sound you can get it done in minutes\nWhat he to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple fall step process to sharing a dream of a story that makes it on you can get it done and minutes you get some help with the back of your guide to towards action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our opinions I mean bad habits apart from that is part of it to be let out so the rushed out of sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get the job of deal with a family\nWe think that we should lie indulge in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention to those in between twilight states of consciousness you between sleep in the wake\nThat's a good time to catch a good time to embark on a list of dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet set of losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dreams because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slammed the door and say no more dreams tell sometimes this is very interesting\nSometimes he kissed goodbye to our dreams because we think that our dreams are giving us a little ring pictures a possibility that we cannot none of us because we're not young enough but not rich enough whenever find the right below the right guy\nAnd sometimes strangely we kiss goodbye to dream because we don't think we can bring from a beautiful romantic breathing space\nWhat we would like to see an are waking life these of some of the reasons that people lose their dreams\nAnd I noticed that you know if you follow the the simple suggested instead I offer you can get your dreams back you could stop dreaming again in the sense of remembering and recalling and one of the most simple ideas is\nYou might have something to them and I think you've got nothing but some say you've got nothing and just pay attention you might have with you might have a fragment and if you can call that up and begin to play with that you might have a way of getting back in touch with your dreams and another thing I'd say to people George's\nWere then you can dream wide awake world around she will speak the language of signs and symbols and things but it's the if you pay attention and sometimes you get more alert\nTo those pop up so the pop ups in waking life that gives you ship is because you feel my gosh there's a hidden handed work that that helps to turn on the tree and plus the night as well\nAs some incredible ways to dream pre cognitive lucid dreams what about these recurring dreams and you have had some stories are directly related to that\nWell it's a recurring dream is coming again and again and as a hilarious story or the serious reality is about a woman doctor for England who's complaining of the breakfast table\nOh Robert why do I keep having the same thing dream but I've got to do my medical exams Thirty years on and I did them I keep having the same dream I said what I Would say in general or you know if if you if it really is the same ... very close to the same dream it's probably because\nYou have dreamed producers who are making a movie for you that's something that goes on to\nAnd they're trying to get a message through you're trying to get you to understand the situation in trying to educate you all assuming you might have some clue about what's going on they tried to mobilize you to take some action\nOn the situation so I I did one of the stories I I picture I sort of dream production movie company that is making dreams for us and repeating that performance if necessary in order to get a message across and I actually picked\nHow I'll dream producers might be getting very bulletin fed up with us if they have to keep on making\nThe same offices and not\nGetting the message of not taking action from it that's one of the ways that ... come about I mean dreams are not all to be put in one box we do have dreamed productions where you feel and you might be quite right when you filled is that there is a production crew behind the scenes\nThat is making a certain kind of dream to you because you need to get a message and another the stories of mysterious reality as I describe a very strange\nSee that is making a certain kind of dream to you because you need to get a message and another the stories of mysterious reality as I describe but very strange women who sat down next to me in a plane an old reality and mentored me at a certain point that a dead husband or the ... he was a pop musician he'd been shot in the face and a diner in Seattle a\nNice city creepy story and he says to her in her dream I'm I've got a great job now I'm helping to make movies for people that they're seeing their dreams that I'm doing the music and the special effects I think back to that goes on I think that's another fascinating aspect of what's happening and dreams\nWho's in charge of this though who's who's the director of these productions\nWell that's a very good question indeed it might use that dream out if you become more conscious of what is going on and decide to step into that role until you become conscious it might be that some shadow or hidden aspect of yourself\nMaybe if you're a high a self made people cite the wise or inside the highest though\nIs the director I don't think any of this is alien to us I think we are connected to all of this I think the dream production company that might be staging movies for you is not alien to is not hostile to you\nAnd is probably being run by someone with a side it why is the perspective and maybe more of a sense of humor than you currently have about your current situation because a lot of the ways that dream shock us awake into doing some course correction is\nThey dramatized and they spoof parity or what what we're doing in our lives in a way that makes it very difficult to avoid noticing that some action might be required\nDreams are powerful Robert in ah I've always used it for my own personal life to get things done accomplish things once you learn how to master your dreams there's no end to what you can do\nRight I mean I think that here's here's where our our current understanding of dreaming and currents physics uh meet up I mean the our current under staffed by kinda understanding I mean the really really the revival some quite interesting understanding about dreams of dreaming is traveling for example\nA it'd physics tells the science tells us that we have access at any moment so the mentality of non local mind we're the field of information quantum field of information that contains everything we could ever possibly need to know and we have access to it\nAccording to our ability to harvest the information and do something with it and ... in the first place what's going on I think in dreams we discover we have snow doorway into this whole quantum information field\nAnd depending on the work and play with prepared to do with the information might getting we can bring through more and more I mean you could set an intention any night for example to be very simple about this very simple practical you can do dream in basements being to set an intention\nTo get guidance on any theme that interest you and probably something will come through if you don't think you got anything you're awake in the middle of the night to reset your intention and maybe at this point\nYou're ready to lose the dream on that subject as well because he's got some rest and you're ready to take off\nAnd it's amazing how many creative solutions come through in this way and they've come through across history one of my book the secret history of dreaming\nIs full of store narratives of from the documentation that suggested dreaming is actually a secret engine in the history of everything in the history of credit breakthroughs in science and technology in the aughts even in business and economics as well\nSo when you say that if you wake up to what dreaming is it can take you anywhere you're literally correct it really can\nCan take us to those hidden dimensions of reality that super string theory pause it it can take us into the off the lights they use Easter ham want the job opportunities some living environment's a like\nA bee on death so you can talk to the ancestors beloved loved ones and ...\nAnd others so you know this is the ...\nAnd it's a like a bee on death so you can talk to the ancestors beloved loved ones and ... and others so this is the mentality of adventure killing guidance and possibility that opens when you become a more conscious ... what about the ability to chime travel in your dreams\nWhere we do it we do it whether we know do not do it even if we don't remember our dreams and I think it's a basic survival function of dreaming\nYou know if I'm a mistake on a practical mystic George I think you know that I Want to take away so that is that in power out every day life and one of the things I Know from my own life and those I work with is the dream show you the future in a way that is actionable mean this is very important dreams show us\nOpportunities and challenges lie ahead they ... the things we don't yet know about they can save your life they could save your job they could say that marriage I couldn't be talking to you today\nIf I did not know for certain shows that I have that I have avoided death on the road predates his death ... accidents\nBy coming back from dreams that forecast book was happening harvesting the information acting upon it so I didn't have that head on collision with the Eighteen wheeler coming down the hill to fall back on the other side of a blind\nSpot for example so that's one direction for time travel over time doesn't move into a new one direction and in fact to understand what our relationship with time is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of Libya time altogether we step into a different place and in between place\nFrom which we can access time passed future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in other times altogether in those parallel times we leading a power life this becomes very interesting when you begin to look at gifts of lessons you might have learned in a parallel life that you could apply and you present life and how to avoid things went wrong and not at other parallel life\nAnd it gets very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you lost at that time or the guy to that younger self or you find yourself also in the lives of the situations of people in far flung places who are part of your multi dimensional family\nI'm a bit of an agnostic about reincarnation but I firmly believe based
