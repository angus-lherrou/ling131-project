you can tell from the lyrics he's traveling over the ocean there and uh\nWe're about to take her own ocean voyage ... you know because of the nature of this job I get to spoil myself by reading a lot of books I I Love reading any way to do it every waking moment if I could get away with it or\nAs it is you know I get the double hour dozens of books per year I Can't think of anything I have read in the last five years\nThat affected me as profoundly as what we're about to discuss you know I saw a review of this book months ago I knew we had to check it out and it exceeded all my expectations the subject is rubbing the writing is superb\nThe research is meticulous and this story this tragedy really touches a nerve in ways that I think we will explore over the next few hours at for anyone who's not a student of naval history\nYou know the first time most of us probably heard of what little we know about the USS Indianapolis it can be traced to one of the best scenes in the history of American movies is from blockbuster Spielberg movie jaws Roberts jaws character went delivered of moving powerful\nSlightly tipsy account of what motivated him to become a shark hunter here is an edited version of that scene deserved just as a reminder to you\n[noise] seven hundred and ... says Linda improvement is [noise]\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned was the fifth the Fifth Fleet flags shifts and I'm a small part that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle is over an hour where your father drove the landing craft\nAnd I'm In the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was participating in the shore of environment\nAnd during that time and march thirty first Nineteen forty five she was hit by a kamikaze nine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really censor on this fateful journey\nHad that not happened she might have gone down in history as the victorious flagship of the world war two specific theaters I'm Victoria said okay now as well as nine other major battles\nBut instead she went back to mirror island California for repairs and that's where she was on July sixteenth Nineteen forty five when general Leslie grows and the other leaders of Manhattan Project including President Truman\nDecided that they want us to send the components of the atomic bomb little boy with would later ... to head to the forward areas\nAnd trim and did this a lot of uh a lot of people don't know that Truman did this before he even knew that he would use the bomb because at that time uh everyone thought that there would be an invasion of mainland Japan\nSo Indianapolis was selected to transport these ... components of the bomb\nShe did that a native record breaking run to\nA Pearl Harbor and then pushed on Tiffany in Ireland where she dropped off the components of the atomic bomb and then two days after that on July twenty eighth Nineteen forty five she set out on what was going to be a routine voyage across the Philippine Steve from Guam for the Philippines\nAn almost three west down shot and right when she was in the middle of the specific or Steve me middle of the Philippines these\nOn July thirty is Nineteen forty five just a few minutes after midnight or she intersected course with a Japanese submarine called ISIS da's demanded by lieutenant commander Moshe Sarah how she mode of how she met her fired exposed torpedoes hit Indianapolis with\nTwo of them the first one almost completely blues afoul of the shift Indianapolis was a heavy cruiser the second one hit her image shifts the vessel went down and twelve minutes\nAnd you know we've been talking longer than twelve minutes it was\nVery very with about three hundred men went down with the shift of a little under nine hundred made it into the water alive and when they made it into the water those who survived their wounds were very optimistic if they were going to be rescued soon\nBut uh they weren't and they spent five nights and four days in the water struggling to survive and uh as you mentioned earlier they've\nThey fought madness they've fought the hydration they fought shark or eventually they fought each other because of the madness\nMadness they've gotten hydration they've a shark or eventually they fought each other because of the madness and that is the story that most people know that Indianapolis\nShe was spotted completely by accident on the about mid day on the fourth the fourth day after five nights for days in the water and only three hundred and sixty men survive\nSarah secrecy plays such an important part in this at every step of the way and it leads to tragedy threatened with tragic tragic results because of the secrecy of the what they were carrying and continue to sort of continued over after they drop them off\nOr what did you share with us the whole secrecy or I did which obviously was necessary military necessity or lead to tragedy and how you probably you interfered with your ability to get at the core of the story\nAbsolutely I mean there were multiple areas that held secrecy and the story that led to the demise of Indianapolis and ultimately the men being you know lost at sea for five days\nAnd you know first of which being how messages were transmitted across the Pacific during the war you know there\nWas a level of coding that had to be taken into consideration and you know one of the ships that Indianapolis was to report to when it arrived in the Philippines was um admiral McCormack and the message he received was garbled\nAnd so you know protocol said that oh it didn't you know didn't come through clearly and no one asked for a repeat so they didn't even know Indian Indianapolis was supposed to be reporting to them you know that was one of the first thing\nI'm so when she didn't show up they didn't know she was supposed to show up you know um aside from that there was protocol that noncombatants shit the rivals didn't have to be reported and so when she didn't arrive lieutenant thought while I guess I don't have to report that either\nAnd so he took it upon himself not to say anything even though he knew the ship was in there and these were all put in place you know to protect our vessels during wartime but the secrecy of that and the protocols ultimately lead to her not being found\nYou know and then beyond that you know we had broken the Japanese code at this time and there were a message trafficking going across the Pacific and the Philippines the\nReporting you know various subs in the area well none of that was related to captain McVeigh because they didn't want anyone to know that the codes and been broken and that we were using that\nAnd so you know he should not have been there without an escort he should have you know had you know taking a step back Indianapolis was not you know made really for combat it was made to get to a scene or to a battle quickly and have guns\nAnd so she should have had something you know first of all that sonar and second of all that had um any calmer ability\nYeah arm or two and a former I\nMean she was part of the treaty cruiser so her armor was exceptionally thin compared to many of the newer shifts and so that was one of the reasons why she saying so quickly\nUh you know so all of these things kind of came together to form the perfect storm\nAnd so much of that played into the secrecy of this mission and why she was out there and why this information and wasn't passed along to the captain who may have made different decisions knowing that there was a direct threat and his staff\nTold me that was it difficult to get the the the survivors to trust you I I Know there's been so many ...\nTell me this was it difficult to get the the the survivors to trust you I I Know there's been so many ... wrong stories in wrong conclusions made about what happened there that I Would think they might still be suspicious even decades later\nWhen I think a big part of that they mentioned is that I had spent several years visiting with them and spending time with their families\nTalking with them that you know\nWith no other interests other than learning their story and so they I think trusted me by the time that I actually wanted to start doing interviews and\nPutting the story down on film or you know at the screenplay and eventually the book and lenders well when she came in we had this trust built in\nWith these men that they knew and genuinely wanted to tell the accurate story however heart and however long that would take we would tell the true story [noise]\nWell it was a it was amazing the uh how how widely you cast the net here um you know in creating real characters are you you get to know these people a lot of the people who\nAre characters in the book obviously didn't survives your piecing them together I guess from people who did know that but uh you know may be among the most interesting is ... ... the guy who was commander the sub the sink the USS of\nIndianapolis a limb talk about him a little bit he's a he's a he's not a are stereotypical Japanese commander\nThat's right one of the things that we tried to do is really pulled back the land on the Indianapolis story because really\nThe man uh before I get passionate or just to to you know circle back and the men who ferry the atomic bomb aboard USS Indianapolis was an army on Robert a nominee major name Robert feminine\nAnd who has spent the last couple of years after the war running down our decision about material that they feared the Germans were using to try to develop their own atomic bomb\nUh on the continent of Europe though once that messing with complete and then burn and carry decision about components of little boy depending on an island\nUm status that final grading the editor of the European and if the conflict and so then writing the whole book we tried to pull back that land and bring in a lot of these other a character's and world leaders and figures\nIncluding the Japanese point of view in addition to ... we had in ... in the county has got to leave and come out of the commander\nAnd what we tried to do storage where to begin to recognize that even those men were enemies at the time that they were all acting out of their conscience and conviction and doing what\nAnd it's the best time of the day
