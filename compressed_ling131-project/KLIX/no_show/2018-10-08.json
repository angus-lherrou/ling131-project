Okinawa they would build an airbase in that air base would bring\nA most of Japan uh easily into the range of their of of the American bombers so what the Japanese did was they spread stories to the civilians\nThat if the Americans invaded they would torture kill and you know God Knows what else the civilians are enslave them\nScare the living daylights right\nAbsolutely terrified so when the Americans did\nInvade the civilians were would run off of cliffs and commit suicide and then you know that's a documented piece of history\nJust a terrifying uh a story but now it there are stories a one story in particular that rate of that I wrote about in the book\nIs that a a group of tourists were added peace museum near those cliffs\nAnd they were walking in the field near that that museum and they heard the sound of what they considered and they said it was almost like a herd of of footsteps coming their way and they couldn't see anything\nAnd then they felt a wind pass them and then later heard what they described as cries and screams so that was pretty moving for me\nUm another story from the Pacific he would Jima is is equally um heartbreaking and he would Jima\n... there are literally thousands of Japanese soldiers that were probably buried alive because they were ... they were a in a tunnel system a very intricate\nTunnel system under the island\nAnd um the the entrances caved in or or or the soldiers were actually burned alive or in the tunnels\nSo there's a story that I write about that one\nA Japanese civilian worker claims that every time he gets a call that he has to return to the mainland to any uh he gets a knock on the door and he claims that these spirits of these soldiers on wood Jima that want to be repatriated back to the to\nAnd the door and he claims that these spirits of these soldiers on wood Jima that want to be repatriated back to the to the mainland and Japan to those are some pretty intense stories that a crop up and it's ... they're certainly not where ah in in this volume middle\nEast what's interesting too mad is that they seem to be so prevalent all over the place something's going on\nYeah that's true and not only are they everywhere that the different one of the amazing aspects of of the world war two supernatural is that the ghost don't even necessarily have to be people because there's actually goes planes that appear especially over England\nAlmost like the flying dutchman the ship\nYeah absolutely exactly\nPeople see these planes and they're really not there\nYeah this is I'm In and I'll tell you a little story from my own\nFamily did they hear them too\nWell some do and some do but there's one area or in the United kingdom um [noise] uh it's a northern section of of the u._k. called derby sheer\nAnd it's known as the Bermuda Triangle of um the u._k. it sounds pretty pastoral sounding so I don't know why there's such activity\nBut there have been a lot of plane crashes there about fifty planes I think if have crashed in that area and it has quite a reputation but over the years there have been what they called ghost plane flaps so for example in Nineteen eighty five\nA bunch of people a claim to seeing this huge military aircraft flying overhead one couple was I'm driving down the highway and they saw this very low flying bomber\nCruising over the highway and they said that it didn't have any sound whatsoever which was remarkable because it was so big and I you know I think they described it as a a for prop I'm an engineer and it looks like a World War two bomb or\nSo of course skeptics believe that it was probably you know a either a current military plane or possibly a um maybe a a bomb or going to an air show or something like that was what they\nDo what they thought yeah you're right but to counter that a lot of these people that solve this first of all\nThere didn't seem to be a pattern a flight with with this there didn't seem to be a straight line as you might see with a a a a a regular conventional non spooky aircraft\nDisappeared in different areas throughout that region and a couple of the people that spotted this one in particular worked uh for a an airfield during World War two was a I Believe I'm a somewhat flight mechanics for the for the uh R. E. F.\nSo definitely would have known the difference between let's say a modern I guess like a Hercules aircraft\nAnd something like a B. twenty four or uh Lancaster Bomber and and this person described it either as a Lancaster or is it would be twenty four bomber\nSo a pretty peculiar in and there have been other what they called ghost playing flaps a throughout history and I think there was even one as I was writing this book so two thousand Seventeen um pretty interesting\nMathieu did they describe how the planes would disappear how would how how they would leave ...\nThe one couple just said that it flew overhead and they thought it was going to crash and I believe they pulled over to see you know see if it did crash or at least to hear it\nFlew overhead and they thought it was going to crash and I believe they pulled over to see you know see if it did crash or at least to hear it and it just it just kind of disappeared\nJust like that yeah yeah like you want to do a different time warp or something right\nIn and the reason I looked into the these are a ghost plane stories is when I was young\nMy parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and said that as they were\nA starting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy or you can make it sound went overhead and it just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be Erie\nThat watch it with my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well England was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any any story similar and sure enough it's a\nIt's not that it
