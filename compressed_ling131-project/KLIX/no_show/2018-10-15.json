listening to this amazing bumper music and hanging out on Twitter during the brakes it's what I Do follow me on Twitter at ... church radio\nAnd any questions or comments just post them right there I've got some really good stuff that I'm a hit my new with when we come back after the break and also\nOver it costs it costs have despite the difficulties with his board of directors and investors ... mosque is full speed ahead for a man to Mars mission by two thousand twenty four now of course that depends on\nA few other tests going off without a hitch or even know what he calls a rapid unscheduled disassemble a\nYou know that's what must uh likes to call rocket failures but the article is right there and you can read read all about it over at coast to coast am dot com I mean it was Jimmy church now our guest tonight is my new as safe as I day\nWe're talking about his new paper that was published last week\nThat seems to show up formula for finding new chambers in the great pyramid more beer phone calls and more with by new when we come back after this short break this is coast to coast am [noise]\nIt's maybe six foot deep\nI'm but I'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is it's basically a blind LBJ but\nUm but you know maybe there are some maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that um I can tell you that the uh you know the world to cruise ships um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth charted under this thing's a and this was published in the thirties by\nA a chronic a person that was chronicling there was a crucial and he has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nUm there is a a there's another blind pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves\nAre into this things are looking for chambers and then you know the one that Jimmy just mention of course we know from seismic analysis that there are ... the our space is under the themes\nAnd one of those spaces specifically which is what Robert truck or a was studying uh years ago um is has a regular uh has corners and has seems to have a manmade sort of features and we think that um that might be something in it that self interest\nYeah he did the seismic research there and the both of you are looking to go back a woods another research expedition to hopefully drilled right\nYeah yeah first well what we are what we would like to do first is to map this again with a you know a little bit more advanced uh five small graffiti\nAnd maybe electric conductivity studies and to really get a very detailed look especially the depth Jimmy that was the problem or you know what you if you remember there was a Japanese Group that came in eighty seven\nAnd ... and did exactly the same experiment and they saw a space about two meters\nA deep and uh and and then Robert uh you know did his studies ... a couple of years later\nAnd Robert is estimating that this phase is five meters deep so\nWe have a little bit of a deaf problem and then of course you know that's I of Boston Market Leno drilled in that area\nBut we think that they missed it uh and that means they are they the the drill angle was too shallow and they were too far west from where we think the chamber is so they didn't really uh you know they didn't really use a good map\nTo guide them and of course they had other reasons why they were drilling so what we want to do is you know just like a you know just like a radiologist you know the first one to do a non invasive study and really find map this space\nYeah where it is then with permission of course that work try a small pro or into that space and see what the\nHow amazing would it be to finally located that hall of records that you know Edgar Casey has talked about and there's this this this rumor has been going around yeah for quite a while it would just be great to finally a witness to bed wouldn't\nOh absolutely we think that if we think there's a possibility that this chamber is filled with water and in fact when I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago um I was standing in front of the valley temple and thinks temple and there was a little depression and it's wet um you can just you can just see the the water coming up and\nIf if that is groundwater than it is in that chamber and so you know if if let's say if we find a chamber or the very first thing we have to do is to\nA very slowly and meticulously drained a water out and rescue whatever it might be inside um you know sufficient enough itself becomes a very difficult project but it's doable Robert thinks it's a it's doable you just have to do it really slowly speaking\nOf those things that just came in on Twitter this is from Baldwin is uh\nOn Twitter and I have heard that this things may have been a woman's face and that it was changed and that is why it's head is too small forward somebody\nYes well if we think we think it was a female lie and so that part is partially we agree with that yes\nI don't think it was a person's head so um but we think that was a lie in this there before and the head of the line this was weak carved into or what we see today\nNow um I Know that you tend to be a little reticent to talk about alien ... when it comes to geese\nI leave all doors open myself but this comes in from Lucien on winter and and and this is I'm just going to have to read this directly as ... images it seems like all of the pyramids in Mexico\nHave an alien in this space craft depicted somewhere ... any comments\n[noise] yeah I I Know I I remember reading this long time ago and I've found myself in agreement with that uh\nThat's one way you could read it I you know I think I was ... data can invite that originally the history she's talking about the ... yeah or the right the lid off the ... or ... of a car ride I have\nThat's our topic is in my studio in the long hair\nAnd I have a reproduction of and hanging out on the wall right and I stop and I look at that Manu and I don't have any other way to look at that ... for the controls hand controls an oxygen mask same coming out of a a rocket motor on the bottom\nI you know I don't have any problem with that I I think this is a this is one way you can explain it and everything is in this day and age everything is on cable you just said that we're going to Mars\nUm the odds that there is then tell I I Know somebody recently published an article saying that there may not be intelligent life out there but I think uh I think there is it's a very likely\nAnd especially the physics of of a of the universe you know the holographic universe I don't know if people are following this\nBut it you know this one way that you can explain everything as a projection and if that's the case a dentist like Robert Duvall proposed in Cosby gloom is one way you can explain or some of these contacts is there may be a message\nAll right then just like Robert ... proposed in cosmic rules is one way you can explain some of these contacts is there may be a message that gets broadcasts across the universe through you know through um\nAh through a Clinton fields and that message ends up on our end somehow it causes someone to do something that they otherwise wouldn't have like you know design a pyramid\nUm I think it's possible I I think it's on the table I'm not going to close my mind to it is but we have to have some proof I I I I mean I'm I'm not going to embrace a theory like that until I see some solid proof of it but I think it's on the table\nLet's go to the international line or a Robin Vancouver Rob really quick before we hit the brake what do you have four minute\nA absolute honor to speak to you guys really quickly a notion that struck me when you talked about structured space is a look you'll make it quick a couple of quick jumps and laundered\nLooking at the idea of a Greek skating architectural attribute ... super big jump starting to tempers are forming old knowledge below the big ... structures\nUh who's to say or he could do even I guess people assume that the the ... the ah periods are solid\nBecause you know maybe just emergency structured spaces be absolutely filled with voids you learn to rocks and everything you know arches inside big cavities like temple\nYeah Rob go look at a news research paper on his website and and read through it that's exactly the conclusions that my news presenting in this paper my new we mentioned already six to eight and voids could there be more\nYeah so I I have to you know I've been a I Need I have to mention shop you know so he of course proposed an internal ramp years ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book\nAnd he proposed this these aren't logistics basis basically to get the stones up the pyramid and his dad from last year business show it but I think the theory is all that I think it's possible that this cat was not sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that this that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I'm seeing that could be theological and shop here who dealt with probably disagree with me\nOr you know he reviewed the paper a but he still thinks it's possible that there are logistical spaces in it but you know be that as it may so we agree there are probably space is up there and um I just want to ask you a quick uh because the pyramid of cool pool\nIt's is is how space is inside researches in the sixties wet to offer his pyramid because they thought it can how can it be that we have all these spaces inside you know corporate pyramid biting off his mid ... only chamber\nWell let me jump in I've got to take a break right there but this is something we need to talk about when we come back our gas my new stateside hey this is all the great pyramid on coast
