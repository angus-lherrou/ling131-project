[noise]\n\nI mean I guess the last one to call out [noise]\n\nAnd would you help me do I mean there's a\n[noise]\nIn your ... coming [noise] from\nCoast to coast and worldwide on the Internet is this just goes to goes to am with George now\nNow here's George\nFloyd hey you from the wall brings us back into the progress you know we all ask ourselves the same questions or why are we here what comes next\nIs that all there is a the current scientific paradigm tells us that when we die that's it that's the end at the many of the experiences that people report over the centuries things that happened to them for real or not real they can't exist and therefore they don't you know the disconnect between\nCenturies of human experience and rigid doctrine is maybe one reason why so many people have given up on science in ways that are probably inappropriate and unfair and also possibly dangerous\nIs there a way to reconcile the seemingly bizarre experiences that people have reported through the centuries out of body experiences missing time time slips near death encounters other realities of science versus spirituality science and religion is their way to bridge all of that well\nDr Christopher white has written a remarkable new book that offers a unique and new understanding of topics that we often discuss here on this program but can't really explain\nOther dimensions of the realities\nWhether or not this reality might bleed into others and vice versa in a moment we'll take a deep dive into the deep end of that pool and I think you will be enthralled as I was\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to they want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions a fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers\nLook better on the equations look clean or they seem simpler more elegant um um and so on so and in fact just to get forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nUh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifty six Seventeen and more and these are string theorist I don't know um if you are\nYour members every audience of her string theory but sure um use me so yeah there's string theory M theory brain theory so these these are basically mathematical theories that\nIncorporate these other dimensions and and they do it again in order to make make simpler and more elegant the basic equations that govern government the universe\nTheir string theorists in um theoretical physicists mathematicians who do this are really trying to wrestle with one problem that really is the the biggest problem in modern physics\nAnd the problem is that we have two sets of equations that seemed to govern reality um and we know that both sets the equations are correct\nBut we also know that they don't fit together we have we we have we had a set of equations that govern very small things in the universe and um that Governor governor some atomic world was the er the atomic world world of quantum\nAnd we know those equations work we know they're correct on the other hand we have a set of equations that govern the movement or I'm of the of the very large so planets and sons and galaxies and so on hum and these are Einstein's\nTheory of general relativity we we know both of those sets of equations are correct but we also can't see a way for them to fit together they don't they don't fit together so string theorist and others are\nAssuming that there are additional spatial dimensions and they're using them in order to come up with a single set of mathematical equations that would be encompassing and that would put together the other the other equations that we have it\nIn between sort of the ... version and the one to merge and you have things like spooky action at a distance or which of scientists have struggled to explain in theory right\nOh absolutely absolutely yeah I mean you know a mathematician who who work on on these subjects\nI'm also have to wrestle with other mysteries right there are other mysteries revealed by quantum mechanics for sure [laughter] you know\nThey're they're definitely trying to wrestle with the problem of having two sets of equations that don't fit together\nAnd they're and they're using higher dimensional concepts to try to try to work on that but as you say yes there's there's other strange and uncanny on implications of of quantum physics that um that that have found their way into pop culture for sure you know and\nTo some extent have found their way into pop culture and I tried to talk about that in the book as well\nWrite the book is not just about scientists working on these ideas the book is about scientists who work on these ideas but then\nI'm a scientist who doesn't have religious experiences and then try to use these ideas to think about them and then even other people who who have religious experiences and start to talk about them as higher dimensional or or somehow related to some some concepts in physics\nOr maybe we could use flat land as an illustration it's both an illustration and sort of an inspiration for a lot of the people who you write about in this book or tell us about flat land I guess it wasn't a pop culture phenomenon when it came out\nAbsolutely yeah ... is a great little book um [noise]\nSo ... kind of a classic science fiction or nonfiction book written a long time ago a written in Eighteen eighty four has quite a cultural life and in fact\nI remember reading flatland in high school calculus so ... you know math students all over the world still read flat land as a way of kind of expanding are thinking about you know what is it what does it mean to live in uh the kinds of spaces and kind of dimensions we live in so\nYeah it's a great little book written by an Anglican priest named Edwin Abbott he was British he was he was raised in the middle of the nineteenth century I'm coming to coming to age in a in an era of science and wrestling with what it meant to be religious and scientific at the same time\nUm you know it was a time in you know this Eighteen fifty nine with Darwin's origin of species and there were a number of\nUm there were a number of challenges I guess you'd say to Christianity\nHum and Edwin Abbott time so he he ended up writing the ... wonderful book flat land which is a book about a lower dimensional two dimensional world and he wrote it in order to get people to get people think more about the possibility that\nUm other kinds of world could exist um imbedded in in our own may maybe we live in a higher dimensional universe\nBut habits flat world was it was a two dimensional world the book takes place in a two dimensional world this is a flat world that might exist you know on on the surface of your table pop right so this this is a world that's completely flat and his populated by\nTwo dimensional objects as objects with just lengthened with say some of them were flask where some of them were flat circles are flat triangles and and even even lines they would all slide around on the surface of this flat world and of course they believe that\nUh they live in a two dimensional world until the climax\nUntil the climax of the of the novel when a three dimensional object us fear inserts itself goes down in in in in search itself into the plane of flat land and there's a square character who looks\nOut on his his flat land horizon sees the appearance of this mysterious object he starts talking to them and the sphere says I'm you know I'm I'm a three dimensional object then I come from another\nAnother world and the square says this can't be possible in the sphere just cannot convince the square that they're flat a two dimensional world is to some better than a larger world so the sphere resorts to a more um extreme measure and he\nHe reaches over and pulls the square off of the plane world of flat lining up into three dimensional space and\nOf course the than the square looks around and looks down on his flat world ... for the first time I see the whole world spread out in front of him [noise]\nSo the square becomes a sort of a believer in the existence of a higher dimension that there's a there's a third dimension and he goes back to his flat world of course and it's it's pretty enthusiastic about this and can't can't stay quiet\nAnd show that there's a there's a third dimension and he goes back to flat world of course is pretty enthusiastic about this I Can't can't stay quiet about it and\nUnfortunately in ... and it's forbidden\nIt's forbidden by the by the high priest to talk about the existence of hired mentioned so he has put in jail where he where he stays for a number of your ears and and the story ends with us for flat square languishing in prison\nI'm hoping that his readers ... some of his readers will be visionary enough to accept that there might be a more than meets the eye to to their reality so he sort of like\nThe idea that the high priest a flat land wouldn't allow or anybody to talk about the other dimension I mean a commentary on sort of maybe rigid dogma of our time\nYeah yeah exactly exactly he and he was he was very interested in commenting on the\nSort of as you say the rigidity and and the social norms of Victorian England you know when he where he lived for I sort of had to stay in your line and not have any wild um any wild thoughts but up at the square character did have these wild often and even at the stationary experience right where he saw that that was\nThat there was another space or direction to reality and and I'm so happy I wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to [noise]\nYou know think about the possibility that above our three spaces are three spatial dimensions there might be others um that we don't see we go through our life I'm thinking about our world is the only world but you know maybe maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about it on to imagine um but when you combine higher dimensions and the ... it gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter]\nI tell you what we're gonna we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who are inspired by this idea\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and uh they they go through\nTrials in turmoil in trying to get their head around it as as I have a at but we'll we'll get into that in a moment or we're talking with Christopher white about other world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions of the doors break on through take us
