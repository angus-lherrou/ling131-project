I was going through your capsules that couldn't it made me feel so much better I can only tell you one thing\nAnd not only works in one way it works as a whole bunch of different ways because it gives me energy negatives me right charity care anything in my house just a better way carnivores has everything back into my body [noise] taken a while but you know what to expect over there and I ... I Can't say I don't know\nAnd and yeah and so what I'm saying is that I feel\nCan gonna leave you on the ... yeah [laughter] see\nThe the thing is that the we are seeing him a moment coming in this century in the first half of the century where religions will see the other side of the prophecies the part the doors been shut to you know and there's indications in prophecy\nAnd Christian prophecy even that shows that what's on the other side of this revelation will completely change the concept and leave behind even the identity of what was the Christian what it was to be Muslim what it wants to be Buddhist all of that will be left on this side of the door\nAnd what's on the other side is completely different that's all I can into right now\nI I Can't let go by without asking you about the middle east and then we'll start taking phone calls and winding up here for you but what's your take pathetically on what's going to happen in the middle east with Syria in Iran in this whole situation\n[noise] well it's unfortunately with all the things we've been talking about specifically since twenty fourteen when I alerted yuan coast to coast and everybody about how we are now in Cold War two point Oh yes\nAnd how it it follows a prophetic a place where the flashpoint as the middle east I mean one of the one of the ten predictions I made in ten production for this year was how we'd come much closer to a a war with Iran that's happened [noise]\nUm Syria is an ally of Iran and is always long story short the\nThe Saddam has properties that are quite clear about this is a look to eagle kings of the north get pulled in this as a Russian double eagle and the American bald eagle ... countries get pulled in because of their allies their vessels [noise]\nWhich are described in an anagram as Arab vessels Bob are a dying Rob in in French at that that kind of a rebel against their their their masters and drag Russian America into a war\nAnd that can happen with the issue of Iran even last few twenty four hours is there we've rescinded a peace treaty that we've had with Iran since Nineteen fifty five [noise] of course it was with their dictator the shah after we overthrew their government two years earlier that was democratically elected [noise]\nThat doesn't get told you in the u._s. press\nBy most of the ... most of their yeah see I took him down to help the British Petroleum veteran retain a Iranian oil [noise] and then they helped train the survivor which is as worse as bad as they can stop all in Germany and terrorize the people as one of the reasons why the Islamic\nThat's why they threw the shah ...\nYes and so so there's bad comedy here and we're basically blindsided to our side uh in this and we need to take a look at how we kind of gotten here ...\nNow so so we have a situation with ... which really got me concerned in August where it's the last province where fifty thousand al ... affiliates who we've been supporting\nCity in Syria for Syria yeah we're going to make their last stand against the Syrian Arab Army and\nThe Russian air force and the Turks were also involved what happened in eleventh hour just before it started is um air to again of turkey the president turkey\nOh what happened in eleventh hour just before it started is um ... organ of ... or ... the president of turkey and water and food and got together and made a pact\nTo not do the offensive to create a buffer zone a demilitarized zone and take the time to do something to help the people the three million people half of which are are are\nAre refugees all crowd that area owns the horrible what what's good about that is it's it's an attempt not to have this thing happened I Know from my sources that there were a lot of uh the real red staged and film the White Helmets who are basically al ... is a A R [noise]\nUh had only taking children and use them and some gassing attack that's this story I'm trying to track down\nAnd we're going to be broadcast is still ... started as a once again another false flag the Syrian regime have chemical weapon eyes them and that would have caused ah [noise] you know we have thirty Russian warships says this time around\nAnd the ah near equal number of American ships crowding eastern Mediterranean long story short we have a lot of military potential in a tight area that if a miscalculation happen it could get serious\nAnd and so and then one thing can lead to another into a nuclear confrontation I mean the missiles of\nThe missiles of October in sixty two can become the missiles of\nOctober twenty Eighteen or twenty Nineteen\nUm his strategy kind of points to and some of the deadlines Nostradamus gave to a long and short deadline if if we can move up what may be the official start of the Cold War when the Russians announce said ... achieved a parity in March first of the year\nThey delayed they're putting their latest address to the nation Russia and any so he could see what what the military changes the rules of engagement was going to happen with the Americans\nHe I I actually quoted law this speech and it shows it's very interesting look at how we've been in an arms race again with Russia because we pulled out of the ab a missile treaty\nAnd which was a seriously destabilizing move to unilaterally do the long story short they had to create a new system of of weapons that could be a deterrent to was surrounding Russia's steadily with a anti ballistic missile batteries\nTo basically be able to shoot down their missiles so they couldn't defend themselves a very very destabilizing move a hardly reported\nSo the Russians declared in March ... pretty much were in the Cold War and they have now made a parity you know interestingly enough fruit and drops ten billion dollars off the eighty billion dollar budget of the Russian defense\nThe same time Trump adds another thirty seven billion to something that's past seven hundred billion if you add the other sides to it were really spending one point one trillion dollars [noise]\nUh on defense spending in our military ironically it's half of what the US people produce monetary lead GDP every year which is exactly what happened at the same time when the Soviet Union collapsed\nIt was paying half of its money into its big military uh and they collapsed\nWe're doing the same thing so uh it's it it reminds me of prophecies of ... through the spirit was channeled by stereo hunt\nThing so uh it's it it reminds me of prophecies of amber asserted his spirit was channeled by stereo hunts and ... who was considered the Swedish Edgar Casey Nineteen eighties [noise]\nAnd um because he channeled similarly and traps and he he would say things like ah you'll see the one side of the Cold War over there and Russia have become more free in America would become more like the Soviet Union and then at least in this economic sense\nThat's true uh with more censorship it's happening to alternative voices you know the that's also a ... I Would say from my own experience with journalism at we're definitely looking more and more like Soviet Union I grew up with than the country I grew up with\nNo that's true in in ... in the last minutes we before the break them will take final calls next half hour you're writing a book about celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain who committed suicide and that this this intrigues me why are you doing this\n[noise] well I've been watching Anthony Bourdain since two thousand five I've learned so much about his unique\nRebellious but Bruins unorthodox way of\nKind of dragging me along to see the world many of the same places I ate and then my travel ... it's kind of taking us through a journey through the stomach\nTo really meet with people and people break break bread they they they it it's a connection it's all it's all I was saying earlier in the show how\nWe can we need to talk to each other rather than polarized both\nHave a big bank would have all the red Republicans with blue

speaker in a true sense because he wasn't buying into\nEasy a rationales of belief he was really questioning thing and of course seeing the world like he was he was seeing the darker sides of it as well\nAnd it wasn't a surprise to me that he committed suicide because I feel as much as I Love him I also had a similar things issues in my own\nLine really let's talk about that John when we come

chef Anthony Bourdain and boy you sparked my interest John because it sounds like you had a very a similar situation what happened\nI did it's really a tale of two suicide a and both of us committed suicide the reason I Am speaking to you is because\nMy experience with suicide was the spiritual suicide rather than the usual what I call mundane suicide how hot it most people and counter [noise]\nUm basically in the mundane suicide I contend that you end up with your pain destroying the body mind that you're that you're mystery of soldiers\nI I contend that you end up with your pain destroying the body mind that you're that you're mystery of Seoul is living in but in the suicide that happened to me rather than the one that I was indeed mundane league going to do [noise]\nI saw my misery and my pain commit suicide and I remained\nAnd so this is one of my most intimate autobiographical tales of the\nWhole other dimensions of my life for all these years I've never known this\nWay I was I was I was walking through a golf course in San Pedro California I just come back from India and I was still in the tender opening kind of broke out of my shell of\nMany lives being with my my teacher in India for the first time and when I came back in the world the world that was not a place that supported this kind of individual flowering and it was having a very bad day\nAnd so I was walking down this beautiful beautiful a golf course adjacent to the trailer park because I Lived in\nA overlooking Santa Catalina island in San Pedro cliffs and that's what I was walking it just dawned on me as as I could just keep walking or beyond these cliffs and plummet down three hundred feet into the rocks\nAnd I was going to do it because suddenly ice had this amazing unexpected experience of\nLife and death suddenly being very tangible unclear\nI have to see how they're really one there really there are plenty of compliment trees or in our fear they're a play of terror and opposites but what was happening to me the feeling was I tried to describe it but it's beyond words really beyond belief\nIndeed it was like um it was descending on me faster than myself and I thought okay this is happening because I have made the decision to throw myself walk over this cliff\nIf I turn away from this I'm going to lose this amazing experiences overtaking me this mystery of life meeting death\nSo I saw this little eucalyptus tree and I sat up against and I said okay before I found myself over I just wanted to feel this and take this with me over the edge\nAnd so I sat there just going inside and feeling it at some point I felt this electrical energy just rise above the ground through the roots of the tree and throw me forward face down into the crab grass where I just began sobbing sobbing and suddenly\nAll of that thank God all of that so that otherwise I wouldn't be killing the human no not at all and uh\nAnd and there was this moment after I cried it all out I turned and there was a little eucalyptus trees and it was just shivering it sleeves and the Senate and the wind and it was just this moment where I realized the sky the earth tree\nExistence love me existence sees every thing that's created out of it as a phenomenal creation rising and falling as something absolutely integral significant\nAnd I had this feeling that\nSo much of what society does to make us feel insignificant when you go in and even at that moment of life meeting death insignificant becomes\nIn significant I it's so the story is really an a it's a it's a jump from what I usually right about but it's a whole other level of talking about these things that I haven't done since I did the ...\nHe jumped from what I usually right about the whole other level of talking about these things that I haven't done since I did the messiah is a book back in Nineteen Ninety nine sometimes my these books you see I I don't write these books they right they use me to write themselves and\nI had no idea until Anthony Bourdain died\nHow deeply he his his suicide how much he was loved and how many many people were shot in the story I talk about the moment that inspired me to write this book I mean the cashiers line\nAnd there's this old lady and she's doing something that looks like she's never done before she's pulled actually a magazine out of Iraq and looks at it and it's a people magazine a van seaboard Dane and I've watched how she touched his cheek on the picture the way she did it was so\nIntimate and beautiful and that's when I realized yeah I Love him just as much and I think I think I understand what he was going through he was not a man to believe or in\nFairy tales and imaginary stuff and that Santa Claus is going to save him from his ends and all that it's really pretty practice and and and and people like that when they die and I always feel there's a person that has the potential to become a an awakening one\nAnd I as I've been in my private life which I'm sharing more and more now in this period especially now when there's so much turmoil when there's so much\nUm Hangst and polarity my inner life now as a meditate or is now coming more and more into my work because it is is still ... point this\nCenter of silence in peace in the cycle of life that's becoming stronger and stronger that is what I can share with all of you with meditation the science of self observation\nIs is what what more and more I always thought my my work with them evil more and more and it's still prophetic but it's going to have more of my own authority through my own experiences\nSo huge on let's take some calls here in the ten minutes we got left Thomas in Iran with John Home Tom\nHi George thank you for taking my call and job while it's hard to follow your sharing of your experience on that but my question John yes for a person to walk in the world to be a participant in the world\nHow can they develop their own centered ness so to speak such that

suggest as my own experiences the meditation techniques that I've been using since Nineteen eighty [noise]\nAnd uh so my answer to that is if any of you listening to this resonate with what I've been saying [noise]\nEspecially with the issue suicide in life meeting death [noise] um I Am on a path where I can say there is a way to look beyond and not be touched you can be passionate and deeply into life but you're not overwhelmed ... you can be a Buddha and the marketplace but not of the marketplace of the world [noise]\nAnd that was what my teacher taught oh show and that is what I've lived

in my class sideline of the kids I think until it can get a box but it on the island world he was flooded out to the next kid there because they would open it up to slow down to the next day they put something in an decided down to the next ... tape it you know so that's what they did if I had plenty of time\nSo George I know how to Boston so I had gotten to the nightclubs and I believe this is a real prerequisite of what why this team and came to this house\nWhen you're doing one or two jobs John yeah\nI had that big a specialty that didn't take up much of my time at a two hour lines I didn't have papers to correct you know so I decided you know it gets going to do this too\nSo um yeah so uh uh ... you know people at night that they're looking for fun and a lot of 'em real stand up people but there was a certain percentage of people out in the dark side of things these people like a little wicked have looking for a cause the alcohol or drugs or commit adultery anything they can get their hands on\nAnd a good portion of these people were atheists they went to the coast a little bit me through it I can get along with anybody I can relate to anybody\nAnd this type of behaviors enemy bobbing factor but to us over the years I noticed that a lot of these people die from accidents car accidents\nAnd this type of behavior didn't even bother me back there but she was over the years I noticed that a lot of these people die from accidents like car accidents overdoses suicide Kansas and [noise]\nAnd I thought what these people and and I knew them you know but I felt that these people like ships in the night without a rider anyway this time it's taken though with a ... or the wind was blowing that was fine with them and they die in a state that I thought nobody should\nDie then we're the last rings unusually high yeah\nUnbelievable and so um yeah I just didn't think they knew how to live I mean that's another thing is focused and the teacher has it teaches you that knows I self you know knows I mean it's\nI'm not trying to be somebody else knowing their self means do you the truth about you you are what they do look at what you do analyze what you do then analyze what you believe about this stuff you might find it completely different person here I mean I had one friend I tried to get through this quick because I Know we want to get into\nHis name is Chris he was the boss and he worked right alongside and he was an atheist and the just to make fun of God used to make I mean he just used to make fun of the Virgin Mary\nI smoke and drank every night seven nights a week I didn't feel well they went to visit a doctor and he found you're already had four states can't\nOh she's so he couldn't work anymore so I tried to visit in between my you know go from the school my school job my night job or are we work together I mean it was like a friend you know I Know you had all these problems but\nYou didn't know what\nI Know it had this ... yeah it's about forty is in a in a few months and he died within a few months but I Would go visit them and I would try to talk to him about God but he wasn't interested at all he was even more fit in Georgia because of the diagnosis he had four I he died in such a terrible state he died in the state and I want you to die and uh\nI I felt like helpless form in my religion George were told that people fall into hell like snowflakes from the sky especially this no one to pray for them\nSo I started praying for him and all these other people that I knew and bonded with and they felt they were friends of mine and I would ask God you know don't send these cells to held it unless you go to hell until I finished praying for them\nNo matter how long it gives me on this planet no matter how many grains of sand they still got left an hourglass that's what I was going to do and I believe now that was the prerequisite of why this demon creature was compelled to assess my house and I feel that mosaic so your piece by piece right down there every single detail\nNo object what we can really engine will let me ask you this little John do this demon follow you to the house basically or was it already there\nAbsolutely not absolutely not I've never had like a and I've never you know I never ... invited to speak to here I never had to say on I never use a we he bought more I never use terror cause\nI mean I I Believe that opens the door for a creature like this to come in and then also just anybody does that because I now I think if you allowed to speak to come in and he'll feel you harm I think your permit him to do is worse you know you didn't have any other time\nIt had no there's no doubt if you view invited in each call me\nYeah that's what I Believe now but you did which is\nAbsolutely not true as I've learned a lot from it I learned that it is and has a methodology to discuss that too but the only other really other time [noise] ah well you know I thought that I worked in Michael that's why I wrote that book anyhow that's the best selling book and then if you're interested in any of that do have some funny stories about the rapper Chris Brown\nThat's that's the topic we don't touch [laughter] we do what we we don't we don't get into that topic oh okay [laughter] [noise] so anyway people probably why it too was basically what you've seen on the outside but go ahead\nYeah OK study on the other time that I ever\nAbout a person who encountered the demon\nOh yeah okay so the only other time that I ever knew about a person who encountered the demon that I Believe was because my brother my brother Paul he we had just a rare or a ... a blood disease that runs in the family and my my dad was unfortunate to get it\nAnd killed him very early in the sixties had a heart attack and died that same\nDay job I'd rather it was unfortunate for you to get it are you okay you get to choose me are you are right yet what with the ... disease I haven't\nI I've been checked with that yeah oh yeah or the doctor who well let me tell you what happened to pull you and I'll tell you so poorly wakes up and he has the same symptoms my dad had just fancy dollars nine one one they can they come and they take him to the hospital and\nAt the hospital he dies on hospital bed and when I went to visit him later on he fits me Johnny you know and I heard that he died on hospital bed that's what the doctors told me sit down and when I got on a hospital bed I left my body ... I left my body and I watched that doctors frantically at a nurse\n... trying to get me back to life again if they'd be late and not uncommon\nIn yeah and uh alarms going off and he said that when I talk about that fifth fifth dimension a spiritual dimension he stepped into that for him and he was still so he's still thought he was in the hospital room because he could see what was going on with his body\nIf it isn't that hospitable he said to me ... ... and it and then there was a dark side of that room he said and demons came from a small team is not like big ones like three foot four foot tall if they came to me\nAnd it was grabbed me and was starting to pull me into that dark area of the room which I which I say is to because they say they overlap sometimes and I believe that's where we overlap him\nThat's just imagine and ah they were dragging him into that talks romance Emily finally got him back to life he was able to get back into his body and he said to me Johnny why did he must come on that's really the fate of a person he said you know I understand that\nWhy would even go man I was like boy I really don't know uh I don't know if anybody but no I Know that you know all of us are raised the same way like I said you know got a religion of confirmed and our religion\nHe was too but he dropped out and okay I have to go to church anymore okay he met a woman he didn't really married to live with it OK yeah again I felt him you know you got kids or you never gave them a religion could anyone of your kids even ... one one prayer maybe it's probably not\nWell I well I don't know maybe get a big kick in your but sometimes when you when your passion to that fifth dimension you know to\nThat where it overlaps somehow on John we're at a break come back and talk\nTo ...
