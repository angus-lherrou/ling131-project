I mean to you know you're you're you're in a academia um you know where to science in it\n[noise] well I I've been doing a lot of reading in a and you know I'm not a scientist but I did I've done a lot of reading and quantum physics and\nAnd I talk a lot to uh I I have communication with folks that have passed on and and that happened randomly before but now I figured out a way to make it more regular but\nSo I've asked the awful lot of questions and I've done a lot of reading and I've met people like dean rating or just you know wonderful and very easy to talk to\nAnd explain difficult things and from what I understand what I Believe is that the the paranormal the paranormal world is actually the quantum world so by studying quantum mechanics and how that works I think I have a good idea of how the paranormal world works and I've come up with a model or\nIs it how I I fit in what what I understand to be going on and tell us with that model might be\nWell the idea is that uh that I okay\nI'll I'll I'll look at it this way so I ... in the morning I take these I I call them a a meditative walks so so when I'm walking my one way of looking at me and said I'm I'm a a a a a particle bean I I'm a bean physical being\nBut if you see that I'm I'm moving and if you look at uh like in in in fast motion or whatever I Would be like a blur so I'm really I'm a I'm a wave more than I Am a uh a particle being\nAnd I and my my location is is not just in one place so I kind of see that in the in the quantum world that's that's what it is everything is in wave form and we don't see the world that way because you know that some in the ... world but if you take it up to the macroscopic world than you think about\nThat ah that\nI I'm not in any one location and it and uh and and that's kinda\nHow how I see it and and I think that that helps me understand how how this works and the the other thing is these near death experiences that I've had a like for instance I think we have many forks and what I call forks and the road of time I talk about that in the book\nWhere we experience a maybe a near death experience or a close call and I've had a couple of those and in one dimension I think that's where it comes into you know a different dimensions\nI think that we we might die in that particular thing that that incident and another's we we live on is if that didn't happen uh and and sometimes we have knowledge of what the incident might have been or maybe sometimes we don't\nAnd uh and then we can have many of these forks in the road of time throughout our our our lives and keep going from one life to the next\n... but at the same time that we're doing that there's this spiritual part of us so there's actually two probably there's a physical form and then there's the spiritual form or that that is eternal and that's where I come up with the uh the title of the book which is timeless that that we don't really ever\nDie\nAnd in ... you have documented thirty four ... cases that happened to you have there\nYeah ah [laughter] there there's a lot more and I have I've already written the second book he'll come out next year I call it timeless deja vu\nAnd uh I have twenty eight more experiences and I I I I kinda wanted to test the waters with the first book how can I say I saved some of the more well I'll just say a little bit more bizarre stuff for the second book based on the reaction of the first one\nWell sounds like we're going to have you back about the same time next year huh\nAnd I and I yeah I plan to release it about you know the late summer early fall and and then I I also have a third book plan too so I I there's a lot of the incidents the they keep happening\nI I was going to ask you how deja vu because we'll save a lot of it for the next book but ah you had mentioned the experiences where you know\nYou may have died in one life but not and another do you think that sometimes we might have memory of other existence is in other parallel universes and that's why we have deja vu\nI I I Believe so in fact uh I I remember as a as a kid and this is interesting because I think children are very open to the spirit world or the paranormal world but third ... that's kind of over the years it's kind of a through our education system or sometimes maybe by their parents are different\nOrganizations that's kind of a you know drained out of them\nBut I remember as a kid thinking I Wonder if I've already died and I'm somebody else now I think I Am and it's and and I don't necessarily remember a previous life experience from that but I I remember thinking that a lot I mean a lot\nAnd uh so I I I think that's interesting that that children have those those are those kinds of feelings but I'll give you an incident that happened just recently with me and my son we were driving here in Southern California and on a sub surface streets and I\nI look down just momentarily I don't know what it was something that dropped onto the floor of monument or whatever and I looked up and when I looked up and I thought it was just a split second here I was hurdling through a red light\nOh and it was it was terrible\nAt it and how old's your son\nOr he's he's Eighteen okay and he's sitting in the in the passenger seat and freaky no yeah he he is and\nWe're going through the intersection and on either side of this is a car you know two cars coming right at us so what was going to happen that I can see was that we were going to get T bone from both sides and just you know ... a pinch between the two\nUh and uh at that moment everything's slowed down ... everything's slowed down and it was if I had all the time in the world to figure out how I was going to\nManeuver your way around a\nYeah and the next thing I Know I I I maneuver through and next thing I Know we're on the other side there was hockey and going on in the cars went and everybody was safe and a time got back to normal speed again and then I I think that\nI think what what happens is that we had we had glimpse the quantum world at that point in in the quantum world and in the paranormal world as my spirit friends have told me there there is no ... there's no future it's all just\nAn eternal now and and that\nThat's what I felt like and I and then I thought this is probably this is an example of a fork in the road of time 'cause it another dimension which we might have had this horrible accident\nIn ... knows it it it potentially at least the potential forty five miles an hour oh at each other like that uh you know that there could have been people killed and it's at least seriously injured and uh and\nWe were unscathed than so or the other two cars thank God but um so it so I I I that is what I'm Talking about and I've had other experiences that you know when I was younger I I at eight years old I had another\nIt's where I I uh uh was playing around it was in ah I'm up at the steps you pass I'm from Washington state and deception passing the north end up with the island there is a a to bridge bands that go from the mainland too with the island the north end and there's a middle island called pass island\nAnd we always used to stop there when when we went camping and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you could overlook the narrow channels that\nThat that separate the island from the mainland and\nI was running around and of course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak up for the yeah the exactly ... and I was running right towards the cliff and I remember running off the cliff and then everything was I was just like suspended in in in in\nIn mid air was like everything stopped\nAnd once again I felt this this light in the warm\nAnd the next thing I knew it was like of everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion I was back on the trail and my dad was grabbing my shoulders and was yelling\nAt somebody's watching Uber's there's a there's some helpers out there for you I Want to come back in a moment we'll talk more about some of these others thirty three experiences you had a or any of them demonic we'll be
