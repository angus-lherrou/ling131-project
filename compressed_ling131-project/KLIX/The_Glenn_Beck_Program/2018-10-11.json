early\nThat leaves me seven\nChange your life from having until ten news radio\nThirteen to ... news in talk on the radio\nNews radio deems a ally acts\nThe name of the book is Christians in the age of outrage and it is very Frank it talks about ah what Christians can and should do and also have not done and how we're actually hurting ourselves\nUm you talk about our God really kind of being identity NOW News claim that ad\nOpenly we've kind of as a nation moved ourselves into factions and what I don't want is Christians to be a faction in a world of factions [noise]\nUm I think that's the part of the problem but but I think you know people identify themselves as you know I'm I'm this or that I've got a social media community and and and then that faction sort of becomes identity becomes a faction the faction becomes an echo chamber\nAnd then ultimately are we the volume just goes up up up up in the anger just goes up up up up and and we can't survive I think as a nation\nFactional ... at this level eventually all Balkan eyes to use the term but history will kind of break apart and so I think the ultimate thing is I I Can't you can't solve all the political things you're you've got much bigger platform talking about politics than I Do I'm just trying to help Christians to say All right how do we react\nTo how do we respond and the answer is is not to take our identity from anything other than king Jesus and and and again I Know that's overtly spiritual but we're talking here in this\nIn his focus I mean so it's to take out any fucking Jesus Jesus is not coming back on air force one he's not riding a donkey or an elephant when he does\nAnd to acknowledge that I'm only all in as a Christian in following Christ and everything else is shaped around that my identity is more to Christ in his kingdom that's kind of our motto here we can college my identity is more to Christ in his kingdom than anything else\nSo I explain this yesterday that um you know the the so called Christians of the Westboro Baptist church\nYou know they they hold up signs you know God hates this Scott hates that blah blah blah they're just despicable you don't win by by holding up signs no God hates view and shouting things back you win by ...\nBeing by him racing them as a civil or a brother and sister not do what they're doing\nStanding up but people have been changes one woman in particular that actually left her own family in the Westboro Baptist church because somebody spoke to her with civil civility and said let's just reason here for a minute\nYeah that's okay I got on my desk actually right every Arab front of me a name played because they actually protested at my church we went out and serve them coffee and doughnuts and they called me and the national news\nI Can't use one of the words probably on the radio but I'll lying deep false prophet and so it's actually one of my staff made into a name played it says it says lined Blanco false prophet Westboro Baptist church which by the way it's either wrap that he was either Baptist church\nBut but in doing so I mean the question is how do we respond well somebody reached out actually interviewed or the members of the family as well a Christian Today to somebody reached out\nAnd I will tell you I think that's what we can do right now with people who deeply disagree with us in\nThe book is filled with examples of Christians who actually build relationships with people who radically disagreed\nAnd in the process where able to come to maybe a better understanding I Want examples for example is a is the president by all university which is a Christian university in California\nAre met with the kind of the leader of the uh the party and say legislature there in California\nThat was trying to change laws that would make it illegal for ... to live their Christian beliefs about marriage sexuality and more only ended up getting to understand each other better the will of the bill was ultimately not moved forward was dropped and and and now we're to very different place now\nI'm not saying you can always do that but I Am saying that Christians need to try to do that\nAnd I do think that in doing so well liked a lot more like Jesus or even this how about a lot more like Christians\nHistorically because of the moment we're in is not time for us to join in ratcheting up the outrage and\nAnd as you said earlier to your caller I'm calling people to arms yet that's not I mean that that's not an uncommon view and I know some of the some of the worst things I see on social media I I click on a lake and I find go to the bio and it's the first things listen the thing is Christian and I'm like that's not what it's supposed to look like\nAnd I think that's what we need is a change and a lot of hearts\nI Will tell you this the ones who can teach us this right now or the the victims of ISIS and the ones who were were literally chained\nOr as slaves or you know story after story after story of these Christians\nWho I mean I Know one family that actually wrote to ISIS after they said you're all dead were coming Saturday to kill you\nI'm a I think it was on I think it was on Sunday we're going to come on Sunday and kill you or if you don't submit and we're gonna crucify you the family sat down kids at all and wrote a letter and said we understand we forgive you for that\nWe're not we're not going to leave we'll be here you can come at three o'clock we only ask that you do not crucify us it it it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death\nAnd they lived because they stood up with Peter unbelievable what's happening\nAnd we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was this emperor fascinating ever called Julian the apostate I write about this in the book and he he actually he's called the apostate 'cause you know victors right the history and the Christians eventually became more prominent\nAnd and here's what he writes 'cause he's so angry about are trying to hold back the advance of course that he's a pagan\nOr they just gobbled up a whole foods right now and when they did kroger's stock went from thirty one dollars a share to twenty two [laughter]\nThat's how big this company is wow they're going to be a the largest clothing retailer by twenty twenty uh they're already so more votes than anybody on earth they've driven how many uh book retailers out of business\nUm and they're they're about to spend more on original programming than even Netflix or they're going to be the biggest Hollywood producer\n[laughter] just so many things is it time to I mean I don't know what you do about it do you favor as the capital is breaking up a company that's what they did to Microsoft is what they did to a or they try to to Microsoft\nThat's what they did with mountain bell um\nGive it mountain bill was in with the government I mean that was that was protected by the government and part of a you know that was\nThat was a protected property you couldn't you couldn't start anything against them\nRight that's why yeah I mean you know you could start your own Amazon you're not going to be able to compete on what they thought there are other options you know there are other options that just ... you know the problem is Amazon does everything better than everybody else you know this is a
