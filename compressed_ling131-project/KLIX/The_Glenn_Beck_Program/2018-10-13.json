credit home equity line of credit means you're pledged your house for that line of credit [noise] um and this is a method of getting a second mortgage on your home basically a\nIs it worth having or should I avoid it will die and we tell folks to avoid that we try to take it the other way we want you to get rid of your heat lock your home equity line of credit if you have\nOn she could reverse mortgage if you have one we want you to get out of bed because when you don't have any payment you know what you have\nMoney the bar or a slave to the lender so no we don't recommend home equity lines of credit and bar Paul is on Facebook is there a mileage limit you use as a rule of thumb one buying a used\nCar um\nKnow what I'm trying to determine is is the caller\nOut to the point is going to give me trouble so the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is the more the miles would affect it\nOther words a hundred thousand miles dodge neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes like one is used up and the other one is just getting started at that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that money on at that point\nI Know they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay it's not called smart anymore so I just give you that example said no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built let's say a higher in nicer vehicle uh they're typically well bill I mean again a Honda Alexis a Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac\nUm the larger body Ford products forge building a great product a truck a Chevy Truck for truck with a hundred thousand miles on that one thing\nAnd the the I'm more of an economy car it is quote\nUnquote the ah the more than ... miles would have a negative effect on it um because I'm just I'm just really don't know how can I just I'm looking for is dependability and how much life is left in it that's a cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin how are you\nHey they look up Sherman what's up\nI'm Seventeen years ago on a high school senior I've got about three thousand dollars and I mean the count out donating shut eye in bed and I knew what China and\nYou're going to college\nYeah community college within a cause for entertainment and olive tree\nOkay so you're only going to do two years\nAnd years and then ending on how the program or maybe ... service ... five of the Caribbean I keep them at the community colleges is either a new ad out in the workforce\nNow you know I Will be true if you get some search someone certifications and stuff and not the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that [noise]\nOkay so that's what you want to do you won't be programmer you want to be an hour or whatever Mm okay uh and the community college is paid for as long as you keep an eye plus um you can invest it or here's\nThe thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment mutual fund\nLike on a scale of one to ten and a nine point nine finish college and all your education was the road that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money\nTo finish your schooling and that's much much you dust and as a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\nField of study that you can you know really make some good money and and\nYou know getting that level of education is really gonna cause your income to go be a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so um you know you're the best investment we can make much better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds and I you know made I talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not\nPut it in a retirement account to stage a what this amount of money in your situation because again my main goal for you is your friend is for you to get your degree\nAnd your field of study whether it's a two year whether it's certifications in the tech field or or whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools in your belt the educational tools in your belt for you to be able to deliver your dream without any that and that three thousand dollar spent on\nIs more important than but then the mutual fund so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out and use it for college if you're going to go that route [noise] if you need to thanks for calling open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago and Mike how are you\nI'm great Dave it's an honor to speak with you you too sir what's up in your world\nFilm my wife and I are currently on baby step forward because her than for retirement and we're using the excess and our budget to pay off our mortgage early and we're both teachers and the state run pension take nine percent of our grows take home pay our dilemma is when we have an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that nine percent that we already contribute\nWe don't have much left over from all agree to fill ration so when we save the thicker than we're able to save a lot for a mortgage coloration though is it okay to do that around recommended saving the twenty four percent\nNow that the mandatory amount that you're putting in are you ... are you invested in that is that uh\nIs that a pension get the answer is no options are just mandatory its pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on sixty seven or okay uh innocent nine percent nine percent\nYeah okay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct correct\nI probably would split the difference because I don't like the pension we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run\nThrough its horribly wrong state and now we're bending them those guys [laughter]\nAh yeah no thank you so\nBut what I count some of it yeah cow some of it I'm not going to count it as a whole new line what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we count as a for then that means we need to put it in ten percent right\nYou got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean likelihood is I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension in Illinois it's just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere it'd be there\nYou know so um that that that's the truth and you know that show a\nGiven that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit or show and just round numbers let's put in ten percent instead of putting them Fifteen Percent on top or something like that and I went to celebrate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but it was a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction show um\n[noise] um\nYou
