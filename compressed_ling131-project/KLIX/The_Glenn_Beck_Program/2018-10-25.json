radio Thirteen to ...\nThey must be ice skating on the legs of fire and held today [noise]\nBecause hell has frozen over a made a member of the media has now actually admitted that he shouldn't have dismissed Juanita broad rex accusation against a Bill Clinton\nNow this is coming from a columnist for the Washington Post where his name is Richard Cohen he's worked at the post in Nineteen sixty eight\n[noise] and he just wrote an opinion piece titled I thought Juanita Broderick was incredible\nI was wrong\nNow ... Broderick is the woman who alleges that Bill Clinton raped her when he was running for Arkansas governor in Nineteen Seventy eight but since the me too movement exploded over a year ago there's been a title shift in the culture culminating in the tug of war over allegations during the Kavanaugh hearings\nNow one of the biggest takeaways from those hearings according to those on the left is that you always must believe the victim during the hearings Anita Hill was once again in the spotlight brought up over and over again and her accusations against Clarence Thomas universally believed to other media\nIt somehow some of Bill Clinton's accusers still haven't been extended the same sympathy as Dr Blasey Ford and need a hill\n... that's really why is it so unusual to hear a Bill Clinton supporter admit that they may have been wrong about Broderick it's Twenty years later now this has been obviously influenced by the me too\nSays she wasn't a victim is now the victim and Broderick who is always claimed it was not consensual I was raped she's ignored\nCohen says it might have something to do with Broderick bring being a Trump supporter\nCome on I couldn't have anything to do with it fell on rights\nI remember refusing to deal with the Broderick allegations because I simply chose to believe Clinton was not a rapist my position has proved naive\nLet me ask you a question unlike\nBroderick who had all of the evidence had witnesses unlike Keith Ellison who the witness is very credible has nothing to gain everything to lose the evidence is overwhelming\nThose two things you can look at and you can say there's evidence there you'd shoot you chose to ignore it\nWith Kavanaugh there was no evidence\nBut if suddenly there was a bunch of evidence and it was presented I Would be fine with saying wow okay new information looks like Kavanaugh did it why is it that no one on the left is willing to do that\n\nWhether dealing with Clinton or the Kavanaugh cases all political camps should tread carefully\nIn their certainty about the truth certainty always seems to get us into trouble requires a huge dose\nOf something more elusive than the truth to be able to survive today and that is humility Cohen seems to be exercising humility and for that I think the Washington Post\nColumnist thank you\nFor being willing to step out of the crowd go against maybe some of your peers and say you know what I think we were wrong about this one thank you Richard Cohen\nIs a pretty big moment for recently went over the details that Broderick accusation like they have her on\nYeah she she would come on I think um she it was interesting to see that because I honestly the same thing had some similar reaction to it at the time or in which a lot of the accusations about affairs and stuff seem to credible but you know rapist I mean the\nThe accusation was really brutal above it half the time she had five\nCooperating witnesses that she told at\nThe time uh she talked about seeing a I think it was a prison\nOr in the outside of the window ... um which was confirmed that prison was there she was confirmed to be at this nursing cameras that was there he was in town\nLike I mean there was a lot of it was on like the she knew that she knew what hotel it was at a and she knew the time period I don't know if you know the exact date but everything else you had pretty much locked down pretty ... I Will tell you\nI always found her credible I found her more credible than anybody else\nAnd the ... and the real shocking that Glenn is not only is that the case with technology and the prevalence but among young people where it's most prevalent Eighteen to twenty four year old men now the numbers show that\nThey view it as a morally acceptable choice or indifferent to it a majority so so what can I tell you something\nI mean ... era guy you're being told you can't look at women are sexually you can't notice what they're wearing you a\nRape is completely undefined I mean you know I asked you out you said no I asked you out a second time and now I hear rapist yeah Murray [laughter] I mean it's it's crazy and confusing\nAnd I don't know you know as a as a twenty something boy or a Seventeen year old boy what on\nEarth and who would argue with the consequences for it right like it's just yeah I Do I have my not getting real that by anybody I'm not getting in trouble with anybody I mean\nThis round Iran's phrase not consequences for it right yeah not at all um I mean the the the pastors that are in this core some you may remember Glenn I don't know if you know Doug Wilson but he um he got famous because he was debating Christopher Hitchens he went around and he was the he was the Apollo just print apologies that went around him and\nAnd so and so he lays that all out about how you know destructive this really is to relationships and how is the silent killer because there's a stigma with with pornography like if you go into you know your church is your testimony and there's some sort of you know like a drug addiction or something like that you know there's a lot of sympathy for you and and people\nYou know roll out the record but there's you know if you come up and you're the porn guy right now it's like you don't how many how many how many times have you seen that testimony or church how am I Am that he's never seen it right and so and so and actually the numbers in the study showed that even church leaders are falling victim to to this so I Know there's a reason why they're not bringing it up there there's a fear that\nAnd actually the numbers and the studies show that even church leaders are falling victim to to this so I Know there's a reason why they're not bringing it up there there's a fear that they're going to be found out too\nBut I Know in you know in in in my church\nAnd you know my church is a good way to to [laughter] I don't do we drink milk [laughter] and it's the number one reason families are breaking up is the number one cause of of problem is pornography and starts out as pornography and it just spirals out of control\nSay too if you're if you're ... you know if you're having a porn addiction issue like you're probably not going to want to stand up in front of your right because the stigma is big\nI think it's interesting about what you've done here is like ... that the same way that\nIt the negatives of what has happened with porn which is the stigma has been taken away 'cause you could just do it online or on what I like this course that you have is kind of the same it takes away the stigma of having to admit it necessarily you can kind of go through and and hear these things without having to stand up for it in front of your church I don't either neighbors of honestly I mean I Know you're ready\nI Know it's really uh I Know it's I understand the stigma\nBut it's the same kind of stigma as you would have as a as an alcoholic twenty five years ago after um there's ... it is this is natural as you said God gave us the sex drive and it is different between men and women\nAnd men are driven by their eyes it just we just are we're very visual women or not is visual is we are when it comes to sex and so there's\nIt's it's normal heat is normal yeah you would have this Dr what makes us not an animal is trying to say okay some of that is good some of the too much of this is bad right\nRight and and what we're doing is like I said we're pressing the reset button and showing you where God has laid out because cultures gone so off the rails and it's that's part of that's been infused in the church I mean even the stuff you lead inside you know the stuff we allow ourselves to watch I mean as you can talk about pornography and say oh hard core pornography yes that's pornography but where do you watch it on Instagram which feeds are you looking at\nI mean his Instagram not like the women in bikinis showing their butts right now I mean like only when I got in the rain when you're just rolling that all the way through I mean you know not be considered part I think I think some people can make that case they make a strong case\nThis is an argument that you know my wife and I have all the time\nA because there's almost nothing that you could watch on you know Netflix or Amazon yeah that unless it's an old TV series or something there's almost nothing that you can watch that doesn't have this you know so you know click click click you know just go ahead\nAnd and um you know fast forward through some of that crap and that's the argument is on my wife like don't stop watching we have stopped watching is honey let's just zip ahead of this\nPart you know but [noise] is that right right is that right you know it's not because it is the cost like how does it have our recommendations for filters is it\nAbout that type of thing with me we we mentioned those things because they're good like having Internet filters in accountability partners and you know things are good but what we do is we really just try to get to the heart of it because\nThose things are band aids they're they're right the Bible says our hearts are deceitful above all out and so it's your your heart's gonna find a way if you're still desiring that your heart's gonna find a way around your filter you're going to find another device you're going to know how to\nDo this and that to get around it and we tried to rewire your heart and show you what God\nIf we give you a positive vision to shoot for you can't just say don't do it right through it right\nTo give me some of the stats um while I'm you know two thirds of all Christian men have you'd porn monthly they admit that I I Would assume too that if that's the admitted to number it's tirelessly either [laughter] it's probably not\nOr in monthly they admit that I I Would assume too that if that's the admitted to number it's tires and we I mean\nThat's probably I actually just to hold on higher I think it was something like I don't have one in six church leaders have admitted to struggling with this that's church while you're sick and so you know nine percent of churches only ... only nine percent of churches actually have resources dedicated and and\nI and I believe because ... is is just you know me sort of projecting this you know I'm guessing this but because of that and the ramp and you know numbers that are here I think that there's probably a little bit of fear and some of these leaders because they feel hypocritical you know coming out and saying let's fight this thing because they know they're struggling with with themselves but I'll give you one more\nUm ah kids are being exposed to porn I mean my kids went on Syria the other day and actually said something and they missed under Syria misunderstood and came back with like a sexual thing um and my son was like what's that all about\nAnd I'm so kids are accidentally or intentionally getting exposed to pornography as young as ten and eleven years old and they're getting married later so now think about that if you start getting into porn at ten eleven twelve years old and it becomes a habit for you\nUm and then you don't get married until you're twenty eight or twenty nine years old you've been poisoning your brain now in how you view women for ... you know two thirds of your life to surge of your life\nAnd an hour and a dating these people to to be a good husband\nThen it takes more and more to excite you\nYes I mean it just it is a gateway fits the gateway it is you start with corn and and we we look at it fairs and that's the other thing that ... where does that usually START I didn't start just one day you wake up and say I'm going to have an affair with my secretary [laughter]\nJust started in the house and your phone you know and like and we can talk about this but I guarantee you our voices right now we're hitting the numbers don't lie the numbers don't lie we're hitting you were not hitting your neighbor were not hitting somebody else I guarantee you there's somebody sitting in their car listening to this and it and it's hitting home right now because it's the silent killer and you've been walking around with that\nWould that shame and guilt and so that's why we made this course set free course dot com because you know God wants you to be free from this he he wants you to live in you know shame free guilt free from this and he's given you the tools to fight it and so that's what we want to\nThank you very much Dan thank you thank you for having me\nYeah he is he doing something with his life [laughter]\nAfter the\nSet free course dot com is the place to go get it and the Israel thing is coming up to where we have the ... documentary I was talking to Dan a little bit earlier today about some of the experiences of seeing the media as they covered the Palestinians versus the way they cover the Israel isn't an old to go over there now over the\nMedia and yet that's what this documentary became because the media was if you didn't stay with the gaggle you actually knew actually observe something above the gaggle down that they're just never aware of\nWell and and even more shocking line is when the gavel so they're they get the story wrong I mean it was unbelievable to me you know 'cause we went there to watch from you know actually do what the other presidents didn't zoo and open the the us embassy there in in Jerusalem and so\nUm that's what we were therefore but then what we saw was how the media can talk to the narrative that's completely false um said I'll

whenever a missile or rocket is launched\nInto Israel because we wanted to follow okay there's a rocket falling down right where we're going to go find where they are and so I downloaded this out and

this I'm shocked that they don't say\nAcne back me bomb on it pipe bombs are made from Steele why\nThe reason steel is used to because the entire purpose of the bomb is to utilize the steel shrapnel went in explodes you put the explosive inside the pipe when it blows up the pipe breaks up and you have shards that terror people apart\nWell [noise]\nThe attacker who\nThe press is saying it has a real level of sophistication\nWhat world vis attacker who I'm giving the code name Wylie coyote\nHas made his bomb out of plastic PVC pipe plastic so when it blows up it vapor rises the plastic it defeats the entire purpose\nAlso the devices had protruding wires coming out of the PVC pipe was a big ridiculous looking digital timer tapes to it\nAgain this is not something you go on the Internet it never shows you to build a bomb this way all the wires and the detonator usually concealed inside the pipe\nI don't know goes through an x-ray machine you see a big metal pipe\nProbably is not gonna make it to whoever it is you're sending unless you're sending it to their home but if you have a long pipe Blake thing\nAnd it shows wires and in the X ray or you can see that there is a timer on the outside it's definitely not going anywhere this is Wylie coyote leaving eight overly large sticks of dynamite with a big alarm clock lashed to it\nHe or she had a had sent 'em some of these bombs to home offices and and residences where there wouldn't be the screening rather than sending them through like the congressional uh mail service which would definitely be\nSchool can I tell you something I Know this is true because ah I've seen pictures and you can just imagine Hillary Clinton coming out in her bathrobe and fuzzy slippers with a cigarette hanging from\nThe get the paper in the mail every day when she gets up whose home do they go to the they did have a Scranton ... both of them have private security course or slower service at their home right\nThat they did have a

address again like it was just the coverage and that was one of their they were saying that this was I guess Debbie Wasserman Schultz ah they send it enough she is I mean she's not even in Congress anymore right so\nAh but she they sent her to the office or that it was sent back to her office they said was one that would maybe not have screening I don't I didn't I didn't fact\nCheck their claim but that was what they were attempting to ah to pass off a sophistication I I've never built a bum no one don't intend to in my life um but it\nWould you say it or that you would make it plastic to get past screening because we put a big metal pipe is going to be more obvious right if you did it if you did it to get past screening\nThat's good but that shows that you have no idea what you're even do you're not even but you're you're there you have a very low IQ or your uh or your ... you know a a a young kid that just thought it was funny uh I I don't even know but\nThe shows that you do not understand why a pipe bomb is destructive\nThe answer is no a plastic PVC pipe bomb it will not get it it'll still be detected because and that's why he had to in my opinion that's why I had the wires and the big ridiculous basically equivalent alarm clock tasted a stupid thing\nBecause like you you you've seen like at the airport like sometimes you're like hey maybe I can slip in this bottle of water you know like ... you know like if there is no slipping this past the screening right like that ... that I think to the other two things that back this up\nAre one or ... you made it in in a way that was so none of them blew up right like you said ten bombs run the country none of them explode right like so it seems to be that maybe you didn't want them to explore possibly\nThe other part is why do you put a sticker with me on their jobs and less it's not going to explode and people are gonna be able to write and I want to get into that and I also want to ask the question why would you put an alarm clock on it\nIn the mail if yeah I don't know when it's going up you don't know why is there a clock on this thing\nSo we get to that in just a second\nTo tell you about simply safe I'm

Trump I'm a\nMocks media as explosives investigated\nWell late ... you guys were blaming Trump mocking Trump yesterday before all of the bombs or even found you were blaming it on him\nWithout CNN as there is really irresponsible he was gone over Ella edge they worked a target of this and when you're in the middle of it sometimes you don't make rational decisions you know that's no excuse for soccer but not for someone who's running a news organization now he wrote\nA there's a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media the president especially the White House press secretary should understand there was words matter that's far they have shown no comprehension of that and it's I think it's a fair criticism at times and we made it um I don't like everything that he says about the media but\nWe have no evidence no evidence at all the rhetoric or anything else fed into these bombings we have no idea we have no idea who did them we have no idea what the motivation was yes I mean I think you could probably say there's a political motive but that's clearly a political motive but that's all you could say\nYou don't know it has such\nThese bombs or so ridiculous\nThat it was either done by somebody who is mentally inefficient or it's somebody who didn't want to bombs to go off yeah\nThe sticker the ISIS me right either done that clearly marks that as somebody from the right why would you put that on there\nAnd why did none of them go off right I mean again you hope gun glad none of them went off by the way um but it it seems to indicate someone who wanted these things to be seen every single part of this that we've\nWould be on that if you're gonna have to look at this in some ... with some level of skepticism\nTo try to understand we're a week before\nAn election right or less than two weeks at least\n... you know the idea that that the the left would be victimized by this hatred of Donald Trump there's an obvious incentive\nTo make America ill that way right now that does not mean that this was someone trying to frame the right absolutely could be there are no jobs on the right that could do that and probably many of them stupid enough to get none of the bombs go off\nIt's certainly possible but they are acting as if you have to be Alex Jones to not believe this is Donald Trump's fault you do not have to be Alex Jones to look at this with some skeptical lie you not to say that\nYou know that that that it's a it's a ... year proving anything but you have to at least keep your mind open to the idea that there are no jobs on both sides with crazy motivations in a intense time look what they said the freaking Kavanaugh people saying he was a gang rape is to stop it\nHere's a here's amazing thing do you remember the time right after nine eleven for the first few years\nWhen something would be saying something would happen\nAnd we would hope that it was

this is just a an outside influence yeah probably not now but we're not even considering it we have zero evidence of anything\nAnd every one is the media is just condemning the right you have no

cartoon world yeah they're ridiculous ridiculous they they they're so inept that they can make a buck they don't even understand why you wouldn't use plastic for a pipe bomb that that much to CNN's

don't get drummed out of society if you if you're if you're a Chris Rock because everybody knows that your motivation is not this deep hatred of racism another example it's always sunny in Philadelphia\nIs a is the longest running a live action sitcom in us history\nFourteen season's going outside of the fourteenth season\nAt least once and I think twice they don't entire episode where whether white characters were in blackface K now their main motivation as\nLiberals right their motivation is to show that racism is really dumb and their characters are really dumb and their dressing up this way and they're showing how stupid they are and making the point that they think\nBut they actually did it on camera multiple episodes this is a liberal icon of our program OK\nTotally okay for them to do it\nBut for her to question it and say if it's a positive motivation is that okay well I don't remember I don't remember a lot of an outcry from the leftover it's always sunny in Philadelphia doing it multiple times they did an entire episode ... which is one of the greatest television\nEpisodes of any series of all time called the gang turns black and they have a situation where they all wake up well after getting the electric or getting struck by lightning and they're all black and I have to live as black people for the day and they will go up to an orderly amazing but beyond that\nIt is something that there's been no pushback on look at things like family guy you'll see the you know the animation but still the same types of things happen\nBecause they believe and we all kind of like well the motivation there is that he's that they're not trying to be racist and upstarting trying to say black people are inferior or anything like that they're doing this to make a point of the other side we think their motivation is good so that's okay what she's saying here is if the motivation is good let's say a child for example who thinks\nThey want to dress up as a hero of there's a happens to be black and they don't want to die in the mix right you want to be black and white they don't understand the dynamics of blackface they would think OK well and you think the kids not racist their motivation is they're trying to look up to a hero and that's the only point you bring up\nTalk to the other branch you need to arrest him an exile him the other branch did so two branches of the government ousted him said that's not what we do we don't want to be a Hugo Chavez Venezuela okay\nHe said ever since then we Hondurans have lived in chaos many things try to buy a ... and his a party to liberate which translates to Freedom Party\nTo destabilize our country this is just the latest stunned and fill a a a blames America\nAnd has also made America is now reaping what its own type statements\nHe has said that America must take in the migrants because America has supported the current administration that he now claims that has caused all of the misery that we as Hondurans are living through\nThis is why they're marching with a Honduran flag because they blame us for their misery\nThis is nothing more she writes than a strong arm tactics to embarrass both Honduras and America sadly the migrants were lied to and had been told that America must accept them in\nIn one news report a lady who was interviewed told the Honduran reporter that they were promised buses to travel once they got to Guatemala but there were no buses waiting on them that I could tell from the report some of the migrants have returned home\nOne twenty two year old man died in Mexico for reasons unknown as of yet this is really sad and frustrating because many migrants ... a has\nBeen a had been told that they will get in and they will get jobs once they arrive in America and therefore many are good with the hopes of a better life\nHowever these are types of situations that criminals\nAre a might have been the organizers of the march will take advantage of please keep spreading the truth about the situation I enjoy all of your content and you're a podcast thanks for being a truth teller\nIn a world of lies God Bless you and the family at the blaze for all that you do\nFrom someone who lives and was born and raised in Honduras that is verifying exactly what we were we're being told what we can do you know just as [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nYou know I was gonna say you know as reporters and then I was going to say no we're not really reporters and then thought of journalists 'cause they're not really a journalist but then I thought of ...\n\nHe's a he's a journalist with the Washington Post you know and it's that everyone keeps saying I I think columnist would be more accurate uh well he wrote five five five columns for the Washington Post that of course makes you a journalist does it ... five ... I mean you probably written five ... columns here to have\nPlaces like the rest of her I I did something for the Washington Post at one point to them and also now you're a journalist that journalists are doing their jobs\nMe news organizations don't want to tell you what's really going on but this is what's\nJournalists aren't doing their jobs the ... me news organizations don't want to tell you what's really going on but this is what's really going on with that caravan\nUm we hope to have Michael Yon before the end of the program today to talk a little bit about what they're doing about this in the Congress and the Senate and what the president can do\nA and how we can hold Mexico accountable and these other countries accountable if they just passed their problem on to us I feel for on doors\nBecause these guys are the guys who are causing trouble in their own country they're having to deal with these guys all the time\nAnd our press is not duped by them\nThis is why it's hard to defend the press when they say we're not an enemy of the people\nYeah yeah I agree you're not an enemy of the people but you are definitely an enemy of the truth and whether that is intentional or you are just unbelievably\nA lacking all curiosity all natural curiosity you just start unbelievable in how a daddy inside you are on trying to find anything other than what people are just telling you in the next cubicle\nWhat you all just are agreeing on oh look at this bombs come in there's ten of them none of them have gone off they're they're they're not even pipes there's they're PVC pipes\nThat defeats the reason of having a pipe bomb you want the shrapnel of the middle of the pipe as it blows up well yes but they put glass inside a glass glass is not the same as ball bearing you put metal not glass you put metal in these things\nPlus\nThe wires are on the outside and they go to a timer a tie him or why would you have a timer for something you have delivered through the mail\nWhere do you expect somebody to open it up and then like I guess I should set this for two minutes\nOr is it doesn't make any sense the kind of seems like that's what happened with um with the George Soros one someone else picked it up from his mailbox opened it up I saw that it was some device walked over to the woods and put it down then called the police and the police came and blow it up right but I mean that's like\n... if this was a a bomb that was supposed to be triggered by being opened doesn't seem that to me that there's a timer on it you think it's a it's a time bomb but you don't have the time through the mail\nIs ... very strange ridiculous uh let me go to Kim in Virginia who is a US mail carrier or hello Kim\n[noise] Hey Ryan I'm actually from outside of Charlottesville [laughter]\nOh what a hateful racist even those\nThat are sitting on the other hand yeah well I I just want to point out that the guys who organized that in Charlottesville we're from Florida so just\nIn my family I took my family both trying to catch not because we want to be a part but I wanted my kids to share that might you not gonna learn history unless they go to these patients so wow well anyway sorry why can't anyway yeah on a mail carrier and about three years [noise] um [noise] I don't\nMind that if in ... in the mail every incentive to mail at all um extradite threes hit the

are they getting Americans it's not the postal service well the one that I saw the picture I shouldn't say all\nThere was one today that was found in the uh postal office in Delaware I think as you say that yeah so but I I I I Wonder the same thing I look for the cancellation cancellation\nWas supposedly delivered by career which will be completely from the U.S protests\nAre yeah yeah 'cause
