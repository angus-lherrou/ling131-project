going to go crazy because Mike Lee is a member pro life uh and he would vote for him in the bottom line is he cares about the constitution that anything I mean who will vote he will vote the

in his hearings yeah and you know the New York times laid them out\nAnd ridiculous detail yeah and we should go through each one of them because I I Would like because there was an idea that if there is let's say he perjured himself which is one of the things a lot of people are starting to throw around now they're starting to say well he perjured himself he lied as I say he was trying to paint himself in the best possible they will she perjured himself that maybe he did I don't know I mean I\nThat's the number one meaning but that's the number one I have never heard of that but to funneling

this is the interesting point here they're trying to say this is essentially perjury there's no way that's perjury to me that is a bonkers\nClaim the idea that knew that word probably meant different

building actually as a\nAgain the lists of potential perjury or from for judge Kavanaugh um the next one is excessive drinking judge Kavanaugh portrayed himself in his testimony has enjoying a beer or two in in high school and as a college student but not as someone who often drink to excess during those years I drink beer with my friends and\nUm then this is disputed as what they say and the times\nHis statements are at odds at a uh with some of his classmates and how they remembered him nearly a dozen college classmates of judge Kavanaugh said they recalled a him indulging in heavy drinking some saying so now it's not it's less than a dozen because someone was that during some saying\nA it was a beyond normal consumption ... parents ethical here to be sure or a smaller number of classmates that his drinking was unacceptable\nSo again this is like judging yourself and how much you drink is\nNotoriously difficult as I Would assume Mr alcoholic over here will be able to tell ya ah I mean the whole point is the toughest thing to do is admit you're an alcoholic right yeah it's very possible and I would say likely that most people who drink to excess and these periods would not necessarily say that they're doing something abnormal even if they are\nHere's what I hear so I take this I took that testimony what I watched him talk about drinking it was very clear that he was getting drunk and and he said look we All right Dr ... drink to excess we all did have you done that I mean I ... the on the drinking thing I don't consider this a problem\nBecause I I Believe that he was in effect saying\nYeah but there's a difference between a blackout mhm okay\nAnd maybe he had blackouts and didn't remember them I don't believe that at all you have a blackout you remember it you don't you don't remember what happened do you remember the ... I remember you were like oh crap I don't even remember now maybe at Seventeen you know your ... your remember or\nMaybe you're Seventeen and doing that but you have to consume a lot of alcohol\nI I I you know I got to that man is gay or ... expert witness and yet in a Glenn Beck please come to the sort\nA you know to me I don't make a generalization but with a specific accusation Ninety five percent of people who say they drank to the point of blacking out are like\nAnd I get a generalization but with a specific accusation Ninety five percent of people who say they drank to the point of blacking out or like\nI Believe it's Ninety five percent I Believe that the blackouts do exist\nBut it is extraordinarily rare I spend a week in France which I Can't believe my liver returned with me out for sure it was going to be like you know what I'm saying on the beach here I I drink a lot of that I Would say I got to get back to dry out my\nPoint though is that I had a lot to drink in my life yeah certain times I've never even been remotely via ... another alcohol\nBut you have to consume in a very short period of yeah I Know I've done I I've I've done my homework on it uh and it's not exactly the way I have experienced it\nUm apparently you can have blackouts if you drink a an enormous amount of alcohol if you if you were moving or maybe um even if an enormous amount of alcohol gets in your bloodstream quickly\nYou can blackout\n... I I have read to places where they say it's rare some places say it's common I'm Sorry but I Do not believe I Believe it's a movie trick that most people you know they're like whole we did one last night we had six new right\nShut up Ninety five percent of the Ninety five percent that's a lot I had\nA friend who had drank a lot in a very short period of time and blocked out a blackout fell\nOff the stage and had to go to the hospital um and that was a legit this was in college and that was a legitimate like he drank way too much nothing beat and do anything wrong he just fell off the stage name was killed himself and didn't remember any of it but and and just remember being there but did not remember the falling or anything okay\nUm and so I'm not saying it never happens but like the idea that you would say to someone oh why this guy's lying he did a blackout is completely absurd you can't you cannot\nYou cannot accuse somewhat of lying about that only they wouldn't know if it occurred\nYou can say that and this is what they are saying that he lied because he said you know he he gave the impression that he wasn't ever out of control falling down drunk well okay I don't believe that but I also don't I wasn't left with that impression\nNo he said I mean the quote business I drank beer and my friends almost everyone did sometimes I had too many beers sometimes others that I like beer is still like beer but they're not drink beer to the point of blacking out he just said I didn't blackout in and say to drink to excess in fact he said I have a drink to excess\nAnd you know I mean I Am not a big drinker and my life but I drink to excess several times but never I mean the idea of the goodness of black a blackout drunk or it might be a different story\nBlackout truck is I mean you've told me some of the levels of alcohol you've had in your life\nThe levels are almost in human [laughter] like I Would definitely be dead they near you\nI mean you're dumping poison into your system is out of it your body can handle it a blackout is shutting your body down saying I Can't keep you alive and to run all of these other systems right I mean that's that's you know that's intense\nSo I'm a we have a couple of more of these and go through yeah and if we need to but I mean I think you get the point this is the level of almost every one of these accusations and so I don't think that ... thing I don't think the ... um what about the well let me take a break come back there's two things that could pose a problem\nDo and some people are asking like why are you given up on Capitol I'm not not all I thought it was a fifty percent chance maybe hire that he gets through the issue here is if\nHe doesn't I mean because if you have faith here you're having the cabinet and Collins and Murkowski and ... if you have faith in them then fine don't worry about it but if you don't like I don't know you better have a plan B that up\nCollins and Murkowski and flake if you have faith in them then fine don't worry about it but if you don't like I don't know that you better have planned be set up by the way I just want to make that really clear I'm not giving up on him at all\nI'm just playing this out scene where the Democrats are headed than we do and how will that affect those three senators\nBy July twenty Seventeen bitcoin was down forty percent taken tore came in and said Palm Beach in Palm Beach letter a ... there's going to be some activity is going to bring enormous amounts of money into bed going\nWhat's bitcoin today a bitcoin currently sixty five forty sixty five forty a bitcoin was trading around Eighteen fifty a coin at the time we all know that it went up to twenty thousand\nTypically or a neutral location is itself and great to have that conversation maybe I'll do the outside of the office I'm I've been ... maybe ... or a drink coffee to resolve all\nHe says here and you will reveal is a great time to discuss the salary increase their box\nYou know you want to make sure that you're off on the conversation and then you know you're making your case to the the management team prior to that as compensation and taking place in the ... being made\nSaving money I'm living now Fox News [noise]\nNews in talk on the radio news radio show ya yeah ... ...\n...

[noise]\nAddicted to outrage\nThe new books and Glenn Beck addicted to outrage is available everywhere borders now at Amazon dot com\nOkay you're just started hearing very soon as this is the most important election of your lifetime is the most important election of your lifetime here the scenarios that icy\nKavanaugh they're moving the goalposts now on Capitol\nAnd if I'm a\n... let me just give me a couple let's say he is confirmed okay he's confirmed but this kind of perjury stuff is percolating and they just make hay out of it um we go back to normal and ... the GOP loses the house to the Democrats\nThe Democrats than are going to demand testimony from Donald Trump because they're going to try to impeach him they're going to demand is tax records because they're going to impeach him and the White House response by going to the Supreme Court and says the president doesn't have time to do this yadda\nYadda um and the Democrats than blondes a\nTo recuse himself but she won't do and you all do it doesn't happen a and the the house then moved to impeach capital guy so we've got a year of fun a lighter recently plausible ... okay uh let's say he's not confirmed because flake or Collins or Murkowski or Heller\nOkay they just don't believe in and the Republicans dropped the ball they have NO PLAN\nAnd they just like well you know and where do you need your vote because we're a repeal Obamacare do they lose the house and possibly the Senate\nSo I mean and they don't come out with a huge play yeah I think you're right they'll try to turn that into a reason to get to the polls but if if it's the Republicans that cause it I don't know how to they're going to I don't think it'll work\nOK mothers scenario he is confirmed it was a house impeached is Trump\nThe house or impeach his cabinet or on perjury\n[laughter] think that is if they win the house you know they're gonna at least attempt to they will attempt Trump and probably Kavanaugh to correct if we lose the house and Senate these things are happening and they're well there's no chance of them being removed\nBut you will have the next two years of non stop impeachment hearings of both capital and Trump OK mhm\nThe only one that seems good to me is I'm a ... if Kavanaugh loses the vote\nThe only one that I think works out is Kavanaugh loses the vote which could be really bad because it will be the Republicans that do it\nUm however Donald Trump comes out\nAnd while he says yeah that's over here's the guy\nShe ups the ante and you get a guy that all conservatives are rabid about guy somebody who you just know oh my gosh that's a skill Leah right now Brett Kavanaugh has not been a lot of people's favorites I mean they're okay with him but no\nI always willing to die in a sword for em em remember remember Kavanaugh was not on the initial list of judge right from Trump and there's lots of them he item leader I personally think the best course of action\nIs to nominate let's say let's say flake and Collins come out and do you know what I Can't do it I'm not going to vote on friday I Can't vote for him great\nDonald Trump with in ten minutes should be on television and say in my opinion Mike Lee is the next the nominee and you know what he's already been vetted for the FBI and every senator knows them\nSo we're going to be calling for a vote next week easy easy you know that\nThe thing to do because then you have them battling just on abortion right there at the same place they'd have about everybody correct and that's not going to hurt conservatives getting to the polls if if you put a staunch conservative somebody who says yeah I think abortion is wrong and if it\nKnow they don't they don't understand that at all I'm ... take me through some of the stories that you you talk about because I Would I like about this is not a gun is not a book about um you know necessarily the laws and everything else this is a story about America and how\nWe we do have I mean we're unlike any other nation on earth when it comes to guns in our history take me through like a either Sam colder or buffalo bill who am\nI ... ... ... one of the most amazing Americans that ever lived I mean not only was he an engineer and and just created this incredible innovation where a person one from firing one\nYou know must get shot once a minute or maybe twice a minute to shooting five times in mere seconds he was also just an innovator in in in marketing in selling himself in and using the press to to to sell sell to other people and using and using\nEngineering to to create something that he can make cheaper so the normal American the normal man the normal woman can get their hands on it and um changed the west\nIt changed the way that the relationship a person has with with a weapon and I'm ... you know he was before Henry Ford he was using interchangeable parts it was like first industrial revolution so he was just amazing man and almost it was my favorite chapter to right I think she needs you know more when it ...\nIt on him yeah so I'm here we are at the the one year anniversary of a Las Vegas shooting of Las Vegas [noise]\nUm did you and you're looking through history did you ever find another time in American history and I should say you know a free progressive uh where guns had been viewed in America as anything but good\n[noise] no I I sort of actually you know in in the in the nineteenth century guns were sort of idealized romanticized in books and things of that nature it wasn't until the thirties really when I started\nTo think about [noise] um and and and for some good reason people were running around with machine guns shooting up places you know carbon elsewhere so I mean there was a legitimate fear that some people had [noise] um but before that time no one even thought to limit\nGun ownership in any way I mean certain places and the west maybe they have certain areas where you couldn't\nHave a gun because everyone was drunk and fighting but generally no one had to go and ask the government the state\nUh for a guy I think in fact that when you think about the second amendment how you think about the ideals behind it tells us a lot about how you think about freedom in general\nThe vigil shouldn't be able to defend themselves in a rather should rely solely on the state\nBecause you could have um you could have had a gambling and I think you can still buy a gallon gun I'm legally ah but you could buy a gambling gun but we didn't have those you know the mass shootings\nOr one it's a little harder to conceal gambling gun in a violin case but also because the government's prohibition of alcohol led to the formation of these huge terrible and powerful mobs\n[noise] yeah and you know they used Tommy guns and you see them in a movie and movies and um you know it's kind of fix it's fictitious only in that but the gun has ... you know big blow back and it's not that easy to shoot\nAnd it was almost never really used in criminal activity it was more scare mongering by people who want it to ban I'm not I'm not saying people should have Tommy guns and driving around in their cars but I'm just\nSaying I I Am yeah I'm okay with that if you're a citizen I'm fine with that that's true that's very well so it so I'm David I'm when we were together how long does ten years ago\nI I don't know if it yeah almost\nYeah so ten years ago if I would've said to you in your lifetime do you think there will be a serious\nMove 'em that either comes close or does take away America's right to guns you would have thought that was a crazy question if I'm not mistaken do you think [noise] ten you\nActually yeah I Do but I Do feel better about the second amendment than I Do the first fourth and fifth and others have because there were four hundred million guns out there and I think that the people who who are part of the culture that I'm writing about I'm Talking about\nWill not hand them over that easily so I'm I'm less worried about them than I Am a [noise] a certainly the first amendment I think for most but others as well\nWhile you lose the second to and you definitely lose the first officer and I wonder\nI Wonder uh you know I Wonder what is going to take before people wake up to the road that we're we're sadly on\nAh the name of the book is first freedom a ride through America's enduring history of the gun is a great read it's David harsh sunny first freedom it's out today you can get it as Amazon or wherever books are sold David thanks so much for having been on\n... months or this half hour his ex
