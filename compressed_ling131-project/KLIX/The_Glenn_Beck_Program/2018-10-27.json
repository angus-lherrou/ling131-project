Florida it broke about an hour ago that they were bringing somebody in for questioning now it is a rest of a suspect uh his um his uh\nIt is a fan is covered in stickers I mean the guy's nuts\nIf I were to ask you before this can you sketch out what you think this guy's van looks like you would have picked the yeah ah it covered and\nThe cows and seemingly political messages on it yet I Can't quite zoom in to see exactly what they say that I've covered the van there now covering it so with blue tarp so no one can see it uh but uh it the you we've had a\nBlurry picture of it and it looks like it may be a guy on the right\nOr at least a ... you know it's hard to tell exactly there's\nCertainly political messages all over and flags all over it does appear to be a ... a picture of Trump in the presidential seal mean could it be a it could be either to be I don't like to have this guy's president right I mean I Know it you know again this is what people are speculating at this point it's hard to see honestly from the pictures\nYou'll get a picture pretty soon though that's clear I'm sure I'm you know but we're going to find this out relatively quickly yeah where this guy goes I mean this is a really quick arrest it does support the idea that he was at an as does the fact that zero the bombs went off completely incompetent and crazy\nI mean the fact that you you mail bombs and they're finding this quickly is it you know shows a lack of level of sophisticated on it really does yeah so we'll see we're gonna know fairly quickly I think oh this\nGuy may be just a really bad incompetent version of the Bernie Sanders guy uh that was competent when he was trying to kill all the the Republicans are about a year ago looks like this may be\nOur version of that guy fortunately our version if you will is a completely inept and incompetent and no one was hurt\nYeah I mean I ... if that's true what the van ... we don't know and should be noted of course he's absolutely not guy [laughter]\nYou know I Know isn't it was but they were going to say my guy either yeah but you know they're going to assign him as you know this is what a Trump supporter is like and blah blah blah and you know there are those people on both sides and this is why it is so\nA terrifying it's not going to beat a rational person that causes these things they're not gonna be rational\nYou're going to be nuts they're going to be absolutely nuts uh and uh and that's what's\nFrightening is ... the media just puts all of the nut jobs\nOn the right in as the regular person right when it comes to the left they don't even reports some but they certainly say well that's not that's not you know that's not who Bernie Sanders is that's not a Bernie Sanders follower well I agree with you I agree with you\nWhy is this guy all of a sudden any less than the guy\nFrom Bernie that that was a Bernie Sanders volunteer\nAnd as we said at the time and Bernie Sanders is not responsible for shooting baseball fields indoors Donald Trump responsible for this as any logical person that's ever seen anything to do with our legal system would be able to note I'm a you know again this is we were not going to know enough about this this is but this\nIs a product of the world we are creating now and that is all of us all of us are creating this\nGoing to they're going to tell you to move because you're a spoof to death all of the neighbors even the name you could be living in the most anti ... you could be living in a neighborhood\nWith the holy family and the pope and all of the pro life activists from all time right and you could drive one of those crazy anti abortion bans into your driveway and those people are going to say you know\nWe have standards yeah you're nuts I just really hope if Jesus comes back or he's not in a van\n[laughter] you know it comes in a white van with bumper stickers people are not going to buy it they're just trying to like I don't believe this guy there's no way back like that and again you're not supposed to know what's coming frail maybe that's how he does how does he comes back maybe that's how the anti Christ comes from that I Would I Do [laughter] well no no no because I wouldn't be slick enough ... to have you know he'd\nBe oh my gosh well\nPlug yours too okay he's being a guy who would try to say we should round up all the people out of hand the entire Christ would be the first one to go [laughter] you know these people are nuts would be a good suspects\nI don't know why such an irrelevant pretty ... I don't care if I used to live out still is the ... [laughter] what a what I was certainly a settlement wow I didn't see that one coming that's like with like\nThe really bad like lifetime movies where they're trying to give you the big the big switch through and like it's like a it's a you know it's a rape case and you know the whole time they put you to this one person and it's a very last second you know a guy she walked by for three seconds in the grocery store is the guy who did it\nCome out of course we didn't see that coming it's a nobody [laughter] well You're welcome on the anti Christ there you go wow same plot twist [laughter] I don't know if I feel comfortable employing the anti Christ so I'm just going to concerts\nWell You're welcome on the anti there you go wow same plot twist\n[laughter] I don't know if I feel comfortable employing the anti Christ so I'm just going to concentrate on the mail bomb suspect that it's just been arrested in Florida\nYeah it's I I cannot believe there is not a journalist who has taken the high quality photo of his ... house it's possible they're always assumed out from you know the helicopters and you can't quite see exactly what it says I Will say\nYou know by all appearances it does appear to be a pro Trump propaganda and now it's it's sort of difficult to see\nYou know like for example a there's a shirt that was around in the elections are a lot that looked like a a Hillary a presidential shirt and then it said a message on dirt that said something like a lock her up twenty twenty or twenty sixteen\nThey get could theoretically be alive anti Trump stuff but I don't think you I think they're\nStarting to fish in pretty deep pier I Do this all the time for the uh for the level after I don't know like you got to find okay what is the one circumstance that we can be missing here and maybe that's it but it does seem to be a ... in his face in a presidential seal pretty clearly on one of the windows\nBut again you know the the media going to try and make this out to be well from ... or you know evil bombers ... you know and and again we didn't do that with all Bernie Sanders supporter known say all people who have ... we didn't say LA fuzzy on ... going to shoot someone on a on a on a field yeah and that guy was successful\nThat guy actually almost killed people this one didn't there's some didn't and we didn't say that when we could have with the Bernie Sanders guy\nAnd you know there's a couple of reasons why number one this stuff happens right right wing people do crazy things to there's there's plenty of them on the right as well that there are plenty of crazy does not go to one party when you get these fringe levels\nThere are people on both sides who do it um there's a there's an ideology and we've talked a lot about this that affects many on uh the very harsh left\nOf going back to you know examples like Bill ... weather underground and we saw this with the Occupy Wall Street where there's some ID ideological reasons why certain types of violets come from the left more often but still there's crazy people all over the spectrum\nYou just hey you don't want to do it because your sides probably knew some dumb leader and you're gonna get blamed for it but beyond that it's just ... correct when people people are responsible for their own actions when you were an individual you act as an individual and the person who says something that you listen to is not responsible for how you take that information and how you deal with it not to mention\nIt may or not may have nothing to do with that at all\nYou know just because you happen to be a he happens to be a a a Trump supporter does that make ... make Trump's making Trump's fault that he's doing these terrible thing no and the same thing would apply as it did apply to a Bernie Sanders by the way that just\nA fan but campaign volunteer because you're working to get the guy elected who then went and tried to shoot twenty five Republicans on a baseball field but again not Bernie Sanders fault at all not his fault at fault zero percent ... and the same thing would be would apply here if this is how this thing turns out I Will tell you there's more to find out\nI Will tell you this think how fortunate we are in a couple of things um go back to the bombing of the bridge in Cleveland you remember that you remember that name remember anybody Mueller bealer\nRemember when Occupy Wall street was caught by the FBI\nOn their way to the bridge I think they had part of it even wired did they have an even wired but they were going to blow up bridge in Cleveland are and they had the capability of doing it\nAnd thank God the FBI caught them but that never made any news you know it would have made huge news if the Tea Party would have been doing that arise from a late in the you know Occupy Wall street all those are just\nScooby Doo van there just crazy kids um\nLet's see how fortunate we are the that didn't happen how that could have torn apart\nThink about the blessings that not a single bomb went off that this guy may have been so damn crazy that he really thought well I don't have any gunpowder by\nI'm pretty sure ... sand gets hot [laughter] uh you know this guy is is I mean you want to talk about incompetent um how fortunate we are that none of these bombs went off if any of these bombs would have gone off\nAnd hurt or killed or maimed people from the other side of the world would be a different place today the media would be going crazy because look at how they're going crazy now well [noise]\nGood news looks like we may have caught the guy\nYeah it's interesting and now they're starting to them that we're getting to that point where people are starting to share pictures of what appears to be the van which does appear to be very pro Trump also very pro soccer if [laughter]\nIf it had a combination of things to me I was out I Would assume dons a big soccer fan but who knows a but will ah [laughter] I Will tell you these things checkout again everyone roasted soccer people we said how long have we said that you know I think we usually uh I think we blame the we're we're at opposite\n[laughter]\n[noise] oh my

doctor ball at Iraq so recently I recently switched off conflicts that started again I'm also\nThe Koran again unless you're going to hit the double every year\nRight um\nIt's ... thank God it's nothing on the go at it if not they don't have and it's not life threatening\nAre you going to do it every year\nWell\nOkay so now I don't know so they look at what what is the nature of this one was the nature of the illness\nI mean I don't want to go into detail that is a nerve pain condition and the doctors are unsure of what it comes from God and so if it was what was your what I Would do is airing on because it's relatively new got I got I yeah\nFor what I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year\nAnd the more experienced got to help you that you have with is the better your estimates are badly because once you've ... battle with it for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months you're kind of guessing at what it's going to cost you in a year right\nRight and you just put that in a budget item so let's just make up a number okay if you're a doctor but was six thousand and you're going to run into your six thousand other duck double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month\nIf it's three thousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know a\nA whatever a line in your budget for medical expands on the wind phonic medical and just call your call chronic or whatever just give it a name and money set aside for that so

now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future and so ... for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nI mean my issue is that I'm literally on like penny pinching I don't like the way I can make that happen from what I've been doing is I mean I decided starting next month I'm going to kick out fifty dollars actually likely to right now on\nWhat I I'm I'm hoping overtime on the opposite you know pay out more show bought it\nI live here right now I'm ... I'm I'm hoping overtime on the other ... you know pay out more\nSo delighted why are we ... we had an income problem a debt problem or a spending problem where a lot of\nIdentity and that that problem [laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand I that\nI made I don't think a lot of noise and social worker and because of my condition actually switch that job and had more flexibility on some of the fee for service division as opposed to a salaried position mhm\nHow long they make anywhere from Thirteen hundred can sixteen hundred ... a paycheck on\nI knew he drops on Montana you back twice a month okay and you said you're living with them I guess I'm I'm living with a roommate I paying nine Seventy I rent it give us some a lot um\nAnd I think that somehow from ... ...\nAnd what is the nature of the debt student loan that is everything credit card I'll also because they can handle it I was trying to ... stick thing um medical ... student loan or most of it is right into the thousands of that\nI have like a total of six figure out\nOK show for the short term we're going to make sure you take care of the most important things in that food pantry\nNot eating and not eating out senior pants on your life from your lights and water and year round and your transportation\nSo food shelter clothing and transportation utilities the eighth grade we used to call that a civics lesson lesson necessity necessity is only the debt you've got is not necessities you take care of the debt only after you've taken care of the necessities and then you work as a low end of the debt as you can\nAnd here's the thing you're either going to Paris for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nRight because they are coming you're told me that that's why you called yeah yeah yeah\nI mean declaring it I'm saying like I said I've got ...\nHow do I prepare for it you're saving coverage so now that's our short term a long term okay we got to get your income up and you're out go down to knock this debt out\nLong term but that has to do with your medical condition and as news your career and has there was a lot of different things that you've got to face and so um but that's how I Would you begin to look at it get take care of the short term make sure you're taking care of you so that\nYou can you know be prepared to take on the long term which is get your income up but\nUh we got to get past some of the medical stuff and you got to really start looking at this career really hard chop up those credit cards is Tom put plastic surgery Tucker is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Tucker how are you [laughter]\nI'm doing well how are you better than I deserve what's up\nFor me and my wife um I go on the baby sit out the right now I'm at that we just paid off for a decade credit card today though we are the only credit card a movie on the line that is good news um [noise]\nBut um so we're wondering that too and we're looking at our budget and yesterday at um at the church we had a big argument about hiding\nI don't know that we want to ... percent and um I realized that we were not in position to Iran now we're trying to pay all that we can get later on it\nAway I think what they call a new model that I'm going to adopt the eighth of all I Want to get your input on it we have our ten percent by it but we want to tie because I was thinking about Clinton got up and given the choice\nWe have our ten percent [noise] but it but we want to die because I was thinking about putting it out and given that the church and then having that extra five percent and kind of giving it to\nUm other charitable organization that we believe in that are doing day or a ... you know during the crisis mission and so we're trying to\nLooking at trying to do what we can to people who need it\nUm but and she's on the other hand what strikes and present a church and then what we don't we can't give you know we're not um this media and she wants to get the chart and we had a big argument about either yesterday I was\nOut on you know the the definition of dies the definition of the time is when you look it up and the Hebrew it's an Old Testament term in Jesus referring to the New Testament is tent that literally means chant the word means tamp it doesn't mean sphere that doesn't mean twentieth it means tamped down you can decide\nWhether you want to tie they're not you get to decide\nUm but if we're going to walk with Christ and we want to and when I'm an evangelical Christian which means I look for what the scripture tells me to do I'm doing my best to follow what the word of God says answer what may wrenches opinion is doesn't matter\nWhat Tucker ...
