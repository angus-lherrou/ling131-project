the puppet master or George Soros\nBecause for some reason George Soros is being rehabilitated again in the press a and now they're ... they're taking it so far by saying that\nUm people are saying this caravan a is a is now being funded with Jewish money and when they said Jewish money what they're actually saying is George Soros they're saying that people said that George Soros is funded this\nBut to make it sound more anti Semitic they're saying people are claiming that this is now being funded with Jewish money\nSo who's the anti Semite here who's the one lying\nFirst of all this caravan we have absolutely no evidence that George Soros is involved in this or any of his money is going to fund or support any of this we have zero information\nIt's it's in it's it's it's staggering\nAnd nobody's talking about it they just got into a a a deal a few years back with a a wind generator from that was making these giant generators that you put on a on a windmill and they had a four hundred and\nNinety [noise]\nLet's say ... billion dollar but it can't be four hundred and Ninety million dollar a bed and they had all of these turbines being built by this company and it was like four hundred and Ninety thousand dollars a foreigner Ninety million dollars over five years\nWell the companies shipped out the first I'm a turbine\nBut the company was told by China hey we need to see everything we need to we need to know every step of the way what's going on what they did is they got access to the servers they hacked in they downloaded everything they got one generator\nThan they cancelled they said yeah we're good will they found out that China had hacked\nIn got all of the blueprints everything they had they had one that they were made by Americans\nAnd they brought it into their factories and said okay just make a bunch of these that's what they're doing to us all the time to me that's not a trade the problem [laughter] I mean depending on what ... or ...\nWhen it can be they have access to our power grid they have access to I mean I'm telling you if we ever go to war it's going to be lights out that these with China and Russia this is what\nWell pollutants that World War three will be fought with ones and zeroes not bombs and China is doing the same exact thing so why don't we do more about this\n[noise] I think\nProbably because we owe China so much money nobody wants to make an enemy of China nobody wants to say anything we probably do some of this stuff not stealing things but I'm sure we are trying to hack into into their military as well\nSo I think it's one of those things where you know everybody's listening to each other right you know so let's talk about it will all deny it but we all know\nBut China is a different animal China is is this the wealth the largest transfer of wealth in human history\nHas happened in the last ten years and it's all fast from China what they have stole\nFrom our corporations the plans are the ideas what they have taken from our our corporations and our country is the largest transfer of wealth in human history\nAnd it's all ill gotten goods\nRoute so that that separate from that separate from their rules like so China has a very restrictive rules in their country\nAnd they these are these are non tariff barriers right mind which basically say hey do you want the access to her you know ... billion and a half\nPeople you might access to this market or you're gonna have to do when you come over here is to give us access to your technology and willingly ... corporations do this all the time they go over there and they say well I mean I Want to have access to the market so I guess you can have it that's a terrible policy\nBy the choice but it's also visited he's chosen to do it that there is this theft this is them getting in like the wind turbine mhm okay\nGetting in a having a basic access okay we're going to buy these will buy 'em for four hundred and Seventy million dollars or whatever it is we're by those guys great\nSend them over to us but we need access you know we need to be able to see anything then going in the on the access that they said ... and grabbing everything that's amazing it's it's crazy it is so bad and\nYou know people are one of these days they're just going to wake up at twenty twenty next year in just a few months it'll be twenty Nineteen\nAnd twenty twenty their total surveillance state will be will they'll turn the key for the entire country that's what Fifteen months away\nDo we have the audio I Know he pulled it for one day this week of the Chinese train oh it's ... or is there I don't know if we can pick that up I think I think it was yesterday\nThere there's a train it's a high speed train and ear hearing over the loudspeakers you're hearing in Chinese a a announcement that says basically it's not in Chinese as it was it in English and English are okay\nAnd it's basically saying don't break any of the rules hand your tickets or when you are when you're asked do exactly as you're told otherwise you'll lose points and a social credit social credit\nLike and they're talking about this system which if you've seen black mirror this this is I Swear it has to be based on this real system being built into 'em but there's an episode where you know you go every interest\nIf you've seen black ... this is I Swear it's like we were has to be based on the real system being built and buy a um but there's an episode where you know you go every interaction you have\nUsed centrally get raided a and if you do things that are wrong you're star rating lowers and you can't get access to things you might not be able to get on a plane or might not be able to go to a fancy restaurant or whatever it is they ... they're actually building this in China it's already in effect in some places it's there's already a skeleton in effect of it\nAnd they already in Beijing they have three concentric sink\nThe circles um and the the inner circle which is the main city and how many can you look up real quick how many people live in Beijing proper the actual city\nUm the the inner circle is the actual city [noise] they gave an operative uh uh I think a couple of hours head start and said go into the inner circle hide\nHide\nThey gave him two hours they then said I'm to the the security service here's a picture of the guy you're looking for feed it into the system find him\n... in eight minutes they didn't just find him in eight minutes he was in the back\nOf a squad car that's twenty four million people in eight minutes they found one\nIncredible that's what's coming that's the kind of surveillance that China has developed this is not something futuristic thing it's here it's here all it takes is a country that needs to be monitored that way\n... you know the the the the really truly frightening thing I I've\nBeen doing a lot of reading on communism and fascism of World War two recently and I was shocked at how many countries were a fascist by choice not taken over they were fascist by choice\nOr there were only about three of them three or four of them that were fascist by choice in the Nineteen twenties but there's like Fifteen before Nineteen thirty eight eight all happens between Nineteen thirty\nAnd Nineteen forty that's when the world went fascist and communist\nWhat happened in the world in Nineteen thirty depression\nWhen you have a a we centered these people are bad these people are good and we we're right they're wrong we've got to get it if this economy falls apart and we haven't found our way to each other the world's history will repeat\nWe just have to find a way to each other\nAnd it's really not that hard if we start concentrating on the things that actually matter and they're big things that are coming down the pike\nAnd I will tell you communism and fascism they failed because you could short circuit the system unless you hit the world with an e M P you aren't short circuit ing\nTotal control your ... this is a we're building a system\nHappily\nThat in China is now being turned into a giant prison camp where you can't do anything I was told by a friend if you go to Beijing\nAnd you want to pretty much make sure you're not being filmed turn the lights off in your bathroom and get into the shower and perhaps you're not being seen\nI won't turn the lights off in your bathroom and get into the shower\nAnd perhaps you're not being seen or heard mhm no thanks no thanks\n\n\n\nI Can't believe that that system is Fifteen months away or\nI mean there are it's already happening in many places in China but the full system goes online [noise]\nIn in Fifteen months can you imagine what that would feel like as a citizen knowing oh crap\nGot Fifteen months to get the hell out of here [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "01"}
