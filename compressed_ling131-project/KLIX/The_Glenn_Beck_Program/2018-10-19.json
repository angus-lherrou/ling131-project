time that makes it even worse it would seem to me yeah\nMean because it's this is why you hear about the dreamers off the bat the dreamers the people who dream people who just created a dream and they dreamed it here\nI you hear about the dreamers all the time that the dreamers the people who dream people who've just\nCreated a dream and they dreamed it here in the United states at all they want to do is continue their dream dreaming here in dreamland let's all they want us to tame dreamy dreamers dreaming to dreamers\nAnd you hear about dreaming dreamers because they have stories that are\nLargely compelling in a one on one basis right [noise] uh you know they pick they know of course they don't pick the ah they came here it's Seventeen and eleven months\nAnd a ... and have been breaking the law for Fifteen Years they take the kid and then there are some examples of this where there's a kid who's you know four years old that comes across with their parents as we as the phrase is no fault of their own\nWhich is true and your four years old and there's a compelling case there and I think a lot of people are open to that case even if you think if your for your mature enough\nTo say hey mom dad I'm not doing that stuff is wrong you know you're not dragging me illegally across the border I'm not doing it have you guys looked at us off guard because they were breaking it okay right now we're going to [laughter] usually that doesn't happen\nOn this situation where\nAre you know you get to a coat paint worker a coat of paint staffer is running for Senate in Arizona and it was a huge mistake I think for her to be their number literally with go pick or I don't I didn't tell you that socializing her views I don't know exactly she she's been with a lot of these ah\nDream groups or some maize any early to thousands to the point where again like she co hosted a show with someone who was the nine eleven truther Wilder awhile that's like crazy bonkers over the line right and and the fact that you have a really solid candidate there in Arizona border state it's a big deal there\n... is another one the cruise cruise has got to leave there but I mean he's always been talking about border security but yeah I get a look at the other side of that yet with that\nHe doesn't want no all he doesn't I I don't know that even wants to border frankly there it just seemed like it\nAnd he's made a big deal out of it some of those ads are like let's protect the dreamers let's let's protect the dreamers and you know what that means it means amnesty for everybody it doesn't stop with the dreamers and\n... I think everybody who has watched this battle for the last Fifteen or Twenty years knows it doesn't stop with the dreamers there they're going to\nThey want amnesty for all illegals here all illegals because you can't just say All right the dreamers can stay well what about their parents okay yes they can stay what about their cousins OK\nIt's the whole chain thing than the Trump talks about from time to time that's what will happen if you grant demand amnesty\nAAA seven twenty seven back is the phone number brought you by Casper this half hour or Glenn has Casper a\nAnd he loves it he always

looks like a cruise has is pretty well in hand right now by seven I think on the average yeah he is up about by seven um he of course is a a deep Hispanic roots\nAttack for being what Don junior has called an Irish guy pretending to be Hispanic so what does the Hispanic community means to you in what relationships do you have with that community\nSo to to her by the question about my name was born Robert Francis or work on a path for instance the ... was a Senator John Francis ... Francis ... who will go as UFO um for\nFor his life and and from day one in El Paso and and you know this and mckell and if you were born Robert or Albert for Gilbert ... your folks your friends your community calls you bet though that's that's my nickname that I've gone a bart for my entire life\nA horn and raised in fourth generation in El Paso I'm In a community that has more than ... percent Mexican American\nUh first of all I was you know I'm not Hispanic I no one calls me or any name other than stew of at this point which isn't even my named either or you can criticize me the same way you can talk about federal because that's actually not my name's to deep uh in Phoenix book called Stu\nThanks a lot for to Glenn Beck for that one but I what I Would say there is first of all it's just an inefficient process but I don't mean to criticize or the culture of the of the Hispanic people but if you have if if if it's true what Beto is saying which is anyone who is named any afloat names\nAre all called ... is that true everyone who know every one is called Albert is called every everybody born in El Paso that's of Irish American descent name is Albert Albert Robert framing it as a whole lot better than\nNo no no you can go and fight an actual Robert in El Paso do any exist maybe somebody in El Paso if you were in El Paso or anywhere around there and your name is Robert I'd love to know if you exist because what we were just told is as everyone knows if you're happy to grow up and do your name is Robert ...\nBills Ted Stanley Orlando or Reginald you refer to it that's how I got can't be true American ...\nAnd I don't think it is I I think it's not a common nickname in some communities it probably is but it wasn't his can be any of it not cultural appropriation did he not appropriate Hispanic culture that\nYeah any any I mean he didn't he limited it to I Would say Texas border area but I Would I'd be interested to see if there's a widespread phenomenon yeah is it possible cannot ... mother named their kid Gilbert and not have them referred to as best show their entire life is that a possibility I don't know if I Am just not in tune\nTo the cultural development as much as I should be and you know please come and and and whites plane this to us because we are just ... that's not a role here that we're just two white\nAnd understand things like that to us ... let me let me just admitted to me the ... referring to himself has that show feels like a guy who wants to take advantage of the Hispanic community for votes I I Know that can't be through\nThe ... but it's just because I'm too white to understand it I Can't quite get their cat clear that hurdle to understand why someone would do that and we will soon find out to see if we can find any any Roberts who are actually Robert\nSo it looks like we have a ah Joel Robert ... no doubt is Beto are calling from El Paso I'm Joel Robert\nYes it is a is it more preferred for us to refer to you is Beto\nNo no not even host their income you know say you\nKnow [laughter] okay what is your actual given name\nMy birth name is bill J. O. E. first name Robert R O B e Archie and I'd already was that he called me and you know so when someone calls you up how did they refer to as well they don't say my middle ... most of the 'cause the only giving out less that's you know of course foremost up but\nJust go to Joe and in my life and it's not that a\nLot of that so I thought you there I'm not job are you there [laughter]\nLet me ask you this and this is a ... but why did you call national radio and lie because we know every morning in the area that had an Robert [laughter] better why would you lie now all those\nNames image and I I it it does it does depend on if they want to be called that though it is a nickname it's I don't know what it is but I Know and all those people and I've always called them either out there with that though you know ... and the other one Gilbert I didn't even know that but it was a ... but\n[laughter] I mean when do they do a lot of white guys call themselves better or do other people call them that'll\nActually he's the first one that I Know a young guy [laughter]\nDon't judge Joe ... what is your background so do you what's your ethnic background\nOr Hispanic or you know but a Latin descent um a lot of it or I get a lot but just because\nThey stay on message going American but I repeat that I'm not getting it because I'm ashamed that I Do have Mexican background but my surname which of course I'm not going to get out is bad for the state by stringing molesting\n... so this this is fascinating you are in in the Hispanic community you\nHave Robert and your name you are not all that show and you know ... the people that you referred to in the Hispanic community with the names Robert Albert Gilbert in Umberto you refer to ...\nYou're not ... and you know the people that you referred to in the Hispanic community with the names Robert Albert Gilbert in Umberto you refer to buy their actual make less than ... this is an interesting piece of evidence we found a unicorn business only one or\nTwo we'll know there is one we should send this dimensional so he doesn't make this mistake next time on CNN I don't want him to go down the road where he's making mistakes and saying things that blatantly aren't true on national television [noise] that would be terrible for now we're just trying to help we're trying to healthier and also as Joe thank you Joe for calling in and and I would love to hear from people\nIf you happen to be Robert Albert Gilbert or Umberto for having to live in a in a Hispanic community where you know or some one of these names that we always how you refer to it as bad as the standards set\nBy that show and I'm curious to see if that\nIf there are more unicorns out there we've discovered something to make it work we've done this is our one incredible we've already uncovered something that people have told us did not exist [laughter] it's a miracle and all this hard research we put into this today uh-huh by giving up the phone number you know once or twice\nAnd shockingly we were able to uncover somebody so we'll see if there's more out there I don't know if there is I knew he is\nThe only we've done a lot of digging so far so I'm maybe it'll produce more fruit I don't know a Richard in Texas you're on the Glenn Beck program Hi\nHey guys my name is Richard I'm Out here in El Paso okay uh the first thing I like to say that there's really not that many Latino as friends is [laughter]\nThat's my first point okay your second point that you were mentioning I Would say that Ninety five percent of the people that are named in the names that you mentioned to go by that though\nMhm that's a high percentage I mean that's\nA that's a lot and I am the no and I am an American citizen\nAll right well thank you very much that's what we're that's what happens here in our community okay so you do in El Paso even you know a lot of guys go a lot of white guys that go by Beto no no [laughter]\n[laughter] okay so the guy here and talking about here the Ninety five zero clothing goes\nRight okay so I I convince is an interesting distinction you're saying in the Hispanic community people of Hispanic descent with some of these names are like that show but the people who are white that Robert Francis do not go by that show\nNo yeah okay that makes it okay what\nAre they going to help veterans that much I don't think it has the same thing again look there's a couple of points out there we're going to if you can always when you're ... you're searching for horses\nYou're going to find a couple with horns on their head that one of the things to some of them are going to be able to fly it part of the it's just part of the experience when you're looking to find a horse\nHey look at that one has got it happens to be rainbow colored and his flying through the sky everyone has the end you say huh how 'bout that I'm just curious just concerned yeah because you know look CNN is the place where they're gonna they're gonna dig deep\nAnd get the facts subject this guy he's going to get a massive fact check at some point today because apparently we're hearing from El Paso that people that are white named Robert Francis are not typically called that's how this is I mean we don't\nDo it at all that if you have Hispanic background and your name is Robert or some ... that you're called Beto and that doesn't I I'm not surprised by that at all what what surprised me as if a lot of Roberts who were just white guys that usually go by Bob in this culture are are going by better\nCan you know one interesting thing we could do with Robert Francis or because you could call them Bob Frank over to right we can go with Bob Franklin work you could guess you could Bob Franklin work as it's not it doesn't connect\nI wouldn't say Bob print a but I'm sure he ... that had nothing to do with his consideration by putting federal and also science now we are of course know that he was calling himself Bob on television when he was in a band\nYeah and that band performed on television in El Paso on their morning show and he brought his incredible guitar style aims to the show and it was getting late in the show and the host of the show was concerned that they got to start playing 'cause the show was\nAbout\nWhen he called the new one I'm going to be over before you know\nHe's talking to a better way believe at that time [noise] and then you hear the guitar styling Bedouin solving credibly talented and allow you to listen to this guy is [noise] it's good to really heavy but yeah this is actually better playing guitar [noise]\nFairly young and then they kick it into gear was a A R styling [noise] of federal Francis blank of Bob Franco horse\nWow that is talented but he's called Bob ...\nWas the ...\nI'm a writer [laughter]\nAds and the ... thing or just the one giant and ... of a campaign has yeah I mean the fact that this guy's\nCaught on with the left it I mean they'll man of they want to run for president in twenty twenty he's raised more money than any Senate candidate in history for a quarter\nThat's how much they love this guy he raised more in this quarter than Brock Obama did back in two thousand eight that's incredible that amazing because why he made a speech about the NFL where he said it was okay to Neal because they are I guess that's exactly what you are or American than that I can I can think of ... American than that a lot I\nI don't uh I don't think I understand it but maybe we'll get more evidence from El Paso and this will show us that there's only two there's only two people who would possibly disagree with the story\nFrom Beto O'Rourke in these communities I'm Glad we've heard from a couple a because it proves that unicorns do exist but we'll we'll figure it out and we'll we'll

for him yeah because it's such shape it was one of a rough terrain which is a specialty you know a lot of a pill a lot of mountain climbing in the middle of it which is not usually in the middle of a

kind of be\nTo share of yourself too much certainty and today we're really learning from the Hispanic community of nothing wrong with that Robert Francis at work I was not aware mhm that every white person in El Paso\nThat was named Robert Francis will be referred to a special that was not something that I knew until very recently saw last night on CNN even\nBecause he's been talking about the best thing that I didn't know I thought maybe it was just him right there is some quirky thing about him now but no everybody everybody\nRight let's let me remind people of of what he told us because we all want to learn together a at a everybody has his nickname here's what he said\nThe campaign you have been attacked for being what Don junior has called an Irish guy pretending to be Hispanic\nSo what does the Hispanic community mean to you in what relationships do you have with that community\nSo to to clarify the question about my name was born Robert Francis or work on a path France has to work with a Senator John Francis or father to us these Francis or a who will go as UFO\nFor instance the ... was a Senator John Francis or father to Ulysses Francis org ah who will go as UFO\nThan I Do want to\nYou know ... ... a gallon if you were born Robert Albert Albert ... calls you commuted out though that that's one that I've gone by for my entire life is entirely born and raised\nAnd I mean that's what happens yeah that's just what happens when you're Robert Albert yogurt or Umberto and just go by that I don't know there is to it white or not that's what'd you\nGo by right and when we say a year in his entire life mhm what we actually mean is his entire life with the exception of times he was in public can happen to be recorded\nAnd it was a tragedy and yeah I mean it really was an amazing\nTurn of events there and it's good to see it's good to see\nA that this has gone I I I I just I don't I don't see how people don't see through this you know I and I think maybe on the left they don't want to because they think he has a chance to every few years these this the less gets this terrible tease or they get to get close in for in a few polls I mean Wendy ...\nIt was the mayor refused and that was going to change Texas a oh\nA were you were to use them and when you're down to yeah ah yeah sort of a moderate leaning ... a Democrat\nHe was also going to change Texas every time they were on somebody there's somebody who's going to just change it and it's going to it no longer we're gonna have to deal with these darn Republicans down their return the state blue we've won forever and by the way that part of it is true\nIf they start they turn ... do yeah that's true they will run they will run the country for a very long time if they're capable of doing that just from an electoral vote standard but still it's a it's not it's it's a way to suck\nThe money out of small donors were throwing it away and we keep hearing how bad\nPeople have it and I think that's true in a lot of cases but it's like if you have it really bad because Donald Trump is ruins your life or whatever it is is it really are the best expenditure of your money to send it to somebody out of state in Texas who's going to lose by eight or ten or twelve\nI Can't imagine that that's the thing that you should be encouraging if you actually cared about people's will be for the Hollywood crowd loves them they're talking about running him for president in twenty twenty\nEven federal Janeiro or pushed\nHis name out there is a little bit better than I Do how yeah I I mean they got they got the name in common but I think it goes beyond that I think he likes\nHis politics I think he does to you know [laughter] it Bob Duvall is done it as well uh we Bob Downey junior Roberto Downey junior we know about that a veteran of all it's really a good collection out and it is a it's a big it's a big group a federal Brooks is also a\n[laughter] it was also [laughter] so stupid but I Love it\nBut I don't have that your name is Robert Robert her five if you're a white dude that's what you get yes I don't even know why you get Bob\nHonestly it's still it's kind of a it's a summary of your name I don't ... Rob seems to me to me even make more sense right does a but whatever we'll give it to you I you know better and better\nNo no I'm going to go with that one I triple eight Seventy seven B. C. K. when you're the show and say these\nBizarre things as we sit in our ex chairs ex chair is awesome it is the new chair that we had never had these uh\nKinda crappy chairs here for a while and ah Glenn in particular with white about them constantly because that's kind of Oakland does or he's you know it's funny for a guy who who dedicate so much time to physical training when he's a little uncomfortable\nYou know he really does complain you ... yeah you think a guy who is spent months and months and months hardcore training for a triathlon and canoeing across the Mediterranean which is

important point and that is that Aurora to identify\nIs that Aurora identifies as Hispanic or there for ... you must be bullied\nWow there's a great point here is again we're learning today yeah I forgot that was the standard how insensitive of us mhm\nHow hateful and are downright ugly that is that we haven't spoken about how he does identify yeah and it must\nBe a Hispanic [laughter] jak bags it it's interesting that that sort of talk it's like\nYou know the the Elizabeth Warren is of essentially identifying as Native American without real evidence that she is she's getting beat up I mean this has been one of the biggest political disasters of all time her coming out and trying to say\nThat she actually is Hispanic Native American short approved it by going back ... generations trying to prove it one one thousand twenty fours yeah that's amazing well left hates it through like this is this is playing into the worst of our\nUh beliefs about the blood being the determining factor in these things and they they hate it they're they have destroyed or over there she handled it terribly I mean it's almost like one of those things I don't know maybe they should have leaked it through another source of the fact that she's associating herself with coming out and doing this is this amazing ah\nBut the identifying thing there's two parts of that like I said as a\nYou know say that you know the libertarian side of me right like I don't care what people say they are right like it makes no difference to me if she says she's Native American or not\nI don't care but beyond that there is an actual\nTruth you know if if we're all doors all what's to come out and say she's black or Sean King wants to come out and say he's black when they're not black and it doesn't matter to me I don't care what they're doing there I think they're lying right and they're doing this for a reason\nBut that doesn't mean it affects me in any way however we have to be able to stand up for the truth the truth is that Sean King is white but the truth is that racial does all is white\nIs because of this video he made about it's ... it's a great idea to Neal or for the national anthem and what's behind that story people like Colin Kaepernick saying that black people are being unfairly accused without evidence and being shot in the streets for no reason\nBecause for crimes they didn't commit at the same time we're supposed to get on board if you're on the left are supposed to get on board with ... with the with the new standard in which any white woman can accuse the man\nOver or if we're supposed to believer that is not going to work out well for African Americans or any ... any race of mail but this is the type of thing that makes no sense\nI mean there are real cases of this this isn't a fake thing go back to you know we talked about till town because like the Emmett Till I mean this goes back a long way where black people were accused of doing terrible things to white people when they didn't an entire communities went and attacked\nThe black person this is obviously going back quite a ways but it is something that legitimately as part of our history and it's surprising at least if liberals actually cared about black people and black men like they say that they do that they would want to embrace the standard like this to the point behind the at I think is\nIs relatively fair and it's something that should be communicated I think to the the African American community that ... that the criticism is\nPerhaps a over done little of her done potentially the criticism here [laughter] interesting 'cause I don't think it's a it's not it does not I don't know the the uh for sure on this but what I've ... my understanding is that these are the people who are recorded this are African Americans that there's not like a white person doing a black voice\nQuote unquote is you're African Americans\nAre talking a and I guess the idea is that they have picked the\nStereotypical African Americans to do the commercial it's very uncomfortable or I don't think that this is something that French she'll necessarily some bracing or by any means but it is a something that's making a lot of uh a lot of waves in the media because they're trying to make it seemed like well this is just this Republican and who was a racist\nI mean hey he didn't have anything to do with the ad but besides that uh it is it it's an interesting\nDouble standards that we find ourselves dealing with the always yeah and and we get that double standard in\nUh to the tenth power and you know I'm I guess we get kind of used to it by now I'm just sort of used to the double standard and to the point where you almost feel silly bringing out the double standard it happens so much\nIt is and it's but it's so obvious sometimes you have to for example does anyone I mean if you don't live in French hills district you know French Hill is it's not a major I actually don't yeah he's not a major national figure as a Congress a person\nUm so you know like I I think this wouldn't be a big national story it is a big national story today what is not a big national story is a name that almost everyone does Louis Farrakhan\nLouis Farrakhan is not a big national story today he's making no waves at all for his comments or yet again about Jews now this is a person who has met with you know people like ah Keith Ellison\nHe has met with several congressmen he's been embraced many times but even you know fairly recently uh people meeting with him we know the ... Obama at one point apparently had met with him we didn't find that out until like you out of office or how the how that happens it's amazing but here's the latest from Lewis\nEvery now\nIs a boost [noise] so when they talk about for Khan\nCall me I have to you know what they do come in and the semi stop it [noise] I'm into term\nI don't know nothing about taking some body because of their religious preference\nOkay right yeah you know anything about hating somebody because of their religion really\nReally you just ... you seemingly just called Jewish people termites\nYeah you don't know nothing about hey said more clearly than that the best what he's talking about another speeches wow a for pretty amazing it's to the other thing is that ... that's interesting about Louis Farrakhan is nobody loves Louis Farrakhan more than Louis that her sure I mean this guy\nThinks he's really clever yeah every every arriving lie and he's got this gigantic smile on his face like he's uncovered some\nDeep historical truth [laughter]\nOr or or or solved you know a perpetual motion machine and the guy is like he put everybody in their place just now white slamming them down on I don't know nothing about hate no religious group\nKnown as I might I met her mind it like he thinks that's a yeah he does\nHe's really excited about himself but he realized both of those words and in ... but he was an ... should do it [laughter] he's hanging around and he's like I don't I don't have any speech is scheduled schedule one we need a speech just for this long [laughter] time how excited he loves when he delivers bat [laughter]\nHe he's really love about it and I don't think\nHe got the requisite reaction from the crowd and I think he wanted more of a you know a gas or a laugh\nOr something you just kinda got in a way I don't know how to respond to that those kind of a bad state yeah I don't think I think he's going to be in trouble for that I Will be I'll give them this though the the words do end in a similar fashion they do that is something that he was able to do uh-huh yeah might in semi so that's why that's why says that way our full\nPowerful really funny man like he just keeps so happy he looked so happy ending delivers the highly I Can't wait to deliver genocide above the Jews as just\nBig smiles [laughter] as long as he can come up with something that rhymes you know people have simple pleasures and I think then you know he got an apple think he's asking for\nRhyming words and killing the Jews other than that yeah it has come on you know maybe I got a good cup of ice tea or something something simple pleasures beyond that I mean he's\nHe's he's said some pretty outrageous things that get very little coverage and this is another one um people just they seem to kind of ignore him and act like a he's not there supporting Democrats he's kind of not there\nYou know at the very edge of the left or but if anybody on the right again this was the double standard hadn't said anything approaching that\n... uh about any ... can you imagine if somebody on the right had said something like that about Muslims would that be everywhere it would be everywhere are on the mainstream media um but he for some reason kind of flies under the radar\nAnd gets away with all of this stuff uh I mean I still haven't really suffered any consequences\nFrom talking about killing Malcolm X. even ... um\nShe pretty much it meant you pretty much admitted with this yeah\nI don't ... even ...\nUm she pretty much ... once you pretty much admitted with this yeah\nCity of you with\nUs today today and tomorrow [noise]\nMonday the are you [noise]\nBut if somebody\nEach one of the room you wouldn't be ... [noise]\nWe have a white man [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] did you make\nThe tradeoff\n[noise]\nSo I mean the accident that almost an exact mission uh he murdered somebody that we could yeah we killed ... is your business though we don't follow your white men law now\nWait not murdering somebody is why am I Hope that that's true no I don't think it is either by the way his Twitter account still active in case you or what have you have a conservative recently had his account of\nRemoved you could still get Lewis Lewis could still keep potent posting\nThese are the video the Jewish termite that was posted on Twitter yeah I mean it was just shut them down his his absolute Hitler sun porch talking about what this is Hitler stuff just as she did he says the third Reich stuff this is you know the architect of the third Reich Beto ... beers stuff [laughter] it's just not right now of the [laughter]\nGetting deep or getting deep down here [noise] but I think it's important to point out this is ... I'm not very it is that is a better mayor and it's\nThe fact that he can get away with it with no repercussions still no I mean like yeah the yes if you ask the Democrat\nOr eating publicly will you distance yourself from this guy upbeat most of them will say yes then will distance and stuff I have nothing to do with how\nThey will they will attempt that then you find pictures of them together right by like ...
