um uh [noise] we're talking to 'em Larry's wise or he is the president of government accountability Institute the producer of a documentary called the creepy\nLine the creepy line dot com um we're talking about Google and Larry I've never I've never\nIn you know those dystopian movies I've always made fun of them and said you know this this this is crazy\nBecause of their algorithms because they are so all encompassing that is the world were headed towards what do they tell you when they say algorithms that we have to keep that top secret because\nYeah they were they argue is this is for reasons of of a state secret um and and you know that they need to protect their trade secrets they need to be a a you know making sure that nobody gets access to it there's some truth to that but there are a lot of things that they could do to demonstrate\nUm that they're offering a fair product in service to people and here's the thing that they have lied about this before\nYou know ten years ago or so you had other companies like trip advisor and Yelp who were saying that Google was artificially suppressing\nTheir rankings in Google in favor of Google owned companies which okay you know Google has the right to do that but here's the thing Google flat out lied and said absolutely not we don't do that our algorithm is pure it's true the best results or ... or our organically at the top\nWell here's the problem the Federal Trade commission the European Union\nProfessors at Harvard University looked at this and said yes you are fiddling with the algorithm you are screwing these other competitors and you're lying to the point is when Google says you can trust the algorithm you can trust us they've lied before and they're lying now\nAnd I think the only question that remains really is how are we going to deal with us\nUm you know there's a whole story that Henry Kissinger said when he was on a national security council\nYou give a president three choices do nothing\nTake my solution or thermonuclear war those are your three choices\nAre in this case it's kind of like that we can do nothing we can try to deal with some sort of the regulatory issues related with Google or we can break up these companies those are the three options that we have and I think we're really at the point of point number three 'cause this is not\nA monopoly like standard oil sands oil that's going to dominate the hallmark of this is controlling the news flow in the United states\nIs in the and this is in the end petered controlling everything yes Google is ... the most likely company in the America in the American world\nOr to come up with a guy yes who ever who ever gets to a I first controls everything there is no way to beat it once you have a guy yes this company is the most likely in the free world to come up with it\nIf we don't have them ... contained in some way or another when they get to a I worked hosts yes\nYes that's exactly right and here's the thing it's not just\nGoogle the company a lot of people don't realize this I didn't realize this\nIf you use safari on your apple product you're actually using the Google algorithm and that is Google information\nUm if you're using if you are using um Yahoo\nYou're using Google the point being Firefox is Google the all these entities are using the Google algorithm so even if you say I Am not going to use Google dot com you're using unless you are making very specific choices for other options if you using any of those others\nGoogle is the one that's dominated by the way Google pays apple nine billion dollars a year Google actually pays apple to be the algorithm of choice for safari that's how much they value this information and want to dominate the space\nSo I Want to talk to 'em a little bit about um what can be done um with the algorithm or I'm concerned about some things that I think are really dangerous and\nAnd more importantly I think they are ... all of it look\nThere's the this is just at the beginning let me tell you this boogie story [laughter] you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay the center is the main city of aging how many people used to look it up for me well you're still how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle there is so much monitoring going on they just did a test they release the guy they they uh took a guy picked somebody said go into the center of the city\nJust go hide guy [laughter] they had a picture of the guy and the the Chinese tested this new brand new system and then\nAfter like an hour or two they gave the leaves system the picture of the guy and said find him\nIn eight minutes he was in the back of a squad car\nUnbelievable in ... minutes yes city of twenty two million yeah corn tea to millions amazing in eight minutes or so and this is without AI right this is the kind of stuff that is coming that people really need to pay attention to that's right and and Google or is it the forefront of that they they take\nIn front of exploiting future technologies real quick though on Gmail this is very important for people to realize that just shows you how far Google goes\nI used to have a Gmail account now what ... does is they scan every email that comes into your Gmail accounts and every email you send out\nYou know what else they scan if you've ever written a draft email let's say you're mad at your cousin and you know I'm sick of you know cousin Chris and all the crazy stuff he does and you write in late one night you write a draft and you say you know what I don't think I'm going to send that to Chris that's just me\nBeing an just as I get I Want to make sure this is writing a draft but that's not saving it as a draft correct It's just you ... it counts the delete delete delete delete delete delete it's not even saving it as a draft\nRight correct that's correct if scanned by Google\nSo Google knows more about you than you know you can have a very open and completely transparent relationship with anybody in your life your spouse your best friend whatever Google knows more about you than\nThey do and they are very aggressively going to retain that information but they're using it against you here's the key thing it's not just privacy is manipulation\nBecause they want to take that information and not just sell information advertisers they as part of their mission want you steer and move your life in a certain direction that they deem is the way the direction your life should go\nThere to be your choice or the documentary as the creepy line a cup let me push back in a couple of things sure or at least problems I have is I'm with you on Ninety percent of this one issue I have is Google is awesome it's all of the products that they make are better than everybody else's product at a similar ... it would\nEat ... incredibly inconvenience me to give up Google because all of their products work better than everybody else's James doesn't know [laughter]\nMore easier because I mean yes they're everywhere they're doing really good job yeah uh when it comes to designing an easy to use product right ...\nThat's that's a great question and it's not easy I mean there are alternatives search a systems out there um but none of them are as good as Google and it's not really that al ... and I think that's\nA a a road that people will go down that you shouldn't go down that what we should go down is we should be talking\nTo the people in like no no no we shouldn't be sending people who understand this five to Washington because by the time we talked to Washington it's already over we need people who understand the ethics of what's going on with high tech\nIn Washington because they need to have this conversation right now it's not about us changing our behavior fry it to the point we must corralled Google and break them up or corral them in some way\nNot was just little litigation because I'm a ... litigation but are not with just little simple laws of what we're going to cut because they'll go around that\nThat fire right okay let me I mean one other one yeah you said this earlier and it made me very uncomfortable and my suspicion is it makes you very uncomfortable to which is your solution we see we're leaning towards breaking up these companies and as a capitalist as a person who does not want the government involved like or in private business\nI mean how do you how do you have a bridge\nThat guy no I mean I I think that's a great point and I came reluctantly today says I looked at all the possible things to do with Google here's the problem in this space the way that technology is moving how\nGoogle exerts market dominance it really we really do not have a free market in search I it's really impossible in fact one of the guys we we interview the vice president of Yelp or in in our in our a film and the founder of Yelp said he wouldn't start you all today because it would be impossible\nAnd the Yelping these other entities have survived as they have built up enough brand equity when they were founded what Fifteen Twenty years ago to where they can exist so we have a situation where there are truly is not a functioning a monopoly and by the way Google's market dominance is partly related\nTo its political alliance in Washington may pass laws and rules all the time to squelch competition a veteran in Santa Fe\nAnd to do things like the platform ing yes we are not a publisher we're a platform right then they go in and they edit will now you're a publisher you're not a platform so they play it both ways and they're they have the money to do it yes and that's a hugely\nImportant point because when they first want it or it was set up the regulation for the Internet it was\nIf your publisher you're treated as a media company\nIf you're a neutral platform which is what Google and Facebook claim they are they said we're not going to any concept they even use the analogy were like a telegraph we're just taking a telegraph message from Peter and we're sending it to Glenn nothing else is happening when we all know that's not true now they're editing or they're censoring\nSo they are acting as publishers but unlike other publishers\nThey don't face the legal or regulatory burdens that they do so it's a competition\nOr even the public scrutiny even the public you sound like you're crazy if you talk against Google editing but I Know that they are like the wouldn't one solution be to make their algorithms transparent\nAnd yes that would help but the algorithm is changing a constantly and and I do get I Am sympathetic to the argument that this is a trade secret that\nThey work very very hard to develop and they have um I think by breaking them up into pieces and by the way I don't think it's just two companies I think it's several different Colombia and alphabet [laughter]\nUm I think it would be would be extremely helpful in the way to go on this um because otherwise they're going to continue to rigs or market dominance\n... the other thing I hear conservatives talk about and I find this terrifying is to make them a utility\nOh no no no I don't know what the utilities are like here in Dallas oh no [laughter] not Texas we don't really have a we have an open energy yeah all that so we have five different every company has in yeah we don't pay anything yeah like the notion of\nMaking Google a public utility ... which really means you're making it a government utility now means you've got that government controlling search no ... no interest in that\nWhatsoever and what you are seeing is this merging of Google which used to be generally out of politics very little lobbying very little interaction when Barack Obama was elected in two thousand eight you saw this enormous influx of Google people into Washington DC and they stayed\nSo it is now one of the most plugged in if not the most plugged in corporation in America so\nThis notion that there are kind of these wild cat or out of Silicon Valley that are like independent from government is just totally ridiculous I could\nSpend two days with you I really enjoyed this I'm going to take a hard pass on that\nHere where half an hour [laughter] yeah fetus\nWiser he is the president of government accountability
