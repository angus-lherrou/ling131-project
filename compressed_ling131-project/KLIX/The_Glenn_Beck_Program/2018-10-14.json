of the excuses that were thrown out there the the ... that well we didn't have the power to do anything\nWhich we threw out because so many decisions were made at that time on the on the fly that uh you know no rules were being followed they were trying to save the system and yet when they came here when he came to leave and\nThey made what I Do believe was a a crucial mistake I'm not suggesting we wouldn't have mattered financial crisis but I Do think it made it worse what are your thoughts\nI agree I mean I Do think adventurous packed it was a mistake I think if we look into the ... the statements by secretary as treasury secretary Paulson in the weeks before we look at it than than an keys actions he remained basically in Washington and the right up to that crisis\nI think there's a clear I think mood possibly even a decision\nEarly on not to do another best friends in other words not to sweetened the deal not to\nUh take some of the worst asset softly ... books also provide some kind of guarantee my own view is that ... this was really a reflection on the political price that they had paid the Bush administration that paid for the bailouts of Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac so to my mind this is the Republican policy really\nFeeling the pinch this election year they've done a truly spectacular active intervention with a Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac I quite nationalize action and they really just I think that I can watch them to pay the political price hike thankful I pay lots of leaving and\nI think then there's another question that follows on from that which is if one imagines them having done to leeman bailout obviously that resentment that share he would have reason to an even greater pitch I think\nThere's a real question in my mind about if they hadn't if the man had been bailed whether we would ever have gotten to top whether we would ever have gotten to a comprehensive recapitalize I should have the American banking system\nSo bad as it was that I agree with you I think it was a mistake not to bail leeman the effect of not pay they leave and was really to fold everyone to look out over the cliff or I'd have a look type of the cliff that and we moved to a much more radical kind of a intervention with top\nAnd of course a there was an irony and all of this as you well know because within within just a couple of days a few days of deciding not to say layman and then subsequently seeing the global the credit markets\nIt's just a couple of days a few days of deciding not to say layman and then subsequently seeing the global the credit markets freeze within twenty four hours and then they're faced with a edgy\nExactly now I mean I think that switch back is is just dizzying 'em and you really I think the you know a Monday morning that still celebrating the treasury that they'd had the nerve to leave and go swab all talked about ... number two talked about it being a good day to go to work in the treasury\nAnd then within twenty four hours with a A R G on the point of failure and I would have been in trouble I think whether we're not leaving a was allowed to go bankrupt um because he was basically just getting ... calls on the on the credit default swaps that had written a day's work and to be cold weather will not leave him and failed\nUm they they if there's an about face a complete change of a change of mind it's a really it's a it's a whiplash or a credible ready to ... decision making at that moment\nAnd our guest Adam twos joining us from Berlin has written a book on a vast array of topics related it's titled crashed how a decade of financial crises changed the world\nUh we've also debated on this program with various or help from I'm from guess the the topic of of of whether the Federal Reserve\nDid function in the end as the lender of last resort in the financial crisis given the fact aid that Lehman was let go and be a the financial crisis was such a total disaster what are your thoughts\n[noise] no I mean I think this is the one area where I won't have to say that the ... the Federal Reserve it didn't just acted acted on it really historic scale I mean it is one of the appointed functions of central banks legitimate uncontested and uncontroversial\nTo act as a lender of last result in a situation of a bank crumb no bank officer real even at very well run bank with very solid or the way they are very solid balance sheet can survive bankrupt and that's what we have a Federal Deposit insurance pool to prevent the positives running [noise]\nAnd that's what are the lender of last resolve function of the central bank is full over spectacular about what the fed did a right to not only that it led until it on a normal scale trillions of dollars in liquidity to us banks\nBut he did it for the banks of the world it provided trillions of dollars of liquidity to all of Europe Spanx I'm beginning in December of two thousand and seven um directly to that branches in New York and then indirectly by way of what to say what a cool liquidity swap lines [noise]\nUm to the central banks of Europe or in doing so it really is zero lost to the fed to the fed\n'em with collateral at all times so minimizing the risk if possible um it really enabled the banking system to come to this crisis without that there is no back ready that would have survived in right\nWell why do you think Adam that the Federal Reserve receives such a huge pushback against what they did in the financial crisis I mean they had been demonized are constantly by many in this country\nI think basically because what it revealed is this profoundly disconcerting fact about the ... tree and financial system which is being [noise]\nLiterally true since the early Nineteen seventies which is the money is not founded on any substantial basis it doesn't have a material and ... there's no goal sitting in the federals was uh [noise]\nFounded on any substantial basis it doesn't have a material and the ... there's no goal sitting in the Federal Reserve's a volts which guarantee the value of money money is founded on the the at the authority of the American state\nAnd on the confidence that he's maintained across the entire economy by a faith and confidence in the ... management of the monetary system\nAnd there is something just very disconcerting about the elasticity that that implies\nGoes in a crisis it's also a great advantage to have a ... system which can expand on that can prevent um the sort of catastrophic deflation which America suffered in the early Nineteen thirties but deep down I think many people find it extremely difficult to reconcile themselves\nTo was in the end does put huge discretion or in the hands of politicians and the officials that they appoint\nAdam do you think the merrier drug a with his whatever it takes a infamous quote a did a better job\nOf an oil I mean in the end barrio jogging came true but that was off the years of failing and another even more fundamental function of central banks\nWhich is a central banks of the market make a fool government debt\nGovernments are legitimate issue debt that the episodes of managing public finance the needs to be a agency to stabilize the market and the fed the bank of England the bank of Japan the Swiss national bank will provide this as a matter of course\nTo that governments um the ISI the is placed in such a peculiar position by its constitution\nAnd the people running it before marriage rocky was so conservative in that conception of the agency's role that they refuse to provide that support to such in a sustained way for the European bum bucket\nAnd it's that have you on that part which essentially is responsible for the panic and the suffering that market severe\nBetween twenty ten and twenty twelve will jogging was eventually finally doing was saying that at this point the construction of Europe the consolidation of its fiscal comes out of its called fiscal cliff situation is such\nThat I can do what any other central bank with a voice to Ninety whatever it takes\nA to stabilize the market so it was very light it was better late than never but it really was very late in the day\nOur guest is Adam two's a Columbia University his new book is crashed how a decade of financial crisis change the world and we're taking your calls after the

too\nHis new book crash tell a decade of financial crises changed the world enemy you mentioned World War two which is my opening to a one of your prior\nBooks the wages destruction the making and breaking of the known as the economy\nWe've talked about this from time to time with guests on the program over the last three decades plus but I've always been amazed at the way that the um the salient advice of John Maynard Keynes following World War one\nAbout uh how to how to go about handling the mess\nThat he faced after World War one particularly from an economic standpoint\nAnd the way John Maynard Keynes was so so perfectly brilliant in assessing the situation unfortunately he um he was ignored\nAnd we had World War II soon given the consequences this is what I really am impressed by giving the consequences of the newer ring the ... line of thinking on how to settle a reparations in the rest of it economically it in a World War one the consequences were\nWell beyond the pale or how did that happen\nBut I think that the the really key issue here at his home with a certain amount of contemporary resonance is into governmental debt so they're really difficult thing to resolve\nAll debts owed between governments say not governments having money to markets cars and the worst cuts circumstance that you simply restructure we did this and the Latin American debt cases of the Nineteen eighties uh Mexico in the Nineteen nineties if the government is money to a bank the some white out by means of a debt restructuring\nThe real problem after World War one than it was a two faced probably the most money owed from government to government so the two parts of the problem was that the British and the French fighting alongside the United states has its associates\nA contract to huge debts with the American state with the American taxpayer [noise] and then to offset upset some of that that are they being pious reparations on Germany [noise]\nAnd all of these states in the Nineteen twenties a democratic states that have elected parliament which have to pass the tax is necessary to service the stats\nAnd so that point a financial obligations gets translated into a political obligation or an and between sovereign states each one of which has to decide to sacrifice a large share of its GDP [noise]\nUm to to uh to service their stats are in the case of the U.S the money that it led to the British and the French constitutions a fool for the federal ... that are in the Nineteen twenties so this wasn't something that you could hide anyway [noise]\nUm if the British and the French didn't pay it than American taxpayers will get to have to pay it and that I think is the real entanglement the real the real problem of into governmental that\nAnd the agony of course is that that's exactly what we see in the year ... today and that Greece has just come out of its special measures it's notion Lee at least\nI'm In a in a normal state now rather than being under a crisis regime the de facto it's going to be paying back money to advance to it by the other governments of Europe for fifty to sixty is for the fussy about future for most of the rest of the century [noise]\nAn AK ... incredible political button a between those states it's very difficult to avoid the buildup of animosity\nAffects the standard of living for decades to come and grace\nIt absolutely does yeah it means that a public services will be squeezed ah taxes will be high or Greece has very high tax rates right now which of course then stunts investment so it creates a deflation make climate um in Greece or for the fussy about future out into the twenty\nWhich of course then stunts investment so it creates a deflation may climate um in Greece or for the foreseeable future out into the twenty fifties I mean so I really for generations to come to\nMind here is not to get political in any way professor but when you look at the situation going on right now with trade certainly is a\nA unique situation where we have a one country the United states laying down a terrorists on steel and aluminum or we have ah the makings of a potential trade battle between the United states and China\nWe have a lot of balls in the air right now what is what is your assessment\n[noise] I mean I think they really remarkable thing a bounce it um is that the Trump Administration should have chosen to pick all of these fights at once I mean it's easy enough to see why the Americans might have a beef with the residual terrorists or all of American vehicles are being traded back and forth with Europe\nOr the camera administration was trying to renegotiate NAFTA renegotiate NAFTA [noise] the Europeans and the Americans couldn't agree that you know trade with China is a rather one sided thing quite a lot of the time and has been a history of China ripping off other people's I. P. and there's a very good reasons to west and pass\nTo be concerned about the rise of an old ... regime which seems bent on\nThe ... dominance in strategic areas all of those ah each one of a separately as a legitimate concern what's astonishing is that the White House it is in Washington should have chosen to sort of lash out indiscriminately against everyone civil tiniest say\nUm which makes it very difficult to create the kind of alliance says that um you know a a necessary ready to make progress in bargaining I mean the America's position versus China will be much stronger was alongside the Europeans the camera administration\nWas using the TPP Pacific Pacific trade deal to gain leverage to Mexico and Canada in NAFTA to address February of grievances within that trade deal and the idea was to trade off concessions\nTo them in TPP against concessions in NAFTA all of that kind of gets taken off the table if you'll see ... the picking fights with everybody\nDo have concerns professors that we could be headed for an actual major trade war\n[noise] and I think at this point what has to be concerned I think one will say that needs to say that the\nLikely impact of that on global growth in ... grade in the United states is probably not as extreme as well might imagine I mean it'll be very bad individual industries which made decisions made a nice to be the auto industry which has straddled across North America with\nFacilities in Canada Mexico and the United states\nBut if you gave the auto industry a new trade regime they'll adjust to it and the same way as they had to the existing law and the uncertainty Israeli would affect investment but it isn't really on the trade side that I worry that the ... for me about the global economy is all about finance it's all about the effects of a stronger dollar of the increase\nIn interest rates in the United states and the impact of that on people across the world who borrowed dollars it's from finance I think an exchange rate's not from trade that you get the really big bad shocks historically to political grave\nOur guest is professor random Tuesday of Columbia University his new book crash tell a decade of financial crisis change the world are looking ahead at this Brexit mess in the u._k. a professor or what are your thoughts\n... it is a mess I mean it is an extraordinary message to find any other words for it um [noise] uh it's\nThe Europeans have always imagined that have the British having made this extraordinary decision but at some point come up with a viable bargaining position\nOn it just doesn't so far I look at the London is really in a position to deliver that they're all ... problems specifically about ... with the\nRelationship between Northern Ireland to the republic of Ireland the relationship between the Northern Ireland and the United kingdom simply being incompatible with each other\nAnd the British I think imagined that the Brussels within the fence or as a surrender or the Irish would surrender but the reverse has happened Brussels is basically authorized the republic of Ireland to make the final colon to veto any agreement that it finds out acceptable\nTo them that I think finds itself now in a in a position of week with the likes of which I mean it's difficult to think of any ... which that position as being as [noise] as weak as it is
