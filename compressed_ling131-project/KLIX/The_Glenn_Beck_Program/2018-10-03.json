I did that last week\nYeah [laughter] I thought it would you love to see these guy\nBecause nobody is talking about fines Feinstein really nobody in the media does is despicable I mean the\nI don't want to just take one side 'cause I'm not God so I don't know what happened I happen to believe Kavanaugh or a on forward and most of that is because Ford has changed her testimony several times\nA year just ... there's nothing support it but I maybe she's telling the truth I don't know I'm not God\nSo if I have to put them in a room and choose one or the other I'm going to choose him because I don't think she has enough evidence for me to credibly say\nYeah he's a bad guy and even if I kind of believe term I still would ... there was a bird to know if they're that it's not him you know he's not a not proven negative correct so I I Hope he didn't do it um and I don't think she has proven that he did by any stretch it out I don't mean beyond a shadow of a doubt I mean just a preponderance of evidence they had an inclination\nI mean I honestly at this point I Do not believe he did it I ... I don't need to not believe I don't either I'm now that's not to say I'm as you point out we're not God even though a pretty cool um so it's possible but yeah I I don't I don't believe that he did right so we've plowed this field over and over and over again\nHow come nobody is plowing the field on how much they've destroyed her life Senator Feinstein has destroyed her life\nAnd they lied to her several times lied to her she requested anonymity they released a letter anyway causing a chain of events that would obviously reveal who she was um ... obviously they lied to her about the Democrats\nAre the Republicans not willing to come out and take her testimony in California yeah\nShe was surprised by that I mean look to be Frank I mean she's told many lives in this process as well um and you know I I don't have all those realize what low things like you know she never fly that's why she can't make it to the hearing and then oh well yes I Do fly often\nAnd are those are things that she showed two co workers in\nReal time in real time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like Kavanaugh said the name cabinet even at that time but by the ... and I mean you\nI mean you don't have videotape oh there was a videotape now we haven't seen it yet though are now there is allegedly videotapes that exists some uh one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet I'm of course there is no video of the Kavanaugh thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the with the with the ...\nAnd we don't have that evidence yeah we we have a a ton of evidence and in fact\nI don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence and afford case so we I mean like we have any him out more we have a preponderance of evidence in the Alice in case there however um\nWhat's interesting about this is that fifty six percent of Democrats believe Christine Blasey Ford's allegations fifty six percent only eight percent say they ... they believe Kavanaugh fifty six to eight is a split there so you assume that if you ask\nPeople and it wasn't a partisan situation what do you think about the Alison situation do you what do you believe from her because she's got a more recent allegation she's actually brought it to the attention in real time to multiple people people around her have seen evidence of this there's text messages there is a ...\nAnd instead we just talked about there's an infinity amount time as more evidence in the Ellison case he had only five percent of Democrats believe Allison's accuser we're told over and over again that women are to be believed it only five percent of Democrats believe the allegations against Keith Ellison and here's\nWhy this is really important I'm just like I don't want an abuser on the Supreme Court if if there was the amount of evidence on Kavanaugh\nThat there is on a Keith Ellison I Would not be for Kavanaugh would you if there was amount on cabinet and how would I Would if if if the evidence\nWas the same thing yeah I like [noise]\nWe still have a standard here in this country um called innocent until proven guilty and preponderance of evidence is a slower is a lower level than that and I understand that\nUm my issue here would be\nYou can once there isn't the legal standard because people will say well this is just a job interview or this is just that this isn't a legal proceeding once you have the absence of a legal standard you'll have to choose the standard you apply I Choose to apply a very high standard\nBecause people who are in relationships many many times when he relationships breakup or someone feels jolted say things that are not true I having all that I agree with you I live in a way yeah in this case\nI'm Keith Ellison should have the right to defend himself and he should we\nShould assume his innocence unless I agree point in which he is and if especially with a case like this where it's very recent\nThat should just go through the legal system and when he\nComes out of he's guilty then he should get thrown out of that job and you can factor that in in your vote if you wish\nBut I don't think he should lose any job because of this at this point he needs to you need to be able to see whether this case goes through and and claims are proven someone had said they have video we need to see the video we see everyone a in investigated we need to see an actual police\nAh investigation and go through and and and see whether the evidence leads us to a belief that he actually committed these acts if we do not get that\nYou do not ruin people's lives over it I mean think about the amount of tons of evidence that there is a with Keith Ellison overall you more which everyone I mean even at a lot of people on the right where like look ... really looked like he did these things his answers are really bad\n... you know there's much more evidence for ... much more there's people you can interview right now yeah children who went through traumatic moments where they had to read about their mom being abused or you know sure her telling other friends at the time\nThat being said however you act in ... he went through this process where the presumption of innocence I agree\nSo but what I Know about Keith Ellison the evidence against him mhm okay\nAssuming this was not current day and it was thirty five years ago if for new would come with that evidence I have letters I have a photo of lead bruises on my arm\nI have um ah I can tell you where it happened\nI told my friends and here they are they verify that I told them after\nThe party ... would you not would you not go okay I think that's good yeah I mean I think that would be enough and it was the only way we can judge the situation wrecked by correct\nHere it is with Allison and again this is why it's important just like I don't want to have a Supreme Court justice that is an abuser or a liar or whatever I also think it's ...\nTo have a guy who\nMay have beaten his girlfriend may have mentally abused his girlfriend assuming the evidence is real and checks out you can't have him as the as the the the chief law enforcement of the state\nRight and just anybody care no fish shows you that nobody in the media cares and iota for this woman and her story they don't care if she was abused and they don't care about any of it what they care about is stopping Brett Kavanaugh if they care they would be just as passionate\nAs a guy let's not just throw him out as the Minnesota attorney general this is a guy who's second in charge of the deep what the the DNC ...\nThis is not a a a a ... a peripheral figure in politics he's one of the most powerful Democrats in America and it's now going to be a chief\nLaw enforcement officer for state and you could say oh well it's all you're what you're doing is what about his ... no no it's not it's not what about his him I apply the same standard to Allison that I applied to Kavanaugh you weren't doing this to Canada I Would still be saying this about\nI'm I'm a about Alice yeah look all go back to ... why was Brock Obama president right above was president because he won a presidential election in two thousand eight previously he made a heck of a speech and what two thousand four\nAnd a two thousand for an election he won a Senate seat a Senate seat that would have been incredibly close if he was going against not Alan\nKeyes who they flew in the last week to to start a campaign but it was a Jack\nJack Ryan but it might be thinking of John ... at this point um I haven't seen too many Amazon commercials but a Ryan was his last name and he was a legitimate challenger to Brock Obama in that Senate race it was a close election and he may have won it\nAs a Republican in Illinois and what they did is they went through his divorce is sealed divorce or um hearings and his and paper work\nOut at it to the public\nAnd in there there are accusations by his wife the actress\nWho had said they went to swingers clubs and all this sort of shady stuff\nDo we know if that was true in added horse proceeding and the divorce proceeding people make all sorts of yelling Ames\nYeah and that's why you don't just believe them that's why they're already old because they went and got them unsealed in a democratic state and they they they ... Brian eventually dropped out there was no real opposition for Rocco bomb and you've got eight years of him that it sort of thing should be always viewed\nSkeptically every claim of a crime should be viewed skeptically by people on that side you're supposed to give the presumption of innocence and they're all close to start with skepticism of a claim on any side on any side on any side of all people who are accused\nAnd here we are in a situation where Democrats overwhelmingly believe the accusations against capital with almost no evidence and they only five percent\nOf them believe the woman who is a Democrat who does not want someone up a ideologically opposed to ... uh to uh Keith Ellison to have that job she's a Democrat and only five percent of people believe her\nThe the platitudes you hear from the media and the left mean nothing on the story they do not care about whether Ford was abused or not they don't [noise]\n\nAnd this shows you how fast that standard is applied and how [noise] and how your life could be destroyed [noise] you are on the wrong side of an issue and by the way I think you've seen the issues change\nChanges and if you don't abide one hundred percent and you're not on the right side will destroy your life [noise] while they'll let somebody else be fine [noise] this is why we must have a standard we must have a standard is getting dangerous to be an American [noise]\nThat's the frightening thing to say [noise] All right I've been telling about gold lines do silver maple flex bar that uh the maple flex bar here still\nCan you open this up and and ah then break some people's pieces off what it is is it's a it's a it's a bar of silver I'm ... and it's it's made by the Canadian meant and what you do is you take it and you break it apart and it's in one tenth of announced one quarter of an ounce I couldn't get that one open either leaves open\nHer mom is so proud I Am very\nMother and baby are doing very well well done Chloe you are a hero and maybe even a doctor someday Jana theme\nJune ... messiah\nWe go to your phone in Delhi seven\nFor the fire\nSomebody afternoon for me as much as always\nFor four years and [noise] you know where you're from Tunisia and you're sure you're a lawyer [noise] news\nAnd talk on the radio dishes use radio for a change a show you all yes when oil to\n\nThe clock is ticking I'm Lisa ...

hold and uh we get his address she didn't eat it among now we didn't live mock she all he did play the audio real quick as we go into the bottom the are\nOr done something wrong okay so in at all sure either her\nAn accuser so he wasn't mocking he was dating the facts\nOf the trial or the or the hearing and a A N condensing the ridiculous miss of the accusers claim we must stop using the word victim\nSmith of the accusers claim we must stop using the word victim they are accusers they may end up being a victim that we can call them\nBut if we're going to presume innocence that I Know there's an old fashioned idea if you're going to presume innocence you must presume innocence which means this is the accuser you're on her\nThis is not the victim because one she's a victim what happens well we're supposed to believe could you look up the word believe uh yes I I can we are now being taught believe the victim\nBelieve okay ah two definitions of the word belief mhm definition number one except something as true feels shore of the truth of okay here or something is true so\nPeople now are saying believe the victim which is translating\nFeel sure that this person has been harmed or injured in a in an event of some sort okay and end up in this area and his response ... yes okay do you are being told when\nSomeone says something I have to believe and assume that we\nGive me the definition again except something is true I have to accept this as true field sure and feel\nSure that it's true that this person has been harmed or went through an act caused by this person wow that's a that's\nQuite a statement that doesn't seem logical at all because it only happen after ... you know that was beyond a reasonable doubt write like that standard as there what's the second version of believe\nUm hold something as an opinion ... think or suppose that seems like the one they're replying yes they're just trying to make it seem like I Believe you I'm sure the truth when in reality it's just their opinion there supposing it's true mhm they think it's true\nNow do you want to be judged or have your dad your brother your son\nYour sister your mother your friend have so world assume that something is true because someone stated it with out evidence the answer is no but we are being taught the next generation is being taught\nTo believe the victim here's the thing\nWhen you present evidence and I see preponderance of evidence I Will believe the victim now that's not even through court of law I just want a preponderance of evidence I Want to see it now you'll notice that\nLast week it was looking pretty dicey for Kavanaugh\nThis week it looks like there's been some things that the press is reporting on some people coming to the table saying okay I flew with her in a small plane in Hawaii but it's small plane a single engine plane it only had one exit it was cramped\nWas just us she didn't have a fear of flying she didn't have a ... we went out to go circle the volcano what are you talking about a fear of flying she didn't have a fear of flying the people coming out now saying the reason why she had the second door\nI was there ... all you have to do is go look at the permits she was building an office in her house it wasn't for escape it was because she was having clients come to that door and not to the front door\nIn an office in her house it wasn't for escape\nIt was because she was having clients come to that door and not to the front door I have two front doors because I'm afraid not according to the permits not according to why wait you put a front door because you were afraid why'd you put the office there what'd you put several after him there\nOf all things would you want to be random clients coming over your house all the time when I Want to separate that from your business as much as possible\nOkay so I don't know what's true I don't know it's true but I certainly do not supposed to believe her I don't think she's I don't know if she's a victim or not I don't know she may be a victim but he may not be the perpetrator right I mean ... the only person\nWho should be calling a her a victim is herself if she let let's just say this did happen to her she can fairly call herself a victim because she knows that happened to her if if it's true right\nBut even if it's true none of us should be calling or a victim at this point that victimhood from society identifying you was the victim is when other people have some confirmation of the trial going through there are enough information to prove\nThat there is one proven victim between the two of them right now one proven victim that is Brett\nKavanaugh who now can't teach up at Harvard because all of the graduate students are saying we're not having a rapist to teach\nWho can't you can't build the coaches basketball games anymore because\nThey can have a rapist ... he is now a victim now that I've noticed assumes that he's innocent um no no no wait wait wait negative ... victim even if he's guilty he's a very ... of mob justice right because they have not perfectly correct he's a victim of mob justice\nI'm not saying that he is he is not rightfully victim this point it sure doesn't look like it this is mob justice so far ... um she also is a victim she's a victim of the Democratic party and leadership\nShe is been victimized she has been dragged out when she said she didn't want to be dragged out\nShe was lied to when they when the Republicans said we'll go out and meet with you you don't have to fly\nThey didn't tell her that she's a victim by the Democratic party and they don't care they do not care that is the real tragedy of this to people's lives are for ever changed one if she is making this up\nIts on her\nAnd quite fun frankly so it was the victim mode of him it's on her\n\nLook at what's happened for political purposes only and if you think the Democrats and I think there are people who vote Democrat I think there are people who vote for the Republican I think there are people who vote for Kavanaugh\nActually feel bad for Christine forward I think they actually feel bad for because they don't know she may be something happened I was willing to say last week\nThat I think something happened and I don't know how it is becoming less and less clear to me that even something happened because of all of the other testimony now that is coming out that saying no I\nI was there were boyfriend for ten years nine years none of this none of this happened\nI I don't know\nBy the way I frankly do not believe her by either one of those definitions I don't suppose is and I don't know it's true I'm now look I could be wrong on this but she has ... not ... it's like you know it can be a hundred percent sure that this doesn't occur we weren't there\nYou don't know it's true I'm now look I could be wrong on this but she has ... not ... it's like you know what can be a hundred percent sure that this doesn't occur we weren't there but that's why we have a system to try to figure out those situations and were never there for crimes okay so I almost never there for them\nSo you'll notice that you are presumed innocent look up two words assume and presume\nIn our standard you are presumed innocent until proven guilty you're not assumed you are presumed what's the difference\nPresume is usually used when you suppose something based on probability so the odds are based on what we know she doesn't know the house she doesn't know the time she doesn't know the months you know we're\nThe people that she said here they'll testify that they were there ... all of them disagree all of them say I don't have any recollection of this at all so she has no witnesses\nShe ... the the documents from her doctor conflict with her report she has changed the time four times in the last former or two months\nSo and that is sketchy because it it appears as though she kept moving closer because Brett Kavanaugh would have been out of state\nIf it would have been where she originally claimed mhm so all of those changes so what's the preponderance of evidence what are the odds based on the evidence the odds are he didn't do it that's the presumption of innocence\nWhat is assumed innocence assume is used when you suppose something without any evidence so no one is asking you to assume he's innocent\nWe're asking you to look at the facts and then play the odds based on those facts what are the odds that she has it right\nSo let's stop using the word victim and let's stop saying we're going to believe every victim we're not we're going to take seriously\nBy rosy passed down twice from exhaustion editor one point wrote a note to his family to tell them you love them a neighbor

transaction is continuous linking buyer and seller and giving the seller opposed transaction power impossible in physical markets why is that important\nSo I I think this is important for a ... a number of reasons it leads to the scenarios that we were talking about earlier where the ... of the good as the ability not only is it as a leak lane\nOr or recall the good but they also have some ability to control\nHow and when and under what circumstances you make use of that product after the sale that's just not something that you could do and and the tangible world at you or your local

wrote a paper a few years ago a couple of years ago now I'm\n... what we buy when we buy now that did a survey of about Fifteen hundred consumers to figure out what people think this language news and it turns out that a significant percentage of consumers\nIncorrectly believes\nThat they do have true ownership rights they get to keep these goods they can lend them but they can give them away and we think that there is an opportunity here to\nA correct with misinformation in the marketplace but think about the company that we're talking about you know apple and Amazon are to the biggest

about the individual and you know I think you understood you are understated the case\nOf tankers I mean if you look at the inventions in America ... a lot of them a lot of our progress came from what used to be called tankers\nPeople who just did things in their own garage and and uh\nAnd now with ... of the government or these corporations every one is being told that the way it is sit down shut up you can't do anything about it and I think that's extraordinary I mean that that that\nYou know in in decades that's what created China in many ways that's what they don't think of things the same way that we do they don't have that that um spirit of invention that America has always been known for\nShow I I agree with you that um that the history of innovation in this country has um benefited greatly from individual creators and we we need to keep an environment in which people have that ability to experiment\nUm to innovate and ultimately it to just share a that progress a with a with the rest of the country and the rest of the world\nI worry that we're moving in that direction where um people aren't able to build those skill sets because they live in a world of sort of lock down digital life\nSo let me ask you one more question and I'll let you go I Know you've spent this twice the amount of time here that you you probably planned on um the last one more question I'm really concerned about copyrights patents trademarks we seem to be entering a world where\nPeople don't take somebody's intellectual property seriously on the on the other side of this um they just feel that to well I can download it I can just take it a an itch and we shouldn't have intellectual property rights that that is frightening because again\nThat was the second piece of the American experiment was you have a right to that intellectual property for a period of time so you can make money on it which encourages other people to come up with their own ideas\n\nDo you see this why do you see this fading and his trouble on the horizon as well\nSo I I write in each about intellectual property and it's something that I take 'em very seriously and one of the things I always try to communicate to my students is that an intellectual property system functions best when there is a balance between the interest\nOf the public interest\nProperty system functions best when there is a balance between the interests of the public interest of creators and the history of intellectual property copyright in particular is it is a history of a struggle to find\nIt and and and that appropriate about 'em and I think we're we're going through and had been going through a kind of sense for the last adoption or the Internet a period where we're struggling with how to answer some of those questions are there are certainly areas in which\nI'm caught freight holders have legitimate concerns\nAbout air works being exploited without compensation and on the other hand we live in a culture in which um copyrighted works a sort of um\nIncreasingly hung a distributed with within these environments like apple and Amazon for example where consumers can't do the same but they think they're entitled or should be ...\nSo I think that the part of the solution here is providing consumers a strong incentive to pay for these works on that one of the things that streaming services I shouldn't have gotten quite\nA which is that they offer a really attractive deal to consumers so people learn that if they're going to access\nThe world's libraries is it they have to pay for the privilege of knew that figuring out how that money gets distributed and what the price point is I think ... is one of the sticking point so it it's an important set of questions and I'm One that I probably can't do justice to um\nYou know a couple of minutes back like All right Aaron thank you so much I appreciate it and I appreciate a viewer thoughtfulness a on this uh and we'll keep watching for a updates thank you so
