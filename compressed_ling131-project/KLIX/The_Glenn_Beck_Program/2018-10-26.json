P. Morgan\nIt was the Morgan house if you will his office was in there one of the bombs went off right next to that building but Morgan had built this classical building so deep and so thick that it didn't penetrate anything\nThirty eight people killed a hundred and forty three severely injured the bomb went off just off of the sidewalk\nAnd it didn't affect his building except there are ... marks from the shrapnel in the building look it up twenty three Wall Street you'll see the shrapnel on the side of that building the pocket parks\nAnd Morgan said we're not going to repair it leave it there\nAs a symbol that no one scares us no one is going to push us into a revolution no one is going to scare\nUs leave it there don't try to hide or cover up those pockmarked\nNow I don't know how many people in the media today even know that story\n\nI can guarantee you nobody is telling you that story they're saying this is unprecedented and it has to be the rights\nHistorically speaking it's almost always the left\nNow this might be the right those might be actually Republican because Republicans are known for not getting anything done uh and so this guy built these bombs and build them in such a way that they were never going to explode\nI don't know who built these bombs could be somebody from the left could be somebody from the right\nBut it's unusual that you could build this these this number of bombs and none of them\nWent off\nRemember Nineteen Nineteen twelve bombs were delivered twelve bombs went off Seventeen were not delivered Seventeen were stopped before they could go off\nThis time not a single bomb went off\nWe're dealing with somebody who has not just the lack of sophistication but is completely incompetent and may be crazy and I thank God for that\nNo one was hurt or injured but there is the other possibility\nThis is meant to look like a bomb but not act like a bomb\nAgain you you you nailed it quite a few minutes ago and saying that the humanitarian crisis that we have to be focusing on here really is a crisis with the refugees themselves having to make this long dangerous journey and then knowing that when they get\nHere the odds are pretty high that they're not going to be deemed eligible for asylum in any event at just creates a whole lot of headaches for them in the process\nSo Mike I gotta I got an um an email in yesterday from a listener in Honduras Honduras resident and a born and raised native or in Honduras\nSaid been following the news or on the caravan here locally or been also a fan of your show watcher show and I have to applaud you and your intel um the origins of this migrant march this all wrapped it in and two thousand nine when the president of Honduras Manuel ... men well a ... a\nA lackey of Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro was ousted constitutionally by the other two branches of government\nEver since then we Hondurans have lived in chaos many of the things are have been tried by ... and his party ... which translates to Freedom Party to destabilize our country\nThis latest sons of ... blames America and has made Americans know reaping what its own type statements he says that America must take into migrants because America has supported the current administration\nThat he claims is caused all the misery that we uh Hondurans are living through\nSadly the migrants have been lied to and have been told that America must accept them in one news report a lady was interviewed a and she told the Honduran reporter that they were promised bosses\nThey must accept them in one news report a lady was interviewed a and she told the Honduran reporter that they were promised buses to travel on once they got to Guatemala but there were no buses waiting for them some of the migrants have returned home one twenty two year old man died in Mexico for reasons unknown as of yet\nWhat's really sad and frustrating is many of these migrants have been a told that they will get in and they'll have jobs waiting for them when they arrived in America\nThere for many or good with hopes of a better life but this is the type of situation that these criminals are who are the originator of this march will take advantage of\n[noise] somebody's messing with them and we have to remember that most members of the Caribbean or ineligible for asylum or earlier this year or the department of justice clarified that you cannot claim asylum\nSimply because your home country is unsafe by definition by law aside least face\nIn individual in particular I danger in their home countries\nAnd because there's no legal basis for the vast majority of those in the caravan to remain in the United states\nOr we end up doing what we can what we can to prevent people from making the journey at all that but this this tape and you just read is part of it is\nA narrative is false rhetoric that is perpetuating the problem and I think it needs to be called out as such just because they have a country that is a mess that as a government that has made light\nUnpleasant for everyone there does not mean that any particular person necessarily as a valid claim for asylum in the United states\nMike have you heard have you heard anything talking to Senator Mike Lee have you heard anything about what Mike Pence revealed I think it was not yesterday day before I'm On a that the Venezuela is behind the

Venezuela might be doing it began as well it is broke Venezuela's perhaps a as broke as any country in the region right now\nAnd so that would really be something if they were doing it\n[noise] what do we do if they make to the border Mike I mean the male the Univision I think it's Univision is reporting that that number is now fourteen thousand I think that's hard to believe but you know even have five thousand people at the border what do we do\n[noise] [noise] it's um difficult to say I hope and pray that it doesn't come to that\nBecause first of all think about what that would do it or already overwhelmed immigration courts or immigration courts are nowhere near being ready to handle that kind of volume for nowhere near ready to be handling the kind of volume that they've already got\nA and so I I suspect that we will need to\nUm bring out a whole lot of additional human resources let's just say in order to make sure that our border isn't completely over run and that it doesn't just become a free for all for people to enter the country unlawfully we have no idea no ability to control who comes in once there is um\n[noise] ah that kind of stampede coming in all at once so we've got to protect our border\nSenator Mike Lee last questions any any comments on um the the multiple pipe bombs that were delivered\nA tragic it's frightening I condemn anyone who\nThe bombs that were delivered a tragic it's frightening I condemn anyone who uh who get it and I condemn anyone who says anything ah to applaud or encourage your support that kind of action\nUh this is not something we can tolerate in American political discourse and I look forward to the day will find the perpetrators responsible and I think they should be punished to the maximum extent possible under the law\nYou would classify them a ... let me rephrase that I Would classify whoever did this as terrorists would you classify them as terrorists\nWithout question without question and they need to be punished the such\nKay thank you Mike appreciated Senator Mike Lee author of written out of history a great book or if you were looking to uh learn about the great people and our uh in our

of them is addressed to James Clapper the other one I think is to Cory Booker what's amazing is that none of these have gone off none are so lot of these were just lucky we are we are by this this\nThis Trump supporter this conservative boy oh boy he's a moron luckily he's just a bad luckily bomb a building I mean and we can we check with the New York times is saying about this I can now there's of course we all know we all know let's rush to judgment\nKavanaugh was of course a gang rapist and these bombs are clearly Donald Trump's fault okay here's the New York times or none of their devices harmed anyone and it was not immediately clear whether any of them could have late\nThese are ... are very dangerous yeah I mean in fact uh shows the level of sophistication\nI that's what I heard from CNN these pipe bombs show a level of sophistication ... what's the New York times say now I'm One law enforcement officials\nSaid investigators we're examining the possibility that they were hoax devices instructed to look like bomb would not have exploded wow now you may uh you may have read the story from the New York times\nIs that why they never gave us really any details on ... ... well you probably didn't get to\nA paragraph thirty four ah that were ... you know you know how you know how like Jewish people read from a right to left we read left to right\nMm okay I with the New York times it's like reading a foreign language I like to read bottom up a lot of good stuff\nTowards the ... yeah when you get to the bottom you start with the bottom it is funny because usually the headline doesn't matter I mean uh some bomb technicians who studied photos of the device that circulated on social media suggested the bomb sent to CNN had the hallmarks of fake\nExplosives kind more typically depicted on television and movies rather than devices capable of detonating almost like a Wylie coyote kind of\nAlmost a digital clock was taped to the middle of the pain of feature that experts say is typically shown on fictional bombs in an attempt to ratchet up dramatic tension ah but\nIs this really keep from tipping off they're targeting all about when the bombs are said to explain it was just a like a nice little clock they were sending to these people for their death [laughter] that's what I saw a look at that and you're like that's not a Bob here's a here's a bonus if you survive\nAll it is that it had an handler wants one hundred percent survive abilities so far on these bombs\nOne hundred percent survive ability\nWe're it is weird now look it could it be a I think here's a plausible scenario that someone on the right did this pay\nSomeone on the right who really does not like all these figures decided that they wanted to send a message to all these figures but aren't actually or murder they want to scare the hell out of them but they didn't actually when it kills they want to do that at a\nPoint you want to know what you could be doing to this country let let me show yet and they're crazy they were wrong are really horrible despicable and everyone they weren't murderers and so they built this to look like bomb\nIf you look on I mean you get this example of this on social media all the time I mean if we counted all of the death threats and horrible things that you get on social media as real all the time\nYou'd have to have a staff of salads and checking them all out mhm instead you know most of the time people say crap on social media that goes way too far and that they're actually intend to do they don't intend on\nA you know you start to happen to for example Dana lash right like has to take all those things seriously when she was on TV uh ... she got all sorts of threats on her family and they did take them seriously but like\nAs far as I Know at least no one actually acted\nOn those things thank God right so you have these serious threats that come into public figures often ends and sometimes they don't wind up panning out most of the time right even even look at terrorists I mean the the amount of ... people in the middle east who say that they would uh execute a terrorist attack on on people who are\nOn you know people from another country for example you and I know the state is\nHe is so high it's incredibly disturbing you almost would never walk outside if you realize how many millions of people will tell pollsters that yes I Would kill American citizens however obviously they're not doing it right\nWhether it's because they're not capable of doing it or whether there are in reality they just want to send a message or they really don't like them but I'm not going to go kill someone whatever the reason is and that could be the situation here could be the same thing from a someone on the left\nWho wants to make the right look bad a week before the election or sending these things around with no intention of killing anyone but wants to make a big media circus you think they're all plausible possibilities we have no room to know that other than the fact that these were all political figures and none of the bottom seem to work\nPut Phelan who is I think there is no ill intent by Jimmy Fallon doing that but he's friends with Chris Rock right ... but the issue here is it on the freaking NBC yeah you can spirit us ally early for mentioning it but you know like Jimmy you're going to give Jimmy Fallon the top but place in your network so what\nShe said was weight but if you are if you are holding somebody up if you're if you're making fun of them okay but\nIf you're holding somebody up like this woman who you know with Diana Ross she liked Diana Ross you unlike Diana Ross for the night and she's not making as he's not making fun of Diana Ross well isn't that\nWas ... Fallon did actually\nDidn't ask the question teaches ...\n... ... ... you brought up a great point yesterday and I thought about this as we were getting close to or getting close to Halloween ... ... the biggest deal in the world was made of finally\nAfrican Americans have a superhero Black Panther finally they have one finally after all this time we've given them superhero and one that actually people want to be with the yeah the white kids and black kid might want to be so if you're white sun decides he wants to be Black Panther\nUm and I think that it's now of course as a father I Would be like sorry dude you're going to be surprised to hear this but knew you could not do that like we have no awareness of race but I mean if what he's trying to do is to be you know the\nThe one of his heroes who happens to be African American and he obviously notice the difference in characteristics\nThat I mean is that a a horrible\nHorrible thing for a child to consider\nGolf course now to be horrible of a black person dressed up as Superman no no no not that way if they put on white face as Superman no I mean it seems it seems ridiculous you wouldn't do it because you don't ... I don't see a Superman is white or black he's just a Superman it doesn't matter\nBut because of the name of the show was white Superman right black plan for the anti try that again I just got this from a an African American a friend of mine who I Am not going to name because I'm afraid that they will be targeted OJ\nGlenn what about white face literally this morning my son in eleventh grade said he and his friends want to be white chicks from the movie white chicks\nI thought it was funny but I don't know especially at the same [laughter] people will take what's supposed to be funny\nI thought it was funny but I don't know especially at noon and [laughter] people will take what's supposed to be funny or and there'll be overly offended by it and start this back and forth drama that none of us need uh we live in a white community\nAh and I literally said I think this is going to come back to bite you later I never thought I'd have to tell my kids that\nFrom an African American [laughter] miss a thing [noise] amazing\nAnd you know it may not they're not may not be a backlash we're going the other way for blacks dressing in white face that movie\nCame out depends on your hands on the political climate now yeah there would have never been before everybody thought it was funny yeah there would have never been but because of the political climate because people are\nYou know you can't even talk about it this is Ken so what did we learn from Megan Kelly the only reason I even ask a question ...\nChair even asked the question here is a woman who is one of the smartest people on TV she is as sharp as the sharpest razor we all worked with her\nWe all know you screw with Megan Kelly and she will cut you took ribbons she is a wicked wicked smart agree ... okay yeah so here's this woman\nWho is working at a place that hired her and then my theory is they hired her because they thought oh she's a great investigative reporter she's great as a interviewer said get at the time they were in a bidding war yeah she was a huge get as soon as the end they all thought this was going to be great\nThey put her in and then the social justice warriors all in the network it outside of the network oh my goodness how could you possibly she worked at Fox News and then they realized oh crap we're ... we're in trouble now with all of the fringe\nBut we thought would be cool with anything that we do now all the social justice warriors and so they needed a way out they have persecuted her persecuted her\nAll the way through so what happens they see this opportunity she's asked a question that's it she's just says well wait a minute is this wrong so here's what we learn\nThat even one of the most powerful celebrities one of the most powerful educated women is so frightened by the social justice mob inside NBC\nBut the very next day this very bright woman who knows who she is goes on television crying literally you can see it in her face\nCrying she's so frightened by these people that she says I I'm Sorry I I I've learned a lot well what did America learn\nAmerica didn't look at I mean this sincerely mean this absolutely sincerely\nPat stew can either of you give me a note on politically correct reason why this is so offensive to wear black face like Diana Ross if you are not making fun of\nHer you're not you're not you're you're on fire and can be someone you admire right can either of you give\nMe a non politically correct answer in other words you can use political correctness well because people will be upset nope nope no tell me why ...\nThe only reason I have is is the one from our ochre and uh which is ... which was that this was used sort of as a battering ram against blacks in the twenties and thirties OK okay Neal hang

I invite you to uh read with even the president of ... saying\nI'm this is this is backed by a cube of the Venezuela a and ousted president of Honduras\nAre that are blaming the United states for all of the unrest ah the former president says that ah America's gonna have to pay for all of this uh they'll have to accept our citizens that this is just an ongoing internal battle\nA in Honduras that has quite honestly lied to many of their people\nUm and said that America's gonna have to take you and they're going to because they're responsible for this mess this is a Marxist a revolutionary\nUh that uh has tried to take Honduras by force the Supreme Court two branches of their government found what he was doing to be unconstitutional and kicked him out and he's been causing problems ever since and now\nHe Venezuela and Cuba are together in what was formerly known as all the\nBut they are tested the United states and they're the ones financing at least the beginning of it that's how it started now ... others may be involved but I haven't seen any evidence of that yet but I Would not put it past them\nRight and and it would be interesting to see if there is a pipeline of cash\nGoing into ... to ...\nSo this is what I say I'm skeptical of everything and I agree with you there has been no hard evidence put forth the George Soros are people like him did this\nBut if you know it's it's one of his things they've done in the past but the the government of Honduras should be able to trace foreign money coming into that country back they should be able to show people\nThis is what has arrived here\nSo\n...
