um\nYeah so there are some things you can do and one of them one of the many things I found them at West says you shouldn't be using Google Analytics which Glenn Beck dot com is using [laughter]\nSo that the individual level now as the as the organizational governmental level there's other things uh you know ...\n... you shouldn't even be using a Google Chrome browser I'm ... but even if you go to is it in Microsoft browser that it's powered by Google\nOr information I mean there's\nYou know no ... no matter what no matter yes I Do know which I have no matter where you go Google is there a Google Now pays apple computers nine billion dollars a year to be the default search engine when people are using safari which is which is apple\nGoogle is paying apple nine billion dollars next year they're supposed to pay them twelve billion\nTo be the default search engine on safari this is for any any apple device at all so Google is everywhere where do you think Syria gets his answers from it gets his answers from both Syria is is you know\nApple's personal assistant so I mean I could go on and on and on but Cathy asked the institutional level there are things that has to be done uh one of them which I'm helping to work on with people now and we need money so you know if you if you guys have money out there you know step up\n... you know basically it's a little ... with people's permission to look over people's shoulders and see what these companies are actually showing people and how they're manipulating people\nSide would love it but I'd love to be a part of that um how can people donate to that\n[noise] well they can go to my Google research dot com my Google research dot com that's a very simple way to donate\nThat supports the research that I Do but also a that's helping to provide funds to build monitoring systems which which must exist they don't exist I did build one and two thousand sixteen\nBut we need large scale permanent monitoring systems to keep all these these creepy arrogant people under control\nSo [noise] I Am very I'm concerned I'm about the GI and a a sigh I'm and I'm I'm concerned that in two ways\nOh I feel as though we need some sort of the Manhattan Project to make sure America is the one that gets at first\nBut on the other hand I don't know who I trust to have it I mean you cannot put the genie back in the bottle but when when we had a GI we are in real trouble are we not\n[noise] ah ... you have no idea [laughter] to if you if if no seriously if you if you knew the stuff that I knew when you were looking every day at the numbers I look at you wouldn't even get out of bed\nOkay All right well I'm going to go back to bed though I've I mean I've I've I've read a lot about it so what do you suggest what do you what what what\nShould we be what should we be asked in I mean I mean Congress has just useless our government is just they're not paying attention to this at all and it's moving so rapidly by the time they would enact something it will be too late\n[noise] that is correct so regulation in law is not going to help us too much because I just moved too slowly and and ... it was extremely fast\nSo ah you know that doesn't mean we shouldn't you know contact are are are are are kind of a congressional representatives karate should\nJust try to keep the pressure on uh I've I've been a speaker uh at at meetings of the attorneys general the state so attorneys general in there and those are those guys and those women can move they can move fast\nThey are you saying so [noise] you know a lot beyond that you know you you've got to start\nAt the individual level I mean if you're using Gmail right now that's insane if you're using chrome that's insane if you're using an Android phone that's that's all Google\nThe ear nuts you're crazy to use products because those are all just surveillance platform that's all they are that they're they're they're just ... feet up surveillance platforms they're just they're just excuses Google has come up with\nA for us to just tell them everything about ourselves do you how much information Google has about you\nKnow\nThey have 'em just based on your age which is I Know roughly a they they have the equivalent of about three million word pages of information about you oh\n[noise]\nSo I mean\nI guess I mean I guess I made a point to where you don't get up out of bed like you I mean I ...\nI mean\nI I guess I mean I guess I made a point to where you don't get up out of bed like you I mean I ... so it's overwhelming so what does that mean what I mean how do we there's no way to get it back are you familiar with solid let me go here you're familiar with solid and interrupt\nYes\nIs there any chance that that is going to play a role in the future is that a pathway\nA ... ...\n... it's hard to tell I'm a I'm going to have to say probably not because uh it's it's very very hard uh you know Google and Facebook meticulous are\nAre are so powerful and so imbedded that ... ... you just ... you can't really cut into them people people don't want to leave them people are ... you know they they love them and so it's hard you know I Know lots of people working on alternative kinds of you know services and\nA and a lot of people are talking about block chain and so on but I mean the reality is you know we're talking about Ninety percent of search around the world is done on Google\nUh these two companies are serving right now more than two point five billion people that all the past four billion within the next three years they're just growing and growing and growing by leaps and bounds so\nIt's concerning what they're doing in China I mean I mean I don't know how I don't know how they sleep at night\n[noise] [noise] well that's outrageous that is ... so they cause they're actually they're actually partnering with the Chinese government to participate in the Chinese governments are aggressive a program to control all of its citizens and Google is ... ... and that\nI mean literally making it easier and better making that kind of system easier and better that's and that's that's outrageous\nDodger I Would I Would love to fly you in and spend a couple of hours with you and and have you on regularly to to be able to monitor and help in any way that we can to get the word out this is\nThis is the thing that I think America and the world should be concentrating on and no one's talking about it the world is being redesigned\nBy a handful and we're just not aware of it and it's going to change overnight\nA doctor thank you so much I really appreciate it absolutely\nYou've as it's been an honor true out or Glenn\nThanks very much Dr Robert ...
