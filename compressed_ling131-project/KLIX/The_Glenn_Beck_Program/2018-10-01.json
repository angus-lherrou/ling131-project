because she knew early Nineteen eighties\nWas false and it was fresh in her mind and might set off the polygraph\nThen finally by mid September on her first on the record interview with the Washington

of the most dramatic andme important Nick ... events of her life\nWhy is this significant well because\nIf the attack happened when she was in her late teens or in the mid eighties\nAs she first told the Washington Post and her therapist Brett Kavanaugh would have been three hundred miles away and Yale University as a full time student\nSo it couldn't have happened in the mid Nineteen eighties or in her late teens\nThere's more in the memo and we'll get to it\nBut this is a bombshell that no one will discuss it not only discredits Ford's allegation against Brett Kavanaugh it obliterate said it

kind of how I Want to be I Want my life to become a but it was interesting watching it in that I've never seen anything like this no this is\nThe people who are speaking with certainty about this it's incredible yeah she has provided\nNo evidence whatsoever that this event has occurred the standard instead of being innocent until proven guilty or innocent or the preponderance of evidence shows otherwise\nThese guys become innocent until proven accused we now know that she's accused this but Kavanaugh so therefore he's guilty is not a healthy standard for society and how any woman I'm a or leftist who has a son could possibly support this standard\nWhat was happening was African Americans were feeling that there was no justice in America it's always the black\nGuy that gets blamed and then he goes to court and the white system puts them behind bars and so they weren't rooting for him they wanted anyone to beat the system they wanted anyone to prove that a black\nGuy could we could go to court and not be guilty that's what they wanted they wanted a victory against the system totally understandable\nUs the African American community now same people did O. J. Simpson do it yes we're all in agreement now now the the emotions are gone we're all in agreement that OJ Simpson\nWas guilty so the question is was justice done\nThe answer is clear no it's not justice that's social justice that's I Want to feel good that social justice\nNot real justice social justice\nEvil when it is when it is played the way the post modernist and the progressives are playing it now it does not provide any kind of real justice\nThat woman who was in the elevator her plight I'm sure was real I Know I could tell her feelings were real and I feel sorry for and I don't know what happened in her case I don't even know if it happened here in America or where it happened\nBut I Will tell you this in the case of Ford we cannot help as a society if you don't ask for help if you don't ask anyone\nFor help we can't help you later especially thirty five years later we can't help you know I'm I'm shocked\nThat someone could be as traumatized as Dr Ford was and no one in her circle of friends in high school let's say she was a sophomore in high school well no she can be a sophomore could she could she be a sophomore\nShe have to be a freshman or a junior I'm trying to figure out when Kavanaugh is a Yale and they're both still in school but let's just say was sophomore year she did this happen to her\nThis happens to her are you telling me that there is no one in her life no one her mother her sister her best friend\nThat wasn't told but now when told\nDoesn't go oh my gosh I remember yes it was that summer and all of a sudden you didn't want to go to any parties anymore\nWould you go to a party if you experienced what she experienced would you want to be by yourself at a party would you change fundamentally at parties enough for your best friend\nTo at least now be able to go I remember that you were really weird that summer\nThat didn't happen that didn't happen\nNobody remembers anything she doesn't remember the year that had happened and as the investigator has pointed out she's changed this now for five times\n\nWe can't help you you have to tell someone you have to tell the police\nWe are not the country of the Nineteen forties\nWe [laughter] I Want to make sure that nobody goes to jail that is innocent but you know what that requires not social justice\nNot believing the accuser but looking at the facts you say you're for prison reform\nAnd at the same time you will not look at facts you only want to go with the mob mentality you only want to go with what is politically correct and deliver social justice\nYou say you're against uh putting innocent people behind bars\nAnd that our justice system is so corrupt that it is put black man behind bars because of white society look at what you're doing right now\nAnd if you were honest about the way you actually feel think of the the construct that is built by the left\nAll police are really bad people that are going to a throat innocent black people in jail or the white people are racist against black people how would how would let's say real racist cops and racist women a deal with\nAn African American who they say has assaulted them in the past\nThink of the standard you're creating black people have been victims of this in the past where they were a unfairly accused of crimes I mean you can go back to Emmett Till right like you can go back there is a lot of these things that have happened over the years you weren't asking for that standard to return how are you going to react\nWhen a black man is is accused unfairly about some assault they didn't commit are you going to believe the white woman then\nI I this standard they are creating is insane and I feel for the woman in the elevator you can tell she passion I don't know if it's about politics or not I don't know her story federal one thing I Do know a better story is Brett Kavanaugh wasn't responsible for it he\nNo role in what happened to her no no no responsibility none now the\nOh well role and what happened to her no no no responsibility\nNone now the argument on the other side is we're only asking for five more days we're only asking for five more days well if everyone was quiet for five days that would be something okay we've got five days to look at this we have we have until next friday to look at it but that's not what they're doing\nThey've now moved the goalposts ... they're using these seven days to come up with something new to move the goalpost she lied about\nYou know how much he drank no\nShe ... oh my gosh\nRight there ... and now they're saying well yes you gave us the FBI investigation but it's not throwing up it's not enough time the only thing here is there delay tactics and that how you can tell this and I think we're going all the honest enough to understand this\nIs Brett Kavanaugh let's just say politics fail him and flaking Collins and Murkowski bail and the bill comes down and he gets voted down there won't be a soul who give a crap about this woman story they will all do they will not even she will not get a phone call returned\n'cause you can still investigate this by the way there is no there's no statute of limitations on felony sexual assault in Maryland they could still go after this the second Kavanaugh was not in that seat they will forget about her and she will be a non story because they don't care about her story it has nothing to do that they're just trying to play this to try to get a pass the electorate\nNow here's the here's this the\nSecond point I Want to make\n'em Republicans if this fall through\nAnd the very next day you don't have a qualified candidate that your going to put through you're out of your mind may I suggest right now that if Kavanaugh falls through\nYou don't have the spine something comes up whatever there is one guy that has already gone through all of the confirmation hearings one guy who is already at every FBI background check one guy that everybody in the Senate knows and that's Mike Lee\nIf Kavanaugh goes down in flames Monday morning or Saturday\nThe president should announce his next Supreme Court justice pick of my clean and you should vote on it next week because there's no need to delay he's already had all those FBI background checks and each senator knows exactly who he is\nHe's qualified jeeze clean\nAnd quick\nYou could get that done long before the election if I hear the ... the Republicans have this fall through the whole we're prepared we weren't prepared for the I'm going to lose my mind\nSo that I Will bring up a story about

your future learn more about skin cancer doubt or a message from the American Academy of ...\nNews in talk on the radio news radio their genes and ...\n... ... what\nBrand back to the program okay here's the one question that I Want to ask every single person in this audience about what should ask your friends this\nLet's imagine for a second that every single person that you want elected from\nFrom dog catcher to president the United states that every person you want elected is elected and they are putting in all of the policies that you want it's it's your utopia\nVery remains about fifty percent of the country and I'm going to be really generous I going to make it a lot easier there's thirty or forty percent of the country that disagrees with your utopia they just want to go in a different direction\nWhat do you do with the forty percent of the population\nThat does not agree with you\nWhat do you do with them\nWhat do you do to make sure that those people don't start infecting the minds of others so your perfect utopia starts to fall apart what happens with the ones who won't comply\nTo comply with these new rules what do you do to make sure that that utopia\nIt remains in place by keeping all of those people in power because there's going to be another election and if you have history tells us anything it swings the other direction what once you have the power what are you willing to do to keep the power\nIf your answer to all of those questions isn't nothing you have gone over the cliff\nBecause in America the answer to what are you going to do to all of those people who disagree the answer in America is nothing\nWhat are you willing to do to keep your power or the answer in America is nothing what do you do it just to silence those who will not comply the answer in America is nothing\n\nSo any time somebody says we should shout these people down they've taken the first step all Fox is creative\n\nWhen you begin to speak things they you speak them into existence when you say\nWe shouldn't round people up the more people that say we should round people up we should disturb them in their own homes we should we should picket and surround their houses the more that you say that the more reality is created in that direction\n\nBe very careful on what you say and what you think the answer to these questions in America must remain nothing\nI Will not do anything to my neighbor who disagrees to me with me I Will not do anything and everything to hold on to power\n\nI Will state my case and I will Duke it out on the battlefield of ideas I Will not silence other people I Will not smear or destroy other people I Will not be calm everything I despise\nI'm Seventeen thinking my God this is going to be great and I walk out with all the\nThe goal armies stuff in my arms in the book covers and still in high school to time\nAnd he said and as I'm walking out the marine corps recorded their arms folded ... says hey son can I talk to you that you're going side he goes an army guy he promised you a lot didn't he I said yes I Am going to be a general and like one of the world's going to be amazing be beautiful women and get a doctorate degree in three days can be awesome\nAnd he says yeah we call that the solar plan everything under the sun he goes you know what am I promise you I said what he said for ... years are you ready I said yes and I signed up when I look back at that and then I didn't know what I was doing what I'm saying I was just reacting\nBut when I look back at that I Know I was desperately seek seeking positive male role models I didn't have\nAnd wrinkle gave me many of them and that was a a great thing and that Marine Corps the military is not everybody and not much to join but for me it really helped me tremendously and I said all the time without the marine corps I would've been a punk because I was lost at Seventeen completely lost in the marine corps helped me tremendously\nAnd when I got out of the marine corps about seven years later [noise] um my mom had really gone into a very bad place\nUm she couldn't handle me leaving she couldn't handle my father's death and she was addicted first illegal drugs eventually illegal drugs and she was a victim of the drug war and she was a convicted felon\nSo I pulled her out of prison and I used my whatever things I had to try to get her back up and running a reading her an apartment in the house that I mean I'm I'm a car that kind of thing\nAnd she struggled and if you if you've had a felon in your life and you know hard it can be right they have that on their record and then they feel less then and then when they get a job there hostage to that job because they're afraid to do the job for them\nAnd it's just bad bad bad so I said you know what I'm gonna do something I've been taken actually my whole life and take action now too and we decided to start our own business I figured if we're in charge him with a ball says you can't fire her says so we started on this became trucker so became we had a small trucking company\nWho what did you know about but what did you know about business nothing as a matter God Bless America in NATO was with what I have a choice I allow my mother to be hostage or I Do something I was my option go to business school was that what I was going to do a low right and that's what\nDo often I don't I never I never have and never will ever measure any plan I have against perfection\nBecause perfection doesn't work I measure my plan against status quo because that has caused what I have status quo was my mother as a hostage I don't accept status quo so business is well I my my um it did well I actually left it let ... let her and my step dad run it\nAnd she ran into is retired and when she retired she did with too many New Yorkers do and that is leaving New York state and she went to South Carolina to retire\nUm so she did that in ... and she was fine until she passed away several\nShe retired she did with too many New Yorkers do and that is leave New York state and she went to South Carolina retired I'm so she did that in ... and she was fine until she passed away several years ago\nBut after that that's when I went off to do my own thing I had made it for jobs and then decided you know what the first visible successful let me to another one so I started my second business and\nThat's when I actually uh that when I did not do well and that's why I say we're not that's when I first heard you back when you want your Philly station I'm In ... in the morning show get outta here yes that's when I first heard you doing your ah your jokes um about\nStand [laughter] I remember I remember I was I was I was driving around and and I was actually listen to you I think you can I Am the ya ya I think so yeah I Am\nYes you when you get morning show I remember listening to back then and um then I did that and I sold that business off and not do as well as I wanted to be do but I always call that my MBA that failure was my MBA so I'm from that I didn't have one more job and then so at this job now that this is now that I have which I'm a trainer consultant teacher\nSo I have large clients like a ... an essay laughter and smaller clients like small law firms I teach um leadership my executive coach at each business I've been an executive in a public company twice as a a band aid\nAnd I've talked to many colleges that Bruce St John J. and I've taught as a guest instructor at the graduate level about Yale and Colombia\nAnd now the about what have you done with your life seriously I Want to be a I'm a loser I'm Sorry yeah holy [laughter] yes so do you are a guy that to me seems tailor made for the times that we live in I I mean I think we're uncle bomber\nBut was also in in some ways tailor made for the times that we live in and I don't think he lived up to his potential\nUm the the more division happened um we we need somebody that can speak to all sides with a with credibility somebody who can speak to prison reform with credibility and not an axe to grind but common sense and experience\nI mean this is the thing that I talk about all the time you know I've dealt with and seen the prison system from both\nYou know both sides my father's rushes off from my mother as as a felon and I say the same thing as I say in business and that is when you want to fix something you don't walk in and start dictating when you do that you get rebellion when you do that people say no\nThe issue that we have particularly in New York state but throughout the country is we have to start a two sided thinking right as you said before a binary I either every corrections officers that dog and every single prisoner is a victim or every prisoner is evil and she'd be killed in every corrections officer is perfect\nAnd neither is true the reality of it is to fix this is the situation in prison\nWe have to have the corrections officers as part of the solution\nAnd that's hard for people to understand because they think they are part of system yes but they see people every day what I Know for sure in prison right now we have people in jail who should probably never get out ever what bad people she never got out and there are people who made a mistake should pay that at the society\nAnd she didn't get a second chance and people probably shouldn't be in jail at all the issue is I don't know which one is which I never will but you know who does corrections officers who deal with them every day those are the people who deal with the inmates everyday\nHow do I know that could be true you look at Massachusetts right now they have the Humvee program which is a program that has CEOs corrections officers and volunteers from outside together with a specific community in this case the communities veterans\nBut you can pick any community a community that the seals knowing they see in prison everyday you make that happen over someone happens you know if people who've had that problem coming as volunteers note your tax money you also have corrections officers who know how to control people know what\nNo those who will be scanning and well now the those who are scanning and we'll put the people who need to have the rights the right the second chat out there in his program\nHow do we know that there is it isn't right in Massachusetts in general is about Seventy five percent when this program less than five percent holy do yes no\nNo specialized people coming in corrections officer and do it here's the problem in New York say specifically for corrections officers ... the the ... the life expectancy is fifty eight years that ... years old\nNot just that every corrections officer I've met either know someone who's committed suicide and or a knows someone who is so ready to leave they become completely apathetic to assist them this is a problem all the time the same thing Larry you know I'm\nI'm already there that therapists I'm already there that marriage Calif I'm already they're legal assistant already helped them out with all kinds of things I'm already trying to help them there are so many CEOs who would happily ship into this world without having to change any of that ad anybody giving them an actual contract out at a contract and three years in the upstate that's how bad it is\nSo we could actually fix things this is a parable\nIf we actually used both sides and go in and asked the people who are there how to fix it that's how you are in the business that's how you fix it in life\nDelivery do you have time can I hold you for a while ... okay ah I Want to take a break 'cause I I Want to talk to you about the economy I Want to talk to you about business sure and you know the direction of California where they've they've just a mandated that you know women now have to be on the board of directors\nA ... we're going to completely bizarre ah the direction and I would love to hear how you think you could make New York or a a more of a sane place\nLarry sharp he's running for governor or as the libertarian\nA and I'm I'm telling you if you were looking for a candidate in the New York you could play the same game where you can try something different I Want you to listen to Larry sharp if you're in New York oh All right we'll be back with\nHim and just a second first let me tell you about car shields partial\nOr shield is a a shield really none are on your car as much as your wallet that's what I think it shields\nWhen you bring your car in for repair and your car has I don't know five thousand two hundred and fifty thousand miles and your\nYour warranty has expired\nEurope for everything now and you have to replace a sensor and it could be Fifteen hundred bucks let alone replay or you know replacing your engine or something you know something massive five six thousand dollars I had some things that went wrong with we one of my old trucks up at
