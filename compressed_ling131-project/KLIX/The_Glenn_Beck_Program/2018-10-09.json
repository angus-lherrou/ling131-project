freedom\nYou know absolutely and you know when when you you know intellectual expiration when when curiosity I'm\nGoing against the green in any way when that when that becomes punishable um view I\nThink I think they really risk a driving good people I'm Down some some unsavory roads and there there is no good and that brings it in the tradition and oh yeah absolutely absolutely ...\nThank you so much for reading the book and I'm going to send you they assign to copy but thank you for reading in calling in I'm Daryl in Kentucky you're on the Glenn Beck program Hi Darryl Glenn how's it going I'm good how are you\nDoing great I just wanted to say that I really love the book and I think that my my favorite part of it is that even though we can't you can't surrender like you said several times we have to remain\nCivil because maybe I'm not even thinking this but I think that eventually the blast will realize they have gone too far they will step back from the ledge and if for civil if where they're standing strong in our principles will be able to bring them back in the fall and I'm\nBringing the country back together but if we get in who do the same thing we're doing we're just health care of the country apart\nYou were on the left as well at one point\nI was a I was raised in southern West Virginia um my family were very deep blue Democrats and um we believe that Republicans were just people who took money away from the poor to give it to the rich and um you know I\nI was pretty progressive guy in college and um I didn't really start looking at the other side until\nAfter twenty fourteen uh I went to war um I was a soldier in the military a spin off two thousand fold in Afghanistan are leading some of the best men and women I've ever met in my life\nWhen I came back to my country was completely different I couldn't figure out what happens\nMy I was no longer welcomed the less as a straight white male veteran so I had to figure out\nWhat happened and I started looking at people that I had mocked including yourself in the past and are\nActually started reading our Roy Williams and Mike or various patio and which you noted in the ... and uh that really you know maybe I'm buying into their theory a little bit too much but I've I've seen firsthand and uh I I Do believe that you have another five years\nIt's better but I still believe Adonis Kelly\nSaid why it's whether or not um [noise] we can uh pull enough people away from the cliff before but I think ... years twenty twenty five where it starts to come back the other direction\nUm that's right so how can we help people like you because I\nI I I think we need to start defining um Democrats when we say the Democrats I think we need to start saying the people in the leadership of the party um because I don't think you like you there are Democrats who are good love the country and are finding themselves going wait a minute I don't have any place to go\nAnd uh and we have to in and I'm not saying it's in the Republican Party I'm I'm just saying people need to start being more welcoming to people who are finding themselves on the outs\nWhat should we be aware of that you went through\n[noise] I think you should be aware that even though the policy and is is an area that we may never agree on that principle is something that we can agree on that\nThings like individual freedom\nThings like um you know ... or having a government that and control you from you know several hundred miles away they can control every little aspect of your life\nOr something I talk to my wife and my niece about all the time is that you know before before President Obama even though I voted for the guy and I kinda liked what he was selling\nUm the president's name didn't get mentioned at the dinner table every single night at my home when I was growing up\nThe the power that we have given to Washington over the past ten Twenty years it's too much\nAnd I'm not really sure what the end state what the solution for that is but I think yes talking about the things you talked about in the book the principals are that make us all United are or you know the bill of rights the things that they make us all Americans are are what we can unify behind\nSo the the section of because I I mean I've really struggled with what it is that brought us together and it's really or can bring us back together and it's really so simple when you finally get down to it it is the bill of rights don't you think\nI agree um I think that as you will never find in any other country that I've and I've been in several Africa Jeremy Afghanistan um Romania\nYou'll never find a country that that speech itself up over its past as much as America does we we realize that we've done some horrible things like you said and you read in your monologue but we've also you know I think it's something that genetics to sue the said\nBy recognizing our falls by admitting that you are false you have to kind of in a way to America's moral superiority because we realize that we made mistakes and we're trying to fix them\n\nDarryl thank you so much for your phone call appreciate it God Bless\nBrought up a great point about how before Obama the president's name didn't come up every day at the dinner table\nObviously that's getting even worse now with Trump I mean people are obsessed\nAbout talking about of all the time the store today and actually it was about how\nThey are the networks have recognized this and there are they're doubling down or they've enjoyed high ratings engagement from Trump coverage and\nFor the networks at a relatively low cost now that our president has been set around these high returns it's unlikely news outlets will cut back meeting the barrage of unlivable content being created an absorbed during the Trump presidency will likely outlive this administration\nI mean like Trump as a celebrity well although Eric and he's like a polarizing guy and people love and hate him but they want to cheat they want this to be the norm they want you to be obsessed with this all the time at the expense that the rest of your life it is and it took ... regime it is the norm\nYou have to know what there are fewer or the leader is saying and doing and wants you to do it is the norm ... anything that normal lives as as any intention of saying you know what that's good for America is mistaken it's wrong\nAnd this is you know this is a it's driven I think at this point by clicks and viewers and you know it's it's one of those things that just because it's going to continue it can be hard to reverse that addiction is well\nThey you know when when they can get you know the Rachel Maddow audience or is addicted to outrage maybe more than any other right their ratings have gone through the roof because of it and you think MSNBC is return you know he's going to reverse that path now no they're not going to say oh well you know what maybe we went to I don't know I mean I'd like to be optimistic about it but I don't see it happening\nAll right I'm going to take a quick break back to your phone calls a day seven to seven V.

depression when you have that how do you stop civil unrest how do you give people meaning and how do you um uh give people enough money to be able to live and and further their life\nIt's fraught with problems and even universal basic income I think misses the fundamental point that\nPeople don't want to live without a purpose and too many people get their purpose from their job\nEspecially men we can't just look at the money problem and you can't just give people stuff if you give people stuff they value it less\nAnd most importantly on this\nWhen you have a universal basic income and Seventy
