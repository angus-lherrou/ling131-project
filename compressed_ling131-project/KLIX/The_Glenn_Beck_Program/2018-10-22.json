though I don't yeah I ...\nYeah so that there is something that's clearly something's wrong with it [laughter] the one thing you're going to want to do and are usually not too big a deal is to refresh the phone to bring it back to the factory a state\nYou know like it like when it just came from the factory it's about the only thing you can do to be honest with you OK yeah if you were at home I Would say before you do that back it up and then\nRefresh it and then re store and you can actually do that through I tunes directly you can a race and restored I\nTried my I kept waiting time but I Would call it that wasn't a big hill and for travelling have cars that you buy that my options\nIt's not an ideal thing if you are I Would wait and well cause is not working so doesn't really matter but uh nowadays I back up to the iCloud instead of directly to computer for a long time it's been my recommendation is Bruce backup and restore\nUsing hardwired to a computer but uh they've gotten pretty quick on the cloud restore so if you've been backing up to iCloud and you're somewhere where you have fast\nWhy I Know probably not right now but at some point um then you could probably do that\nFairly quickly but the key is you go in you know you're going to settings you're gonna need your iCloud password you go into settings and you're just a race it you know\nBring it back to factory uh specs that may or may not fix it if there's nothing wrong with the hardware it's not going to fix it but it would be something that the apple store would ask you to do or they would do any way that before they fix that they're going to say well maybe it's just the you know 'cause it's a computer and it's got a ... it's got storage in the operating\nSystem sits on the flash drive just like everything else does and if it gets corrupted somehow then that could be causing this\nSo you know you you know you just go to the general settings and you could call the way down where says reset and you're gonna say race all content settings and that's going to centrally bring it back the way it was when he got at home [noise]\nOkay yeah and I can do that and I might be able to do that on that trip also because I knew back it up as a a\nGood have you back up to the cloud it'll be fairly straightforward just that on cellular it's going to either won't do it because it says well I'm not gonna you know kill your cell bill or it'll be very very slow ... will do it\nWhat what would be that can't that idea has medic now to turn my back in my car that would be that ... that the ... or ... you know\n... that's the good news is a magnet stone harm smartphones okay [noise] so uh it's\nYou know it's look it's a computer and er they make lots of them and ... percentage of them are going to have problems unfortunately it's at a warrant to you if you bought it right away when it first came out\nI did and that's why I thought it might need it to any else because I didn't hear it and that's not how ...\nDon't plan it that way [laughter] sometimes it feels like that that the day after the warranty whereas out things break but I don't think apple especially I don't think they planted that way and uh it should it should last several years at least it but it could just let's hope it's just something went wrong it can happen\nThey planted that way and uh it should it should last several years at least it it but it could just let's hope\nIt's just something went wrong it can happen to any computer the operating system one of the key files could be damaged and that's why it's rebooting ... periodically we're freezing periodically and when you were race it and start over you're going to start off it I truthfully the best way to do that he's with the computer at home\nBecause it will read download the software the from where for it you won't be able to do in the car but when you get home before you throw the phone out\nOr throw it out and apple guy ... ... ... do the full restore using I tunes and they will actually download replacement from where which is good and that that's the best\nIn show that any ... all the multiple heart rate that are probably any issue it's\nJust no it doesn't hurt no it doesn't hurt yeah or if you know it could be adapt its bad uh that's one of the reasons the reset might work because you don't ... don't reinstalled all the apps just a slap says you need him because maybe there's some yeah\nI mean you name it I think anything on Amazon Music lays and that he kept\nTrack of that I use those all the time yeah should cause a problem yeah those are\nActually somebody saying that I forgot to say I felt ten was delayed the announced it in September but didn't come out till right about now so you may just be under warranty\nWell I got it and I remember I bought it for my for myself through my birthday so that way or that show her yeah\nAnd and that was four\nWheel [laughter] just write like a day after you got it uh yeah I think you're going to happen when there next time you're in an apple store having check and see if it's on an warranty and and really honestly they should swamp it they should if it's under warranty they should just give you a new one no questions asked OK\nOkay well they can add another star charts as to\nHow are you on a road trip where I get\nReal quick can trap where they're going to hit the adolescent

Washington happens to like about a a Saudi Arabia and that is the Muslim Brotherhood perspective\nSo you remember the Muslim Brotherhood founded in the Nineteen twenties in Egypt the only reason for being was to reject the west and established global surreal law\nThey exported this organization all over the middle east anti Semitism towards a Jews their biggest and most effective tool\nAt harnessing the Arab rage\nMuslim Brotherhood they're the ones who invented modern day jihadism\nThey are the ones who inspired Osama bin Laden and the other founding members of al ... to do any

constitution jihad are planned and death for the sake of all of the law for the U.S of our wishes they are not primarily a secular organization the Muslim Brotherhood of the calls jihad\nThe industry of death and they mean that in a good way\nIn their own words to a nation that protects the industry of death and which knows how to die you know believe God gives proud life in this world okay that doesn't sound secular doesn't sound like somebody we should be in bed with but the Muslim Brotherhood ran up against a problem\nAnd that was one of them the kingdom of of Saudi Arabia because it was backed\nBy the west any of these kingdoms in the middle East that have been backed by the west Jordan will be next anybody who stands in their way they had to destroy but these were democracies so how are we going to do it\nWell the Muslim Brotherhood decided to switch tactics and weaponize democracy enter the Arab Spring\nThe Arab Spring praise by everyone we told you their goal is a caliphate well it never materialized did\nNo no not there it materialized from the chain of events with ISIS what you were talking about the Muslim Brotherhood right and what happened to the Muslim Brotherhood\nDid they just choose not to do a caliphate oh no no they were overthrown\nOh\nThe Muslim Brotherhood still wants their caliphate so now you have two of our allies turkey Muslim

a\nMember of the Muslim Brotherhood and they were at odds with the hobbyists\n... was cast aside\nAnd that's when the western media fell in love with him an active\nMember of the Muslim Brotherhood not us smear or conspiracy theory in his own words yes I joined the Muslim Brotherhood organization and I was not alone\nAnd quote\nHis Muslim Brotherhood friends in clerics were all in prison in Saudi Arabia during the Arab Spring he got out he came to the U.S he established a political party while in exile called democracy for the Arab world now party\nThe liberals the progressives the press loved him because they heard the word democracy it's the Muslim Brotherhood plan to subvert democracy\nLike turning it against itself he wants\nWanted to establish sharia law in the region\n\nHe was also a wicked anti Semite who wrote quote outside the context of history and logic the Jews will have to die by force\nOh\nIsrael's outside the context of history and logic so we're going to have to kill all of them this is not a smear campaign when you hear somebody say that you make sure you asked them where are you doing your homework where are you getting that why is that a smear campaign to\nSay that he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood he clearly was in his own words so why is that a smear campaign because I thought the Muslim Brotherhood was largely secular\nAsked people how much do you know about the caliphate how much do you know about the founding of the Muslim Brotherhood how much do you really know about what this man wrote\nThat he ... it was a mistake to think\nThat you could have any kind of state in the middle east with out some form of Islam assists\n\nNow that's different remember then Islam and Islam assist believes you have to use sharia law that the constant wow it sounds like the mother Muslim Brotherhood that's our constitution\nThat is our law sugary a law\nSo\nLet's just begin to tell each other the truth and here's the truth turkey is not a friend of ours\nTurkey is in with the Muslim Brotherhood turkey would like to have a caliphate run by them\nSaudi Arabia not good people Saudi Arabia huge exporter of ... and has done it here

head toward a world\nWhere people are going to get disrupted out of their jobs at aged forty and forty five and fifty and fifty five forever more we've never ever done that in human history and so it means all of the banks\nOf what's often called now the quarter life crisis the sort of late adolescence crisis of trying to figure out your your role in life and how do you go from just being a consumer and mom and dad's house to be in a producer that cannot just put bread on the table for your kids but can\nActually have a sense of meaning that you're serving your neighbor that disruption\nThat most people know in late adolescence or do they experience that again every three to five years for our\nWhole life and that means there's a lot of new potential for upheaval and frankly for unhappiness there's going to be more economic output\nThan it's ever been produced before in human history but it's not at all clear that it will redound to the median family in the median household and the media and worker or going to have to become a civilization of lifelong workers able to get retrained when you're forty nobody's ever done that before\n[laughter] okay so there's about an hour of questions or just on on that one uh but I've got about three minutes left can you give me\nA ... your take on the first real political upheaval that we're going to see that I think by twenty twenty needs could change everything could start global wars deep fakes\nYeah so one of the reasons I wrote them is because I spent a lot of time on intelligence issues and I'm In the intel community there are people who talk about the perfect storm of deep fakes that we have gone back and the storm is these three ingredients number one new technology makes it possible\nTo sort of narrow cast a world with fake audio and fake video where lots of people can be susceptible to being sort of um a\nSpoof or persuaded the things that aren't real are real\nThere's always been enemies doing malicious actor you know information warfare since the beginning of time you can find it in proverbs and ...\nThere's always been enemies doing malicious actor Theo information warfare since the beginning of time you can find it in proverbs in college he asked these uh to sow discord in an enemies tent but it used to require a prostitute non each trap it affect business partner in a bribery scheme and more\n... you had to get people around people number one is now we can use technology to surround someone and give them a fake experience and ... are fake audio and fake video that are going to seem real to make that possible number to Russia is already trying this constantly against us they're just bad\nAt it the real reason we need to take the Russia type investigation so seriously as because China's right behind them\nRunning scout team off since I'm On them and ready to do\nBig the fakes a hybrid war information operations against American leaders and business officials and the public at large and number three we have so many internal divisions about geography about race about um gender about guns there are many many issues where Americans are so divided\nThat we are susceptible to these kind of campaigns like Russia is already trying to run on social media they're just not very good at it where they try to exacerbate and inflame tensions on every side of every issue the NFL dealing controversy majority of the stuff on line on social media in the first Seventy two hours after that flamed\nLast fall the majority of it on both sides stand for the anthem and taking the NFL most of it was Russian on both sides and so we're going to have a world\nWhere you're going to have things like the cabinet hearings where all of a sudden the audio will appear\nOf Schumer strategizing with Michael ... or video will appear it'll be fake but video well up here and it will be Kavanaugh party and hard as an undergrad at Yale it'll be fake\nBut in our echoed silo chambers of the way we consume media right now it's going to be a potentially much more divisive than what we know today and so one of the reasons I wanted to write them a why we hate each other is an awareness\nThat there is actually national security exposures for this country and how much we hate each other around politics we need communities of people\nThat live in the same neighborhood that believe lots of stuff in common even when we differ on politics\n[noise]\nHow come we can't get anybody in Washington or in the media to talk about this than\n[noise] ah it took us what twenty five minutes to unpack some of it and the business model of selling soap three minutes from now is let's just say who the bad guy is you know there's there's some nut job somewhere in a McDonald's right now who probably slap to an old man wearing a mock a hat and or\nThat person is a weirdo and did something wrong but they don't actually stand in for all the bait and that's really the way we're consuming most of our media right now is that kind of not\nPecking and so it's harder to do ten and twenty five year out issues but that's the that's the strategic stuff that Washington should be focused on\nHow are you going to do that when you have about thirty to thirty seconds I'm not getting even ask you I'm not even ask you I Would like to ask you to come down a Ben and and really unpack this because I think your voice needs to be heard and understood and I think in soundbites\nUm it's not a not always understood I'm so thank you very much\nFor them that good to be with the climate\nSenator Ben Sasse um why we hate each other and how to heal I really wanted that you really want to get into him on taking on your own\nSocialism not ten not Canadian socialism socialism communism she's talking about state run and owned property in businesses now that's that's not a welfare state oh you're a conspiracy theorist weight she just said it at one point\n[laughter] oh I mean first of all the you know the press is a collection of individuals some of what you do a good job some of which do not ah so it's important to make those decisions I think um and you know look at that as they this was just this is going on at our founding\nYou know people were doing it at our founding and I know and and it at our founding but we've what we we\nRealize is when we were in a gauge and informed populace which shows correctly right I mean I you know if we're not well we know what the ... we know a Republican you can keep it right and if we if we don't choose to keep the republic well then of course it's kind of fall apart we knew this was an experiment and that was the risk of it\nAnd I think we are seeing some some of those risks pop their heads up but I mean the whole foundation of this country is to let people uh come out and make their arguments\nAnd we have to make our back that does not mean I'm In a minute diplomacy thing and I was so encouraged I Hope you are too so encouraged by the ... ... a reaction from conservatives\nShe Nancy Pelosi shouted down a and I did not see a peep of support from conservatives over the actions of the people protesting hurting I didn't see I was disgusted by I was disgusted by it as well and I didn't see any I didn't now I'm not saying\nThere were none I'm sure people will show me a tweet of some you know not job it was like I think they should harass Nancy Pelosi had dinner but I didn't see one prominent Republican or conservative support those actions not one you could see if we can we played dozens\nOf Democrat and you know here's here's here's one from Shawn\nYou just say it again I'm grateful for ... it's weird that it's politically incorrect for me to say so but I'm Glad we have people in this country who stand up to a fascist and a bigotry and are willing to confront ape\nFace to face right and then you can there's nothing on the left there even prominent politicians yeah I I have not seen one prominent conservative support what happened to policy and that's right and I'm Glad\nThey mean that that shows that there's still you know even though we're divided and even though a lot of things come down to ... minute emotional politics that go minute to minute I'm Glad to see that there's still principles there so here's where\nI think than was wrong when he said to deal with them so far um he was right when he said you know it's a small group says fulcrum she's right it is a very small group and they become very very loud because of social media and because of the media but it is a small group\nWhere I think he's wrong is ignore it\nIs a part of the solution is ignoring yeah and I think you know because you can't get to the point where like I Would say the same would apply to the alt right right you know as a Charlottesville situation\nUm you know\nThere's obviously a crime committed there that you can't ignore right um but generally speaking when we're a bunch of Nazis or KKK members must have been having forever the stars and come back forever but you take a K. members walked through your town like ... you know largely speaking it's great to ignore them\nBecause they want attention and they weren't they but that's not what we have now we have to a breaking laws you can't ignore the night came you know you can't ignore that I don't I don't care if it's the Nazis or ...\nYou can't ignore that I don't think fast with argued nor the write me I mean like I think he's saying that we get a little bit too wrapped up in the back and forth of viral videos and people who are not even really engaged in politics for getting freaked\nOut over things that they're never going to have to necessarily deal with a few ... a group like adds a photo though that's how they grow a and or at least arguably that's how they grow up there on oppose you're seeing it happen in Portland right in the mayor is largely just ignoring what they're doing\nAnd it's getting worse and worse and worse and worse that does not mean our lives have to be ruled by NFL though and I think that was the generalize argument he was going for\nWell the the the key here is what do you do about it and\nThe solution is to not do what people did in Florida would than see below sea you don't do that because that doesn't give you a side to run to yeah\nYou don't do what the Proud Boys are doing I'm Sorry but it's so I just when you talk to gabbing about that and yeah and I think Gavin is even you know looking at things going again you know look we were\nWe were doing things because you know it's funny a\nMedia yeah he's a comedian um but you know this this will grow out of control you just don't do that 'cause there's nowhere to go when you're watching that you're like well I don't like\nWell Nancy Pelosi is doing but I Do I was there doing so who do I go to and look at look how the press is treating Donald Trump\nLook how the press treated Kavanaugh everybody kind of hard and their positions didn't they everybody just hardened their positions\nAnd got more outraged the only the only thing that might have happened is independence looked at that and said\nKnow what I don't want to be with those people left the left and I don't want to be with the I don't want to be with the left and then looked over to the Republicans\nLeft the left\nAnd I don't want to be with the I don't want to be with the left and then looked over to the Republicans they weren't misbehaving during that\nBut\nWhat are we doing to welcome people in if you are kind of saying I don't want to be with those guys and then you see [noise] you know you ... get out get out there pounding on ... and like okay I Know\nWe can't\nWe can't get to a place to where people disengage because if they do completely disengaged then it's just run the country is run by radicals we need to be a safe haven we need to be a place of real thought\nReal actual kind is um and real principals\nAnd we have to present a rational logical alternative I mean that that is one of the reasons I'm a conservative Frank I saw the left\nYou know early in my life as a group of people who made decisions emotionally yeah and that's not something I Want to be part of snow and we can't be a part of that we can do that ourselves let me go to Andrew in Florida hello Andrew you're on the Glenn Beck program\nGoing good morning first time caller longtime listener I out during the day very good\nAll right yeah you know I I just wanted to let you know I mean I'm here from Florida of an independent uh most of my adult life and I'm exactly what you guys just that the\nVitriol on both sides it's so ridiculous I think a lot of independence just stay out of it because it's so immature and it makes every one of those type of fat because they just can't talk to each other anymore it's just at far God now that being said\nEvery one that I Know it's an independent and the state of horror will be showing up for the conservatives\nNovember\nReally are and I and why are you\nA simple reason you've got people in office it off just right now out there that are fighting for lower taxes I might I'm bringing home over three thousand more dollars this year than I did last year which is a huge\nDeal for me I've got two little girls and I've got one more finally I got my first son\nComing in a [laughter] uh yeah I mean yeah and\n... there's there's things like that are going on and on and I'm a conservative Christian showed up at you when you're when you're talking about what these people represent and how they forced themselves into a restaurant that can hurt people when they're eating with their family\nOr most dependent and that's exactly the way I Do they just so disgusted with some of the rhetoric on both sides\nWe just ignore it and we've always been independent thinkers or we're going to stay that way we also know what's wrong is wrong and what's brightest right as far as ... concerned I think a lot of people are underestimating that\nWell Andrew I'm the EU if what you say is true ah than people or the ... the then the Republicans will keep the house most likely\nA because it is so close at levels we've never seen of interest in participation in the mid term election ever\nA and it's it's within the margin of error between the two that if the independents come out and they are that they could be the ones that make all the difference on which direction we go next so much Andrew ...\nSo filled your mind is our sponsor and I I brought this in a\nLast week because do and I've been joking about when's the last time you changed your filter\nAnd a news was about Nineteen Seventy\nLast week because I'd been joking about when's the last time you changed your filter and a ... years was
