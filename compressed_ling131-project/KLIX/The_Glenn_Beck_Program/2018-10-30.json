tangible\nHere is Joe Lieberman on a very frustrating interview with CNN listen to this\nWorld so shocking moment I mean I'd I'd we view it all through our own experience I I haven't had a life as a Jewish American which has been is not only free of anti Semitism\nBut I've had the opportunity to be elected senator from a state Connecticut where the Jewish population is about to present and then Al Gore gives me the chance to run for vice president first Jewish American on a national ticket\nA that really didn't know I face no anti Semitism a and forgive me for going back to the end of the two thousand election\nWe actually got five hundred thousand more votes than the other ticket ... which was a reflection in numbers that people weren't voting are based on religion so\nWhen something like this happens it's shocking and it changes that reality but I Believe the reality is that the American people are very fair minded not bigger than you saw it in the wholesome reaction\nOf the neighbors who are not Jewish ...

I mean without saying what does it in the nicest Joe Lieberman possible way right but what are you saying is what you're doing right now by trying to make this into a situation where it's Trump is blamed\nWhat we should do is wrong what we should do instead is when he says something that we think helps the environment we should praise it sure certainly generally speaking we have an issue with our discourse I think I think almost everybody would agree with that um but when it comes to the shooting it's not related\nRight so here's what the media should have done this weekend the media should have said okay so what role does rhetoric on social media and from the president and from the press and everything else what role does media play in\nIn in the life of a guy who as we saw\nThis non white male um ... tried to commit with a with a pipe bombs the guy was nuts the guy was absolutely nuts he was a loner she had\nFinally found the cause that he could you know rallied behind she Reno was\nNot he was nuts okay so that one what role does politics\nPlay does the media play do politicians play in whining people up\nThat's a viable adds a question on that particular topic and not just about Trump up the whole thing ... ... what role does the media play what about Twitter what about Facebook what's winding some of these people up what happens in the future\nOkay valid the shooting in Pittsburgh here's how they should have covered this this guy was a anti Semite\nWho this clearly had nothing to do with politics the guy hated Donald Trump\nThis is\nJust a loner just like the guy in the van and he had no friends\nHe had no friends he was a sick twisted guy\nIs the whole in America why are we seeing this now because it it's not Donald Trump and it's not for Rocco bomber ... not the right there's something fundamentally missing here what is it why are we changing wire a kiss\nIt's not the right there's something fundamentally missing here what is it why are we changing why are kids killing themselves\nAt a record rate there is a bigger issue here than politics but nobody in the media wants to address it because nobody in the media and nobody in politics can win\n[noise]\nBy the way we're doing a episode tonight on what happened in Brazil the candidate in Brazil and why does that matter [noise] why does that matter\nIt's a really important a monologue or that you don't want to\nMiss and that is on tonight's a [noise] a TV show the blaze\nAt five PM [noise]\nAlright sponsor this half hour is life lock cyber security cyber security\n[laughter]\nYou really think that you're for safe I mean with anything I mean a mind I mean no no way no way forward after\nHe says here and you will reveal is a great time to discuss the gallery in their box you know you want to make sure that you're off on the conversation and then you know you're making your case to take the management team prior to that conversation and taking place ... saving money I'm living now Fox News [noise]\nMilitary matters Google\nWorking with us dabble in the past find your program which aims to ease the transition from military to civilian life\nIf you touch jobs for veterans on Google you'll be able to enter a military occupation cold right at the top\nThat four digit code well then immediately find jobs which will directly linked the skill set up service members to employers and send over their resumes Google was also donating to point five million dollars to the u._s. do to jumpstart the pathfinder\nProgram for veterans small business owners Google says their search tool will alert customers to the vets who are running small businesses\nFrom many customers knowing a veteran is leading a business and to trust will tell you you're dealing with someone who worked hard embodies the value of it and cares deeply\nUs that was also offering free tuition for an IT certification for US military members or their spouses so they can be hired remotely and work while being\nBound for military base from James chamber of a sudden\nNews and talk on the radio dishes radio for change when you go\nDuring the dead Pennsylvania's governor in Pittsburgh mayor did not joined the president today we\nCan all thanks to house Speaker Paul Ryan pushing back against President Trump's suggestion that he would end birthright citizenship for children of parents in the U.S illegally with an executive order that would\nInvolve a very very to link the constitutional process but where we obviously totally agree with the president is getting at the root issue here which is on track to illegal immigration\nRyan speaking to W.

Glenn Beck dot com slash tour we'll be talking a lot about the uh the upcoming election\nUh and I'm man's do has some news for us but he tells me it's not really good news\nYeah and I would say if anything is that the road is a little bit more up hill than it was a week ago um you know it was interesting someone made us a election analysts made this point in it it's an interesting one probably the most\nTrolls he's been no crazy tweets none of it he didn't play any of those games likely weeks to the election and that's when he closed the entire gap\nWas down by eight in the polls are so ah when after the the tape came out and closed it to a much tighter margin him on winning obviously\nYou know it's funny that seems to be going the other way with right now I mean like he's talking obviously about a lot about the they're talking about a potential uh executive order to hug and birthright citizenship he's talking about um he's been more aggressive right and that that may be good and may not be good we're going to see ...\nI don't think it is I think you know look you've already made your mind up with Donald Trump\nAnd then there there's a point to where he like I don't want any more information I don't want any new information or I Know what I mean I'm I'm\nI'm happy with the way things are going\nBut I'm not thrilled [noise] can I can you just help me as a citizen just feel like everything is normal you know what I mean ... and he reminds people at a normal and right before an election that's not necessarily what you need\nSo that makes sense ah yeah\nI think that's probably true because he made his strong stand with Kavanaugh he made that strong stand we know where he stands on the border mhm there's no reason to to continue to dog pile and and quite honestly I I Wish he would stop the\nPresses our enemy I understand what he means and I'm going to be doing some stuff on the press today a that is a a I mean it ... out of control but that enemy the you know there is the enemy of the people it's just bad phrase allergy yeah makes me feel uncomfortable I think\nThat we have to also back up and say that this is not just the just the Trump election right offices election for individuals in individual districts and there's a lot of storylines particularly in the Senate were you know there's a lot of storylines Becca decided\nI think the issue a overall however uh there's a the momentum the is not in favor of of Republicans right now particularly in the house and you're seeing\nMore movement a as dangerous to the Democratic side right now but I mean they know who knows I mean this doesn't mean that that's the way it's going to turn out um it's just it's not you'd hoped to be having a nice run right now where you're going to the famous like for example the lead up to the presidential election was a positive run\nFor Trump and Democrats or Republicans remember they you know among before but I'm an eight or nine points they close that gap all

little late yesterday as well or on CNN or ... G. Q. columnist or talking about Trump radicalizing what's the most\nAnd this past that at one of the things that he really launched his presidential run on is talking about Islamic rattle radicalization and this president has radicalized so many more people than I ever did I mean the way he taught the way the\nWay he had is that just it it is hot the way the way that we asked allows them to the white ...\nEither way he says I Know I'm not supposed to say it but I'm a national asked quitting his task kind of says fine okay I condemned as but then you know\nAnd I think that we all see pushback\nOn that you remember that it was found by blizzard for her to say the president's aides as radical as more people that ISIS is irresponsible\nStop do you notice feeling ... was not just saying that to hit to to her the guest was saying it to the host yeah for you not to push back on that is irresponsible he's not talking about her being respond yeah he's talking about CNN being irresponsible\nAnd one thing to notice in that clip she ... she says uh one of the things that the president ran it was a fighting Islamic extremism and now we know that she is radicalized more people die says there's a set applied to that so not only is it a catchy little thing that might get her in the news it's also there is a set applying to it\nAh to me obviously a plant wind\nObviously she meant to do on television and say just that she set it up out of ... didn't make any sense in in the context of the conversation she wanted to get to that line right and she's totally under control mhm she's dispassionate about it you know he's just having a conversation yes so here's her apology once you realize just how bad that was a few minutes later\nI think I've spoken to hit at the moment this has been a very emotional and personally she hands on the line from ... I think I exaggerate and I apologize for that but what the point I was trying ham fisted late to make is that there is not a coincidence that\nTo the ... the number of anti Semitic attacks has jumped by nearly sixty percent and the first year that Donald Trump with an office and it's no coincidence because\nEven though the main danger is homegrown right wing extremists as many studies have pointed out this administration has methodically shifted resources away from monitoring those people with higher control those people keep them from committing violence\nAnd all kinds of on a regular that's not enough to handle and not an apology\nFurther inflamed yeah what you were saying and there's no pushback from CNN no they don't care you know it's great for them they like it yeah ... because Lincoln leave that they do they believe\nIt it's it it they are ... I've I've never I've never been this connected disconnected from the media ever and we've been disconnected from the media long time you know this this is like they are broadcasting\nTo an alternative to a a reality ...

Pittsburgh\nAnd then Linda SARS sewer\n... you know tweets out we're turning our grief into action with Jewish Action to send a clear message that this anti Semitic Xena phobic attacks never happen again or you can lend us are sort of a fan\nThirty nine percent say yes and fifty five percent say no so people support their right to do it but don't agree with what they're doing exactly right now that is not the way the media is portraying dope\n'em and I think it's the way most conservatives feel right like yeah like if they can do it but it's not that I mean that's not the right I don't support what they're saying and what their what their actions are correct\nA support single payer healthcare fifty six percent say yes thirty seven percent say no and that if you're wondering why you're getting so many people jumping on that bandwagon at the polls like that that's why the Democrats are doing it\nDo you want Congress to check Trump fifty three percent say yes thirty eight percent say no also by the way the founders said yes to that one yeah and I said it to any president right I'd rationality land beyond heart of the role that shouldn't be the first one hundred percent\nUm do you support them lower investigation fifty two percent say yes forty two percent say no these are independent voters compare that with another poll yes is the Russia investigation a witch hunt forty nine percent say yes forty seven percent say no\nIt's interesting they support the investigation but they do believe it is politically motivated and with no real end to it this is this\nThis poll is the first time and you're not going to get this without 'cause who's publishing all of it or they'll just give you the highlights of they'll say oh well you know fifty two percent say the the more investigation yeah but they won't say forty nine percent also think\nThat it's a witch hunt so people are nuanced yeah they they think it's worth looking into um you know right either looking into it just to make sure but we don't think there's anything there\nWas this one surprises me elected more feminists forty nine percent say yes thirty three percent say no and uh that's similar to the women question that right I mean it's like a generalized question feminist I don't think people are really familiar with the ideology enough to know and it depends what kind of feminist you are right I mean Christine how summers love to see her\nYeah she's but she would you know but she's not the type a fan of feminist that's going out there today\nHas Trump committed crimes in office forty three percent say yes forty six percent say no just a political lines ... vote their abolish ice thirty percent of independents say yes\nSixty three percent say no getting let me preface with another one too I mean abolish ice is a complete fringe position right just to say bunkers left wing position yes um and he's the type of thing that even Cory Booker dodges questions about\nUh however pair that with the support\nIt's a bonkers left wing physician yes um and that type of thing that even Cory Booker dodges questions about\nUh however pair that with the support that thirty percent support there\nTo support of Trump's tariffs thirty three percent within the margin of error of abolish ice that's how popular that that idea is now I don't care if it's a hundred percent approval I Would still oppose it because I don't think it's a good idea but it is not even in a popular proposal it's not winning over any voters\n... it you know it is again the the worst policy of his presidency up in my belief Kavanaugh accusations this one is fascinating believes the cabin on accusations twenty six percent say the twenty five twenty eight I Believe ... percent say yes\nTwenty nine percent say no forty three percent say\nI don't know and I think that's where America was left I don't know I\nDon't know there certainly was enough proof of it right by any means that I I don't think I Would say no to that I Do not believe it but still uh I can understand how people who are jumping in and not following it every day might not\nHave to say if you had a gun to my head and said you have to pick one\nI I\nI wouldn't feel comfortable condemning a man or or condemning her I I wouldn't now with the additional information that we've had\nAfterwards you know where we've had a Ben fast food didn't know and said yeah then we saw the additional information and it's pretty bad her story completely falls apart you know then I'm okay but when you watch those two I wouldn't\nWant to decide I'm bothered by force fathered by hearing foreign language Seventy six percent no twenty percent said yes to immigrants commit more crimes Twenty one percent said yes Seventy three percent said no\nReduce immigration and build a wall sixty percent said no thirty five percent said yes now I Wonder what that would be on\nIncrease immigration but build a wall increase legal immigration\nExcept for the you know they they they like to put this reduce immigration well people don't necessarily want to reduce immigrant and they would reduce illegal immigration exactly right\nAs Trump drain the swamp thirty thirty nine percent said yes fifty six percent said no support Trump's tariffs thirty three no or sorry thirty three yes fifty five percent\nOr know twelve percent I I don't know reverse racism\nIs a bigger issue than racism with your questions get forty percent say yes it's\nIt's it's unbelievable it's forty percent\nUh you know it it the the question is never been is it a bigger problem per se is the question has always been does it exist at all\nBut I think that's what's a forty percent is saying there that they deny them press denies that it doesn't even exist here either independence saying forty percent of independence going\nYeah yeah worse than they do worse than what we typically think of race right now I mean that's a ... it it ... number it ah it verifies that it does exist or what Republicans to keep the house forty percent say yes forty five percent say no\nApprove of Trump forty one percent of independents say yes fifty one say no just a quick\nRepair that again I mean forty one percent approve of Trump of forty nine percent say the Russia investigation as a witch hunt that's those are two together that same ... it's pretty interesting\nAh you support Kavanaugh's confirmation forty four percent yes forty five percent no uh his help the Trump helped you economically forty seven to forty seven uh the Russia investigation as a witch hunt forty nine forty seven [noise] we are a divided nation but\n[noise]\nTo keep our crap together we really have to creep keep our crap together because\nThe next five to ten days depending on what happens with the stock market\nBecause historically were in that red zone right now through like November six is a red zone this thing could fall apart it'd be Nineteen twenty nine could be fine I'm counting on fine but things can change that rapidly\nA and others are preparing there's this bizarre story and I found um\nThe money managers for the elite in China have virtually all of the high net worth clients into physical gold their all into gold virtually all of them own\nGold and that's why it's so interesting the Chinese buying is continuously going up and it's going up without stopping the Chinese know what's happening\nThey know and they're continuing to buy gold [noise] one day\nThat's going to have a major influence on the gold price when the paper market breaks China dominates the gold market it's going to be very interesting I look forward to the west failing in their manipulation of the gold price\nUh through the various paper markets blah blah blah blah blah China just took delivery of a massive amount of gold from London and New York last month imports of gold into Switzerland and then exports to Asia in India\nOver Seventy percent of the gold import figures into Switzerland [noise]\nCame from the banks in London and the United states Switzerland is now buying the four hundred ounce bars from the u._k. and us bully on banks\nAnd converting them into one kilo bars and shipping them to China last month there was hardly any buying from the minds it's all coming from the banks out of London and New York\nThe central banks are either leasing their physical gold into the market or selling it covertly\nNow I'm not\nSure [laughter] I'm not exactly sure what all of this means yet I called a couple of friends and I'm looking into this I'll Try to get back to you on this tomorrow\nBefore it is used a before it used to be in London and stay in New York and it would be traded between the various banks these banks now are getting the gold from central banks and they give the central bank and I owe you\nAgain in normal times the gold would stay in London or ... or New York but now that gold is going via Switzerland to China and India and it will not come back\nSo\nWhat does that mean for months I had been telling you\nThat\nOf the countries all around the world are calling their gold back they're all calling the gold back\nThis is at some point either going to leave us with nothing because of what's called ... and that's another show or a a a war\nBecause there's not enough gold for all the money that we all printed in borrowed so what happens nobody is paying attention to\nCountries hey Russia and China saying we're going on war footing and countries all around the world calling the gold back there's something happening and\nYou need to know about it and you need to be prepared\nCoincidentally let me tell you about our sponsor this half hour it is gold line I'm telling you that story because I pulled it out last night and I'll tell you more on it tomorrow but I I I Am very concerned especially with the election moving forward", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "30"}
