experience but I'm sure somebody listening does\nA these are doing the same thing by the way it's just that instead of predicting a screening shooting the screen there they're running you still have to ... in effect project it you know converting analog to vigil requires a play back in the analog and then somehow capturing it ah\nSo they're doing it on his you know uh uh they're still doing internally on a screen it's just you know you don't have to have a\nComplicated set up I'm looking at the Wolverine three hundred bucks\nThat is a lot cheaper that's probably what are people are

portfolio one [noise] and um [noise]\nWell congratulations you've a definitely [laughter] definitely done extremely well\nYeah we're we're getting close we are getting really close um [noise] the the the the friend that I somewhat of a upon it at vanguard was the vanguard managed payout fun and it's they would control the money in their portfolio and automatically send you one check at four percent and it's a man\nOn that's what I was that's what I was getting it okay 'cause that would mean that would mean without commenting on that particular\nFund that would mean you ... you have a single custodial so here's the way a let me use model portfolio three since that's the portfolio you were asking about yeah let me use use that and that's the portfolio the most commonly our subscribers used for purposes of\nUsing the four percent withdraw guidelines so here's the way that works and and I think it works a beautifully\nFirst of all you have your stock market exposure you have your bond market exposure and model three and so that means you have three sources of revenue that are coming in each year\nGive or take from those assets one source is the um the stock dividends that are paid into the stock mutual funds that are then paid out to the shareholders so you have dividend income from your stock holdings so that's part of your four percent\nGuideline in addition you had interest coming in from your bond holdings and that is interest income that's part also of this four percent guideline and then uh and this is variable of course but\nFrom time to time you have capital gains distributions\nThat are made out of the mutual funds mostly out other stocks bonds occasionally a small amount out of the bond funds and that also represents revenue coming into the account because all of this money in a taxable account all of this money is taxable in any way\nOr if it's a tax deferred account find it comes in but of course everything that comes out um once here at the qualified age comes out as ordinary income any way in a tax privilege to count that is not a raw so we're talking about a a personal account we have all of this money coming in a sensible\nThe dividends are generally qualified dividends they have a tax rate the interest is taxable and capital gains how the tax rate depending on the type of getting the short term long term whatever save all of this money coming in and here's what's going to happen in some years it will be less than four percent\nAnd that means you'll have to sell a small number of shares across the board to make it come out to four percent and other years it will be more than four percent especially a year where you have distributions from capital gains it'll be more than four percent\nWhich gives you the ability to take you four percent and reinvest anything in excess of four percent\nAnd some years it'll come in very very close almost identically to four percent that is the approach that I recommend for how to go about a enforcing the four percent with ...\nOr ... percent that is the approach that I recommend for how to go about a enforcing the four percent withdraw guidelines which you want to review every year\nTo make sure it's working very very important appreciate the call Pete always great to hear from the land of the mighty WLS radio Chicago let's get Tony on the line in Santa Clarita hello Tony\nThey know that ten thousand a state and local tax limit rural new thing\nYeah there is a new law that limits the deductibles ... of state and local taxes of all kinds of property taxes income taxes sales tax is a local taxes like wage tax is like the city of Philadelphia wage tax all of those state and local taxes now\nCobbled together can be deducted up to a limit a cap of ten thousand dollars if you have more than that you lose the duct ability\nDon't you think that will encourage more people to buy new need bond so they could get back some money that they can't get back on their tax return and then that means that the bonds will be able to withstand higher interest rates better than they usually do when I heard when interest rates go up\nI'm not sure whether that's going to actually happen I Would say that if interest rates go up municipal bond prices will go down\nAnd I think that they will probably go down in the same proportion as they always do which is a inverse to their duration for example if you have fun with the duration of ten years and you have a one percent increase in rates I think the fund those probably drop in that as a value about ten percent\nI think that um you do raise a good point however Tony I Do think that the loss of folded ... ability of said and local taxes is going to result I think it's already happening in people looking at relocating to low tech states because\nAh for higher earners a for a business owners that have the ability to relocate I think that they have to take a look at that because uh the impact as dramatic\nAs I figured like if you were five thousand over that made you just lost two thousand of of whatever quit or whatever the top\nEnd up top bracket uh an a top bracket and there's another you're right but there's another problem with that uh were two other problems for one or there are a lot of people that are way way more than five thousand over this and ... and limit\nThere are states that are known as high property tax states\nThese are states where historically the the the taxes assigned a real estate had been far above the national average\nStates like a New Jersey a which by the way it has the highest property taxes in the United states and ah as a former New Jersey I I can tell you that's a fact\nA New York or California Connecticut these are all very very high property tax states which also by the way happen to have high state income taxes and all so all of those have um a ...\nSo you have all of these taxes you have this ten thousand capture your high earners take a look at this and they have to take a look they have to take a look\nAt no or low cost DOMA styles I mean they have to because uh it would be\nA irrational for them not to and I think you will see re locations and this is one of the reasons that I Would not want to have a long term pension income obligation from the states that are likely to see outflow\nYou know in California\nPension income obligation from the states that are likely to see outflow\nYou know in in California there's a bill in Sacramento where they want to consider state taxes that charitable contributions to some kind of\nState foundation charity whatever like if the if it's above the ten thousand dollar limit and then you could claim it as a turtle bought charitable contributions state of instead of an income tax some there's a guy in Sacramento trying to pass that bill right now did you\nHear about the only he does have a ... I did and he does have a problem there are other states looking at this New Jersey by the way is looking at this and they do have a problem and the problem is in order to get a charitable deduction you're supposed to have no strings attached\n... for example has well we're not wanted to go well no\nI Know you're supposed to have no strings attached to the donation if you're not supposed to be able to make a donation and I have no idea how the courts will rule on this this will all go through the legal machine but you're not supposed to be able to make it to a donation for example let me give you a really good example a\nYou're not supposed to be able to make a donation of thirty thousand dollars to a a a church right take a charitable deduction\nAnd then the church gives you a thirty thousand dollar car that's not a legitimate donation that's quid pro quo is not supposed to be that way so I think he will face a legal challenge\nIf you tried to pass a law that says the taxes the taxes are a donation\nBut in return you don't have to pay your property tax because that's quid pro quo I think this is going to be a a a legal train wreck that's what I expect money talk on demand is
