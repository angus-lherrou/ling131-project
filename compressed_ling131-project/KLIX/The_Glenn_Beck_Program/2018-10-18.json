blame if GOP loses my dad who cares I mean CNN\n... can you just get over it for ten seconds is there nothing else important going on in the world\nThey're not the only ones guilty of this but there is CNN in particular a treat\nLike Donald Trump\nLike almost the reverse of ... a teenager and a boy band it's like the obsession level is he's incredibly high now they're looking at it as a negative instead of a positive\nBut like they just are obsessed with this person yeah I mean it's it's seemingly there ... all that matters are dominated by him yeah we all that matters the whole thing about living rent free inside someone else's head I mean is so on display with CNN right now they can't talk about anything else even when they're talking about other things\nSaudi Arabia Trump Saudi Arabia now Saudi Arabia he's in trouble you know to all of those Trump have ties to Saudi Arabia he's talked about his ties to Saudi Arabia\nI think really caught somebody up a live a live feed butchered him alive caught him up and put them in a suitcase and you're looking for a way an angle to get Trump what is wrong with you people as wrong with\nThe like legitimately like a sickness for some of that might be ... if not CNN but I mean it is it as a network as a whole\nThey can't figure out a way to discuss any other topic is really incredible I mean he really doesn't dominate to their lives every aspect or at least there's at least they're public life\nI don't know maybe they go home and don't talk about it I don't know but when they're on TV they're talking about it all the time it's like there's got to be something else interesting in the world there's got to be\nWell just look at the headline at Fox they're talking about Elizabeth Warren and you know are Cherokee heritage\nReally\nAgain like all of these stories like the Elizabeth Warren thing is is interesting because you can be running for president it's a day or two story um I think it's at this point I'm I'm done with it but it was interesting to see her I mean a real flop here but we're talking about when the all time political flops yes she's tried she can get ahead of the\nAh a\nDonald Trump is everywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right and it's dominating your life just like Iraq Obama was dominating everybody's life\nUm and Donald Trump has a really good side and I've really bad side and it depends on what day\nYou're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah\nOther days you're like oh yeah that can we not talking about today and I don't want to talk about the ... you know so she is such a big figure in everybody's life Ted Cruz was a very big picture or big big force in everybody's life two years ago\nBut he's just kind of fallen off the map and he's just doing a good job okay mhm I'm Greg Abbott is just doing a good job and nobody's talking about nobody's talking about because the state's running great everything's going really well he's a great governor he's not controversial\nSo I think the poll numbers or just\nHow much is this person impacted my life in a kind of in a bad\nWay of oh I got to deal with this again today I got to talk about this again you can get you get you get into it but the ... yeah yeah yeah and it's not a bad thing about any of them it's just like\nOh I'm so tired of this ... you know it's like the closer you get to Washington and Greg Abbott is here Ted Cruz's in Washington but you know really the epicenter now and with the last president is the White House and so the closer you get the more you're like oh enough\nYeah I it's it's a it's an interesting thing I mean I it's nice to see I think you know especially if ... hold on to this race would it seems like he will at the moment or it's going to help\nTrusting thing that I mean I it's nice to see I think you know especially if cruises hold on to this race which it seems like he will at the moment or it's going to help a lot of other candidates in really close races there six tossup races right now\nUh Arizona Florida Indiana Missouri Montana and Nevada all of them are are very tight um I you know the fact that this thirty eight million dollars is not flowing into a race in that group\nIs a real positive for Republicans I did Democrats are very excited about better but I mean his chances of winning are very low\nAnd they've just thrown money at a candidate who has essentially I mean a very small chance of winning I Would say it's no chance for a very small chance of winning\nAnd you know that's only benefiting Republican chances of keeping the Senate but they are doing here's what's\nHappening they've made him into a national figure mhm you know they're already by putting him on Elena y\nY and Z on that one huh I Wonder if he doesn't get done he's he's responsible for absolutely nothing right he's not he's not some like up and coming outsider right like he's a guy who's been in Congress for a long time or he has been in politics for very long time\nHis whole life has basically been politics outside of his early banned years I Swear it's just because they think he's good looking guy and he can he can give a good speech you know I think he's I think it's\nIt's the ... Obama the syndrome of two thousand for what is this guy done he will he gave a good speech in two thousand four well he should be president what is this guy done well he's been on Allen\nI mean it's it's it's\nNot just that he's good looking I think that there is a part of the Democratic party that does not want to go the Democratic socialism anti capitalist sort of way and Beto doesn't look like\nThat you don't like his ... his power game as Alexandria Ocasio Cortez correct I mean they went ... went through them in the debate last night after replace some of these young yet but first of all let's start with a hit a better was opening and how you may know\nBeto is a a Hispanic noise do Hispanic ... name is Robert actually ran to hear from a Central America I Know a very recently Irish and he uh and he came out and make sure he knew how Hispanic he was the last Hispanic\nThan water than Elizabeth Warren is chair and I don't know what you're talking about here's a here's the battles open\nFirst race let me thank you answer for moderating tonight's debate has five for hosting us the people of San Antonio for being here and the people in Texas for watching this and participating in one of the most important decisions of our lifetimes on or if ... is author of is a key in San Antonio\nThe s the powerful see how it's panic he is he can't even stop himself from speaking Spanish he was trying to speak in English that entire time and just slipped into it because it's so natural for him coming from his deep Hispanic groups and that's\nSomething I Want you to make sure you understand on like this old white guy or she have gone through no he's not white or who is basic I mean it's so ridiculous Ted Cruz's old white guy because I think a ... a year and a half to two years older than a ...\n... or Robert Francis Oregon or he's not my column ... um anyway so uh\nThis is it was interesting to watch this because you know it's like as you pointed out crews runs for president he doesn't win a and he's been you know you don't hear from him as often as you did and he's been doing a great journeys his voting record is very solid I think you know anybody whether you like Trump randomly like all the stuff he\nFor the stuff he's doing behind the scenes with the judiciary and I don't mean just the Supreme Court I mean the ah the ah the federal courts is remarkable and will change the course of court decisions for a very long\nUh the federal courts is remarkable and will change the course of court decisions for a very\nLong time yeah he's been very involved the very involved um however Beto I don't I don't know\nI mean I get the idea that maybe he's a younger and good looking and can speak coherently I think that's the only thing he can as attractive to a lot of neck muscles yeah a lotta neck muscles a very shiny as well very shiny but he um talked about\nAbout Cruz and his motivations remember this is a guy who's brought in it the only story about that overall of any note is he's raised a lot of money that is his entire the entire reason anyone would ever discussed him because he has raised a fortune but of course he goes after Cruz over money less than\nThe speed of balancing budgets I'm only one of us has with good friends in El Paso started a small business or not the payroll every week balance\nThe books made sure that we delivered for our clients only one of us who served as the local government level every single year balancing the budget seeing each other not as Republicans and Democrats but at the council members entrusted with a ... responsibility to deliver for the taxpayers will pass every single year\nWe did and for Senator Cruz to say that this isn't going to bust the budget at a time of Twenty one trillion dollars in debt when we're on track to deficit spend the tune of a trillion dollars a year he voted to add two\nTrillion dollars and those tax cuts just proportionately will flow to corporations for already sitting on record piles of cash for and the already wealthy in a country that has ribbon with income inequality unseen some last gilded age why\nIn the days just before and just after that vote Sen Cruz accepted one hundred and twenty thousand dollars from the political action committees who represent the corporate interests benefited from the ... why does it go for this why does he vote for Internet companies to sell your private browsing data to the highest bidder without sufficient sense\nWhy does he not vote for universal background checks and a country that loses thirty thousand people to gun violence every year follow the money in each of these cases if you look at the political action committee contributions to Senator Cruz it helps to explain the reasons for his vote and how corrupted Congress has become\nNow again unbelievable hundred and twenty thousand dollars really it's Ted Cruz changing and opinion over a hundred and twenty thousand dollars it's ridiculous if cruise dropped out of the Senate right now he get a lobbying job at some from and make millions without even thinking about it he was me I mean he's highly educated his wife worked at Goldman Sachs if we remember\nThis is not a this is not a money issue\nOf for crews are beyond that\nOf course Beto O'Rourke has accepted or as had many ads run on his behalf ... from ... from PACs and superPACs and he's\nGot that little uh you know that little line of ... you know I'm not telling them to do it so therefore I'm not responsible ... but again he's raised thirty eight million dollars he's complaining about one hundred and twenty thousand\nDollar donation to a crew that make some changes opinion worth thirty million dollars do what does that make you\nI'll tell you what it does I think thirty eight million dollars uh for some uh makes you into a national candidate for another race not this one for others who have given part of that thirty eight million dollars\nOr in large a chunks

K. or with your comments and questions and maybe you have some questions like we do all this Saudi Arabia and killing I you know I don't know why we haven't\nNewt Riyadh yet why I don't know why I mean a journalist was killed yeah uh that much we kinda do so usually when that happens we've destroyed the country by now usually what you do write new just willy nilly start launching missiles at it\nI Love I Love the way the media reacts to this stuff the criticism the main criticism of Donald Trump since he's been in the public eye in politics is that he ... quickly jumpstart he just jumps into everything and he's he's constantly he's a he's a loose cannon\nHe might knew everybody knew everybody [laughter] actually trying to gather facts yeah would you do\nI mean look it to me it sure looks like something really bad ... bad but again all of this comes from Turkish sources Turkish sources with an incentive to make Saudi Arabia look as bad as possible so until we actually have the evidence or at least our intelligence services at the evidence\nIt's hard to jump to a conclusion and do anything a drastic\nAnd the criticism that is coming in a Trump is he saying well look we need a we've asked for the video we've asked for the audio that supposedly exist that's been described media reports but we don't have it yeah mhm we've tried we've talked to them about it we've we've we're investigating we spent like bomb pale over there to talk to them about it\n... I mean you ... I think the same people who we heard for years and years and years\nOver there to talk to them about it ... I mean he ... I think the same people who we heard for years and years and years and years we did not do enough research to figure out if there was weapons of mass destruction\nIn Iraq and enjoying Donald Trump by the way who was who was leading that at the time ah or at least commenting publicly there are a lot on that now we're hearing from the same media people that we should be jumping immediately to we absolutely know what happened and how can we haven't punish Saudi Arabia yet yeah\nAnd I think that that's been the transformation of of the news is that everything now is seen through a Trump prism and clearly the you know the Saudi Arabian explanations have been suspect there's first of all they didn't know anything about it at first\nWell he was gone and he left a we we don't know where he went hoops while we never saw him leave out the front door ... do you have another yeah he went out the back window\nWhile I think we get scanned little from them but other people get a lot Europe gets a lot of oil from Saudi Arabia so yeah you want to make sure you got to all your uh T's crossed in ... before you take any severe action I Would think\nNow look as a global market anyway yeah so if it all affects ah each part of it affects the other parts and you know it's something to consider though I mean I think making a principled moral decision outweighs that a lot of times but American interests are have to be factored isolation we I think we see that happening too infrequently or over the past\nA AAA seven twenty seven back as the phone number are sponsored this half hour zip

Saudi Arabia situation yeah\nIs it possible for us to settle out of pronunciation of this man's [laughter] I Would I Would like to call a day off to a conference of I I ever went on media all media mhm what are we supposed to call this guy because I heard\nChris shaggy initially yeah I heard that one on CNN ... we're supposed to CNN and the ... the ... first name a news right I mean this is the big the big one right mhm then I heard\n... I could show or no ... ... ... yes cause show\nThe is the one that I think is I thought was like the main\nThat's what I thought ... I thought that we've been hearing that name since the eighties with Adnan ... who was a big arms dealer yeah and he was in the ... he was mentioned in the Iran Contra yeah hearings and so this is the name it's been that it was ... yeah that doesn't that's not a determining factor any more like if you call it Copenhagen for five hundred years it just turns to Copenhagen wonder [laughter] I just started saying Copenhagen they it's\n... it's guitar it's Qatar nope it's cut her\nAnd that was good or for a while I was younger for a while yeah uh I don't know I'd like you I don't know how this happens Osama bin Laden and it was Osama bin Laden\n[noise] it was the al ... al ... al ... and it was ... Q. U. I. D. A. and Q A ETA all different spellings\nI understand it so I heard Kush ... cars shockey initially then could show ... uh and now on the way in today I heard in New York Times a person\nSay ... ... showed G oh you really are show gee\nIt's a whole new one and now we're like a week or to the store and there's already three different pronunciations this guy's name ... can we settled on something\nWe want to call them Bob I'm fine with that you would ask me what's his name Jamal I'm ... I'm Jamal Jamal was killed at the embassy we can always say it's it was ... and what does all know Jamal\n... or ... ... and then whatever the pronunciation is tomorrow\nBut you're right we got to get together on that because that drives me out of my mind it probably is irritating yeah it is it is I I I never understood that Osama Osama thing how did that happen why why did that happen\nBecause it's even less or a ... couple right the here you have a situation where it's it's been name it's spelled the same but were pronouncing it different at least you can understand that Osama\nWent to Osama they shouldn't be a letter [laughter] and they just said no no no no it's a new it's a you know the guy went from like mid range pick in kick ball to last pick I like ... when does this happen used engine and the guy is dead\nKnow don't ever have a ... you know no one ever said you know Osama's wrong it's it should be you saw about Osama why no\nNo one ever said you know Osama's wrong it's it should be you saw about Osama\nWhy no no it just started and if people just started using it\nVery strange ... that is very strange uh and like some of it I I guess they understand like for example ah here we say the tiny little country that James Bond goes to the casinos Monaco right mhm in if you're over there they call it ...\n... everyone calls it Morocco no I've never heard that I Will say here's another one here we say Mazda for the car ... if you listen uh as as as a Canadian sports celebrity I Do quite often to Toronto blue jays games on the radio they seem as though it's mad stuff Toronto that's\nReally irritates me I wouldn't get to that I Would say I mean would you be pissed off of you also yeah they'll call us ... stuff that we are I've also noticed the jaguars being called Jackie what you are all the commercial either from Jack you are what it's like they like if you come up\nWith a name on your own maybe you can describe to us what how how it's pronounced\nBut what does the word we already know and when I say you were a hundred years yeah stop it it's an animal yes and they're not just a car it's an animal to write a buddy ever says jak you are [laughter] the Jacksonville Jaguars or no I think that yeah I think that's jak you\nAre trying to seem refined right like it was like if there's something nothing a little snooty about the way they pronounce mhm uh jaguars like as the that that stupid animal over they're ripping up my dog and listening to you on her [laughter]\nSilly so weird I even get yourself so worked up about the you know what I Hope happens every day is every day when she brings breakfast to them they ask her where did this for\n[laughter] I don't think it's just torture her with an ad for the rest of her life [laughter] 'cause I can understand\nThis you know sometimes I I think even you know like the conservatives get made fun of when they do these types of things are like when you watch uh you know that there's a there's one cartoon the kids were watching at one point that was and it was just it was just like a nonstop commercial for recycling\nAnd it's like I Know it was a captain planet or whatever and all of that that is that ... that one is actually a legitimate effort to change kids' minds about environmental is admitted they you know people who created it actually talked about that but I don't know what this one will know what happened to have a pig or something it's usually pepper pick I like to pick a lot a and a pet or it was talking about\nYou know recycling or something I don't know how important it wasn't in the recycling whatever like I don't have any passion for recycling I think there's some some ah\nThere's some conflicting evidence as to what good does a there's been several studies that have shown\nNot much not much if any clearly you work for all go up I apparently not know\nBut uh yeah like I don't know I Do I really need a giant a commercial about environmental is among my kids programming I feel like no no but I mean he also can get a little bit worked up about that stuff ... you know I mean you can get a little a little fired up with trying to find the political messages and these things even if they're there I mean kids\nGrow up into you know adults they can think for themselves and you know you kinda\nHave to at some point I realized that you're not gonna be able to control every little bit of that you can just you can do your best and I guess with her values probably the most important thing is to point out I mean she's probably doing you know a very worried about\nUh you know she thinks Brett Kavanaugh's are everywhere and ah and at any point they're going to be an assault going on and you know what I mean maybe this is this is consistent with what she wants to pass along to me it's just\nIt's a little ... it is and I remember when people were concerned conservatives who are concerned mostly uh about some of these Disney movies because of the things that they put in the Disney movies like I'm In the is it the rescuers are the rescuers down under one of those\nUh there's a scene where the character is going down a street on I don't know some type of vehicle and\nThere's a woman or on the ... in one of the buildings they pass that make it for just a split second I remember hearing over that yeah yeah so conservatives we would talk about that and it would be oh whose job it you can't even see that that's it's subliminal you don't even know what's there\nAnd then there was the lion king a scene where a ... as simple as as a grown lion kinda plop down on the side of a cliff and the dust shoots up informs the word sex if you ... [laughter] remember that or this yeah ever that\nBut we were insane for talking about any of that yeah oh please that's nonsense\nBut you're supposed to tell your kids are you do you need to ask word that apple is from why why do I need to eat the apple where the ... century she's saying that rape culture is happening yeah Disney yes and that's a terrifying message I was ... or send the children [laughter]\nWhere the ... century she's saying that rape culture is happening yeah Disney yes and that's a terrifying message I was ... or send the children [laughter]\n... although we've we've had this before I mean the ... the one I always think about as Willie walk on the chocolate factory which is a movie African love I mean I Love that movie\nBut what happens to the scene where they're just going through the tunnel and in all of a sudden like in really quick like subliminal things you see like a chicken get its head cut off [laughter] could one hell is missing his children's movie it's terrifying that whole scene is terrifying\nI like I remember that you are oh my God like they go through the tunnel and it's like really like psychedelic and weird and like I said I remember that being yeah well I live close to what's going on in there it's not good [laughter] I'm really sorry she gets his head cut off yeah like just like a sub\nOf this is why I'm bringing up and it can be I don't know it's I think as opposed to the scene is supposed to set the like off\nPutting a like if it's supposed to give you an off putting feel like it's supposed to be like things are all everything's twisting around and like it's dimensions are almost changing and like all these strange things are happening and you see like the scary or what was the guy's name uh with the with the ... alas he wanted the everlasting job stopper they kept harassing the poor kid in for it\nAnd then he worked for Willie won't get the ... I don't remember a cat I Wanna say squid word but that's about ... I got a lot of things messed up my mind that you know this happened and then he's going through and it's supposed to give that weird\nLike you're almost dizzy feeling and they flash like a bunch of really fast images of more like like they're just cutting a chicken head off in the very strange very strange yeah so we've been tortured with is up for a long time and look how well we turned out the world's fine right everything's going really well I Can't see how there'd\nAny downside [laughter]\nI I guess you can get to that point where your over your over parenting right oh definitely and that's certainly yeah it'd be the way uh you know that things are going now we we um we recently started\nA letting our son ... cause I I listen to ... a lot she's been on the show before she started an organization called let grow and a ... a free range kids and basically her mission in life is to\nMake kids do some things like you don't need to helicopter parent over them all the time she's famous for a she lived in New York still doesn't believe and she let her nine year old to go on the New York city subway system by himself\nAnd she was called the worst parent in America and Europe ... honestly my immediate reaction when I read that story initially was she's the worst parents in America\nRight like your ... year old on the subway by themselves like I Can't even imagine the amount of panic I Would have but then you you kind of ... I don't think I could do it either\nUm what'd you step back and he said well wait a minute like George Washington was like I think he won the revolutionary war to eight years old or something like this is the ... we went through a long period of time where people were\nAre supposed to be as kids are much more self sufficient you know I Know when I was a kid like we would leave the house and we would go play at a friend's houses that all the time the time with you on the whole day yeah and that whole thing about us coming back\nAnd um you know you come back when it gets dark or when the streetlights come on ... and I think it's ... we use that a lot of times to signify things were safer and better than what's not even true I grew up in the nineties this is like the eighties and nineties\nMore the eighties but no I was getting my wrists in America by far dangerous than now there was a much ... I mean the crime rates were all hire\nA murders were higher kidnapping for higher everything was worse school shootings wherever that the rate of four times what they are now when I was in high school and I didn't have a minute of panic over a school shooting in my entire life and I think we get to the point where we're just we're so freaked out we recently had are are you know we have her son\nWe're a little chore and he's doing it by himself or just up the street a little bit and back and I can tell you just that\nFreaks me out like I can and everything in me not to walk to the end of my driveway and spy on them to make sure he's okay the entire time and I don't know why that is that certainly is and how it was when I was a kid yeah uh and\nI I I somehow live through it I think that the the the instinct there is to just\nMake sure you're mentioning every little thing that you think could go wrong in their life so that if it that thing does go wrong you can't blame yourself\nYou know it's like it's almost a selfish instinct where you're just like wow at least I told her I ... I remember telling my kid five hundred times not to go Down Dark alleys and they went to a dark alley and well it's really sad but at least it's not my fault that that that's not really healthy instinct for parents I I Do feel like that is that the basis of it because of course you don't want no one wants anything bad to happen to their kids\nBut it's a dish and all of that like you don't want to be the person who let your kid\nWalk down some a street and they were something terrible happened everyone's got to look at you and say what the hell are you doing allowing them to walk down that street why were you there yeah um so it's like a double whammy and\nI think that leads to a lot of that over parenting stuff and ... and I'm sure this is the boat she's in ... right like she's trying to protect me look you're not going to ... you're not going to say anything to a four year old reading\nCinderella that's going to protect them from rape culture that's not going to occur you're never you're never going to be able to solve this problem you believe is so prevalent ... by a story you tell them after a while I was reading Cinderella or watching it\nFor the Little Mermaid um or any of these uh Disney movies because they're already going to be a messed up from\nSimba falling down and blowing the word sect rise of the year from the dust ah that's going to mess them up a lot of teen pregnancies cause a lot of Tripoli Seventy Seventy ISI Kay [noise]\nYou know that feeling when you just know you're experiencing a whole new level of excellence I have felt it a few times a first luxury car even my first iPhone you're experiencing a game changer that is exactly the way I felt and you will feel the first time you sit in an ex chair I\nKnew immediately the generic chair they suck and we spend so much time and the stupid chairs get a great chair and ex chair most of us spend more time in our office chair then in bed\nThat's why the ex chair is so important ex chair now on sale for a hundred dollars off go do X chair back\nDot com right now that's the letter X share back dot com or call one eight for for for X chair ex chair comes with a thirty day no questions asked guarantee just go to X cheer back dot com use the ... and get a free foot rest\nMost passengers seem to like it and so to the airlines for instance British Airways which has been using the so called E. gates at LAX since November ... that can board more than four hundred passengers in twenty two minutes [noise] some critics say people might be sacrificing privacy for convenience at the Los Angeles international airport\nNews and talk on the radio\nDishes use radio or change when you are\nWilling to wait but appearing to draw conclusions nine ...

I mean I I thought John Stewart was on Sunday this guy is on funny too about the one million power\nBut I'm Trevor Noah on Comedy Central the other day I took on Hillary Clinton and you know to his credit actually said some some accurate things are about her and and whether or not she's the best person to be speaking out on sexual allegations here's what he said\nIn retrospect do you think\nAnd in a way kind of them aren't Lewinsky scandal ... we're not it wasn't an abuse of power now now there are people who look at the incidence of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with him in turn the power imbalance as to why in and out but let me ask you this\nWhere's the investigation of the current incumbent Noll ... [noise]\nI'm Sorry man look here's the thing that's not cool maybe it was different in the nineties but today I think we're all understanding that there's a massive power imbalance between an intern and the president of the United states right I mean forget internal president with anyone as a power imbalance President Obama texted me I have proper you are [noise] uh [noise]\nI'd have to let him slash and then he'd be like I actually I just don't know if you're watching the game and I'll be like oh yeah I knew that I knew that of course I did yeah [noise] and also of course Henry trying to deflect and make this about Trump like you're not in a position to be throwing stones at someone Henry especially when you literally sitting in a glass house\nUm other than the power dynamics thing where he is saying there is is really amazing because nobody takes around like that on the left\nUm but I don't buy into the power dynamic that nobody can say ... or no to the president of the United states of course you could say I mean don't you wouldn't you certainly tried to raise your children to grow up to the people that would say no to president in ... states yes absolutely yeah\nYou don't

I mean that's amazing meet your rationale of okay you but you let this guy on who did much less than they are and you shouldn't you shouldn't have let this comedian perform on your stage ... and the fact\nThat nobody cares about these other people the same people right by the way\nWho want him to shut out Louis CK didn't care about Clinton didn't care about any of these other circumstances\nBut he's supposed to [noise] yeah and it you know I I Will say he he was really smart about this uh I mean he he well he some great points in this interview and and the New York times reporter was just constantly trying to say well yeah but you did this thing and you allowed and try out it\nPersonally on him as to why he made the decision which is an interesting part of the story but I mean he made the point is well of\nLook what is the line\nWe don't allow him Lucy K. to work so what does that mean does he go on the governmental to do or can you work at other jobs any work what if what we see cake hired by Walmart would that be okay\nAnd I I think it's it's a fascinating I ever support himself in life again and the idea that this guy has not been punished for the English sanity yeah\nThe Manhattan was making ten million dollars a year and he's probably now making I must be making at a comedy cellar appearance fifty dollars maybe five hundred dollars I don't know nothing may I wouldn't be surprised if he just walked in and does it because he wants to do it or he has you know paid for this and in a large way\nUm and you know it's it's certainly affected his career in a big waste most movies he's lost jobs but I mean we saw this with Charlottesville there was a guy who again we're talking about a consensual act because yeah because we have a consensual time he'd actually did it yeah it was it was intentional and it will there was one case in which as we discussed\nWell yeah I can yeah consensual time he actually did it yeah\nIt was it was intended to will and will there was one case in which as we discussed the woman to them no another case on the phone where we don't know what happened another case where he started doing it and the woman left because she didn't want any part of it will go up and that's what she should she should walk out or I think he's a loser and tell every all of her friends that he's a loser for\nA number that does not mean that he should be losing jobs ten or Fifteen Years later Charlottesville it's another great example of this look we use other people we played the video and the and the audio of a you know Jews will not replace us and and all these crazy chance to from the real dirt bags\nOr in in Charlottesville carrying torches and ... you know the the deepest darkest corners of the ... right ... one of the guys\nWho attended a rally and was in some of those videos or was identified as a man who worked at a hot dog stand in California he was\nFired from his job at the hot dog stand\nNow how is this a good outcome for anyone that look if he is saying to black customers I won't serve you because you're black obviously we get that but if there is no indication that I'm In the kitchen if\nThat ever happened he did his job at the seemingly right for every one he was serving hotdogs and making hotdogs and it was not like you know he was not in the high levels of finance here [laughter] and so now\nWe we are we can all feel good about ourselves the dynamic\nOf a hotdog vendors is fairly ... that are still intimidated or other people that's true so so I guess that we can all feel good about ourselves\nBut the fact that we are instead of him having a job a hot dog stand instead we will support him with our tax dollars because he's going to be at home and all these projects and programs that liberals have created over the years to support people in need are going to go to this white supremacist\nWho can no longer hold down his job at a hot dog stand critical for two morally above him but I ... I don't want to ever hang out with a guy who would go to that rally and carry a tourist in say Jews will not replace us never\nBut I mean do you do what we do is we just find every one of these guy you wanted you to replace you [laughter]\nBecause they ever consider you want to I Would rather not\nBy anyone [laughter]\nEver considered that include uh gee I guess I guess I don't like me or anyone else yeah it does include that uh but I guess [laughter] I really don't want anyone\nUm it's just a it's a weird thing we're dealing with because\nYou know finding someone a in a video and identifying them on line gives you the sort of rush of I've out at this terrible person and I can punish him who really punishing I mean I ... for certainly you're punishing the taxpayers this area who now have to support the loser\nWho actually somehow was able to hold down a job selling hot dogs and now has to sit inside probably playing X. box well you're paying him to do it I mean no water when let's do celebrate that one I I I don't know it's a strange direction for us to be going in as an artist\n... yes yes it's nuts it's absolutely crazy\nOr so maybe the answer is um they just can't be alive anymore I mean is it almost comes down to that because if they can support themselves and certainly the state you don't want them supported by your tax dollars right so I guess all people who are accused just starve to death now yeah\nI I guess that's what it comes\nThat's the way it works and I I Would be nice for us to find some consistency in this world would you know the fact that like you know if you were to say the me too movement I bet to most people are you sure you get hurt you get Harvey Weinstein mentioned [noise] um and you might get ... ...\nIf you want to say the me too movement I bet you most people are you sure you get hurt you get Harvey Weinstein mentioned mhm um and you might get more maybe Kevin Spacey or one of the other two you know few few big stars\nBut what you would almost definitely get is Donald Trump and Roy Moore and Brett Kavanaugh and every conservative are anyone even supposedly leaning right that you can think of that was accused those of us had huge play in the media\nThe I mean what's the percentage Ninety five percent have been on the left\nIt's all Hollywood news media people and I mean it's been almost everyone has been in those industries and those industries obviously lead incredibly to the left\nThe idea that this is a right wing phenomenon I mean it just seems like people who are on the right pay the price for it or people on the left you know don't necessarily see that the same way and\nYou know I think you have to get to a point where\nSomeone like Lucy K who was I think are\nAccused could correctly of being a dirt bag right to his ... to his own admission but not not any nothing that was over this line of sexual assault at least it's not\nAs reported\nYou know I have to look at these things as they say and I mean is easing sorry is now doing shows again\nUm and he was a he was accused of something um you know what's his face from the New York times he's back\nOr the Glen or what the heck is his name you know we get it wrong thrush right he used a of a of a harassing a young interns and other underlings and he he's back at work\nWe have this weird why I mean Mike Tyson is pretty ... the man was convicted of rape not not ... time convicted of rape spent time in prison yeah and he's like the darling\nOf the media he comes out of his silly appearances everywhere I'm a problem going anywhere now doing anything and he's I mean and look he served time and he's out right now um and so you could make the case\nAs the less has made forever that people who go in felons should be able to come back and vote you should be we their programs to give felons and convicted felons and murderers jobs\nYet but when someone's accused of something much less\nThan murder they can never work again and not even convicted just accused just gives you that really doesn't make any sense ... seven twenty seven back is the phone number or it is a pat and sue for Glenn who\nUh is traverse thing currently or the Mediterranean Sea and a canoe or he's always wanted to do it and he finally said you know what this is the week so that he's doing it", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "18"}
