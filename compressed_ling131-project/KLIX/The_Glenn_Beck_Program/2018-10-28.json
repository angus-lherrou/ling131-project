about to transition into retirement or sixty three years old and I'm I Need to know how to re allocate for retirement\nOn I'm going to more or less be going on your number three um recommended list\nAnd move heavily from my equity into some bonds and safer uh instruments because I Want to try to walk in some of the games that I've cut down the last few years her from the market [noise]\nAnd I've got three main silos I have a ... a traditional roll over IRA at a brokerage account and I'm worried about the ...\nOur capital gains in my brokerage account and that's heavily inequities all I Want to transition that into some say for bond instruments going forward without taking a huge tax yet a possible [noise]\n[noise] well if you have long term holding as a well one question would be what tax bracket you'd be in for the capital gains do you know that\nUm I Would not sure but I Would think Fifteen Percent\nOr less not a very big hit when you're a a Nevada citizen you don't even have to pay a state income tax so\nIf you're getting out of it with a Fifteen Percent long term capital gains tax then are you you've already you've already won the investment game at that point where you're able to retain eighty five percent of your profits I mean there are some people in some states around the country\nThey get hit over their head or twice they get hit with a ... with double taxation so uh you're way ahead of the gay game on that one\nAnd that's what I Would be inclined to do now you referenced a model three or something you were talking I think about model portfolio three oh hey Jay I'm Paige eight of the investment\nLetter and that for the initiated that is a balanced portfolio\nWhich essentially is invested in the stock market through no luggage will funds and also in the bond markets through no load bond funds and right now we've been using a short\nDuration [noise] but I Would say that a at a Fifteen Percent capital gains tax rate I really think you're a winner Brian all the way\nI appreciate that I that makes me feel better um would would you agree that the the ... is where I should retain most of my um more aggressive equity stuff going forward in other words that would be for down the road a tapping into that later\nAnd then my traditional i._r._a. I can kind of put a mixture of equities and you know more aggressive stuff in there and and I should put them in a more bond and safer stuff in my brokerage account uh when I go to start moving stuff around here [noise]\n[noise] well I think that uh one of the things you want to keep in mind is um I mean first of all let me address your ah your effort to nuance between the raw than the traditional ... holdings or\nI'd be more inclined to take a a a an equal approach between the two sons I think tried to nuance between a raw that a traditional is a probably a a analysis paralysis that's the way I Would look at it so\nI'd be inclined to just just go down and down the middle on that\nBut keep in mind when you talk about um the personal money\nThat you do want to try to put your most taxable vehicles for example bonds are totally taxable if you're in or the bonds and a newsletter that we're using and the model portfolios those are taxable bond funds so if you're doing that then you want to try to put the most taxable\nInvestments the ones that are going to hit you right away with tax liabilities a net calendar year you want to try to put them in my opinion into your personal account a\nI'm Sorry it to the attacks privilege to count is what I'm saying it is the tax privilege to count so you don't get hit with those tax liabilities right away whereas in the personal account as you've already a documented with your very small capital gains rate of Fifteen Percent a\nYear in a position to take advantage of the tax law there so I think that does make sense to put the investments in your personal a portfolio that are going to get the ... are going to benefit the most one of the tax law\nOkay well the thing\nSmith's in your personal a portfolio that are going to get the ... are going to benefit the most one of the tax law\nOkay well the thing is is that I Can't really move more money into Iraq without doing a conversion\nOh I don't want I don't want you to I

one where you can ignore it and it's not you're not touching and then it's automatically putting another call on hold and picking up\nExactly ended and what I don't understand is I when I look when I call these people that I had to eat crow because\nI'm Sorry they didn't call me my phone card and\nWhile I was on this other phone call on speaker I had the phone down I was making notes I don't know what happened it's never done this before you know developed a life of its\nOwn ... and ... as it happened again\nNo it just happened those three calls on friday\nAnd Ira and you were on speaker phone yes and uh\nAnd uh so you weren't touching it it was just sitting on the counter\nRight and then it would rain you know put the other person at one point it actually I tried to put the phone on hold her call back or something and it disconnected so I had to call the other one I Want it back\nBut it made three separate my phone call these people while I was on this phone call\nI've never heard of this happening before [noise] so that's the good news um [noise] I don't know how it might have happened in law has there is one possibility that something you're saying oh these triggering Siri now this has happened in fact you may remember\nA couple of months ago we had a story about\nCouple who were having an argument and the argument was somehow by transcribed recorded by the Amazon Echo and sent to an employee of the husband who then called and said I don't I don't know why but I just got an email with a recording of you guys having a fight\nAnd if it was the Amazon said yeah this happened but it's hard to have it happen it's a ... you know you have to say the trigger word and then you have to say in other words this call this person and is there any chance you mentioned any of these people's names in your ... no\nI did I did not and the Dickens is frequently I'll Try to ask theory for something and she just\nSaid of course money is you know it's the old story you can never never find a police officer when you need one but the minute you go five miles over the speed limit there they are they're they are and it's the same thing Siri never works when you want it to work um\nI I don't probably is in Syria 'cause that would be a really happened three times would be especially surprising you know you'd have to say\nIt called one person twice and then it called another person\nYou know it does sound like it's a glitch in the phone there's something wrong with the phone\nShould I take it to apple and see well they're going to the problem with all of this stuff is unless you can make it happen again\nUh with the phone or should I take it to apple and see well they're going to the problem with all of this stuff is unless you can make it happen again they're going to say well we don't know what's going on if you can make it happen in front of and they'll go well that whatever that is it happened\nI Would say if it doesn't happen again just put chalk it up to we're following weird Halloween\nJew Jew but otherwise if it happens again yeah I I Would\nBring it to apple and say it's happened a couple of times you know one thing I really learning with all smartphones even the iPhone is occasionally restarting it every\nFew days refreshing it by turning it all the way often you know with the iPhone now it's complicated you have to press the on screen on off\nButton and the volume up\nBut not the newer efforts on your old uh iPhone as the I think you can just press\nAnd hold the power off button for awhile slut okay yes lied to turn off and then you can wait a second and immediately rebooting okay that just clears everything out of the memory uh and it's it's a computer and you know the computers when they're rebooting sometimes\nWork a little bit better I mean that's not much of a solution for you but it just uh I I Can't imagine what it was that was happening\nIt's a weird glitch yeah look let's hope it doesn't happen\nAgain if it does do you take it to the app will go back and say\nThank you so much I enjoy your show and learn all the time\nOr less you think you still really listening and thank you hear well and if anybody\nSaid that
