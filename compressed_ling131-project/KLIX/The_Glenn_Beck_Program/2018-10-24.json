this caravan let's give you some additional information because it's\nIt's ... it's very\nImportant what Mike Pence said yesterday Mike Pence came out in the oval office and said this is being funded by Venezuela bell the mainstream press they're not gonna do anything but ridicule that but this makes sense\nIt makes perfect sense of it does sound crazy when you first hear about it like if you're not if you don't know the back story here like Venezuela you know like oh here we go again you know and they can't afford anything yeah there is blaming some of the country so we can get involved or whatever you know or yeah or the how do they even have the money to do this\nBut um it makes perfect sense when you hear when you put it into the context of the relationship to Honduras had\nWith a both Venezuela in Cuba and makes absolutely perfect sent in particular\nThese this group that SARS started this caravan they are the group that is that backed the ousted Marxist\nOr radical a president was ousted in Honduras right and they are they still have a populist the avenue to go to like their goals are stated goal is still to restore\nThat President back to the power and he was and they do have kind of a case there and an international case because he was democratically elected and so the really if they can make\nCompete with the United states in a conventional manner you have to go non conventional way and you have to understand too that\nIt was the ousting of the Honduran presidency the guy this caravan support when he was ousted the first thing the new government did or one of the first things a new government did was get out of the ... agreement which was agreements of hey we're going to prop each other up\nSo as soon as Honduras pulled out a way from Venezuela that hurts them economically big time so he's got a double reason for doing this\n... this is huge and this is huge so you really need to look at it through that lens they have a gigantic political and future economic reasoning behind all this is a very big plan it you know in place to do all this I mentioned before that um Iran\nAnd Syria were big time observers of this economic union and a lot of people have been focusing on what would've ISIS gets into this uh you know to this group or whatever you mentioned the possibility of Cuban intelligence Venezuela intelligence was I think is\nProbably Ninety percent likely that they are part of this caravan um but also a through I uh Iran\nHezbollah Hezbollah can be all in this a caravan I have\nNo information on that note no intelligence behind it but because of all the actors because of everyone involved the because of the people that are are are ... Venezuela Iran\nRight now that you could be a chasm below would be my ... if I'm In a U.S intelligence operative I'm looking for Hezbollah links you know inside the Caribbean and I guarantee you the U.S intelligence agencies are all over this I'm sure we've infiltrated this that's why when when the vice president United States\nSays that oh the Honduran president told me this he's not reporting on here say like that would be here say unless they seriously have something behind it\nI fully thinks he knows I think I heard your interview with a gun or having to yesterday yeah he do he knew as well he knew and of course that's something he would not come out and say oh Venezuela's behind that when the governor of Texas is not going to say that but I Do think vice president Pence tipped his hand on that I\nReally think that they're behind us and the question now is\nHow does this escalates you mentioned waves of attacks\nWe already know there's a there's a caravan forming in El Salvador there's a ... and forming in Guatemala and who are they form who's forming them ... we don't know the organizers yet but those are all they're all in the same border all with Honduras\nSo the same people that liberty and re foundation party look that up when you're looking at these things up and doing your own homework liberty and re foundation party in Honduras I Would not be surprised if what if we hear more names in El Salvador in Guatemala forming these\nUh caravans because the ah Honduras border was a shutdown pretty heavily they crack down on that border so they can't send more people front doors anymore so they'll probably go there those are their allies in El Salvador Guatemala are probably just forming them in their border countries\nAnd the press won't look into this in fact the press is downplaying this now and the reason why is because they know this is a nightmare for Democrats and the election this is an absolute nightmare the build up to it\nWhat happens on the border may actually work to their advantage politically because you'll have the big fat American Soldiers standing up\nBut the build up before the border they are saying this is a conspiracy we don't know where they're headed yes yes we do yes we do we know what their intent is to cross our border\nPeople the diapers middle ... with the infant this sanitary conditions must be like strong how are they sleeping how are they moving\nWith somebody 'cause I Want to help I Want to help\nI just I didn't know if ...

I'm\nHopeful though there's two others the news that we've broken this morning there are two other caravans that are forming behind this one\nWell because they've seen you know the seriousness of the countries along the way that they're just well no they're not going to be stopped so yeah [laughter] they continue to come and can you imagine if we allow these people all fall fourteen thousand or however many are there\nAnd then the Caribbean after and the one after that what does that say to the future ...\nNo you're over there and how many foreign land is over it's over California will be a first a collapse\nA yeah even if they are or what the Democrats are saying they are they're just all downtrodden people who just want to come to America and find jobs well okay but are we going to get fourteen thousand at a time\nMonth after month after month after month that's not going to work out well for us I I guess they think we can just accept an infinite number all wildland or country the

I think that you said um but with regards to why transitioning should be seen as something beneficial in research that show for some people that can help I Do think if other things happen ruled out that it\nIt can be beneficial for somebody\nUm I think ultimately adults should be free to do what they want with your body\nSo so do I don't get me wrong so do I but I I I think would uh I was getting to and you just answered is\nWith this trends phobia of is this just hurting everybody into Ashville questions\nIs dangerous it's just dangerous for people and and when we we should look in the end you're an adult you get to do what you want to do and I'm fine with that but just the silencing of fraud and in this case\nScience and medicine is is terrifying\nYeah but I mean going back to the difference between gender disorienting something like anorexia with people who are gender to support their brains has been partially either my school and I are ... writing or action I got out of\nThe the gender they identify as right at the thing is the studies that show that in the brain how are also conflated with sexual orientation so if you have a study on trans women say so these are people who are born male but identifies female they are also attracted for the most\nSo if you had a study on trans when they say these are people who are going out and if I see now they are also attracted for the most part two men so when you do these brain study it's we're still not clear on it like for instance we're seeing are two two and identifying female or get you then be sexually attracted to that\nBecause they are very strong neural correlate are associated with sexual orientation that that's the other thing that people are talking about is that it has a lot to do with sexual orientation being gay I felt that brain call it that people are talking so much that how transgender transgender isn't the same it's not really accurate because we don't know for sure yet\nDr Deborah

woman and he wants to do whatever he wants to do he can do what he ... he's an adult and I can choose to be kind to him and and say you know you're a woman now but if I if I'm On the witness stand I'm raising my hand and saying\nIt's a dude he's he's a ... that's Bruce Jenner okay and Bruce\nJenner had a horrible life in a horrible experience and he felt this way and I and I went along so I don't want to hurt him I don't\nKnow if that's what made him happy I'm going to say that but the court of law no end your honor she's not pretty either right I think that the the there's two sides of this there's the libertarian and may has is like going to want to do whatever they want I don't care\nOnce again looks vulnerable after it seemed like he had re open up a lead and maybe he would cruise to the finish line he's now only up by three and a poll that just came out a ... and you know you never again you could fool yourself as a Republican thinking gonna win a lot of New Jersey racist but it does I mean Chris Christie was governor there for two terms it does occasionally happen\nOr ... is a terrible candidate who you know ... quite likely was paying underage prostitutes for sex and he was not able to convince overnight you to judge ah well I get to the judge whether you think that's a good or bad today but it was the other had occurred\nUh so I didn't falling pretty mixed right now there was another fall by the way I'm an ... you know um some polls are showing that Cruz overwork race even tighter\nSo I don't know I mean it it was interesting to hear Sean Spicer talked about it because Spicer as you would know is that you know it was the original spokesperson\nFor Donald Trump or and became famous for that but has a very long ... long military career and he was a he was very much a a you know a Washington insider really knew the behind the scenes politics of it and you hear him talking about politics he knows this stuff you can rattle off these races like nobody\nElse is from the latest podcast the news and why it matters if you are if you don't subscribe to that it's about a forty five minutes a thing ... on your way home you can listen to it ah and it's me and it's a ... to ... ah Sarah Gonzales and uh also just sometimes the gas like yesterday we Sean Spicer\nUh and it's just a kind of a fun look at the news here's here's what Sean Spicer said yesterday just a little bit of what he said about the this election\nThe problem is that there\nNews here's here's what Sean Spicer said yesterday just a little bit of what he said about the this election\nThe problem is that their face the vocal minority their base keeps dragging them so far to the left\nThat they kind of have to keep fumbling passed each other to outdo each other to prove who is the most ... and that's the biggest problem that we have right now for the Democrats and that\nThe ... they have been the biggest helpers to the Republican Party over big because by going so far to the left and trying to repeat this this law which is what it really is\nThey've lost the ability to talk about things and I know [laughter] him to have um [noise] they they for most pragmatic traditional Democrat they feel like the party so far left them I actually think he might have a turnout problem you're talking about it with the Latino community now\nI think the Democrats is ironic is this may sound may actually lose the enthusiasm gap\nBy big margin heading into the ... midterms because a lot of these folks are saying well they they've now expose do they really are this isn't about fighting for workers' rights are environmental causes that we've cared about for so long\nThis is about impeachment investigation I don't know that I bought in on that if you're a traditional Democrat and I think they they look at the Republicans who have been focused on a pretty pragmatic agenda of economic growth low unemployment deregulate tearing down the deregulatory state and then you know I'm not sure I'm a Republican but I kind of agree with that agenda\nSo when the dust settles how many Republican senators are fifty five fifty five and I think if if if you call me into a high you are wrong is fifty six [laughter] so it will be able to do that I'll be okay with that but I I think that the way it's going now got a fifty one forty nine majority I yeah I I actually think Florida is going to go Republican I'm\nNelson as governor Scott's going to beat incoming centered and also I think there's no question in Indiana\nAnd North Dakota and the bag and then I think the I mean North Dakota point yeah but you have it in that but Indiana there's another story but that's all I think Indiana I is up for it but it's ... and look I've been in politics a long time the trend is what matters\nIf you're fighting back if you got the lead and it's coming over here that's not good right now when you look in Indiana it's continuing to move in the right direction Donald keeps fading further and further back\nYou don't pick up that momentum going to you don't reverse the trend in the last four teenage it just doesn't happen\nThat's when the news and why it matters podcast you can you can
