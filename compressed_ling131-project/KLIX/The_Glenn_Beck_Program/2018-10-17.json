...\nGland back\nThe ... uh the the case of the Washington Post journalist he was the Saudis citizen he's not you know despite what the journalists will tell you they they leave out the part that he is actually a Muslim Brotherhood and uh his problem with Saudi Arabia is that they wouldn't\nYou know a protector sanction the Muslim Brotherhood well you know Saudi Arabia knows who the Muslim Brotherhood is um and uh so he had a falling out with the kingdom and then he had to go get a a you know the divorce certificate\nHe divorced his life in Saudi Arabia had to go into the Saudi embassy in is in both turkey\nAnd he disappeared his fiance was waiting for him outside it appears as though the Saudis came landed a jet on the tarmac came with a bunch of empty suitcases and a bone saw chopped them up and put them in the\nOh and investigate ah the some more things were leaked by the FBI or sorry about the CIA et cetera and are now our secretary of state is over with the king of Saudi Arabia and it looks as though they are going to admit\nThat yes they did kill him a but it was an interrogation that just went horribly wrong and we're going to punish all the people that were involved\nIn this so now they're twenty four episode oh it's it's crazy yeah ... is is I mean this is honestly rear window Alfred Hitchcock this exactly\nAlfred Hitchcock with somebody sitting sitting outside going wait I I I think they chop her up in that case it's a woman I think they chopped are up and took her away in the middle of the night\nAnd it was like no that's crazy mhm well it turns out it was and uh and it's the same thing here somebody sitting outside going I think they dropped him up and took a mountain suitcases it's it is the Hitchcock\nRear window and this is obviously gone very arrive for the Saudis because you don't do things like this and expect to admit to and interrogation gone wrong two weeks later like this is something you do and you deny me Russia does this all the time they're constantly killing\nJournalist and they're like I don't even know who I don't even know what that was what is ... Loni him I've never even heard of the thing and you know like ... that\nTheir pattern and they never admitted if Saudi Arabia actually comes out of the ... yeah we kind of killed that journalists that's a big moment or in you know geopolitics that's not a it's not a tiny thing today\nOr how today or tomorrow the way the president answers Saudi Arabia when\nWhen they admit to doing this this is an ally a this is one of our bigger backers this is probably our best friend next to Israel in the middle east\nThey stand against a lot of the stuff that we stand against there are a big supporter now of Israel um we're in a proxy war in Yemen with most people don't even know that but we're fighting a war in Yemen at their request and they're fighting with us [noise]\nUm they keep Iran at bay we're about to sell them a whole lot load of arms they also don't money into our tech industry taxes ... right now because of this um they also dump a lot of money into our banking system a hillside\nThat cool orb that which is a that's a pretty sweet shore okay the or British do we know that and how they don't ask the or why hasn't anyone interviewed the or about this incident notice how the orbit is a show she\nStuffed inside of it [laughter] stuff inside of how they ... they hide so um what is the president do what do we do this way you don't get involved in these things because it's none of our business I mean I don't want it to be any of our business\nI don't want to have our whole economy and everything else hinge on what they just did what he don't like that we don't want to endorse it we don't want to be anywhere near it\nCertainly feels different ... helped me quantify the difference here for a minute these regimes are killing people all the time\nYes we know bad things are happening all the time and you know Saudi Arabia is not an innocent of these things yes is it just because it's a journalist is it just because it was on foreign territory in an embassy\nA president with everything that you have to a deal with I mean I think it's okay to take a stand and say you know the sort of stuff can happen anymore we still have relations with a lot of a lot of countries who have done much worse than having killing one journalist as sad as that is I mean this is you know\nThen I remember in the world this isn't this guy is not just a journalist he is a he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood that's really the problem here is that uh they believe that he was um\nYou know helping the Muslim Brotherhood against to Saudi Arabia and possibly even helping the Muslim Brotherhood here in the United states\nSo he's not just a journalist is that let's let's\nLet's clear that up this isn't it the Saudi Arabia ... really ... and it's not that they were killing him because he was a journalist but because of his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood\nFor I think I mean it's a you know it's literally impossible to be able to judge all the moving parts behind the scenes that we don't know about ... you know that's why you have this is why you hire a president that you trust and and you know this is why you vote right because it's the situations that we know is with Bush I mean you you met with him during the war\nAnd he informed view of nothing about top secret or anything but a lot of the different uh things that you had to consider when making these decisions\nAnd you know it's easy to say well we should just never talk to Saudi Arabia again and throw them out there's a lot of things behind the scenes but they're doing for example helping in the fight against terrorism they have been a while obviously as we all know nine eleven or many of the people came from Saudi Arabia\nHas been all sorts of questions on that and we talked about distancing ourselves for a long time and this is probably a great a opportunity to do that a little bit um but you know there's there have been they've also\nUh that have assisted us over the years as well I'm On those efforts so I it's a tough one I think you have to you have to send a signal you have to make sure I think probably sanctions or something if this is actually a proven um you have to you have\nTo do something publicly but you look at I mean Russia's done terrible things like that and we have in uh we haven't uh acted\n'em any more not selling arms to Russia no no it's not selling arms to Russia and you know the idea that OK well arms sales help jobs is not agree argument\nAnd this is the one thing that we have to we can't really consider the economy for when you're talking about arms sales yeah um but I you know I think taking that step of of probably sanctions and maybe that's what it is maybe it's arms um\nIs this going to be an important really really important decision for us for the president Glenda [noise]\nUm first I go back in history and I look at uh the Archduke Ferdinand moment 'cause this is the exact kind of moment that the world thinks is no big deal that could spiral out of control so quickly mhm um I send my secretary of state over which is exactly what Trump did yesterday\nUm like gather all of the evidence and then I Am as strong as I possibly can uh understanding in weighing everything a that is currently going on trying not to\nWeaken them but not necessarily empower them or as well and try to get myself out of it in a long term strategy of getting away from\nThe bad guys and I think you know we're both going back and forth a little bit because we just don't know what's going on behind the scenes but not enough information to make this decision logical but will say is that while I Am not a fan at all of this slogan American America First and I think it has a terrible history\nI'm In this situation that is your priority here is to make sure that whatever happens is whatever is in America's Best interest\nYou can't start a war you can start um uh you can't go crazy and to just to make a statement if\nThe long term effect of this is a negative for the United states we seen this with uh North Korea right like I mean North Korea you can I think make a serious argument that ... I don't think Trump wants to go out there and be talking about how he loves Kim Jong lunar publicly I think he thinks\nThat the best way to avoid negative consequences and if we're if I got to say a bunch of words you know what is bad or\nGood we were saying earlier last night on the news the white matters again the south Korea of the time to take care of that was under the Bush administration we didn't or Clinton or Clinton now we didn't do it\nAnd now you're in a situation where you have no good options well welcome to the world that we ourselves created or allowed it to be created for us

don't know anything for sure um because we don't have the evidence do maybe the United states has the evidence the president has the evidence I don't know it's all coming from turkey\nAnd turkey is motivated to destroy Saudi Arabia possibly to destroy the west if you want to look at that they're looking to build a caliphate\nBut they also may be playing another game to get closer to the United states I mean there's an argument to be made a they've released is a pastor recently and they want to maybe send the signal hey\nThese guys you're dealing with in Saudi Arabia there there are bad you dealing with us more ... sauce arms you should be working with us more closely and they're trying to negotiate themselves to the United states at at the expense more specifically at the expense of Saudi Arabia or because they they don't like that the closeness of that relationship or there's an argument to be made there I mean I think a lot of this is\nYou have to take when you have to countries that really disagree with each other and don't like each other you have to take the reports coming out of turkey with some level of a grain of SALT I mean you have to we we need more evidence than they are we there is a tape if there is a tape\nThat at least we don't need to hear it necessarily publicly but at least our intelligence sources maybe a a high level reporter uh somewhere with some credibility\nNeeds to hear them and confirmed that they exist as we've heard a lot of details about what is on the state but we ever that obviously if I were here to one I Would not release the tape if I had it and they wouldn't release it yet\nI Would let Saudi Arabia play this all out because remember last week it was no this is crazy this conspiracy nuts mhm now\nIt seems that they are are saying yeah those things happen\nSo now let's see Saudi Arabia again we still we that's all\nBe facing an imminent threat of you know a bomb going off in a place that kills a lot of people that you know we might be able to stop this is\n... if this is this is the prosecution of a crime right in our eyes and if if they have actually killed this person they need to be held responsible however we don't need to make that decision tomorrow no we need to make sure that we get it right we need to actually\nFigure out all the dynamics going on\nJust because this is a media feeding on today does not mean we need to make a decision today are we actually take it seriously and most of the facts only a media feed them because it involved a reporter ... yeah and and and the stories so dramatic as you point out what was it wasn't at first Hitchcock movie rather window where we're window I mean ... you know it's such a dramatic\nHollywood type crazy twenty four ah you know Jack Ryan story that you wonder I mean it it's capturing our attention which is ... is okay it's just that we have to make sure we're looking at where the stuff is coming from right now it's coming from people with incentive to make Saudi Arabia look bad\nMy guess is because I think Saudi Arabia they're not our friends they've done a lot of really bad things um this ... I mean I remember this prince took his own family members other princes hostage in a hotel and likely a stole tons of their wealth including planes\nAnd these specific planes are the ones accused of flying in and taking their remains out in suitcases so these are the planes the prince confiscated from other family members [laughter] I mean\nAs he held them you know in a you know rich Carlton prison\nSo it's a legitimate worry that this guy is an absolute Kim Jong own style maniac\nAnd if that's happening with Saudi Arabia is a lot worse than it's happening you know in North Korea and a lot of ways I mean we already have a relationship with Saudi Arabia they're very influential in that region we know they do this do we know this stuff goes on in this region already and we're talking with all these countries that that do it right but we just have to make sure that\nThere's no reason to feel pressure\nTo not go through an intelligence you know full look at this before you start making public proclamation\nAnd you better take this tape seriously because if I were holding the tape I Would hold it until I see exactly how the United states and Saudi Arabia kind of ... around and talk to everybody down\nAnd then what everybody says okay this is over and they're not such bad guys and this was a mistake that's what I read the tape if they don't do what you want them to do if you're a turkey that's when you talk to the tape because it's that that\nDestroys the what credibility Saudi Arabia has ever had and with me they've had very little they're not friends of ours they are not friends of ours\nThey are selling us crap that quite honestly I live in Texas we don't need it we don't need it open up the fields here in Texas start pumping again and bring the price of oil down and let's get off of Saudi Arabia we don't need it [noise]\nAnd here's an Irish guy it changes the nature of the\nHighest Hispanic yeah trying to be more Hispanic and he he crazy\nHe also went so far as back in twenty twelve try he tried to ah joined the Hispanic caucus in the Congress and you know [laughter]\nShe didn't know he did he tried to get into the Hispanic caucus 'cause some of the El Paso residents his district is Seventy seven percent Hispanic\nSo some of the residents were upset that still dust race was no longer going to be in the pretty powerful Hispanic ... so he tried to join it they're like Mm no the nicknames not enough [laughter]\nYeah but I mean if we can go to the intersection analogy of Beto or nobody's intersecting him no nobody's intersecting him he is still at the top of the hierarchy in the patriarchy pyramid I think one of my favorite\nParts of the debate last night was when Beto tried to make this case that every decision Ted Cruz makes is about money so like he supports the second amendment and that's because of the n._r._a. and\nHe supports they've caught and it's like you're you've brought in thirty eight million dollars of nations right were outraged cruised by ... for two one five to one uh and of course as Cruz pointed out he's had plenty of special interest money come in and it just coming in through other names that's coming in through a pack\nThe heat quote unquote doesn't control which we all know how that game goes I mean the idea that you're going to come out and making money an argument about how Ted Cruz is about money when the entire story arc of Beto is based on the fact that he can raise money well he's not competitive in this race\nHe he has never won anything yeah fails she is only in the race to run for twenty twenty\nI Believe he loses how has he has he run for ... I don't know but there's still talking about it other than the euro was talking about how he is he is the he's there John F. Kennedy ... Democrat hope here right now and other may I say the great white hope\nYeah yeah it's a it's been fascinating to watch this um he also tried to a pin\nUh it it's been fascinating to watch this um\nHe also tried to a pin head up against Donald Trump says they have the big rally coming up what is the next Wednesday or Thursday in Houston\nAnd by calling him lion Ted ... like Trump did and he said that's why the president called him lying dead and it's why his nickname stuck\nBecause it's true which is never it's never stuck in an average or never stuck it's never been true and what prompted him to say that about a battle was that he had voted for Bill that would raise the price of oil twenty four cents a gallon to put a ten dollar surcharge on every barrel of oil\nWhich would raise the price about twenty four cents parents have gas the price of gas yes\nSo a federal said that wasn't true but he voted against the bill that would have stopped that bill so it really is true that he did he put in the book and they can both kind of claim that they have the truth on their side in that particular case\nUm but it was interesting to me because the CNN fact checked Beto on some things that he's been lying about during the campaign one being that his mother is a lifelong Republican loves this life long Republican right now you know because he's so wonderful and he's\nSo uniting yeah she's going to vote for him for the first time or the first time he's a life that is law on that first of all your mom is\nGoing to mold for you while [laughter] water ... how\nYou got your mom\nRight and then help me out because I think see an end even looked into this war I sure did yeah yeah I\nVoted for a hardcore Republican named uh Brock Obama in two thousand age primary Obama\nYeah yeah now here Mary [laughter] [laughter] okay so here's the interesting thing I Love this part of the expos aid from CNN\nAnd she can't remember who who she voted for twenty six point he remembered ten years ago but not to [laughter] we're\nReally you don't know who you voted for you know in order for Hillary and just didn't want to say it didn't want to say it\nShe couldn't if she voted for if she voted for Trump it would work to\nHis advantage yeah\nShe was she was there so I was part of the Trump saying yeah you know she wanted change she won right is it would have worked right oh ... voted that she voted for Obama in a way this lifelong Republican and then she can remember in sixteen\nThe other interesting aspect is that this lifelong Republican has voted in every single Democratic primary in Texas since two thousand [laughter]\nI Am even went so far is donating money to build bother [laughter]\nI Love my uh the federalist on this to a ...

I think you did and I've got a lot to ask you about on this but let me let me start with this\n[noise] [noise] why do you suppose that there isn't a an uprising or in Portland or they are they blind\nTo it for some reason or do they actually supported are they afraid to come out what is the what's the real readership\nIn ... in Montgomery County so you\nIf I were still working on channel two I'd be doing commentary going okay I'm going to be out uh on the banks of the climate wherever I'm going to be there at the turn in the morning on a Saturday I Want all come out and support what I'm doing okay nobody's going to do that there's nobody in town going to do that with any visibility it'll\nIt'll be two um unfortunately because there are many many many good people in Portland in ... county and I have friends there most people are selfish alright they're into their own pursuits they're doing whatever they want to do and you know what this is the New Orleans but\nI don't really want to spend time on this and then maybe they're not like me\nAnd maybe achieve all hit me or I'm not going to do it it's a selfish thing and it's not just in Portland, Oregon I mean we have to really as as a people\nWe really have to start to rise up and say hey you know what we want to process we want a presumption of innocence we don't want thoughts on the streets and mass beating people up\nAnd telling women that there has been rocked the grave it we don't want that okay so important when do we have any democratic 'cause it's all Democrats a hundred percent got any politicians here the governor of Oregon doing anything about this saying anything about it no no no no ...\nAnd that's how far we've come that's how far we've declined\nSo bill I Want to talk to you a little bit more about this and just one thing on and when you say we've got to stand up and fight this I'd like to hear your opinion on on what exactly that means a but also when we come back I Want to take you to Saudi Arabia\nThings have gotten even more bizarre now now now they're saying that the ... he was alive\nAnd aware as they were dismembered bring him a it is just an amazing story I'd love to hear your take on it and also if you were the president or advising the president what would you do when we come back [noise]\nAnd destruction of Israel Saudi Arabia is leading that charge so why on earth is the American laugh wanna destroy that nation when in history we allied or sell what style and it was killing millions of people while we were allied\nWith him because we had to defeat Hitler All right and you can just give a thousand other examples of countries that we had to do business with\nThat were bad countries\nFor the greater good but the left wing press now says the Trump you're an idiot\nBecause you are not destroying Saudi Arabia you should destroy that and then not trade with them\nThe sanction them boycott them all of that and then you turn around and go the unintended consequence of that is that the whole alliance against Iran falls apart at a wine is empowered eight times as much as they are now\nAnd so the Brotherhood\nYeah and and the and the left wing press doesn't care what happened ISIS did have using one article from the mainstream media about how the Trump Administration destroyed ISIS no have you seen them wanting to know under Obama ISIS ran wild\nAnd killed tens of thousands of innocent people for eight years for eight years\nTrump gets in there and the first year he wipes them out because of math is the defense secretary and he didn't do it in a very public way it was all done behind the scenes but you can get those articles you can get those stories are right now to even try to get them\nAll right so bill here's here's the problem with with Saudi Arabia as I said you're exactly right you know we're in we're in a no win situation in fact I think we're going to lose lose situation here\nStanding with people who we've known forever de de do this kind of thing all the time yeah they're bad people we shouldn't have been in bed with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the first place but we were and now\nThey're they're I'm a strong ally that is one of the only ones that is standing up for his real at least quietly\nFighting the Muslim Brotherhood and fighting Iran they we have a lot of aligned interest even though I don't want to be in bed with them but now how do you get out if if a kid out well but wait a minute Saudi Arabia this is different because if they're\nThis guy being dismembered while he was alive this will set the world on fire it's different\nAnd any new sanctions Saudi Arabia in a way that hurts them but doesn't destroy\nThe kingdom that's what you have to do so I'm at\nBut look Trump does have the heart for this he doesn't want to cancel the arms deals that are rich America didn't want to do it and the reason that we're we have a relationship with Saudi Arabia anyways because they headed OPEC we needed that oil in the in the sixties and seventies and eighties\nNow don't any more but now Silicon Valley takes a lot of their money\nRight so I have I say punish them you know when when it comes out and I believe firmly they did it I Do I don't think there's any doubt that they did at this guy walked into the\nCounseling and assemble Saudi counseling and he was butchered or whatever okay they did it and I believe that salt and the guy running the place\nHe ordered it right to the top so when it comes out than Trump has to say we're going to do this and figure out a way to punish them um but not destroy them that's what has to happen for the good of America\nAnd do you think they'll take that punishment they've said that if we rally behind you they have to right\nYeah yeah I mean it's just like turkey when a letting the pastor out\n... let 'em out well he's out I mean Saudi Arabia can't exist without the United states\nThey can't exist without the United states because it ... it will go in there and cause so much trouble yeah that'd be the place will collapse and so they need the United states can say whatever they want to say they need us and they've got to pay a price for this they absolutely have to pay a price for it\nDo you think turkey has the tape or is this plus\nI don't know how can I possibly know back in the turkey or three times All right ah I don't know what tape they have what channel I watch I don't know anything\nWhat I I I Would think the leading national you'd rather just in politics highly ... on it I mean I Would think so too I mean\nIn the Saudi a council it is Saudi Arabian territory the Turks have no access they did go in by the way which is interesting and they say yeah we found some chemical agents of and then somebody paint that something but let's just\nWait but I don't think anybody listening to us right now I should have any doubt\nThat this guy was assassinated by the Saudi Government it's amazing\nHow close is is to rear window\nOr the Hitchcock movie I mean it's it's really I mean it's you know if the Muslim Brotherhood and try and swords were involved\nUm a bill always good to talk to you that book a killing the ss absolutely worth the read it applies to the day shows real heroes and real real villains that got away for a way with it for quite some time\nYeah and I want to tell everybody I had back on the nose venues on Bill O'Reilly dot com yesterday for a rollicking twenty minute interview which we posted now so anybody can see it you know and if you remember to watch\nIt you were pretty ... you were pretty tame I thought maybe they were you know what\nI mean you and I are some panic though on most issues now I and I don't know\nThat might say it gets because having me on every week you know thought about you know\nReally where I think a lotta rated your position oh I Know my way I think he's not saying a back yard that's crazy I think the point\nNow is that you're looking more and more like colonel Sanders every day\nAnd I feel sorry for the colonel 'cause he's being held every day you look more and more like Glenn Beck and he's like I'm I'm the guy\nYeah [laughter] I I mean like I think that they're going to get a tub of chicken away from me I don't think so [laughter] build good to talk to you thanks so much Bill O'Reilly dot com [noise]\nOnto this half hour is blinds dot com
