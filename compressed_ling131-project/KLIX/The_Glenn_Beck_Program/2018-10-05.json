you heard that news where were you who you talk to first how did you feel you know what happened that day and then they go back to the same group of people a year later five years later ten years later asking the same set of questions and they compare their answers\nAnd loans or what you discovered is that not everyone that many of the people substantially alter their memories of the event\nWithout realizing it otherwise they are the first time they'll say when I heard when I saw the towers fall I was standing in the streets of Manhattan with my best friend Jim tears streaming down my face and then ten years later they'll say\nA kind of a a a practice um and you will you know obviously know much more about this than I Do but the the idea that that is part of what it means

just say maybe he's liberal maybe fifty fifty shot\nHe just came on this program and he talked to me about a portion of the Kavanaugh hearings with out expressing either condemnation or support\nHe spoke about memory and how it applies to both Kavanaugh andme forward you know how dangerous that is for him\nBut it was you were on the Glenn Beck program strike one you talk to him about Kavanaugh strike too you didn't say an opinion on Capitol strike three you're out yeah I mean any weather\n... regardless of his personal politics a lot of his listeners would be from the left\nUm and so you know but that's like but he doesn't care the ... well he doesn't care it's something that we need it is it something that we need people just being willing to be honest and and just talking about just about what we we can talk about things without making everything about politics\nEven though this story the reason why I had him on\nHis because it's very ... today but that's he did the podcast before Kavanaugh yeah nothing to do and nothing to do with it and I'm so glad we talk now in light of this\nPanel we just talk about what you found on memory right because it's important is the reason why I honestly I Would listen to him on Brian Williams yes because he's credible if you're a chill mad\nOut came out and see if I ever did that I wouldn't you know it didn't ever but like Malcolm so credible because he's not doing he's actually\nLooking for an answer right yeah and that's what I think it is so absent\nIn so many places right now I mean they say you know it it will always be your sides not always right um but it's okay to keep your principles and and maintain your arguments and and believe things are morally correct the way you do\nBut there's no reason why you can't entertain and be challenged by someone who has a different opinion I I feel like that's what you know one of the things that's been interesting about the cabinet thing is because the those on the left here and you know the prominent ones in the left\nHave been so I mean I Want to use the technical term bonkers on the story so over the top\nSo ridiculous in so many ways um it has taken it has increased you know enthusiasm for Republicans which will be something you'd expect but it's also taking people who are already planning to vote and changing their minds\nHow can you let this guy go back to the

All right\nOkay so did he know that the letter to\nThe I I mean eddy it is really clear I thank you for your phone call um and it's kinda like talking to Lindsey Graham is I'm a ... you know it's obvious that this leak came from somebody I personally think\nThe ah ... you know the the authorities should should look into the leak I think it's really rotten what ah what happened to forward\nPat welcome to the program thank you good to be here it really it it it it really is you and you can just say that now and you can think of any other place could you know that I'd rather be you know so

my bathrooms I have a fan there yeah every everybody because of of that memory but anyway so [laughter] so what are you really okay I sew a though it was just\nCode so [laughter] so [laughter] so I'm\nPat what's on your right today a well of course cabinet is on my mind he's always on my mind never far from my thoughts and uh and uh I\nIt's it's fascinating to see how are you know just kind of outlined how the Democrats wanted investigation got one wanted it expanded still got a ...\nA wanted it delayed so it was and now now that it's all been done and we're wrapping up and they found nothing now they want even more investigation and when I went to separate rent a I think in two thousand twenty is when it when it if you if you are yeah I let him continue this process\nBut ah the latest thing from the roommate who knows who\nKnows for a fact that cabinet was lying about his drinking habits\nAnd those words in his ear book in high school ... don't bring them up uh I don't run don't bring up the word no do move do so it's by and devil's triangle don't though because you know what those are about obviously ...\nThey're a well at least his roommate knows that they were a
