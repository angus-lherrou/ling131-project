what is your organization like what's your ground game\nYeah we have we have probably the best um obtained ground you've seen the longtime um if probably ever be ab over seven or eight directors campaign manager about thirty five to fifty people who are actively\nWorking every day on every aspect of the campaign to include things like a scheduling setting up a ... a fix our calendar or making sure people show of social media we have a a team on Twitter team on Instagram a team on Facebook we're we're\nWhether a team on Instagram a team on Facebook where we have a team when everything Youtube video production we\nDidn't go to and you don't have but you you're lacking money you're up against people who have tens of millions\nOf tens of millions of dollars absolutely we raised almost half a million but to be to be clear if in these last couple of weeks if we raise another fifty thousand dollars a hundred thousand dollars this becomes winnable I Know it sounds crazy but it is and the reason is\nName recognition is my only issue the last poll we put out I was at about one third name recognition and with that I pulled that Thirteen percent seem to the math on that one three times to get to a hundred percent equals thirty nine percent right through time searching through ... percent this a five way race thirty percent when this thing\nSome nine points above victory assuming I get a hundred percent\nThere is the hard part writes a math equation can I get to a hundred percent and sadly that's not my message I've got that down\nIt's the media can I get my name out to enough people to where I cross over that barrier which gets to be over thirty per se I Can't believe that there's I mean it's like libertarians don't want to win yes what I hear it has really is that well again you can remember as third party in general the system is act against you\nAnd some of the day was telling me they said you know only someone who has like a marine mentality could do this because every day I'm up against failure but the marine corps taught me take the hill the cap and shot take the hill the machine guns broken take the hell radios don't work take the hell are stopped giving excuses\nTake fail I get it and that's what I Do have to take the hill as a matter\nI get I literally deal with failure everyday this woman every day and when I say that\nThat's not an exaggeration that every single day as I mentioned earlier there's going to be a debate coming up here tomorrow WCBS\nAnd they're only going to include the Democrat Republican even though I'm On the ballot even those thirty one thousand New Yorkers signed a petition to get me on that ballot WCBS they got him him shelling is his name\nHe there's decided no Larry shop dozens of beyond their he's decided that the establishment is all that matters this is what I'm up against it's not going to stop me I'm Still taking the hill but it's yet another obstacle to get over\nSo if you're a libertarian or you're hearing something that um that to you think should be heard than you should probably\nUm maybe tweet storm what's his name again at CBS WCBS radio eight eighty radio uh it's I think Tim shelled so this is a radio debate yes well they're going to be televised also now okay there are ... are we both televised on radio ... okay so yeah again and they're just deciding now\nWe don't want them they'll me wrong there are three other people should be made should also be the Green Party and also the same party they should all be there but this is the norm and we put up against this with against is constantly and here's the the worst part with all of this we're still growing and they're still going down that's that's the sad part they don't they don't\nThey don't realize that when a sinking ship mhm I mean they don't care\nIf people want to donate how they're doing Larry shop dot com slash donate and to be clear if some of you want to get forty five thousand dollars you can't the mass of momentous forty four thousand [laughter]\nBy New York state law so if you I Know well sometimes I I Want to get like forty five thousand dollars sorry you can't do it forty four you only can get forty four thousand that's all you can get a okay\nLarry sharp a dot com this with an e at the end of sharp um I Want I Want to talk to you about some of the issues of the day and and how we solve some of the things like for instance healthcare yes how do you solve healthcare will do that coming up in a just a second a\nTotal was over a million look they're voting with their feet in it yes it's so bad it is so bad that ah Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and said thank you Cuomo because older retirees we have\nAre going to Florida and their pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and these pensions now aren't being spent in New York state\nThey being spent in Florida we're ... we're literally writing checks to Florida every single month horrible that's how bad it is yes so let's take pensions though true pensions are\n... it's a ticking time bomb yes\nThere's no way to pay for it yeah you've you're going to break all of the promises ... who worked their whole life and were promised ally\nYup what do you do you see it here in Texas with your beliefs or oh yeah you see it right here in Dallas Dallas you ate already already happening I may have all the time in New York state we are the most unionized state in the entire nation mhm so patches are critical right now pending or about Fifteen or sixteen percent of our budget and a budget as a hundred and Seventy billion dollars\nIt's double Florida and Florida has more people than us wow yes for about eighty five billion and they have more people than us and we have a hundred and Seventy billion dollar budget how about just massive\nAnd it's getting bigger the bugs are getting bigger and so are the percentages of the other pensions but on top of that a\nNew York state has about a three hundred million dollar debt and about a fortified they know deficit so it's a bad\nPension fund is good they write the fund itself is relatively well some of the upstate ... up and doing very well some of the city wants or disaster but overall it's er and well they don't realize it's being also funded by our tax base a budget that keeps putting money into it the problem is and the fun right now that's great\nThe problem is the actual budget at one point it gets so big that we simply can't pay me more as you're saying and Dallas\nAnd my response is about Larry's in the constitution\nYeah I I get that asked Detroit right asking Puerto Rico right Aspen is ... ... it was all legal for them to one there's no money it doesn't get funded when it doesn't get funded that eventually will collapse\nIf that collapses if our pension fund collapsed near state\nWe become Somalia overnight I don't want to become a Somali overnight I Want to stop that I'm the only guy talking about negotiating our pensions\nInto the right and which is some type of four one K. for three be something like that and I'm going to go with every single union that will take forever I Know that's why I say it's a four year plan is to for you plan to make as to what New York state is paying either\nA flat fee and or a flat percentage as sustainable because the issue we have a lot of people are pensions who no longer paying it any more mhm so we just have to keep paying them until they do need pennies anymore\nSo we have to do that also used to be like ten firefighters supporting one now it's one supporting tend to Iraq I think she was a ... for for ... I think that's right I'm not sure but I was making them I think it's something I think are supporting three or four\nOr so yeah it's bad so now we have to make that change and the funny thing is people are attacking me saying lie wants to get rid of our pensions I'm like I'm the only guy trying to keep them on the other one's talking about reality I'm Talking I was actually happening if you have a ... if you're ready for a pension now it's ten or Fifteen Years from now it's probably not going to be there for you\nBut why deal with that I mean it's human nature why deal with that if the two on the other side GOP and the Democrats are saying oh he's an extremist he's he's trying to spook you your pensions are fine it's human nature to follow them\nAgreed but I have a problem Glenn I care I have a problem I'm human I have a problem I Want people to stay in my state I Want people to stay in my state because if they don't my state's gonna collapse and I have\nTo move and I don't wanna move I'm born and raised in New York state my family and friends were in New York state I Love my state ... ... people love New York they hate me off government New York state is very special it has the largest city in the entire nation\nIt has an amazing waterfall in Idaho Falls it as mountains as cool as Colorado and has farmland in the middle as yes and no ... no farmland as cool as the mid west it as amazing rivers and\nLakes and everything you can imagine in New York is there it's a beautiful diverse state and with destroying it because wedding one city run the entire state most of my my ideas about happiness but the other part is decentralization it's about letting counties ... counties in regions be regions in towns beach towns\nRight people upstate tend to get upset with people in New York City saying well they're running it and there are bad and\nCut them off if you ran your own county you wouldn't care and that's what I Want to let people in New York City be New York city isn't right under the rug Rochester\nIsn't that what we're we're debating now over the electoral college the only reason why we're debating the electoral college is because it's the original debate I don't want New York city so tell me in the middle of the country\nHow to live my life yes don't lead to San Francisco bay San Francisco ... poop on the streets that's fine yes but we're different here yes and maybe you\nTo visit them once in a while right then ... look at the poop refined or whatever and everything is and they should be allowed to do to their city their county what they want to do a hundred percent true and it's not happening\nUs control it happens in any large organization as I told you I'm a business guy right and I'm the guy who I Will come in sometimes and try to help businesses to fix that make things better and the last thing I say as iron fist it's the last thing I say I hear all the time I go to a business owner and he goes\nMy my leaders aren't doing with them what they should do I can't get to innovate I Can't ... to take it does you're taking your all your things\nAnd the last thing I say it's iron fist I say give them actually more freedom here's what I Know it's it's literally an equation personal freedom plus transparency plus accountability equals innovation that happens all the time\nSo you give the people more freedom let the leaders take charge someone make mistakes but as long as you try and ... you learn from them you become humbled by them which is fine we all make mistakes\nBut then which of the ones who simply want to make a mistake blame someone else now you see that these leaders you don't need which are the ones who will not make any mistakes there doing nothing those illiterate you don't need you need the ones to get up try do well\nHit a couple of home runs strike out sometimes get better become humbled become better leaders in the long run that's how you make a better organization we don't have that now [noise]\nLeary is going to join me for a a pod cast you'll hear a about Ninety minutes uninterrupted a and we'll put that out on Saturday um Larry sharp is his name and ah you you need to be a need to listen to him I I have a feeling\nIf he doesn't win New York we're going to be seeing him a again a perhaps the elsewhere but he is um he's worth your time to listen to and if you're in New York\nConsider voting for can't imagine\nI Can't imagine what would stop you because it's not working as it is but that's just me Larry sharp a S.

care band members in Mexico come in so many Mexico's is is actually playing\nA ... a very beneficial goal in this whole process with us right now and we applaud Mexico for what they're doing or at least as of this moment in time\nOr they headed towards the Texas no no invasion plans of the United states with the former Soviet Union ever included taxes because they knew Texans would not take

yesterday on there was great concern that they were headed for Texas and it was reported last night\nThat they are headed toward California now that makes sense because as you know California is a ... state yeah and and ... they were welcomed this caravan and Tim or caravans like it\nAnd and and these care band members and the leaders of this caravan\nOf they understand one thing and that is a if they try to breach the gates in Texas or we're not going to tolerate it and we're going to be very uh you know protective of our sovereignty here and so uh I Can't tell you are starting to right now where they're going ah I can tell you what was said and what makes sense and that is they may be headed to California\nSo uh I Can't tell you for certain to right now where they're going ah I can tell you what was said and what makes sense and that is they may be headed to California last question what is the way the same as you know what was there in the United states there and you get out of

if she's been possessed by a gym I mean you know this is\nThe thing we were talking about this off the air a little bit because you know Donald Trump used the word nationalist yesterday talking about nationalism and what the definition of nationalism in its history\nThey're a little bit because you know Donald Trump used the word nationalist yesterday talking about nationalism\nAnd what the definition of nationalism in its history is is at times very disturbing way um however you know I don't know I'm sure that's not obviously no one is citing\nThe really bad examples of nationalism as it as where we are trying to go if you're Donald Trump you're not saying oh we want to be like those terrible countries he seems to be referring\nTo it as like look we're the best country and we were routed and we have a great the best you know culture and went and we should be a you know patriotic and and and be ... up you know sure excited about that\nBut when you talk like this that when you\nWhen you play a clip like that it's hard to kind of argue that we don't have a superior culture and a lot of ways\nYou know like I can only say that because you've probably been possessed by a gym or ...\nThis is the gym targeted and now it's a different kind of a threat was I had a lot\nOf of didn't talk or in my life I guess they ... and its trouble yeah it is and it gets you into believing in the bottle adds up ...\nSixty shots of beer on a program recently alive on the air right it'd be an issue but I think I'm OK saying that a culture that embraces women as equals is superior to a culture that that puts them but won't let them drive and and force them to address the specific way that you can't even see their face like that it that I mean\nThat way but I'll tell you what if you have if you would have a must happen what do you think is is worse for America to have thousands of people come in that shouldn't be here and you have to chase them around and process in order to kill a bunch of people on the ...\nWhat do you think is is worse for America to have thousands of people come in that shouldn't be hearing you have to chase them around a process in order to kill a bunch of people on the border who come in a way worse for America can\nYou give me your you're going to extremes here and I want to adopt something you said earlier which is the national guard approach National Guard troops are trained to deal with riots I expect to see military and National Guard and border patrol in riot gear\nThat's how I expect this to be handled at the border if they're not coming in at entry points and to turn them away right there it's an invasion treat it as an invasion German way you see this as an invading force these people they're not legally\n[noise] now the media is trying to say wait a minute wait a minute this is not an invasion and vision force and how can we turn these poor people away and I want you to listen to all of the people on television that are now saying\nWe are a country that has always had open arms to migrants we're always the country that I mean our our values or have always our greatest strength is our tolerance and are welcoming spirit\nReally is coming from the left because I've always felt\nThat way but you always told me that we have a rape culture not a tolerance culture\n... ... ... I've always thought we welcomed immigrants in but eat you'll always told us that we have anything that is foreign\nI've always believed that our our laws reflected a nation of immigrants but you'll have always said that our laws are racist and have from the beginning in a system of oppression\nSo which is it which is it\nHow can you tell me that we've always been a country that is welcoming immigrants\nAnd our laws are set up as a nation of immigrants\nAnd yet tell me that we are the most depressive monstrous society ever that only embraces it raids culture\nYou can't have it both ways which are we\nAre we a\nAre we a country that is that embraces a a rape culture\nOr as or as any rational\nNon Marxist post modernist might say or are we a little of both\nAre we are we a country that tries to be this way and sometimes we fail to see you can't really say that\nBecause then you can throw the baby and the bath water out which is why we've been saying hey baby is a good thing the bath water may need to be changed but let's not throw the baby out too and that's having your argument the radicals\nThose who don't believe in any kind of border security at all your the one leading the charge that we do all this\nLand this land doesn't belong to us\nThat were all afraid because we're white people and white people are bad\nAnd now you're on TV saying\nThat we've always had this culture that welcomes immigrants\nWealthy [noise] um\nIt is true we've always had a culture that has welcomed immigrants we are a nation of immigrants\nWell see [noise] um [noise] it is true\nWe've always had a culture that has welcomed immigrants we are a nation of immigrants but we also felt that you've always needed to come here and not want to dismantle us\nThat you came here because [noise] because you saw the American dream\nAnd most immigrants do most immigrants\nSee the American dream and they've come from someplace else you know is these guys are coming from Honduras they're not stopping in Mexico why they would probably have an easier life in Mexico just blending in they speak the language why why would you come to America and why not just walk through America\nUp to Canada they've got free health care\nThinking that\nThey have all kinds of hate anti hate laws and speech laws there a progressive utopia they have free universal healthcare why not just marched through us and go to Canada\nBecause one of two things either Canada is not the beacon\nAmerica is for all those who are the poor and the tired in the huddled\nMasses or this is a political move\n'cause you're not going to Canada because it's not about you your life the job\nIs a political move it's to destabilize to help push a country over the edge now I don't know which one it is but I Do know this Seventy\nFive hundred people coming across our border in mass\nIs not helpful and shouldn't happen you lose control of your borders let me ask you this if all of a sudden\nPlanes just started taking over VFW or the airport in your area all of a sudden just planes were just landing and Sea Tac\nCompletely lost control of the sky and they're just land and planes and Sea Tac the tower is saying hey guys guys guys wait a minute wait a minute what are you doing can land here can't land here would you be okay with that\n\nOr would you think that might cause chaos and might be dangerous would you think that if Sea Tac airport cannot control the skies if they lose control of their airport they're not really an airport\nWhy does that work\nFor an airport but it doesn't work for a country we lose control of our borders and people are just coming whenever they want and they can just get a big huge mass of people because they're Seventy five hundred people can do it\nSurely they can get twenty thousand and they will try twenty thousand and they will work and if you let them through congratulations you're in once you lose control of your borders you don't have\nA country any more\n[noise] or or uh or\nMight be hard to find a really good craftsmanship and people who really care about their product\nSimply safe [noise]\nA group of people that they don't have a problem with this one you if

for some reason they just disappeared and they they never introduced them and I'd wonder didn't want to do what it is about a year year and a half later that they finally came in and said the cameras done\nWhat were you waiting for they put the cameras in and the people who work at simply say put them in their house and they said I feel uncomfortable because you never know the cameras on or not\nMost people say put a little ... D light on it they didn't like that they decided they had to put a shutter on it and then they started looking for shutters that would make the right noises so when when did you catch and closed you could hear it and then they had to find the right material that could do it\nYou know five thousand times without any kind of wear and tear on it\nThat's the work that simply said puts into your system you own it and there is no contract for the monitoring and the monitoring is only fourteen dollars Ninety five cents a month that's it you get ten percent off your system and you won't believe how inexpensive it is it simply said back dot com ... ... ... or protect your family\nA and trust the company that we trust for our business and for home simply safe back dot com go there now simply safe back dot com [noise]\nPat Boone here again and I assure you I have never before endorsed a pain relief product not until now\nNot until relief factor came along as a one hundred per cent drug free solution for people struggling with ordinary pain quite simply relief factor was designed by doctors to help relieve those occasional aches and pains due to aging exercise\nAnd everyday living let me ask you are aches and pains keeping you from sleeping through the night for keeping you from taking it was nice long walks or playing golf or tennis you can't really call it living if you can't get around comfortably the\nThree week quick start from relief factor maybe all you need to lower or even eliminate these paints a lot of people have already gone to relieve factor dot com and here's something you need to know the majority of people who ordered the three week quick start now only Nineteen Ninety five go on to order more [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "23"}
