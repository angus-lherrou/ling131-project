an exciting time because\n\nLabels are worthless Thomas Paine wrote heaven knows the proper price too attached to something so celestial is freedom it's true every single generation I think except for the last the boomers\nHad earned and renew their freedom they didn't buy or sell the label the greatest generation that that that generation didn't have it wasn't them who came up with that title\n[noise] he was actually the boomers their children at the time there weren't labels like we have no for every you know every subset of every generation\nPeople saw themselves as people and Americans they saw a crisis not as anybody's fault but rather\nOh crap their turn to stand and do the right thing is what they did with their crisis\nThat made others years later bestow upon them the title the greatest generation well I don't know if you notice this but ah we're living in a time of great crisis set up people and I don't think it's\nWell I don't know if you notice this but ah we're living in a time of great crisis set up people and I don't think it's going to India and be much different or a smaller scale than the great struggles of the past\nAnd in that struggle all of the labels that we think we have now will fall away all of those that have been bought will become worthless and every new label for each of us will be purchased with blood sweat tears or actual courage\nAnd what we face in the end\nIs not going to be smaller than what many of our grandparents or great grandparents faced in the world wars it's not going to be any less frightening than the\nGlobal economic unrest of the Nineteen thirties but it's not going to be greater either it's just going to be hours and just like the generations gone by it'll be our choice whether or not we survive\nI think this is a blessing\nThe boomers never got to see who they really were the boomers feast it off the crisis of their parents they never really had to choose for themselves\nLike the greatest generation did life or death freedom or slavery they never had to push themselves as a group beyond what humans thought was even possible to achieve something as valuable or as celestial as freedom\n\nOf the crisis that we're now beginning to see is a blessing and it's a blessing our parents never received each of us it's going to have to choose we're gonna have to pick between black and white slavery or freedom good or evil life and death the choices are going to be that clear\n\nWe will all know in the years to come to we really are\nIf we choose carefully who we really are\nOtherwise we will be painfully aware of who we simply allowed ourselves to become\n\nWe can become through this struggle exactly who we were born to be our best and highest self\n\nIf each of us were honest and we began to see the struggle in the proper like we did Mitt that it's the softness of our foundations that have caused all these troubles it's are wanting an easier life not making the hard choices not having to say no not having to say yes\nBut Brock Obama nor Donald Trump or the problem or the solution there's symptom look around you no matter who you voted for I think all of us\nAre not the enemy no matter who they voted for\nAnd if you're not there yet or your neighbors not there yet asked them to ponder this who in your family came here\nI don't care if it was three months ago or three centuries ago why did they come here\nThey came here to make a better life\nFrom a country that would not allow them to follow their dream for one reason or another from a country that that didn't value hard work to a country that did value hard work and allowed you to keep what you belt so you could live better\nThan you did before where you could have a better life than your parents or your grandparents you could afford a better life for your children so they could achieve even more than you did that that opportunity is not coming because we have just a blessed land\nBecause we have all kinds of climate and you know Great Plains and mountains and and shoreline it's not that\n\nDoesn't even come from the people because quite frankly sometimes people suck\nIt came from our mission statement it came from\nThe American thesis that all men are created equal an endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among them life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and while that mission statement was and always will be aspirational\nAs it's never been fully achieved it has done great good even in its\nEven in its worst interpretation it has done great good\n\nIt shaped and given the best chance to succeed when it's protected by the guard rails of the constitution and the bill of rights\nPeople came here because of our laws which come from the American ceases that's what created the modern world\n\nIt is indeed why people still die in the middle of the night on the desert just trying to get to the side of the border\n\nCan I ask you went on his question\nIs it really that much of a stretch to believe that you and I are not alone in our ... out of our doctors\n\nReally that hard to believe\nThat our neighbor who knows how sick we all are really wants everyone who disagrees with their doctor to die is it possible that our neighbors have seen the flaws in their practitioner as we have an hours\nBut we haven't talked about that\nIs it really that much of a stretch to think that if we stop spending all of our time looking at what's wrong with America or what's wrong with them we might be able to see and search for the things that are right with America and good about our neighbors\n\nPerhaps were not as sick as all the doctors tell us are perhaps our doctors our politicians that are parties are more akin to bad crooked chiropractors that\nYou have gone to and have done more damage to your spine than good and will continue to bilk us out of every single dime week after week until we finally stand up and say you know what no or we're broke\nAnd I understand why we haven't wanted to listen because most likely our friends have all said don't go down that road\nOur family matters that don't don't don't go to him and then you really believed in you fought and now you're sitting here and you realize geez they're right and I don't want to be wrong I don't want to tell them that they were right\nThen again perhaps we are beyond help and we only have ... months to live but if it is that way I don't know about you\nBut if we're going down I Want to go down with my friends in my family around me and all of them all of them\nEven those who told me not to listen to my doctor or the one I angrily chased away because I just knew they were wrong I Want all of them by my bedside\n\nI think we should spend some time especially when we look at what's happening in Portland and and realize it's really easy to jump on the bandwagon and light fires\nIt's really hard to put fires out it's easy to lose friends and family and chase them away it's a lot harder to bring them back\n\nToday there are four stories in the news that talk about our founding documents and our structure of our country our Constitution's say they all failed well ... no not really no they were just forgotten our founding documents really are only an idea that's it I think a really good idea\nThat says yeah we should all be able to choose who we want to be you know build our own life charter own course and be left alone if we want to be left alone or be or right on top of each other and we want to but whatever we choose we can live our life with dignity and security that's a pretty damn good idea\nBut that idea has been failed\nIt just that nobody really remembers it believes in it anymore\nHasn't failed\nIt just that nobody really remembers it believes in it anymore\nI still do\nAnd I think you do and I will bet you that your neighbor does as well\nI'm not a doctor well actually I Am I'm a doctor if humanity's

of societal Munch housing by proxy\nThen were fatally ill and will only survive because of them and I have to tell ya that's ally they need us to be sick and I don't know about you but I've had enough time in bed\nWe're not as sick as they tell us\nThey've convinced that they've filled in the line for us because we never had to fight for it we never had to fight for what that blank is as a country we say I am was worthless racist over you know\nWe as a country we are a powerful force of good\n\nWe are people who make mistakes but learn from them\nWe is that people are always looking at a better tomorrow not just\nThe broken passed\nWe came here for a reason one of the reasons is we wanted to leave the past in the past we wanted to charge a new course\n\nIf we choose to see things the way they are and couple that with who we always have ... ... trying to be\nOur best selves better not not better than the neighbor just better than you were yesterday can you just be slightly better than you were yesterday not perfect not like him not like her stopped comparing yourself\nCan we be better than we were yesterday if we can do that and see each other\nIn the best light put our past in the

grieving studies and the corruption of scholarship part one introduction\nSomething has gone wrong in the university especially in certain fields within the humanities\nScholarship at base less upon finding truth and more upon attending to social grievances has become firmly established if not fully dominant within these fields and there are scholars increasingly but bully students administrators and other departments into adhering to their world view\nSo Dr James Lindsey a along with a couple of other friends decided you know I let's find out what this is all about and let's see what the lines are and they learned an awful lot um they learned something\nA quite valuable that you just can't get away with anything you have to fall into a a set pattern really\nDr James Lindsey a is joining us now he is a thinker he's not a philosopher but he is a thinker which I like a doctorate in math\nOr background or in physics uh James how are you sir\nI'm good go an hour you\nHave good um so tell us what you were tell us what you were trying to do what were you trying to prove\nWell we were looking into these fields to find out whether or not their scholarship has gotten so kind of ideological bias that if we put forth\nI'm really absurd arguments or that they might be willing to publish though so long as they've felt fell in line with the political views\nBut they seem to be forwarding and plays a scholarship\nSo that first you didn't you didn't really understand the political view part right\nIt seemed to be forwarding and plays a scholarship\nSo ... the first you didn't you didn't really understand the political view part right because the first few\nThe studies that you use submitted a you've got back they were rejected\nYeah um well it's not quite that actually we I think we understood the political view but we didn't understand the need for a scholarship we started this project out and as you said we got the first several papers are back rejected we started in August by Thanksgiving everyone is literally Thanksgiving a day off\nOr we really realized we were in trouble um we weren't getting anywhere with trying to host them but the problem wasn't we didn't understand the politics so much\nAlthough there's still a lot to learn there and there was for us to it it's very complicated they call it a matrix of domination that you have to understand um\nBut it was more that we actually we're not trying to work their scholarship and so there are two things that are needed to to get these papers and one is that you actually have to understand what they call scholarship you have to do it\nAccording to their rules you you have to understand the concepts you're working with and present them ineligible eat and then you also have to navigate this\nMatter your

had years before you came up with this or how you guys came up with these\nAh but they're fantastic oh let's go through some of them one by one let's start with the first one dog park the ah the thesis is dog parks are re rape condoning spaces tell me about ... tell me about it\nWas kind of funny actually um I tell ya story um when I went to we we all got together to to have this ... public as best we could so I went to Portland we all went to Portland, Oregon\nToo I'm ready for this project to come out the public can we went to the dog park on the first day I got there almost right I got off the plane I took over next thing you know I'm walking\nPeters out to the dog park with a filmmaker and uh we get the dog park and there's this just dogs they're living out the pay for it was crazy this dog\nWas fighting the other dog's hunting them down holding them slipped right and center the the owner comes over to the same as the ball thrower at the dog gently oh boy you know it wasn't being abusive and then he says stop pumping\nAnd then we get to as I lean over to the filmmaker and kind of mother but I guess a little too loudly and maybe we should start interrogating people about their sexuality given money is going down here and then this lady yells out to me oh no no it's okay she's the girl dog and I was like oh man there's papers happening for real [laughter]\nSo what is what is the thesis\nThe thesis was all the original idea behind a thesis was that we should write a feminist paper arguing that we should train man the way that we trained dog\nAnd so I thought that they thought it was pretty funny when I was brainstorming ideas for papers sure to Peter Peter takes his dog the dog park every day I'm ... said let's work and some of the stuff from the dog park and as we started working in and just\nYou know absolutely absurd ideas from what might be considered the most ridiculous dog park in the world or the paper grew into that and so we made it about so called queer perform a pivotal in human reactions at the park\nAnd then ended up concluding things like the ... we we should be able to leash man likely least dogs ticks to prevent rape except it's not politically feasible and uh\nGosh it would be great if we could could push shot colors on men but that's not okay either so we have to shock them out of you know hitting on women by screaming at them to scare them\nAnd it gets emphasis from their behavior we the thesis of the paper was though that\nThat humans reacted differently to gay dog hunting as opposed to stray dog hunting\nAnd men were far worse about this than women and then we concluded that this is indicative of race culture and we called the dog park rape condoning space than glycine to to nightclubs we said race nightclubs are also rape condoning spaces was no evidence for that whatsoever\n[noise] um\nSo that was pretty out there um that one was was really out there I think it's I don't know maybe the one about the the feminist spiritual spirituality meetings and poetry is a little more out there but\nIt's probably close to the most well LOU LOU finished the dog park this one was accepted and reviewed uh some of the reviews is a wonderful paper incredibly innovative rich and analysis extremely well written in organized\nA yadda yadda I Believe this ah intellectually and imperial being periodically exciting paper must be published and congratulated the author on the research done and in the writer\nAnd in the right yeah yeah\nThat was one of the most disturbing parts of this I feel like because again it wasn't like these ... these journals looked at this and didn't really go through it and kind of just ... it made its way through the process there are very specific comments from dozens of reviewers who ... who are doing peer review insane specific things that you wrote\nThat are completely ridiculous are amazing new accomplishments in the field I mean that had to be wild funny and it proved your point had to be really disturbing as well\nOh yeah that is by far what we consider to be the most important evidence that we gathered\nIn the process of of this project without papers it got published or that they got awards in some cases are one case\nAnd all of this is fine and it says a lot and it's disturbing but the reviewers comments show that these were peer reviewers which really worked out between two and four or five or paper\nSo we ended up with something like forty five or fifty total a set of comments\nThey they really did engage with what we did they really looked at it they ... ... set our analysis was good when her analysis was terrible they didn't raise an eyebrow about the data we gather the idea that um you know the dog park paper contains\nA bit of a completely irrelevant evidence about where dogs go to the bathroom and unauthorized\nWays as we did it and this completely irrelevant to the paper but nobody raised an eyebrow about how ridiculous that is um they were concerned however that we indicates that where humans not dogs so that we can be sure that we don't claim that when uh\nWe indicate that where humans not dogs so that we can be sure that we don't claim that when a dog there was a ... ... thing of another dog whether or not the dogs they go home to want it or not because how could\nWe know that as being ... and they were really concerned as I Hope everybody's seen in our little\nVideo we put out to announce the project they're really concerned with the fact that we respect the dog's privacy and the process of inspecting their genitals um\n[noise] and going out and what specifically were they concerned about I mean the ... what I mean\nYou got me man [laughter]\nAnd then it was done in the privacy of a of a veterinary office [laughter] okay um let's see you did fat body building which quickly is what\nIs that the idea that what needs to be added to the professional sport a body building is a category in which fat is displayed politically so that fat as just considered another to issue a equal with muscle\nAnd they said that's not true is to be mean to fat people fat phobic as they call it and that was accepted\nYeah that was accepted that was a pretty pretty exciting acceptance um especially because uh we actually had a real scholar who let us use his identity who wrote that who we claimed that paper and he actually has a professional body builder\nOr Mr northern hemisphere in Nineteen Seventy eight or something that I mean this guy's Seventy years old and just stack\nAnd the picture in my mind of this guy being the author of this paper for fat body building was just kind of hilarious\nBecause that's another thing to a lot of these papers you had a completely fake organizations you had completely fake scholars coming from colleges that I think didn't exist in some cases I mean some of this would have been easily just provide basic checking when it when it wouldn't have\nI think so I mean this kind of a this is a tricky point and I don't want to get too far into the into the weeds here but honestly scholarship should stand or fall on its merit not on who did it and so\nA lot of people are are making that point and we deliberately chosen names that would be hard to find in a Google Search in specific which was very common names on purpose I actually used\nWhat if this were published and they were real if this were published ... what what would that mean to the university system would would what does that mean\nSo the all events is a really complicated and there will be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at the University of Pennsylvania\nWho was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom he got in trouble for it a late last year\nSo they decided it didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting in classrooms and so there would have been some some uh educators primarily working and\nSocial justice size field topics courses I guess as the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general and stuff who would take up some degree of these suggestions as\nYou know experimental but but legitimate to using the classroom and this was being submitted to the gold standard journal this wasn't some fringe of journal in education and this was a gold entered feminists philosophy journal hype Asia that we were working with here which is where a lot of the literature there's like this already exists\nWhich you don't mind me going on a little bit this is kind of what's happening I'm we think that what's happening here is kind of in the equivalent with ideas of money laundering called idea laundry\nOh so they take they take these these bad ideas some of which are just opinion some of them are prejudiced some of them are genuinely terrifying like this vegetation all thing\nAnd then they launder them through the academic process and they come out with the stamp of academic approval that makes them look like they're real knowledge\nSo you'll hear people say oh well there was a study or we've basis program on studies that show well that's fine when this study is or could but when the studies are coming from a place they can't tell a truth from from prejudice and opinion it becomes a real problem\n[noise] teams one of the other ones I found um disturbing or was\nThe uh H. O. H. two ... two was was accepted can you explain it explained this one\nThat paper was accepted by high pay showed the singer and I was just mentioning that patriot we stood for hoax on hoaxes so it was a hoax paper we wrote that was a battle writing academic hoaxes that code namely gave for convenience\nBoy they argue is that that you can only properly criticize things that go against\nYou can only use humor to make fun of or or do satire to deflate\nThat which goes against social justice if you use humor against social justice if you criticize social justice what that means as you never really properly engaged with it therefore we don't have to consider your criticism and that's one of the huge problems going on in this is a set of of\nFields there's that they don't accept criticism if you tried to criticize them they say that it's a privilege preserving epidemic pushback that a scholar named Allison Bailey huge huge in the education of literature\nThey say it's white fragility that's Robin to Angelo who has just had a big book published on that this year but it introduced the concept in twenty eleven\nWhich says that if I'm somebody with privilege in particular white people for her work uh is challenged so that their privileges Clinton question that they are fragile and don't know how to deal with it because of privilege made them weak they don't know how to psychologically deal with having that challenge and they act\nOut in anger or grief or something like that and trying to maintain their privilege and so\nThese ideas are already getting out there and we just took him to step further\nThan ... you know it's interesting guy because the one about hoaxes ... is interesting in that if ... to criticize what you guys did they would almost half just cite your paper as that was\nThe idea yeah and it was definitely to put them in that position and I've asked ... to stand by the paper that they accept it and publish in our right names they haven't responded yet but we'll see what they do I'm that way indeed people who want to criticize our project from a position of intersection all feminist them will need to cite cost in order to criticize us\n[laughter] I could we could one more to go on and on the Utah Jazz is on the scary front at the feminist mine Tom are\nYou also did the white man my income if you did to one of his was accepted in the white man wasn't\nFried correct correct tell me about them\nSo I'll do though the white one first because they didn't get in it was much more frightening it was written in from the position of an auto West Nile graffiti where the researcher\nIs reflecting on in the states her own experience as a white lesbian women coming to hate her own white mass and they was rejected partly because the scholarship wasn't quite er which is the case in all of the papers\nBut also because the position to the author as a good white rather than being sufficiently supplement or whatever to critical race Amir eats 'em so there was in there was an explicitly political reasoning behind why it was was rejected and it was that the\nThe author as a white woman was trying to make herself look good by criticizing her own white asked was was one of the main reason the feminist one was\nWell hold on just a second hold on just saying then that took mind the parts of mine come where he was talking about Jews and replace the words Jews with ah with lights\nYeah in that case it was either whites are white and this and then we edited the tax around it an added a whole a whole bunch of literature and rewarded things so get past plagiarism checks and things like that so yeah that was a\nBit started with scanning through my income picking out passages about the Jews and replacing Jews were the whites are white nests and then\nEditing around it uh this having just one didn't do it quite the same way the feminist one was not about it didn't take the Jews out and replace it with with men\nFor example they actually as the chapter in my income where Hitler explains the need for the Nazi Party has chapter twelve and what its members would be expected to\nHold to Embry including especially the sacrifices that they have to make to the Nazis and we were\nFor ... would be expected to ... a whole to and including especially the sacrifices that have to make to the Nazis\nAnd we were placed our movement the party et cetera he doesn't mention Nazis specifically in that chapter or we replace that with intersection of feminism north solidarity or ally ... something to do with with the feminist movement\nAnd criticize the idea that uh some feminists do what they called choice feminism which is the idea that if a woman is living her own life the way she wants to end considers that to be a statement of feminism\nThan she is doing feminism it feminist for women to have you know full agency and make their own choices in the world that's what this paper was criticizing saying that no no the responsibility if they really want to consider themselves feminists is to be\nTo make sacrifices him stand in solidarity with other oppressed people particularly of you know women of color or women of other marginalized status is\nJames [noise] couple of quick questions um they they\nJust had to be one of those things that you entered into and hope that you were wrong in when they were accepted you had to celebrate and then short time later going\nGood God this is bad am I right\nThat's exactly that is exactly right so especially the ... paper I think the one that got accepted\nUm the idea there was that we were trying to it's very different from mine conflict course do I mean as you you know it's a wonder one thing uh but the ... the politics of grievance going through I really am glad I get to talk to you about that if I can\nBecause politics of grievances everywhere and it's certainly being used in the academic laughed as we were trying to demonstrate we called this stuff grievance studies we see it everywhere right and I think this is why we're so divided\nA politically right now I was really happy to talk to you because I mean I don't want to get in touch with you but you're a real dude and that's why I wanted to talk to you thanks you know you had this whole May of ... about how things were going to under Obama's time and I thought that was huge\nAnd I was like you know this guy Glenn Beck is is is a bridge she's looking for reconciliation is on your on your Twitter bio we need to be talking to each other again\nSo our project was you know or people on the left were left liberal so I'm not ashamed to say that I Know when you consider yourself a classical liberal and conservative on the right that's great I'm we're on the left me to take responsibility for our own lunatics and so our project was kind of that\nYou know we're in a left wing people who want the left to come back\nFrom the from the edge and we hope that you know the same things happening on the right and we can all star I think you know people in general I get a lot of sense for those people send me emails about this now all the time especially\nUm we're all kind of sick of all this nonsense all the fighting all the polarization and we can't get anything done I think we want to get back to productive politics and as long as we're relying heavily on this grievance stuff which clearly the academic left is I think we see a lot of it coming out of the right wing media sphere as well from my perspective\nI think as long as we're focusing on that we can't have productive conversations we can't ... remember you know you are an American I'm an American you're a person I'm a person we have ... most of the things that we think income and even though we have some probably pretty serious political differences\nBut I think we also have in common that we want to have better conversations we want to move society in a direction that benefits us all and it's just a matter of working out the details and I really hope that you know that our projects kind of reaches reaches that point does that make sense", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year":
