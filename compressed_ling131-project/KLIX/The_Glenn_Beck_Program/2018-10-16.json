numbers [noise]\nWell it would be great if it was twenty eight teams played the wrong word but election by the numbers here we are twenty Eighteen mid term election and what are the numbers look like\nSue ah depending on what you're looking at a you can find a lot of good and a lot of bad if you happen to be a Republican or ... or rooting for conservatives to to have a chance here to pass anything I'm obviously the both to really have a good chance of passing anything and as we've seen over the past or\nThe past couple of years even that is no guarantee you have to get anything done um but uh what you're seeing now is really good polling or for the GOP in the Senate a lot of these races that were close have\nUm to get to fifty is which is what they need of course to have control with my pets as the deciding vote you need to have a a there is about ten races there um and they've knocked out most of it's not just the ones that lean in their category ... get them to fifty there's the ... additional seven tossup races where they could get all the way up to fifty seven if they were to sweets those\nUm you know maybe even outside shot at something dramatic maybe even getting to fifty eight\nMost likely you're probably in that area of fifty three fifty four right now which is an improvement over the current situation in the Senate but if they lose the house that doesn't mean that yeah and you know it doesn't mean it means something but it doesn't mean a a heck of a lot 'cause you're not gonna be able to pass anything 'cause you know the house is going to oppose the other way and the houses where it looks real things look very bad\nFor Republicans um it's interesting the way that they're looking at this is not whether he usually it's like we'll we'll I work full of party loser gains seats\nRight that's the way we usually typically look at these things and then there's the control angle as well who will control the house pull even notice you haven't heard a lot of talk about whether Republicans will will gain any seats\nPlugs because it looks like it's not even possible at this point in fact um the the polling models that they have working right now uh five thirty eight has one which they have um the I the chance of Republicans maintain their current amount of seats at less than zero point one percent\nOr you might say oh well they've gotten you know there was issues with the ending of Trump right which is a big thing every time I talk about polls are like oh well they didn't get dropped right well first of all the national polls are almost exactly dead on for Donald Trump or it just didn't get the ah electoral college right but that also wasn't what they were pulling\nAnd some of the states were were obviously wrong but for example uh five thirty I Believe had about thirty percent chance that they thought Donald Trump or when\nThey're saying there was a point one percent less than a point one percent chance that the Republicans will maintain the same amount of houses are seats in the house in fact they're saying the\nEqual chance that Republicans maintain the same amount of seats as Democrats gaining eighty three seats\nNow both of those are ... stream outliers right like I don't think either one of those is going to happen right but the chances of of of the of the Democrats just controlling the house are about eighty percent\nAgain more certain if you want to use those words are are more probable is the right way to say it than Donald Trump or being elected or are they more probable than Hillary Clinton being elected right um so this is a it's a big difference and\nPolice nothing nothing\nNow I don't know if you saw the uh the mob in yes and I did use\nThe word gosh I don't know if you saw the mob in Portland this weekend but they had a a a law and order march ... showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law suit browns shirt stuff started beating\nKicking\nBurning flags whatever that's pretty scary and the mayor\n... released a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene\nHow how how can you how can you support that decision I I don't\nI mean I guess the the just the idea of look this is wrong but we want to make it any worse he's trying to make it\nSound as if um the police this is his angle for the mainstream our police can do no right but they act and they're just sucks they don't act and their do nothing's so\nThey have no way to win the great observation there are two political parties and whatever you do one of them might criticize you yes they that this is the\nJob of being married right out of your job of being a leader is supposed to\nActually have an idea and do something and what I think he did by the way I think you're right what did you went on a speak is dismayed right when you say for public consumption that is exactly what he's doing yes he has these opinion is oh jeez where we're damned if we do damned if we don't but in reality what he wants is a is much more on this side but yeah the ... more on the side\nAnd you can back that up with how he reacted to the FBI\nThe FBI building in Portland is is under siege ... I mean think of the balls and these guys they take the FBI building and block it off so FBI agents are are now trapped inside the building\nThey call for police police say ah we've got a call the mayor\nWhy\nI'm calling you dispatch police we have to call the mayor the mayor goes on and says if the FBI thinks that this city is going to back them up there in the wrong city\n... excuse me what what ...\nSo the FBI had to get federal officers to come in and get everybody out of that building and into safety\nSounded nothing Portland did nothing to these guys\nThat I mean whoa what\nIs this it's a I mean it's it's close to an artist\nYou'd think it would come if it does it you know the idea that you the FBI can't depend on police officer forget the FBI just these are people that these are actual real individuals who are in danger or and the other woman who has the food carts across the street from the FBI\nUm she was a a threatened with an inch of her life that I think they've had to move out of the city her and her family um they took her stuff destroyed it\nOr threatened the neighbors who are coming down trying to you know stick up for I mean there are just that they've become animals they become animals and their claim\nThese are they're streets no they're not they're not punk it'd be paid for them because I think a lot of the people who are trying to make it to work are the ones who actually paid for it your streets since when but read enough history\nUsually people are who are um\nYou know national socialists or Marxist radicals of some sort they were in power and they let this they let this stuff go until the people have had enough and then they\nDo what they want with those people and they you know\nUse those people as cover to seize even more power that's the way it works on a national scale I have no idea what this Portland mayor is doing\nBut it's insane meanwhile Alex ...

us as well as if there's not enough chaos or in the country\nThis terrible news came I realized I wasn't really having fun in the music business I had lost the joy and at some point just before the Brits I was starting to lose the plot I become desperate to hold on to something I thought I might be losing and I thought I had to do something special to keep it\nI started doing things out of my comfort zone like presenting and the truth is\nIt had been a while since I had been having fun it started I started to worry about ticket sales for my tours what the critics said what the perception of bite me might be I felt like I was living with this over my face and near a and the reality I was seeing was all blurred by it\nI decided I never wanted to read my name and print again never read a review and I never have I decided I'd never use social media again and I never have but the diagnosis made me realize how stupid I had been to worry about all of these unimportant things I was embarrassed by my ego\nI was embarrassed that has allowed this in security\nI realized that for many years I couldn't believe I was on the same stage as my heroes I couldn't believe I was looking across somebody like Paul McCartney and saying things like it's hard to get here but my God it's harder to stay here\nThan I woke up and sought after ten years of trying to get here in five years of being scared that it would go away I think I can enjoy it\n\nAfter his son's illness he says I just don't have the stomach for it anymore the celebrity narcissism\nIt started I started to crumble but then I started to wonder why I wanted to do it in the first place I had forgotten that it was all about souls connecting because I become so anxious there were people in my business\nOut of you've written a better song tickets might be selling quicker I started to take all of that on board and no one wanted to take any responsibility is just so much easier for people to pass the buck to me because I was in ... insecure enough already\nI Would digested and say it's my fault time rubbish it affected me and I started to think it's all going to go I'm going to lose everything\nIt is\nFascinating to read these things from him because what I've always felt about Michael boo play was she was just having fun\nHe was just living a dream and I wondered and I never spotted and him I just wondered\nIf it was ever going to get old to him because what makes him\nI think the best performer I've ever seen on stage is that joy he just has a joy of performance and it is a it is so infectious yeah he loves it\nI mean you can tell when you see him live you can tell he just absolutely loves doing it or at least\nDid at one point but they're starting to talk about I mean there's conflicting reports that he's actually thinking about stopping it completely\nHe says I was learning with passion that I was afraid I'd become a mere pour photo copy of my heroes\nBut when I come back from this terrible time I realized I'm not a mere photocopy I've learned everything I can from them taking it found my own soul my own voice my own style and now no credit can take that away\nIt needed clarifying now I've just seen the music I Love maybe when you let go that's when it comes back to you it's a lot like love he is um he he I think he's joking about he's because he says\nI miss the guys in my band so when my wife had to go back to Argentina I said to the guys come on over to the house let's have a drink orders and pizza place and video games and jam\nThey came over and we partied and I said let's play some music and I thought wow this is fun it was then that I realized I missed making music I didn't even know I missed it that was about a year ago so why would he possibly be saying that he is now\nIt seems like it might be one of those situations where the Internet has taken a somewhat a sarcastic comment and turn it into reality has is spoke of people are coming out today in saying that he's not actually going to retire because he's in the middle of\nA two hour and a book or ... album released and all that other stuff so here's what he ... here's what he says exactly to the reporter\nHe pauses there are three reasons I wanted to do this album one because I felt a debt of gratitude to deeper than I can explain to the millions of people all over the world who prayed for us and showed us compassion that gave me faith in humanity to because I Love music and I feel I can continue the legacy of my idols\nAnd three because of the world was ending not just my own personal hell but watching the political turmoil in America and watching Europe breakup\nThere's never a better time for music then he suddenly stops quote this is my last interview he says quite solemnly\nI'm retiring from the business of made the perfect record and now I can leave at the very top end quote somehow though the writer says I don't think he really means it\nIt's unbelievable because I you know that it was put all over the media as if he was retiring well he said it was his last interview he got other interviews\nScheduled right like he's had a whole press tour for this album is just silly and most important thing though is is looking at that and saying that is really the type of thing that ... that changes your perspective completely right you go through something like that and you stop it\nWe'll idiocy that you you participate in everyday uh and you can re prioritize you don't want to have to go through that to do it but sometimes it's the only thing that makes you kind of re prioritize the things you're doing in your life uh and and he seems to have\nI mean he he's making\nThirty five million dollars a year if he's out there a touring and stuff and he's able to walk away from that um because he just wants to spend time with us on how many times a week here of course excuses I'm quitting over there and more time with my family that was completely real guy yeah it's nice to see somebody who actually you know kind of nice\nTo see that he he got through it and has made it into a good thing\nYou know I have I have\n... probably more respect for Michael boo play than any other professional that I've ever met in the entertainment industry because he has found a way to keep his feet on the ground and he was afraid\nI mean when everybody when everyone it was very popular to hate me he didn't but I mean it's always a popular right you know by the heat but he would and he was never taking a stand for me he just wouldn't\nHe just didn't understand and he's like oh look I'm I'm not in politics I'm Canadian why do I care to take it out of it and then you get a fight at a\n... yeah he said the guy turned around and said I could believe you look back and he's like I'm Canadian Idol vote what what does it matter what does it matter to you and the guy threw a punch and he said I threw punches back and he says I got to do it I got into a hockey fight [laughter] you got to do a hockey fight [laughter]\nI Am so happy to hear that his ah family is um is doing better and his son has made this miraculous turn\nAnd ah Michael ... you've given enough if you want to give more we will certainly take it but uh\nDo what's right for you do what's right for you and for your family and\nYour real fans will be thrilled no matter what you decide\n[noise]\nI mean unless it's leaving the music business then they're pissed off [noise] by the way his new album is out in a few weeks a couple of tracks on them already been

more importantly I'm getting a lot\nOf mail about depression and I'm a and suicide yeah and I don't\nKnow why this is happening but suicide is a huge spike and I don't think people understand it a and I want to share some of the things that I have seen in the mail and some of the things that I've heard I don't know if you saw a star is born\nI did not know Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga yeah it has to be a an Oscar contenders are I think they're both gonna win Oscars I mean they should it's it's\nIt's fantastic um but it is um\nI don't want to own wreck anything but uh it um it deals with alcoholism uh and and suicide and it's a it's a very powerful and his portrayal of that\nAnd um I don't know suicide is in our is in the ... right now um and ah\nWe'll we'll talk about it possibly tomorrow you mentioned you signed a book or for a for him and the book of course it did get the outrage we talked about about twenty five million times in the past couple of months you may know that it is available in bookstores however we want one thing we don't mention often is\nWe talked about about twenty five million times in the past couple of months you may know that it is available in bookstores\nHowever we want one thing we don't mention often is subtitled and you know it's about how treating the country right ... ... and admitting that we have a problem not like us but like the country as as as a whole as a whole has an issue with the way they're dealing with problems\nUm and if you if you look at that because it's about what do I don't have it in front of me it's a it's a um a house thinking like a recovering addict can help you heal the country yeah\nI mean it's it's it those principles that are helping him get through that alcoholism right\n... ... a lot of those same principles would work at a on our country no they definitely would and that's you know you get into some of the ... addiction issues in the book but also how that applies to everything we have to deal with an entity that basically ... you know with a cure for Michael ...\nLike this is ... that's what the book is about right it's about being able to apply apply those and they weren't supposed to be the other situation it starts at the ... and it starts at the beginning it's not just admitting you have a problem\nThat we all have a problem of the nation has a problem and I think we can all admit that\nUm but it really it really it it's got a I think there's a section in here that in the book that really came before as an alcoholic I had to decide\nHis life worth living and in the book there's a chapter of are we good or bad is this republic is the American experiment\nWorth saving\nAnd we're not talking about that we're seeing people tear it down but nobody who's talking about is it worth saving so how do we answer that question and the book goes through that and I I think\nThe road to recovery of of our ills in this nation\nStart there or you know you you can say Hillary Clinton can say well I Can't compromise with people you know I Can't even talk to those people because they want to destroy everything I Believe in\nWhat what is that you believe in and and really believe in don't tell me the trade little things tell me about America tell me who you are now\nShe can't do that because I don't I I just don't think that she's a she's honest enough\nTo tell me she's this is a politician sees a calculating and and so are most politicians right and left\nIt's up to us we have to say that to our neighbors that we think we disagree with can we just can we not talk about politics for a second is America worth saving is it a good place or a bad place and the book shows you how to have that conversation and gives you some some facts both on good and bad\nBecause both sides have to have to step to the plate both sides Republicans generally see rah rah\nAll the good things red white and blue and were patriotic because we believe and we don't want to hear the bad things because usually the bad things are being told to us by people who have the country we have to go out and learn the bad things about the country\nAnd those people who just know the bad things about the country you have to go and honestly look for the good things\nBecause\nI don't know about you but I'm both good and bad and my struggle every day is to be more good than bad

Want to get divorced and I want what's best for my kids they always say\nThat family lawyer and author joined Jenkins says the stress of divorce can make it easy to lose sight of that so in every meeting she keeps goals and interest posted on a white board pictures of the kids on a conference table and his parents take a break when they're getting upset to break the news to children Jenkins always recommend doing it as a couple\nOther big thing about getting divorced if you're sending their children the message that you can't stop loving someone said\nKids need reassurance from a United front of support I think\nYou often explained that it that you can't live together anymore that reiterate all the time we will always love you we will vote always but you don't stop moving your children\nThat she often recommends family counseling especially to make sure kids don't blame themselves but thanks and family and the\nNews and talk on the radio news radio their genes and ...\nWith again and again is who is the host of get off my lawn and see our TV or he is the writer actor comedian he is the founder co founder of vice media in vice magazine [noise]\nUh and uh also leader of the Proud Boys are which the media is saying you know they're they're violent or and racist activists so tell me who you really are Gavin tell me what you're really fighting for what is your vision of America\nWell first of all I'm not the leader of the Proud Boys I just started it they they grew organically I just happened to be there and they ...\nShe as somewhat I wanted to stand up to the violence of antifa who were pepper spraying and culture and Lawrence other than me and all these other people who just wanted to go to a talk and they haven't stopped with this violence and inevitably when you're that\nViolent I mean you've got a group slashing tires you're going to have the tire boys\nAt some point you're right so this group would not exist if ... if it wasn't trying to show people down in trying to\nI'm a would take them out\nI don't think so I think he just they just stay at a bar like the ... they wouldn't be coming out to defend people\nBut more importantly though the way I feel personally is America's greatest country on earth because it's not about identity politics because it's not about your accent like it is in Britain or or you come from it's about meritocracy you come here\nYou bust your ass you at least appreciate Judeo Christian values you could be an atheist but you have to understand that that is the backbone of the country and as long as you if you're part of us here in we don't care if you're from you're gone to\nSingapore you bust your ass you're into American values urine and there's not a lot of places like that in the world it's it's very rare to have that total lack of class as a man that admiration for independence and liberty and hard work and we got there through a horrible list of ups and downs and and rights and wrongs\nAnd trying to correct things we had slavery or treatment of the Indians was not a but what's not what you'd expect for someone to homes the sermon on the mount mount with divine commanders as you can invest\nBut we've we we got here altogether through all this mess and all this suffering and here we are in the ... country the world\nAnd we get people complaining saying America was never grade and and that's what pissed me off and it's ironic that we ... we get caught a white supremacist because the reason we love America as it doesn't bother with all of that crap\nAgain we have is that for a long time I think the media basically just said antifa was that maybe didn't exist they ignored them completely and as the violence has escalated their new tactic seems to be well yes there's violence buddy it's the Proud Boys fault or it's it's the right wing ... have\nYou noticed or they're just exercising I my favorite is they're just exercising their First Amendment right of the assembly and Patricia of course of course\nI'm curious if you have if you detected a difference recently I'm In the approach from the media as is trying to make your group\nThe real a village the real villain in this because I mean I I they were you know there was a ... a tweet string going on about the alleged violence by Proud Boys members and it was retweeted by people like ... like the big time reporters were going after\nThis you be calm I think a central target in this is that you feel that\nDefinitely I think that the DNC put their uh hate is not hate has no home here that's the only thing they have to\nDefinitely I think that the DNC put their uh hate is not hate has no home here that's the only thing they have to say to America and it's an idiotic thing to say that's like saying\nWell we we are sick of albino violence like most is really weird concept\nThese evil Nazis and they said we're going to rid America of the clan and Nazis now there are not so they go ... uh we got to expand the next year so now anyone who disagrees with them as part of this evil hate to have to stop and I unfortunately have fallen into that that definition\nAnd it it's [laughter]\nIt's amazing that antifa and the media and the DNC all includes like Cuomo was saying hey this is like a a match and you put it on dry dry grass and then the wind just takes it I think the matches antifa the wind is the media and again the are starting fires\nIdle I'd I'd have to tell you I have a hard time disagreeing with that I'm seeing the way the\nUh the left has just consumed the DNC I mean there there's\nYou know when you when you're into a an organization where you're starting to say you know shout your abortion and\nUm and and that kind of really despicable kind of a a behavior you're bound and determined to start going way off the rails and they're they are they're they're the extremist party now\nIt's it's all getting so great I mean they used to and at the same as in Britain by the way the way that\nThe anti uses and keep their paramilitary\nKept paramilitary wing here or the media uses the jihad is over there and and the attitude in both cases the enemy of my enemy is my friend\nAnd then she says language and the DNC language getting more and more similar just like that now that said we're not simple\nThat's what Hillary's said when we go low fat when they go low we kick them or Maxine Waters saying no no freedom no L. peace or what ever go to their homes attack that we've got people on CNN saying that Sarah Huckabee Sanders should be harassed for the rest of her life that's a life sentence they said the same thing about Susan Collins\nThey're setting rice and two Republicans if we've got Rand Paul's wife sleeping with the gun we've got senator is getting that tax of ...\nThose are the people you need we need to unite with with the easy ones to get the ones on our own side again and again is that I may disagree on a lot of things we disagree I I Believe that it would be\nMuch more helpful to take the Martin Luther King's pledge and go and\nWalk through ... singing hymns and let them club you in the head go ahead let them club you in the head I Know that's not fun I don't want that but that video of not breaking ranks and not punching back\nThat video will speak to eighty percent of Americans that video will cross all barriers and people will say okay look at these ... they're not even defending themselves look at what they're doing to them you put evil versus good side by side and people in America\nAt least still at this point\nWe'll choose good but it has to be really good it has to be a shining example of good it has to be over the top good\nThat's why this is where we disagree I understand you know\nGather in in in ah the Proud Boys what they're doing I don't think they're wrong for wanting to do it and I don't think they're wrong for thinking that it's the right thing\nBecause how is it right and how is it wrong to stand up to bullies how's that wrong how's that wrong if the police won't stand up if the media won't stand up well who's going to so I completely understand that\nAnd I can't blame you can't like I get it I just think it's not effective\nBecause what happens is the media event just takes the piece of the video that they have where somebody's swinging back and then they say it's their fault so it's just not as effective\nDo I want to get club in the head no no\n\nBut if given and I can come together even though we have big disagreements our disagreements or not on the things that actually matter we're not talking tactics the things that actually\nMatter or the principles bill of rights constitution declaration of independence Judeo Christian ethic\nBetter or the principles\nBill of rights constitution declaration of independence Judeo Christian ethic\nI mean\nFundamentally the left as you talked about this before shouting their abortion they're proud of their abortion and they're heroes the Proud Boys are proud of the west right and they're the villains\nOr you know I think you and Gavin ... would agree completely on on what to do to be proud of the fact that ah you know once you are in the western way of life is is something\nTo cherish it's a miracle it is and there's nothing wrong with with defending that at all or you know tactics are attacks tactics decide we have to if we don't defend it it's going to go away you know we're all at the you know we're only one generation away from losing this as we all know and maybe it's a generation\nSeems like it could be a week or two away at this at the rate\nSo we have to sit there and defended it it's just you know what's the best way of doing it and I think that there's a there's a discussion there um because I think you know I think as you I'm gathering would acknowledge it kind of talked about in an interview they're going to be they're gonna be under the microscope now you got to be on the absolute best behavior as ... when the Tea Party was going on right when we went out and do these rallies\nIf there were you said don't bring signs because we know if there's one sign that's out of place if one person makes one sign that has any hands of something bad it will be the entire story don't even bring signs\nMe Trey clean up when we when we walk away we want to we want this or this area to be cleaner than when we got here and time after time after time that happened\nAnd they weren't able to show to say it would any evidence that they were violent\nSo here's the thing I think we were way ahead but Roger ales told me once he said you're so far ahead of the parade\nYou're about four blocks ahead they can't even see who you're walking by herself high horrible at the head of the parade you're just that was his point on a stroll that was his point and he said you're so far ahead and I said well I I don't know I'm just doing what I feel is right and he said slow down your way too far ahead\nThat was the best advice he ever gave me I never listened to him or a ... who is good advice and I think you know when we were talking people used to say all the time why are you talking about Martin Luther king why are you talking about Martin Luther king when we went to Birmingham I said I Want everybody here I Want you to sign that that Martin Luther king thing\nWell there was nobody shouting us down there was nobody doing that and I said on stage\nThere will be there will be\nThere's going to come a time soon where you're going to have to\nDecide there will be these times in our future and you have to decide now we're just ahead imagined doing or imagined doing a rally now we were afraid of the restoring honor rally because if you remember right\nThe black Panthers were going to come and they were going to engage us well the black Panthers joined with ah with Al Sharpton and they tried\nThey just marched through they didn't cause trouble they just marched through and we let them go and\nThere's video of people saying good things as they're saying bad things to us we're saying good things to them now at the time it wasn't like ... in Portland\nAnd add to fall wasn't there\nIf you do a rally and is peaceful and and to fall comes to attack and and we're the ones and we don't oh my gosh what am I saying God and we don't turn away we don't\nAnd we don't oh my gosh what am I saying good God and we don't turn away we don't raise a fast\nThat's a different story now than one that people want to hear because people are believing the media anymore and they're seeing these words come out of there are Democrats I'm telling you all over the country\nThat say look I maybe I Believe and abortion but I don't believe in that\nI don't believe in partial birth abortion I don't believe in hey abortion should be you know you should be proud of it go shouted it's great there's nothing wrong with it no\nNormal people look at that\nOn the Democratic side I mean the voter that lives next to you they look and say look I don't want to be involved in those decisions but you know I I'm I don't agree with that I don't agree with that out of compassion medical\nBecause I don't know people situation yes but if that's your version of the pill\nAnd your proud of it that's a problem that's who America is and they're looking\nThey're looking for a movement they're looking for someone they can stand with who just won't call balls and strikes who are not going to say yeah that's right when Donald Trump tweet something\nStupid to say if it's stupid I don't agree with that\nBut when he does something right yeah I did that look\nThat huh call balls and strikes that's where America is\nThe first thing we have to do is come together behind those principles I don't care if you are on the Democratic side of the Republican side or the independence of I don't care I don't care who you voted for in the past I don't care what you believed in the past\nWhat do you believe now do you believe we're on the ropes do you believe this system of government is worth saving do you believe this this capitalism is worth saving do you believe the the scientific method is worth\nSaving great than let's stand together and put our\nOur differences of approach aside because we've got a lot of work to save this thing right now\nBy the way and Gavin has already been silenced on Twitter and invoices don't start coming together a lot more going to be silenced what was it five or six hundred in\nA worse islands last week from Facebook and I don't see anybody talking about him and say anybody talking about and that kind of came and went to ... days no big deal [noise] sixty million followers [noise]\nJust disconnected from the voices that they were following last week and sixty
