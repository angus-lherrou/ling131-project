might be an interesting idea to re install or just to make sure it's not that so there's a there's a few things [laughter]\nA of a handful of things among the probably hundreds that could have gone wrong this is the problem we have these operating systems we use today are so hideously complex\nThat things can go wrong in so many different places it's not always easy to figure out what's happening to certain amount of I think there's a certain amount of intuition that goes into solving problems like this and that intuition is built up over years of of solving problems like this I mean Microsoft's own issues I mean\nIt seems to me maybe I'm a maybe I'm asking too much seems to me that if you make an operating system and uh\nAnd you've tested for six months with millions of people uh you would you would not have a problem that it deletes hundreds of gigabytes of files when it gets updated\nYou would catch that but that's that's a problem stuff's so complicated windows runs on so many different kinds of hardware\nI'm very curious to find out what it is it caused this book I don't know if we'll ever know sometimes Microsoft's cagey about they don't like to talk about problems so it may be that or maybe they mentioned but I'd like to know\nWhy would why would an installer upgrading an operating system just routinely go into your documents folder and delete stuff\nThat shouldn't happen [laughter] [laughter] that\nShit and opiates should be able to write files and ... should be able to write files or you know they have in the past what's really weird is that\nYou said that it's if he doesn't work you try again and it does or your ... and it does that's really weird\nI almost always and I should probably be so way but I almost always suspect the hard drive and cases like that and the reason I Do and the reason I mentioned in his heart tribes are usually the first thing they have problems on a system\nA because in in you know a lot of the older system that's moving part those drives you know there are spinning\nThousands of revolutions minute\nTo get hot they get cold as it turned off and they get hot again which means they expand and contract it's actually amazing that hard drives work at all [noise] solid state drives people were very worried about the cell is straight flash\nMemory base drives that they wouldn't be as robust as spinning hard drives which now as if you think about it seems laughable 'cause they're much more robust we just we just didn't know [laughter] remember\nThe experience we're ... we're afraid they would wear out\nPrematurely\nBut uh I don't think that's the case so another great fix for this kind of thing is to replace that spinning\nDrives that older spinning drive for the new solid state Dr used to be they were very very pricey\nPrices have gone down there not quite as inexpensive as spinning drives his first\n...\nFiber optics move crazy amount of data and even crazier speed and fight us by the

grows a murder worldwide on the Web it is murdered his money program money chalk Barbara girl oh you're just a new segment as older miserably over his new book is the ...\n... who teaches digital marketing at the University of California older thank you for joining us which bridges have you with us\nThanks for having those while you wrote this book you know when you look out there today I feel like everybody feel it feels like everybody's part of the gig economy we're familiar with things like liver and up work that we look beyond that and we start to see that\nReally any on demand services are project based services that can be provided by anyone a part of the gig economy when we start to see how really big it is and I wanted to give people a leg up a way to get chosen in the nature of work\nBut we used as a Russian and uses expression in your book the gig economy tell us what is meant to get on them\nSo the gig economy truly come back to thinking of something as a gig right like might think of all the addict gig so something that has project thing\nSomething that is temporary project faith or on demand services that can be provided by anyone and when we think about it in terms of the United states is just ugly we might think of it in terms of ten Ninety nine labor at the cheap labor\nAt a company gives its customers are employees or business partners and we look at that and we say what benefit minus cost a lot of times the cost isn't really money\nUnique value proposition says hey what is it that you are able to provide that someone is not willing to provide or doesn't provide as well and that's the ... and so the idea of why someone she knew in particular is incredibly\nImportant when it comes to understanding the gig economy and how to thrive in it because you want to not only get chosen once you want to get chosen again and again and again\nIt certainly seems when you when you look at the world of the show does pay for it it's so in recent years\nBut it certainly uh I mean for the common sense would tell you that well this has been great for entrepreneurship that this is really generated ... or ... of a of a revival though to renew were shipped issues that were\nI think it's interesting because in some cases you can look at the gig economy is kind\nOf like a mini step towards entrepreneurship right out of a sudden I'm working independently I'm working for myself and I can see if like how I stuck up against buffet other ... other people on care dot com or something like that but at some point\nEven the gig are themselves will start to hire out or even before they become yourself a gig or you may become comfortable using something like ... so you're actually becoming part of the gig economy without necessarily hear yourself\nUp putting yourself out there as a gig\nAnd as you get more comfortable with this starts to proliferate and we start becoming more comfortable all of a sudden we see on both sides not only am I putting myself out there let's say on air being be as a as a or B and the host or an experience host but also I myself I'm going out there and using those services whether it's\nLift all ... all those are the most popular enough science and I think it's it's hard to understand that beyond that were in the list of the world there are hundreds and hundreds of apps\nThat specialize in very specific types of gigs so if I Want to get a massage or something for that\nIf I Want to you know find somebody that shows\nOr something very specific I can find something for that so yeah the whole thing if there's an app for that certainly applies to the gig economy as well\nFergus is older is running out of University of California and her new book is the giggles up thrive in the gig economy where a jobs are obsolete freelancing is the future where you shoot the whole group re losing is the future\nI think that when we think of jobs in terms of job security I think that's what's missing now so regardless of whether I'm a freelancer on a traditional worker\nThe surveys show that those groups don't feel very secure in that position so if I was promised the gold watch pension and I no longer have that\nThen what's my alternative so that's why I say freelancing is the future of this idea that you constantly now have to and want to quite frankly keeps your skills updated\nAnd be the best person to choose for that job going forward and then I Do you get chosen again and again and again on those teams so it's not like you're constantly having to pick up everything from scratch pick up everything from scratch they just make those relationships and have those great teams that move forward and move you forward\nOlder you don't have a chapter the discussions reviews rejection and retention till the little bogus\nOlga you have a chapter that discusses reviews rejection and retention until this little about this\nYes so fast and there's nothing that puts more fear and especially a small business owner heart but I'm sure also all of us because we now all get reviewed whether it's a Lincoln recommendation\nFor the other way now how do you have I get rich on whether my places even as\nA passenger right if you are a passenger of an over you actually get reviewed by those taxi drivers\nAnd so all of a sudden there's this new I don't know where everybody's getting ready and is that going to lead to people behaving maybe a little bit nicer possibly possibly I'll tell you one thing that has a seismic shift\nThere is a company right now outside of Washington DC called snack work and they actually higher so the company itself flat hires college students and then contracts with restaurant industry and hospitality industry in the area so let's say five guys burger and\nSo now as a student I can pick up a couple of chef at five guys I show up that five guys isn't my employer snack or as my employer so everything goes out so I'm showing up for my shift and my five guys uniform and at the end of my shift is what flour to rate my manager\nTo review my manager I don't know any other time and our existence that this has been happening yeah this is something brand now\nWhether reviews go both ways changing\nWorld for sure our guest is Olga ms right of the University of California her new book the gay goes up the rise in the gig economy we're taking your calls for Olga\nAt one eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one good time to call his right now one eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one and you can speak directly to ... he\nAnd um discuss her new book the gig is up driving the gig economy\nWhere old jobs are slowly and freelancing is the future your questions for Olga when we return one eight hundred Ninety three four forty to

or one thirty six eighty nine\nA specifically on the topic of baby boomers and the gig economy because what we're finding is that a lot of boomers are coming to where they don't they don't feel secure in how much retirement\nThey possibly have or they don't feel secure and the fact that\nThey'll still have like they want to keep on working but they don't know how to keep on working and part of it I think about is the stigma you know when we look at what contract\nWorker was thought of as right and in some cases still is but I'm seeing it less and less and less and when we think of a contract\nWorker within in an environment even a corporate environment they were really thought of as left then right like\nI don't know how many times I went in and it was the broken chair and um you know good luck finding an office supply and good luck getting invited to the meeting right but now it's a lot better with the tools that are available and I don't think there's the stigma as much anymore as there was in terms of going towards um the contract work\nSo to answer your original question I don't know if\nIt's possible to turn back those kinds of time and I think there are some opportunities here as far as getting to be known for what your best shot and hopefully establish yourself almost as your own brand so that you feel secure going forward and what you do\nWell things are changing ... as you well know probably better than most I Need to ask you do we need to rethink ... benefits because of the gig economy\nThat is such an excellent question\nNeed to rethink ... benefits because of the gig economy\nThat is such an excellent question you know you you hear somebody like Iran mosque out there and they they would like for us to have\nKind of like a living social wage because and it's not just this idea of the gays economy it's also automation right this idea that you know by some statistics Ninety percent of all jobs will be automated out or through artificial intelligence be be put to that place we don't really know what's going to\nHappen because you know every time we think we know something else happens and innovation happens and and other things kind of show themselves but at some point we may look at it and say okay well if Ninety percent of our workforce if this is true right that Ninety percent of our workforce will look differently\nDoesn't make sense to have a different type of social safety net so that people have a living wage regardless of whether robots doing their job or not and that will be an interesting conversation kind of going forward I can tell you that where we are today they're still very much a need for humans\nAre just as old room is right at the University of California or new book the gig as a thriving the gig economy we're all jobs are obsolete freelancing is the future\nWill you know back in ... if you'd been around a while and you were making good money\nThey used to call you consult has it changed\nIn some ways yes because the consultant moniker\nThat also meant that you were your own business right like you had a small business you are the one that was responsible for marketing you were the one that was out there getting that work whereas now as a consultant I I can choose to be on a platform such as up work\nAnd let my work speak for itself and let that marketplace Dr\nKind of the pairing of the work to the consultant\nSo it's it's changed a little bit\nOf a chapter of moving from freelancer too employer pillow so little about the concept\nThe concept really comes down to this idea that at some point if you're thinking like an entrepreneur then certain parts of your\nTime are more valuable spent doing something else so unless you get particular joy in you know picking up dog poop and walking your dog then maybe you think to yourself you know what if\nI hire somebody to be a dog Walker twice a day I can focus on this project\nAnd I can earn more by focusing on this project so that's just one small example of how you might hire a good worker to further your own time but there are you know dozens if not\nHundreds of examples like that where it might make sense to do that and we're seeing that for everything you know something that was maybe was previously only reserved for\nThe super rich or you know I think just this weekend I saw a girlfriend of mine who's a mom you know jet out to Vegas with Mike Tyson on a ... a a jet that was a partial jet like basically something that you get on an app\nTo get out kind of like a a a lift or Hoover but for jets and I was thinking to myself oh my gosh isn't that different than a mom's a girl's fun weekend to Vegas with a bunch of moms now includes a jet and Mike Tyson like when did that happen [laughter]\nWell I have to ask you a ... iron might get involved in this\nHeat [laughter] well all that's all\nBoy like there that the fact that there is a basically a platform or an app that allows you to buy a seat on a private jet and you might be sitting next to anyone including Mike Tyson is a is definitely\nA seat on a private jet and you might be sitting next to anyone including Mike Tyson is a is definitely I opening\n... was accidental but it happened to be on the plane or a a trip that he was actually because it ...\nIt's like it's like as if you order to taxi and all the taxi shows up and Mike Tyson's already in the taxi but then it starts with a jet [laughter]\nIs that ... that is so is there enough that I can use to a wind up sitting next to describe ...\nI Believe it's called ...\n[laughter] that's true that's true or out for me or you have a chapter and you just touched on time management you have a chapter the things you're not going to think about time management is one of them almost a little about that\nI think that when you work for yourself and especially when you get into where you're doing this a lot uh so you're either doing multiple side gigs or fight our souls or you have one main kind of gig [noise]\nIt's very easy to lose yourself in this concept of just being lonely you know we sometimes take for granted water cooler talk and being able to just\nTalk to somebody in the morning or over a cup of coffee or whatever and when you're constantly divided by your laptop screen even though you might be sitting at a Starbucks right or you might be sitting in your home office it's sometimes difficult to\nCombat the loneliness in that respect and also time management because now nobody's going to be looking over your shoulder to say oh you just spent the last two hours on Facebook [laughter] right it's up to you\nOn whether you got kind of stuck down that rabbit hole of fake news or if you um actually focused on your project and worked at through so you know all of a sudden we have to be a little bit more adult\nAnd how we treat our time and luckily there are tools for that whether they're on your phone or your laptop or even within your browser like there is um a there are several pills for your browser depending on which one is that you can actually block social media during certain times so that you're not tempted\nTo uh to follow what all your friends are doing and get a serious case of phone no fear of missing out\nSo as a as the gig economy has contributed to a freelancers needing special services words is going\n[noise] yeah so you know it's still in its infancy but I noticed that as of last year um there was a couple of bipartisan senators one being tired of mark\nWho looked at something by the name of portable benefits this idea that hey if I Am constantly changing from a\nYou know the type of work and my employers not always the same how can I keep my benefits relatively constant\nSo there's there's that there's um a new type of insurance put out by the freelancers union\nThat is more like a disability type insurance says rather than like an hour flak where it's a particular employer and you know you hurt yourself on the way to work well what happens if you're a freelancer and you hurt yourself in on the way to work you know ... where is that safety net so we're starting to see kind of products like that emerged\nUm in terms of insurance and that's not to mention like a bunch of other types of services whether it's food delivery or you know getting your nails done or you know who knows what other services that might also cater\nTo a freelance workforce but those particular ones caught my eye because they're fairly universal and the needs that we all have from an insurance standpoint\nOr a toll on Monday talk less mystic awesome\nSo and the needs that we all have from an insurance standpoint\nOlder a toll on Monday talk listeners across America oh what you would like them to take away from your book the gig is\nTo not be scared\nYou can do it when you go out there you have an individual unique contribution to give and I'm so looking forward to

little little tiny chip on the mother board size of a grain of rice there are lots of chips on your\nMother what is the big circuit board on the computer\nSometimes they call it the logic board it's a ... little little support\nChips on they're not just the microprocessor and the graphics processors but there's little little tiny chips there you know amplifiers and things and they snuck it in there I think it it appeared as a some sort of support ship but instead it was according to the story\nModifying the operating system once it will you know the operating system booted up on these mother boards on these computers\nModified it took to phone home to fall on the Chinese military and to X filled trade secrets and to to take you know be under the command of the Chinese military I mean there's a terrifying notion and of course since most of our electronics are built in China\nParticularly terrifying and Bloomberg Businessweek had it well sourced than the next day on friday apple and

you've been answering the phone since the wee hours of the morning preparing\nActually there's only one [laughter] yeah but what\nAre we going to say that but I was leaving a cheater lives are always call football ... if you will kill us\nThough I Love football but\nFortunately real nerds don't like sport bowl no they don't do all your real listen you know call yeah ...\nWho should I [laughter] if I didn't know who should I talked to talk to them are [laughter] Okay Mark in Santa Ana okay how he's able to listen to Kelly online or you know hardly ... were on I found\nOut the other day or\nSomething like two hundred eighty stations across the country yeah not all of them are playing football plus now this thing called the Internet where you ... you know you can hear the show anywhere in the world\nYeah surely in Bulgaria and they're not playing NFL games on it I mean well anyway here we go mark hello mark from Santa\nAna who's listening but he also calls we can sing camp songs together [laughter] I hear crickets [laughter]\nAnyhow and by the way I'm betting here that Microsoft thing as a compiler\nA compiler air\nYeah think about what it basically is I think is doing is just doing a ... a a a not an upgrade but you know how they have the advanced in regular and one is wipe out all your stuff\nMaybe somebody pushed the wrong button there saying click click the wrong check mark\nEither that or you know like if you've done enough uh programming to know that sometimes the compiler decides to do something unplanned\nYeah [noise] so you would think I mean if that's the case\nWouldn't some body of running at least once before saying here have it everybody somebody must have noticed that I Know I Know Microsoft has lots of testing that I just it's very hard to imagine what went wrong the real problem Microsoft has\nIs that unlike apple where you know there's a handful of ... of machines run apple or all of the run ... macro with all of a made by apple so they know the testings fairly easy with Microsoft there's thousands of PC manufacturers every\nMachine has had some sort of different ... configuration of hardware and other programs running on it and you're installing a a challenging thing which is to install a big upgrade on an on an in place operating system so\nIt is not an easy thing to do and I think what's happened probably more likely is it worked it worked for me were for most people some people had some sort of odd thing oddball thing around and that uh somehow interacted poorly with the installer I mean you're right the installer shouldn't have done that but\nIt's very slow as uncle you'll always says there's so many millions of combinations said problem and and anybody is two hundred or whatever gig data loss is big news\nWell it is but yeah that's right ... when you have a billion users if even one one thousand to one percent of them have problems is that thousands of people so yep\n[noise] um okay so my question is is got an Android two fifty six gig um essay\nAnd I would like to just download all my email on it and be able to search it nicely the only problem is so far I've tried a couple of different email programs and about every twenty to thirty emails I gotta say download show more show more shy\nThan that's not the email program or you're using Gmail\n[noise] uh no this is actually a go daddy daddy\nIt's not the email programs fault it's something go daddy's doing while email servers do this because they don't want you to hit the server real hard to say give me all fourteen gigabytes in my email now\nSo they uh throttle it and they say well you can have a certain number of messages at a time\n[noise] ah so that's I mean that's really all what's going on or it's not so you can try you know Android email program so you're blue in the face and it and you still have the same problem because it's not the\nProgram itself it's it's go daddy and mail servers doing it or how do you get around it I don't know I mean I Would I generally will first of all I'm map\nWhich is probably the protocol you're using yes a\nIsn't really designed for downloading the emails designed for cashing in than what's on the server but the server is the definitive store and that's not on you\nAh isn't really designed for downloading the emails 'cause I'm for cashing and what's on the server but the server is the definitive store and that's not on your phone or computer anything is on your premises it's on the\nUh the the ... you know the email providers premises so that is you ... you know I met president really designed for you to download anything it just caches it so if you really want to download and you should investigate where and I bet you this is the case that go daddy server will support pop three\nWhich is the old member post office protocol that allows you to download all the mail and find a a pop three\nOr Android email programs that will support pop three uh I don't know if canine will do it that's the most um [noise] that's the most powerful email tap I Know of on Android K dash nine it's open source it probably support yes supports pop so would you put it in pop mode you use the pop server\nFor go daddy instead of the IMF server and then you download it may still um say all you can only have twenty but tomorrow you can get twenty more tomorrow after after that day after that and over time you can gather all the mail basically that's what pub threes designed for pop St ... the older\nPolitical was designed for you to log into your mail server clean it out and then a\nAnd B that was because her dress bases expensive and and ISPs didn't want to keep your mail nowadays because we have many devices the ISP keeps your mail and the devices are just a window into the servers that makes sense\nYeah real quick thing yeah yeah if you don't have any more callers one quick thing about football I was a a dinner for my wife's work and we're like five couples and I said I Can't watch football it's two Thirteen minutes compressed into two and a half to three hours my wife and I think I have time to cuddle or\n[laughter] it's not merely engaging
