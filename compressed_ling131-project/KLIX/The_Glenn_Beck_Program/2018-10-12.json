Donald Trump I helped write the tax plan with my buddy Larry cuts us off but I\nI just disagree with this policy I don't see the wisdom and steal an auto and aluminum terrorists or auto terrorists but especially not steel and aluminum 'cause you know we have something like a hundred thousand Americans who are employed and steal an auto\nBut we've got six million other manufacturers who use\nSteel and aluminum and what they produced I was over it and how is your Bush a\nCouple of weeks ago they you know when they make a you know\nBudweiser is they're using a lot of aluminum for those cans and they showed their prices are going up and you judge that's going on\nAround the country our auto producers are autos are more expensive because the steel towers so my point to Trump is this is an even creating factory jobs were going to lose factory jobs as a result of this so I disagree very strongly with the steel and aluminum tariffs I think they do more harm than good\nDoes he look like he's softening\nNow do you think\nI don't see I don't see it either green respond to them as soon as you know he's not you know and I think at\nThe rose garden last week he said how he would Brett boasting about how all the steel jobs were created it's true we are creating steel jobs Mr President but we're losing jobs we're losing you know jobs in uh in other areas that manufacture a quip meant trucks and things you know those kinds of things that they use steel aluminum so\nIt's a it's a dumb policy I Wish you would reverse it and by the way the ... same thing even the U.S auto industry that's what the terrorists you know there's so many of those supplies Tom from you know a country's abroad you know there's there was manufacture you know ... steel might've come from a\nYou know Canada about the assembly might have come from Mexico the the parts might have come from Taiwan I mean there's just this is the modern American\nAnd global economy at work and and we put ourselves at risk

happened right about this time in two thousand sixteen right about now if you have to ... eighth or ninth in September eleventh that I uh and that by the time the election came as we saw had\nBasically no impact on news ... I mean this stuff goes away fast and I think there will I don't think this is because\nBecause it's not just Kavanaugh\nIf they would've yeah left it alone leclaire Williams\nBut they're not they're doubling down Hillary Clinton yesterday we can't live with these people I'm a Eric Holder comes out that the news today that he says when when they go low we kick them and the crowd cheers and this and he follows it with this is who the new Democratic Party is\nAmazing amazing Michelle Obama pushed back on that today by the way it kind of an interesting way\nUm but you know what you see I think is if you are under control you can make these stories go away their craziness in the cabinet thing could probably be forgotten by a lot of voters if you look at it from the time that Donald Trump came down to the escalator to today\nProbably his cleanest month was October two thousand sixteen after that that a tape came out he was buttoned up\nThe rest of that time and made very few statements and wound up winning the election um because people were able to kind of forget about you know started this crazy innocent scandals that were going on and look more Hillary Clinton in her craziness and scandals\nIf they ... they could get it to go away doing things like we're going to kick them when they're when they go low a and a few people saying that's not a mob what are you talking about that sort of stuff is not going to help them\nNo ... and so far since the Kavanaugh saying what we've seen is really encouraging numbers for the ... particularly in the Senate the Senate has a you know we had a lot of reasons we talked about the um Robert Francis overall versus a Ted Cruz situation\nWhere Cruz or that poll came out of fifty two forty three and a nine point lead know Cruz had been there was one poll I think that had them tied\nA few ... most of them settled around three or four points would cruise leading um that's expanded in multiple polls now to a new ten points I used to be more than nine or ten point yeah the fat grey who are who are not in here with us today but he was talking on his show or he goes yesterday the day before\nBelieves that it's going to be over ten points you know I think it'll be ... I think it will be between fourteen in Eighteen points to another interesting poll that came out yesterday again from the New York times and this is the other during his life\nPulling thing I mentioned uh last hour how many calls as it takes to get seven hundred and Seventy eight responses in Texas how many calls you have to make to get seven hundred and Seventy eight people to talk on the phone to you the number\nFifty one thousand one hundred and Ninety two oh my God they had to call fifty one thousand people to get seven hundred and Seventy eight to actually participate in the poll which isn't good well you're calling Texas\nA and if it's march with a New York ... number one the New York times\nI understand that ah I mean it's this is ... over all the like for example York they do they also polled the eastern Long Island district New York one\nAre and what they found a five hundred and two responses they had to make twenty seven thousand one hundred and Seventy ... or you answer and seriously do you know anybody that would take the time to answer that nobody does and that I wouldn't you know again if you take into account that factor which is totally changed over the last Twenty years with cell phones and and uh telemarketers and all those things\nIt's amazing these guys get even close to accurate results from polls because your self selecting a group of\nPeople who want to participate him and it's a you know who knows if they're represented Google Home should include some sort of an F MRI so they can just read our brains and that would make it a lot of making a lot easier to come to your door that yeah I\nWanted to um another interesting poll that came out of there are times though however a was a protest of the Taylor Swift effect\nRemember Taylor Swift after all these are all the time being silent on on politics decided to dive into it inexplicably they ridiculously ... you know again like you almost feel like with her PR team if you're going to come out and do this at least have like sensible observations and don't be just a bumper sticker\nYou know a ... you know quote tweeting Huffington Post write like that was the level of analysis she provided in her little post but again she's one of the biggest celebrities in the world how does this happen I she's from Tennessee she came out in Tennessee race the biggest thing that she talked about was Marsha Blackburn saying how anti women she was and\nAnd how she didn't care about this she wanted to keep gaze at of stores and all these ridiculous things that aren't true I'm the first of all come out since that um and ... the most of the ... calls were uh after that\nUh fifty four to forty Blackburn leads fourteen points this was a race that within the tossup category wow now that polling holds I can get ... ah safely or understand that more people care about what Kanye West things about politics than Taylor Swift but we'll see if that holds or not\nSo we could look at\nSenate possibly a red wave in the Senate yeah I think you know so we talked about this a little while ago to ... cents people know that where the Supreme Court is happening and also people who are in red states right and they're going to become more excited to vote more\nThe house we're seeing sort of a slight turn to the opposite effect wear purple districts um sometimes it it has been a little bit little a little more blue\nNot much to tell from it I think already the houses in real real danger I mean I it would be a surprise at this point if the Republicans were able to pull out the house not impossible it would be a surprise\nUm uh but for the Senate real quick we had ten tossup races that we were talking about before\nUm and I believe it was three or four that the ... the Republicans had to win took control of a sudden I think it was three that with three of the tent at the time we talked about it but Ted Cruz race which in which he was favored by only three points with the best\nCase best case right now that's changed dramatically since we talked about that a couple of weeks ago now I'm a Ted Cruz seems to be on solid ground uh and more than a three point lead\nA Heidi Heitkamp seems to be in massive\nDanger I Would say it looks like two races were decided with the Kavanaugh hearings barring some other may major development ah Heidi Heitkamp voted against him she looks like she's toast and Arthur in North Dakota now a Joe Manchin voted for having all he looks like he's safe\nSo those two races are not even in the ... category anymore in my mind\nA ... and need to really is the cruise one which gets you down to about seven toss ups which the Republicans need to win one one of the seven will keep the Senate in Republican hands is is much improved situation\nFrom even when it was just a couple of weeks ago the cabinet I think I think is a big part of it or we don't know that for sure yet I think I Will play out in the next week or so when we really have a lot of results but it looks very promising in the Senate better than it's probably all year or so that's a that's a good thing if you care about that ... let me let me explain something this election\nCould be in that\nI Know I Know technically we have three branches of government but I Believe we kind of had five we have the press and the people okay via the executive legislative\nUm and a judicial are the three in the constitution then you have the fourth which is the press and the people I Believe what happens in this election could put all five branches\nInto chaos if they win the house the house will go nuts\nAnd they will impeach they will subpoena which those subpoenas we'll go to the Senate the Senate will be in chaos because of it because of the Democrats\nThey will put the administrative in chaos because it will be under impeachment and it will also ah have testimony that it has to give that it will fight to they're going to subpoena his tax records he will fight that which will go into the Supreme Court\nWhich the people will rise up and destabilize the fifth ranch if you will the people as they stand up\nAnd they're starting to fight kind of back and forth in the streets you know not in a mob sort of way and just in in ... sort of way\nThey will the house will then again I think tried to impeach Kavanaugh or at least get him to recuse himself from anything having to do with the administration you watch it on ... and ... and the press has already in chaos\nAll every piece of society could be in chaos based on this election\nGoing to be a fun couple of years I mean

[noise]\nBy the way I have to squeeze in today remind me do I want to start a a a pro millennia Trump's\nUh I don't know group\nSomething I don't know she is she is she is the the most elegant first lady we have had since Jackie oh she's not been on any cover of any magazine she has and nobody says anything nice about her\nNobody says out of all I it's incredible that when she was when she was out just recently last last week in Africa\nAnd it was a Ralph Lauren photo shoot it was on some of the most beautiful photos she was in Egypt in front of the in front of the uh pyramids it was in trouble so beautiful so tasteful nothing\nYou know it's not a major issue obviously per se as compared to others but what I honestly think it is the most ... your example we had a media bias it is in my book\nThat's the McDonald's French fries\nI ever what I'm saying you don't remember that part I said if everybody says they hate McDonalds okay that's fine\nBut if you can remember that you like their French fries or that they make them drink as\nFrench fries and they do and then you have no credibility millennia Trump is the McDonald's French fry I'm shocked you brought it to fast food yeah OK lane got we got to talk about 'cause it's a good soggy uh\nTell me about this guy this Saudi citizens been disappeared I'm always I'm always amazed how the media does all the stops doing any kind of journalism like like I see the stories are riding and I'm like this is not what I Would be writing about at all for one yes this is like a Quentin Tarantino style movie it's\nAmazing really is yeah I absolutely think the Saudis are guilty on this I think turkey is probably over playing what they do have\nProbably just a little bit ...\nBut um but everyone's framing this this this uh this journalist ... as this great guy\nNobel Prize winning oh yeah he's got to be she'll be a Nobel Peace prize winner soon he came out so surprise surprise he really came to prominence the ... the media loved him the west loved him during the Obama administration uh why was that because well he was one of these one's advocating\nUm I don't know how they're framing it he was friends he was he was ... he loved the crown prince they got along and and he said a lot of great things about the crown prince now he disagrees with some of the crown prince his policies and that's where they've wants to take the Saudi out of Saudi Arabia\nBasically that's the best way to put it for this guy\nBut he's a he's not a good guy he wants to political Islam he wants political Islam to invade countries all over the world and take it over and he was living here for quite a while before he went to work at Washington Post yeah\nNo no issues there whatsoever I'm I'm On the other hand you have this one guy that's not that great of a guy even on the other hand you have a mom and been summoned the crown prince\nWho ever want to send this is this great reformer he he he's a great guys agree we're going to modernize Saudi Arabia women can drive now all these social is all these tackling\nHe they dug plain and simple he is eight Doug they go after he's doing this to tons and tons of people thousands of people in his own country people just disappear they go to jail for the rest of the life he is a thug\nAnd the only reason he's tackling social issues is because they have a lot of young people in Saudi Arabia and social unrest of the doubt that hit the streets have you want to see the place for the next uh Arab Spring might happen Saudi Arabia they the demographics point to it I Would not be surprised\nRight all so how do you keep Saudi Arabia under control do without a thug you can't I mean it's like Russia really either rights groups like other countries like that you really can't here's a disturbing part\n... most likely most likely this guy was killed by Saudi Arabia yeah um it just it just feels like a man and maybe all of a sudden he pops up and I'm like\nNo I was a chick fillet and nobody in the media wants to look at chick fillet so I was invisible for a while\nMaybe doubtful here's the problem we are we are pushing through a major arms deal with Saudi Arabia we should not be doing that now we should not be doing that that should be canceled today I can tell you however what is being what is happening\nIs you know the United states was supporting the Muslim Brotherhood now we have some people who know exactly what's going on in that part of the world and they're probably being talked to by Saudi Arabia go and look look guys guys\nYeah I Know you don't like what we're doing here but uh it's the Muslim Brotherhood and its a caliphate you what you want the whole region to be in the Muslim Brotherhood caliphate have\nAt it you know and that's the decision our president is is having to make it's why we should stay out of other people's business is a man stay out of their business\nCan I make a production yeah so I think that Saudi Arabia will eventually own up to this because I think the evidence will come after them I think they'll they'll blame a very familiar a photo and they'll say it's the deep state the beach they did this no shelter salmon get him out of them\nRight I was a little bit of our rescue dot org\nAre rescue dot org go there and uh and make it under the name of hunter Kelly and make a donation now thanks hunter God

movie all the time really all of my gosh it's so frightening because you know\nKids when they go into their teenage years their bodies are changing and everything else and they you know they started not listening to mom and dad and ... out of all the\nUsual stuff okay but now it's like you know ... ... you could lose them overnight and I need to lose them with depression rates the way they're going\nWith all of this influence that they can get I'm just so freaked out all the time and I can't believe that I'm Alone oh you\n... I'm sure you're not alone yeah like I was you know basically the perfect child as my mom would Fouche uh for\nFor my mother had died she would say say figure out I'm sure I'm a you know but it's it's ... you're right it gets dark fast I think the ... control really fast with with social media and stuff\nOr you know I I don't know how I don't know how to even contemplate dealing with that\nYeah I mean I you know your your kids seem like they're pretty\nI don't know how I don't know how to even contemplate dealing with that but yeah I mean I Know your your kids seem like they're pretty pretty good shape I mean the only thing I Want you to believe upstanding young people\nHave it you know that I mean my son is now going he's got testosterone you know pumping through his body\nAnd you know I just it's it's frightening I guess because I remember what I was like I remember how I felt ally was moody and everything else and\nAnd now [noise] you know what's real what's not what's it's just so hard and I you know I said to my son I said to my son last night we were having a conversation and I said\nSo what are\nWhat are the two words 'cause he was talking himself down and I said\nStop stop listened to yourself\nAnd he said what and I said listen to what you're creating listen to what you're saying and I gave him the dad I Am speech that I've said how many times have you here at one more time my gosh you're going to kill yourself ... hundred times on the air you say that this I started in this and I said you know this and he said\nI don't [laughter] and I I ...\nOh my gosh am I not told you this if you haven't told your own kids but you're told the national radio over and over and over again and I realized that there are some things that we just think our kids here and because there are around us they just know they're going to pick up\nI mean he's in American history right now\nAnd you know he probably knows more than some kids are most kids on a lot of things\nBut things are big gaping holes and I realized how much of my time with my son do I think he gets it through us most is somehow or another you know just because he's living here and blah blah blah\nAnd he hears me give speeches and he hears me on the radio and here's a blah blah blah\nHe's\nThere we it's maybe it's just me I don't know if if I'm just going through this\nBut my gosh you have to be very very specific and watch what you're saying to your kids and and be with them all the time and what's frightening is the influence is so strong and so sexy on the outside\nThat it's the draw that they're just the you're just black and white that everything else is color yeah\nI ah I mean one suggestion is a he was a Jodie Foster movie panic room and she was she did is she was able to lock herself in the room and have no outside influences at all and I think like some kind of like the editor I ...
