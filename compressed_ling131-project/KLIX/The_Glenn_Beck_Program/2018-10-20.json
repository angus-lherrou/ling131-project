Republicans in these big high profile races you know presidency and things like that\nI mean ... I'm a famously I'm outraged everybody in the universe and you know Donald Trump spent like nothing on his campaign twenty six team yeah it's a it's an under told stories of that election Hillary the if the idea if it's true that you can buy elections Hillary Clinton absolutely what if one but she had way more money far\nMore resources or because you know Donald Trump\nDidn't throw up a lot of his own money into the race\nThey they just ran it on a shoestring promote much at the time and they were still able to win it kind of\nJust proves every liberal theory about money in politics\n'cause he was going and going on the theory that he didn't need anybody else's money so he didn't he sort of didn't try to fund raise much now I mean he ... he he raise some money and a little bit yeah and he used some of his own money but it wasn't like a billion dollars like she did know it wasn't even close um and this is a\nLike ... it you know part of that if he's a big celebrity right like he was a celebrity before he was a candidate so he's able to get a lot of TV Time for free and and everybody was covering him all the time you could see now I mean even after he's president that the media the media is absolutely obsessed with him as a person I I just\nThey cannot get enough of him talking about anything every single story\nYou know Saudi Saudi Arabia Mercer is all about Trump every story is all about Trump all the time I mean this is a foreign citizen who was living in America who was murdered in in a foreign embassy\nSpending bills which still find ways to get those throughout I'm sure of it but other than that you're gonna get any real advantage not getting any tax stuff you're you're going to be tough times with any regulation you're going to get ... you know none of this stuff is going to be easy as long as you keep running a massive deficit you'll get all those bills through yeah just\nJust keep spending money and they'll vote for it yeah\nYeah it's not a problem to show you the house and how dramatic it is at least by the polls look and I know you're going to say well the polls got the last thing wrong well some of it they got right a and a lot of it they got rights including the popular vote by the way which is what they were actually trying to predict in the national polls some of the staples were totally off though so we don't know what let's hope we're not sure\nBut right now the models are showing 'em there is a like a point one percent chance that the Democrats could pick up the eighty three seats\nNow it's a point one percent chance to really unlikely like you say\nThat's an absolute no what's that going to get to eighty three ... ... the models are also showing there's a point one chance for Republicans to hold the same amount of seats they have now it's that bad and environment at the same\nSame percentage chance the the crazy outlier possibility is Democrats plus eighty three Republicans pluses zero\nWhat is the chance of not holding the same amount of seats by keeping the majority about twenty percent they're saying about uh twenty percent chance they can keep the majority right now wow that balance out the same percentage chance that Democrats can get the Senate [laughter]\nSo I mean ... look and if they get the house if ... if all the Democrats do is get the house they're going to be able to launch investigations like crazy right\nThey are going to it's going to be a nightmare most certainly impeach they willing if each in right now we're going to be convicted no no the when I'm Alone or ... no chance of in ... they said unless something dramatic were to happen right\nBecause you have to get to is it sixty seven states pay and other stuff that are that I knew it was sixty seven seats in ... and they're not gonna get anywhere close to that even if they get the majority in the Senate they're not going to be able to do that but they will have a subpoena power\nThey will will they will Bob down the administration in constant investigations and look\nInvestigating something that's real is fine what they are going to do is not ... it's going to be ridiculous they're gonna investigate it'd be a nightmare you know there's a new story up today that Ivanka Trump may have committed a crime if you heard this you know\nBecause when she was promoting the sale of real estate or in a when she was back in the day and you know do her job was with the Trump Organization see she said things like wow this is a well this one's almost sold out and it was not almost sold out like were they saying like our new building in a in\nIn New York or you should get it now because it's almost sold out and in reality was only like twenty percent sold out now look there's a lot of us are great to be made\nIn New York you should get it now because it's almost sold out and in reality it was only like twenty percent sold out\nNow look there's a lot of guys the gate that he made right like you shouldn't say that because if someone's investing in the investigation and these wind up going bankrupt their demand you joke it's happening\n[laughter] believe it I Believe there was a huge report that came out from a left wing media sources should be going on in New York has investigated him a bunch of times already\nThey're going to go after the house and the Senate if they get control of it will have launched investigation after investigation after investigation and nothing\nWill happen in this girl dude investigation as to why Donald Trump doesn't talk about his daughter Tiffany as much

a ... millimeter sea fries or whatever it is\nFor a decade over the past hundred years because sea level rise is the thing that defines the last century yeah everyone's like oh my gosh I remember when there are a bunch of states to the west of South Carolina in North Carolina remember that now they're all under water that's what everyone will talk about when talking about the ... century now the wonderful advancements\nIn going back to you know uh to uh uh actually I'm giving their million and still not being enough it's never enough right I mean these companies it's never enough they give and we have the story about clean next rebranding their man sized issues\nBecause of the gender backlash yeah what did they do um the weather's been many people have complained meant in the story and from a can really clerk who was the maker of Kleenex um\nMany people have complained that man's size issues because it's offensive or sex right and inclusive yeah yeah\nSometimes if they're all complaining about uh you know lady foot locker to write like there's there are complaining about things that are designed specifically for women know\nAre you what they're trying to make fun\nOf it yeah and also I Do have a guy saying that ... the leader of the ... campaign\nMan [laughter]\nI've seen like how to do what is it\nI mean I honestly I honest question what what do ... what's the difference between a female to male tissue how does that work ... well\nLook there's a there's a difference because it's called man's size so she was later I assume yes it's bigger a bigger chess and it's and it's just is what it is\nAnd he actually said ... that's what they're calling it ... I like that term though yeah it's fun and clean extra so there's no way a way no way suggest that being a both soft and strong isn't exclusively mass\nGraves by you know away or say no way not only laying its Amanda ... math size branding a suggestion endorses gender inequality no way no way are keeping them in science they're just thinking that I as well they're going to keep the the actual product but they're going to you know ... the course they're going to re branded around what\nKleenex\nExtra large [laughter]\nNow that I ... I like to say this I Believe that's fat shaming I I I Want them to get that off that extra large stuff\nNo way I think you can strip I wanted to do I want you to complain colored headquarters ... I Want you to complain ... let's get him away from even the extra large cause yeah yeah\nWhat are you a triple quadruple extra large when you live that extra large is in the name yeah so in that sense of it is actually it is it is so I thought maybe I could you remember on\nA Dr Pepper ten\nWhich came out a few years ago yeah I still out I mean you could still have it and it's a ten calorie version is not quite diet\nWhich is zero salary be more for men right they that was their advertising campaign and they stopped at a ... for men yeah they were like and they made it was all brand is almost like an Old Spice commercial like it was like ... with all ... you know the guys with big muscles in doing crazy things lifting cars and all this stuff\nOut of it was just a funny joke he campaign I bet they wouldn't even do that today and I ... no way I haven't seen it or they don't even talk about Dr Pepper ten anymore do they I mean now I haven't seen before in a while it's still available and pretty\nOkay I'd be very interested to see what many people have ... equals 'cause they also say in the story from a Kimberly Clark that despite our consumer service registering consistent increase of compliance okay so what is that\nTo to to fight or or is it probably three people that are complaining more than once in ... I mean that's what has got to be a couple of people on\nTwitter said something Ryan and they freaked out right yeah but it's like a Pam on the office and they said uh she said I doubled my sales last month and someone said what a lot from two to four and she said yes [laughter]\nIt was you know to force that yes [laughter]\nIt's kind of what we're talking about yeah these are not real complaints I mean\nHow can you can always find someone to say something always get frustrated by these these are the news stories that come out of me like someone on Twitter said that they were upset and it's just like a a one person on Twitter finding someone to say any ... any oil and gas alone or head of the nation in the English language is not an achievement\nIt's certainly not a news story\nSo the idea that you can find some people who are going to be pissed off at ... I'm sure there is somebody some crazy person there's probably some organization that has decided this is going to be the thing of the day to make their donors feel good about themselves as if they've achieved something in life for reality this is not a real complaint people don't care\nPeople don't care if you like ... and then you make the man size thing right I'm right who cares\nAnd women could ... just like if we didn't want to do we could be I Would probably look good looked at funny\nIf they went through they will just or whatever of course not there is down side to this they'd be female shame too yeah it'd be looked at ... ... that's when you're not a man of ... that you can't you can't find that your money's good here [laughter]\nThat's the way it works they like your money do they do\nNot ... he went through a another transition and went back about ... just three or four transition that's going back to female let's just say I'm and you and you were then that would be\nA a larger female\nIf you were to transition back he'd be on the large side of the female scale that they'll be fair to see after a ... and you want it to go by now man sized tissues would this be offensive to you if you are now identifying as a woman very well could be\nI mean I Know that are\nReally really good to be able to be okay Hi what why at\nOne of the transitions when I was a female and again I was [laughter] you know a lot of ...

four months ago but for enrolling in financial ... feel like I made one of the worst mistake some a lot of [laughter] I was wondering if you could give me some advice on how\nIt would affect me if I were to return lease car to the dealership or at this point I just keep the vehicle or none of the above me take her car back that you own money on our signed a lease on\nThat's a fact of late a voluntary repossession and that that would be dumb because they're going to sell the car after they've repossessed it and\nUh they're anal repossession lot and then they're going to sue you for the difference if you don't pay them the difference immediately\nAnd you don't have the difference 'cause you're broke so I don't know that would be a dumb idea we're not going to do that [noise] um what we are going to do is find out two pieces of information one is called the car free ... company that you are paying the ... to ...\nAnd find out what the early buyout I'm ... now the early buyout is different than the total of your lease payments pleasure residual value at the end it should be less because you're these leases are very new and there should be it's kind of like an early pay off on the line\nWhen it doesn't include all the interest from\nThe time that the ... from keeping alone the whole time show the early buyout as your hourly pay off now\nNow that was what strikes by the car off and get the title in your hand then you compare that to KB dot com Kelley Blue book dot com private say what the car is actually worse\nAnd I'll just make up some numbers let's pretend that the early buyout is ...\nLook it up and the car is actually worse sixteen thousand that would leave you four thousand dollars in the whole ... probably not far off of what you're going to find\n... four thousand dollars in the home and you sell the car for Shakespeare again you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer and so\nUm you have to have that other four thousand dollars\nYou have to be able to cover the whole richer and the amount that you are upside down in the way you would do that is obviously alone and so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank and you get a loan lined up for the amount that you're upside down\nAnd you put the car up for sale and you sell the car for as much as you can possibly get for which is more than they will sell it for the report lot said bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the difference is greater and you do more damage to your life at least more control\nOf your life by doing a repossession and so you cover the difference cover the amount that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather you'll be four thousand dollars\nIn debt than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are so um they robes utility to borrow money no diversion telling you to move some of the dead and get rid

there's a motion sensor which I use but that's not going to that's not going to help you that that turns the lights on when I go in the room which I Love I don't I you know I I Would say I would look into this Philips lifeline technology it seems as\nIf it ought to since it does does detect\nFalls and it would be a great start to that the question is this automation peace and this is why it's been such a disappointment is you've got things to do things lots of them but they don't they don't seem to talk to each other very well\nAnd apple and Google have both you know push this idea of a hub you know the new Google a device is called the the Google Home hub Apple's got the er I ... you know the the a pod the home pod the whole idea\nIs these have you know radios in them to communicate with these devices the nice thing about you know Google stuff as you can do is you know an apple stuff you can do scenarios you can say goodnight you know apple and then ... the lives of doors locked lights all turned down\nOr off and all this stuff but I don't know if they get tired of the fall sensors\nTheir best bet is to is to is to look\nAt the Philips since it's the same company right they bring in the chat room ebony experience so what you want is is like this warning light for your dad that the moms foreign\nRight basically where the light turns ... and he knows to go in and we've gotten neighbors and stuff so if she follows the light would start flashing and we know\nOh my God over there and she has to push a button\nI've got a ah she's got a Google Home um but if she falls in love and gorgeous\nYeah she can't see anything yeah and that's the idea of this is this a few rather Philips thing um\nI I don't know I ... off the top of my head I don't know I'm looking at it it seems like that would be an clear used for this that Philips ought to support since has all the same company and they make this very and by the way the the the huge stuff these or\nOther the motion sensor stuff or for falling as is considered quite good you know I'm\nSo that's nice but if it doesn't you know the Philips life what I Would go to a lifeline to Philips dot com look at their medical systems and and\nI I'm looking at but I don't see immediately where it would tied at a hue and that puzzles me seems like it ought to and if it's gonna that's gonna be the most direct route [noise] um you could if you got er an apple watch and turned on fall detection and no I don't\nHave a lot of experience with fall detection with how accurate it is and and and of course false positives oh you probably don't care about false positives that can come run it in and it can be everything's fine and you can go back out um\nSo I think maybe looking at apple watch cars that you can definitely do a script with I Would bet that would then change the lights and this this and that script again I'm about to do some investigation since it's a really interesting\nQuestion scooter X is going to put a link and it showed us to hack a day project yeah fall detector wearable for elderly and clinics disclosed would argue we know now this if you really handy you could you could program that's for sure

sound immersive sound is twelve channels including for overhead and so their their format\nIt in such a way with special base management that that sense the information to the sub woofer that\nNeed to why they're in a special receiver and has ended ... at most is is something else yes no I remember it\nSo ... [laughter] or however your standard at most speaker configuration will work just fine uh it they they recommend having a seven channel around\nOne at least one sub woofer and four channels overhead to make this work ideally so if you have an ... set up that it'll work just fine you don't have to change anything there one problem I see is that most many uh aficionados enthusiasts movie enthusiast have\nA to point three five screen which is the aspect ratio of most movies and so when when an IMAX enhanced movie goes to sixteen by nine the image on your two point three five screen will actually be smaller [laughter]\nSomebody asked about that at one of the press conferences the DEA and and the guy said well yeah but the majority of people have sixteen by nine screens well\nYeah that's true but if you're looking for the most immersive experience you can get a ... a well the most cinematic experience you can get you're going to go with a wider screen and this IMAX\nWon't work with that but if you have a sixteen by nine screen as you and I both do on a lead TVs and so on then when these special scenes come up in a movie they will expand outwards upward and downward to fill the entire screen and presumably become more immersive\nInteresting ... so it's an interesting I sound like a gimmick to be honest but okay well\nYeah OK er basically it's kind of like THX certification the IMAX\n...
