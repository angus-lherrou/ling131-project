A. and mutual funds than you are with prepaid college plants here is the reason anytime you ... pay something your rate of return is what it increases in\nPrice and so if I prepay a an item I pay a thousand\nDollars in increases in price\nTo twelve hundred dollars my rate of return if it did that in one year would be twenty percent so that'd be a nice rate of return right so how much of an increase in price 'cause that's the only return when you ... pay anything they're not giving you an interest rate they're not giving your growth rate you simply are saving the increases in tuition\nBy paying it ahead of time\nThat's all you're doing now tuition for the last Seventy years as average about seven point two percent inflation right so that means you're making about seven point two percent on your money when you do prepaid college in a good growth stocks mutual fund you ought to be ten to fourteen percent\nAverage annual return over that same period of time minded and so uh you make more by putting it in and you actually get some headway towards college the other problem with prepaid college is a ... and it's a blanket statement but ... and it would vary from state to state many\nMany many of the state's business government are very poorly run and they screw up some of the prepaid college plans in the process\nI mean they're just horrible administrators now some states are well run my state happens to be well run show in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be concerned today under the current administration with a\nWith the stability of the ... still wouldn't do prepaid college even in Tennessee because of the other reason I was talking about I Want a better rate of return on my money than simply the inflation rate of tuition so all of that the sale roll your ID six hundred bucks and they'll five twenty nine and a good mutual fund at some point right now I just stop adding\nIt's all down stop going out to eat canceled the trip that you had planned called vacation because you're broke and you've been spending more than you make and you have to stop that and that's how you got a car loan and credit card debt so you're right on track you're doing the right kind of things and that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes Matthew\nIs with us in Fort Worth Texas hey Matthew how are ya\nI'm excellent or want to thank you first off for a a ... I was going through a few for the last seven years we paid off over a hundred thousand dollars good for him and would have been in bankruptcy had a had we not gone through a few wow so ... to my question because this is a wonderful thing it's fixing to happen\nOr we were my family my parents have received an inheritance a mineral rights in West Texas a large portion\nAnd a habit struck oil a lot of oil we've had it for a hundred years and had a few oils but not not a Thai\nUh-huh uh speculators are wanting to sell a by our rights for a large sum of money\n[laughter] or over a million dollars [laughter] and we're deciding whether or not we should sell mhm and cash out or hopefully you know we're being told don't sell because there's going to be a boom and we want them out you know large nice inheritance and I want to make sure it's managed properly\nMhm [noise] well there's only a boom if it's not a dry hole and there's only a boom if after it's not a dry hole there is an actual uh oil prices that sustain\nA drilling a and then that's the only reason west Texas is struggling or on our prices are so far down that there's no boom okay I mean when the gas for five dollars a gallon or the boom baby here I mean\nBut uh and could that come back yeah I just probably depends on you know what OPEC does on turning on or off the faucet on the supply demand that's the issue all of that to say I'm no expert on the oil business I don't know much about it at all to get just about everything I Know just in a\n[noise] but um and so the way I asked myself that question if I'm In your shoes and you might answer the question differently than I Would because you might know more or your family might know more\nUh I'll let me ask you this you have to sell all of them you have to sell all the way it was an all or none\nNo it's not an all or none ah what do you it's it's essentially a they're looking at the three million for all and uh and uh do you know obviously one point five for half okay so you just add\nHow one yeah and my biggest concern is a risk yeah you're not oil people\nYeah I think I don't think I'm asking is women I'm ... so you're only talking about selling our house\n[noise] we're deciding on how much to sell\nOkay All right if I were in your shoes I don't know much about the oil business and if someone\nAsked me if I had a pile of money in the middle of my kitchen table that said three million dollars on it when I go by oil rights with it my answer would quickly be no mainly because I don't like that much risk and I don't know much about that okay those two things would take it off the table for me I Would rather buy something else with it that I\nThat I Know a little bit more about like real estate and it's a little bit more predictable and less risk personally okay but that's the way you ask yourself the question if I had three million dollars part of the mill kitchen table when I go go by our rights and west Texas where the if the answer is no then it's time to sell for the same reason I say you know that you wouldn't die\nAnd ...\nAnd that's that's what I agree with his getting the family to understand that you know we're we're afraid the stock market crash\nYeah well it might but I Am I going to sell you start getting less rock markets less risk than drilling holes\nYou're a hundred percent sure that you don't ... I mean walking around since tells you that you don't have to be a person to know that now uh so what I Would do a ... the family has to do these are family owned and so you can't just show like yours off\n[noise] you know this is I'm I'm helping my mother and father make it to say oh I see so it's a just shut down they can make the decision for the whole thing or not yeah\nAll right then if I were in their shoes I Would at least to sell Seventy five percent of it\nAnd\nI probably would sell at all but on the off chance that they are just dying to be a little bit in their own business and they're scared to death so foam oh you know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and uh you know so that that you know if it struck out right after I sold it I regretted the rest of my life\nYou know those kinds of statements then maybe keep twenty five percent of it and sell Seventy five percent and then let's buy some real estate or by some mutual funds or something that's a whole\nFor the families entire portfolio\nThree million dollars worth of um\nNatural so as I Do that I Will say though\nThe time thanks for calling\nThis is the ... [noise]\n[noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it

Tom regardless of California yup letter man than this hack or allow bad guys to grab\nThat little piece of information and use it for themselves so what Facebook did when they found is is it the activated Ninety million users a week ago friday now is that about when used that were unable to log in\nYes actually it's my wife's account I can still log in them\nSo she was one of the Ninety million you weren't\nYeah yeah yeah 'cause I very judicious about every thing\nWell I didn't have anything to do with how judicious you are that's what's scary about ... like this is you can be perfectly good and still ah have your Facebook account stone and this and we believe that uh actually one of my producers had as a cow stolen or some months ago and now we believe that's how it happened so ah\nThe way Facebook fixes it is by the activating that cookie and by the way that would also log you out of anything you used Facebook to log into you know you can use face right log into a lot of other stuff so she she's probably noticed that as well\n[noise] well ... like me I'm each each thing like Instagram and that sort of thing which one we don't log in from Facebook what do you use individual long\nThat's smart yeah turns out that was if you are good that was a very smart thing to do because if they got that token and you could use that token to log into other sites right they'd be able to log in to you now\nThey do you have to re log in and now you're they're saying hey we we want your second factor normally would that would be is a text message sent to your cell phone right or another Facebook instance that you could use the code from 'cause there's a code generator in the Facebook app\n[noise] right well we we've been down that path um [noise] of course we can't get into her account she only logs into Facebook from one thing yeah\nBut you know the truth is even if you had it on the phone and it would have been logged out too so write write code generate isn't gonna help you\nKnow and I tried from mine is generated a code but it's different\nBeen logged out too so write code generators and go help you\nKnow and I tried for line to generated a code that you know it's different yeah that's how I I knew that they try it yeah\nNo of course you you must use every outlet so does it at some point in their say well I don't have access to I Know it does can't do it that way what else can you do and then at some point and say well we have a phone number on record for you or does it not\nWell she didn't need it I but needless to say I was only one in mind just like yeah but either way yeah\nBy the way we've also learned Facebook once you put that phone number in their uses it to sell ads against just so thank you Facebook what a nightmare Facebook has turned out to be yes but you have to use that were black male into this so it sounds to me like she's going to have to contact Facebook\nAnd extend say look I Can't and a number of people have had to do\nThis and it's [noise] they'll make you jump through hoops [noise]\nFacebook and the only one that\nGot ...
