general place is the most certain criteria and it is what applies in the United states it will therefore be unnecessary to investigate any other\nThis goes on to a then quote this is the um this is Edward Bates President Lincoln already general way way way can we separate things too because the first one is James Madison hard to take it apart and dozens James Madison right\nNow however James Madison I think in this particular case James Madison\nIs is looking at something\nDifferent piece looking at the weather you came from Great Britain or not correct he's not talking about people who are coming in trying to drop off to be able to take stuff\nOr or you know or bringing all family in born in the colonies or were you born in Great Britain correct and they answered that two ways if you were born here you don't need naturalization however you also have to be born here to be president and that's what they were worried about they were worried about these English coming in\nAt ... try this out for size they were worried about the English coming in\nAnd just saying hey I'm I'm I'm American I'm living here and I'm American\nI can vote because they knew that if all these English people came in they would change the country [noise] that's why they didn't want it\nAnd her as president as well you had to be born here so they were trying to protect it at that time from the English coming in and screwing up the country with a vote which is what we're dealing with now\nI think I agree with that although he's saying if you were born here you are\nYou do have correct because it was a ... it was a different time and a different problem\nYup ... essay like as much as I Love to invest in one of the founders I ... it's almost less important what they thought about this particular issue because it was an amendment to the constitution right we're talking about the fourteenth amendment yeah and they do and that's why you have to separate James Madison 'cause that's not constitutionally he didn't put that in the constitution\nWas that was put in under Lincoln\nAnd ... and so now go to that because that's a different argument as well um so so this is now a Edward ... is president Lincoln's attorney general mess that we're in a pretty this is again a few years right before they do the fourteenth amendment\nOr the eight incorporates the language and is a this is a from the article from National Review\nProperly understood of codified ... attorney general based contemporary understanding this is what he says\nI'm quite clear in the opinion that children born in the United states of alien parents who have never been naturalized are native born citizens of the United states and of course do not require the formality of naturalization to entitle them to the rights privileges of such citizenship isn't there more\nThat was the end of that quote\nI thought there was something else too about or maybe it was in James Madison that they had come in the proper way or something I I thought I heard that earlier today\nBut the the the Abraham Lincoln thing is just the same\nRemember so way on the constitutional thing because there wasn't the fourteenth amendment yet I Know I Know he's writing it this is this is the beginning of it and so the first one is how do we know who are citizen is because it's almost all well it is at that point all immigrants except those who had come over and the Mayflower\nA or had their relatives come over before um so it was very small number who was mainly immigrants\nSo how do you know who is an American well were you born here that was it that was the question of who's an American at that time because it was mainly a you know people from England and they were worried about the English\nComing in so you're born here you're a citizen you can serve you can vote starting to get a pretty serious German influx too yes serious German and they were free to buy that the the second thing is uh with with Lincoln\nHe's trying to solve a different problem he is trying to solve at that point the Democrat literally the Democratic party this is their first attempt before poll taxes\nAnd you know moving the polling place and all of the crap that they did the first thing was oh well you know you're not okay you might be a you might be a citizen but\nYour kids your kids weren't slaves so your kids aren't citizens he's truly are trying to say stop it stop it we're talking about the slaves\nThe slaves are free their citizens and so are there children that you have to look at the thirteenth fourteenth amendment for what it was talking about and what it was trying to do\nIt was trying to say to the Democrats\nStop it these are human beings and they are citizens\nAnd it'd be fascinated here these two sides tapas out because it's it they're both coming from the conservative perspective it's not like you know Chris Cuomo versus somebody you trust or at least they're both sides of the argument I think a really interesting I don't I mean 'cause I think you're right\nLike you know Chris Cuomo versus somebody you trust\nOr at least they're both sides of the argument I think a really interesting I don't\nBecause I think you're right so but sometimes that is because that is definitely what they were intending right was slavery however sometimes you ... that is the also there's the ... not unintended but intended consequences where you would you would absorb a larger group to make sure one group is is there is no way the intent is\nThat if you come here from Mexico central and South America and you have a baby\nAnd everybody who does that is now instead of ... Ryan\nWay that there are Russian tourists now that take you Chinese to take you to Miami the Russians and go to Miami you stay here for a few weeks you have the baby here\nYour your your child as American citizenship same thing in Hawaii with the Asians uh it it's big in Hawaii but probably also big in California that's not what they were talking about\nThis is not at all different problem yeah the the constitution the first ten in the bill of rights\nThose are universal those are gigantic\nSo when somebody says the bill of rights well is it in the first ten because the first ten our global pretty much with the exception of new ideas\nAre pretty much the the the rest of them are ... of the first one where they had to get very specific and say\nNo dummy women women are part is all men are created equal women can vote same thing with blacks and the thirteenth fourteenth amendment\nMhm it there there were specific where the\nWhere the amendments are very ... the first ten\nWhat is it made sense for them to think that in Dallas texas United States of America at Parkland Hospital Seventy five percent of the babies born there\nAre born to illegals and now they're all citizens no that doesn't make sense to anybody that doesn't I I definitely don't think it's a good idea ... right and not a good idea institution at this this this this is the best\nPhrase and I just I Can't understand how people don't understand that the constitution was not meant to be a suicide pact\nThat's positive or a but it's also a very dangerous free so I guess I I feel like that's the same argument people use but the second amendment oh well they would they look I mean that the time they only have these little weapons they know that we're not at all sure they wanted freedom of guns I mean these guys are too big huge brutal and this is not meant to be a suicide power when I'm\nTalking about suicide pack I mean on the principles on the principles it's not meant to be a suicide pacts if we follow these principles you won't have a constitution you won't have America anymore you just won't because what he is\n... nobody even for a hundred years and we still have America\nAre not doing it differently now there was not the have a baby tourism back in Nineteen hundred you know I mean it's certainly being exploited at some level right I mean but that does not mean huge it than I Am like let's just say we ally argument is an argument to amend the constitution\nRight yeah let's just say if it was very intent was to be getting let's just say it was\nThat we wanted it alien students come in and have been dropped babies over here and then they're going to be anchor babies and they're going to get citizenship let's just say that was their intent I don't think it was well let's just say it was if that was true and and back then people weren't exploding and now people are are ... should not be as say we now think\nHe I asked them if you want to change guns don't make some slippery arguments just amended Eighteenth amendment twenty First Amendment and we said you know what we're going to ban all alcohol we did it back\nYes just amended Eighteenth amendment twenty First Amendment and we said you know what we're going to ban all alcohol we did it bad\nIdea twenty First Amendment forget the Eighteenth amendment we need a drink [laughter] right yeah and that's the way you're supposed to do it yeah and they don't want to do it that way because it's hard it's hard and they know that it's impossible to make the argument\nBecause when you do something that big you actually have to think about\nIt and that's why the president's not suggesting we have a constitutional amendment ... adjusting ... and that they were right and that's in overturned immediately hearing them in ... immediately alright Packer unleashed a blaze TV networks every single day also pat on the news white matter says\nThe first that for what we are working for you\nHave ... laughing in this country that sound like shrimp ... now how ... kinda\n... cameras up soon you don't like the man coming around ... ... ... ...\nNews and talk on the radio dishes use radio for change when oil you\nRallying Republican ...

hear from you so\nSo for people who don't follow a Whitey ... give us the give tell his story\nA it's a it's a long and complicated tale but in a nutshell a you know he uh ran south Boston in a neighborhood called ... and over twenty five year period he basically was allowed to kill with impunity as as we later found out he was um\nWe're we're talking to a job earlier he is the director of why the United states of America versus James James ... a blogger who is the you know Whitey I'm and I'm I guess what was it that it tractor due to the story why why did you make the film and what did you\nWhat attracted you to it and what did you take away from it\nYeah I mean I thought that ah you know Bolger finally bring being brought to trial because there's there's such a myth about the guy there's such folklore [noise] you know in our society is unfortunately we tend to glamorize and make errors out of criminals\nAre Bolger probably is the greatest example of that so much folklore surrounding him so much hero worship\nUm films that kind of downplay the grizzly side of or the or the aftermath of of what he is responsible for even if it does show the details of\nHow people are killed you know we we celebrate criminals in this society which is which is an odd phenomenon and so the idea that he was being brought back to trial finally to face the music I thought would be a great opportunity there kind of separate fact from fiction and to really understand\nThe crimes that that was my going in assumption but sitting through that trial and witnessing it and getting to know Bolger are in fact I was the only journalist allowed to actually interview him because the a defense attorneys\nBasically trusted me versus some other journalists in part because of my previous worm films like Paradise Lost\nUm uh you know what fascinated me and ... and what my big turn was was just how ... the government has been in allowing a killer to run roughshod over the streets of Boston and how you know he his informant you know\nIf you're going to allow somebody to evade justice for twenty five years you would hope that the record of what you got what he what you got so rock solid and I so points to like oh my God this guy was invaluable\nBut I ... the evidence was just not there for me you know he was it was in who he was in the logbook says as as being an informant but you know if you really drill into it there's very little information you have that the feds didn't already have and so then the question is why was he allowed\nI mean even if he gave the best information on the planet and he is directly responsible for the end of the mafia in New England as we know it\nWhich was not the case um are you still have to question the wisdom of the government allowance\nAnd they knew it Joe ...
