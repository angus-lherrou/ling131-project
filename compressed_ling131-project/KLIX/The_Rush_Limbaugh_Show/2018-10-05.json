S. N. B. C. today\n[noise] uh see one of those are the river [noise]\nAnd I just put it the bottom of the stack it's about somebody I very rarely comment on because I don't care as phony folk conservatives his name is Jennifer Rubin\nA gap there it is Jennifer ... it's amazing that transformation this woman has made the Washington Post hired her as a conservative blogger\nDuring the Obama years during the Obama years for the most part she came across as a conservative blogger and then when Trump gets elected she became I think what she's always been just the died the cast in the wool liberal and now she has\nA this still the conservative columnist or blogger at the post but she's not conservative and MSNBC reversed or that\nWay but that's not the point I couldn't tell the story without mentioning her name she says that GOP senators are behaving as if it's their time of the month\nNow\nThat to me it goes a little deeper than what it just sounds like you're on the surface\n\nImagine a conservative saying on MSNBC the female Democrat senators were being so emotional almost hysterical behaving is if it's their time of the month does anybody think that would fly there is no way\nA male commentator anywhere can say that about women senators are women witnesses or any of us or for the here's Jennifer Ruben\nAgainst Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom and then the assumption is that if people knew that\nIn two thousand six day and that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support enable Trump to be successful and she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nIs the Kavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populist coalition that elected Trump needed something outside\nOf Trump to coalesce around in the midterms in other words in her study of things just continuing to vote for a Party Republicans to enable Trump to keep going was not enough to get them out there don't know why\nI Would think it would be but she says it's not Kavanaugh however has\nProvided the catalyst because of how Trump voters the priest and specifically the conservative populists coalition perceive the way he has been treated not just by Democrats but by the media and by Hollywood\nThat the Trump conservative populace coalition is tired and worn out\nThe way they edit things they believe in are treated by Democrats the media and Hollywood and her point is that\nThe targets of range had somewhat diminished until cabinet came along and re awaken these people and fired them back\nUp so she says this is what I see in a nutshell what happened to the Kavanaugh has served\nAs a reminder Anna highlights to the people voted for Trump why he's successful that it's all about being strong it helped to remind voters why they supported him and the other Republican president would have walked away from cabin all by now\nEnergy would have been lost but it's not energy is high [noise] now that's again that Salinas Ito and her analysis of the electorate today heading into the two thousand sixteen thousand each in midterms now where I\nLook she knows what she's talking about I find it strange that people who I think that people are voting for Trump are deeply involved with things now maybe there are some exceptions\nAnd you have some people will vote for Trump to just set up with Republicans and Democrats and found Trump interesting but for the most part I Am of the opinion that Trump voters did so for a very very very specific reasons related to Trump's agenda which he [noise]\nDay multiple times a day Donald Trump told everybody when he was going to do trade deals the wall immigration rebuild a military bring back the economy\nI Would think people have voted for Trump knew that that's what he's going to do and I would also think that people who voted for Trump would realize that he needs more than two years to do it\nBut is her insistent know that kind of stuff it evaporates and wanes into people's lives do on the news changes but at this camp on a circus has re ignited the coalition that electing Trump\nAnd this is to the detriment of the Democrats or don't see this happening\n\nShe says the Senate could and did see a red wave the house she's not so sure of\nIowa I found it interesting analysis and I wanted to share it with you she points out the Democrats are spending money and house races out there like we've never seen

would withdraw his nomination ... that that ... that the Trump will withdraw\nSo asked his spare him the embarrassment they miscalculated both ways so now we've had a procedural vote we're gonna have

this country\nDamn right that is exactly right I don't think Kavanaugh would be able to sue them I don't think that the ... once you start getting into the government government officials and so forth are coming in and you got the first amendment which protects political speech and you can produce an ad that says pretty much anything and it can lie\nAbout whoever and whatever you want and there's not much you can do about it the\nThe er the remedy for that is more speech\nWhich in this case equals more money to counter the lives that are being told I it's a frustrating thing that drives a lot

handed to them and these upcoming elections by all the ... just by all that's decent they ought to be wiped out this ought to be the biggest mid term landslide defeat any party has ever

come from your hard work it doesn't cover yourself our minds it comes from them and you're gonna learn it and love it and live at by golly by gosh or else you're going to be punished\nThis party deserves to be sold soundly defeated in November that we haven't seen anything like it if they lose if they do not win the house if they do not win the Senate if they lose seats in both then that\nMight make some of the leaders of the party ... think\nTheir current strategy but if they win based on this it's going to get even\nWorse than it's been this politics of personal destruction is

he wouldn't do it\nOh okay I'm\nToo many people will be hurt too many people be hurt by\nYour right but that that means a lot for her and her state\nSo I don't know um\nThe other quick question that I

does that did it for Neil Gorsuch does that put him back in play again\nThat can play you mean to be impeached is well\nAbsolutely sir no no no ... they wouldn't buy that much off uh you get rid of
