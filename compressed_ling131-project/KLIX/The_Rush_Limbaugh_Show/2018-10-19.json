disagree with your assessment of what this election\nIt is about the main voting issue is not immigration or health care is is that the Democrat voting race is a bunch of nuts\n[noise] I Wish that were true I have tried to make that a fundamental issue in people's minds literal insanity the psychological disorders and I mean that\nWith every essence of my being I think much of the Democratic party agenda has derived from their voters being psychologically\nScrewed up they are suffering the psychological disorder and because of things that have happened to them in their lives and they want to blame the country for it they want to blame the patriarch and they want to blame the founding but then they they they claim that the only fix for it is the government punishing the people that did\nWhatever happened to these people\nAnd the Democratic party has embraced all of these various psychological disorders and abnormalities\nAnd is try to normalize them all by enshrine ing them as policy planks in the Democratic party platform if you will and that's how we ended up with people or represent two tenths of one percent of the population\nGiving a whole weight of the Democratic party thrown behind them to make their issue one in which the otherwise vast majority can end up being bullied into submission\nI have tried to ever say well even before but it's civically since the Kavanaugh hearings to make the point that that's what we're up against it and that's what it's going to end up triumph ing and ... if the Democrats win the house all of that abnormality is going to achieve power and when they have the power\nTo actually implement their forms of punishment against groups of\nPeople they blame for whatever was wrong in their lives these are not people that are things that can fix things themselves they're not people that they've not been raised this way the Democratic party does not promote that kind of thing in human behavior Democratic Party is happy\nTo help them blame others happy\nTo make them think they have no hope that the deck is stacked against them because of whatever their skin color or sexual orientation their their their gender identity their religion whatever Democratic Party is helpful\nIn making all these people believe they are justified in thinking that life is miserable because of all these horrible other people what they've done to them and then the Democratic party let us fix for DACA\nWe'll become your champions will punish these people for you in the\nDemocratic voter basically yeah yeah yeah yeah now what you need to do is examine every Democrat constituency group that they've been representing for the last take your ... ten years twenty fifty and ask yourself if any of the people in those groups\nHave become happy have had\nTheir issues addressed and fixed or are they as miserable as they've always been are they as angry as they've always been if not more so are they still complaining today about things they were complaining about injustice discrimination a mistreatment\nThat they've been complaining about for fifty years what has the Democratic party done to fix any of this answer is nothing although the Democratic party has done it's best to punish\nThe day Donald Trump won the presidency is the Trump would trigger a global recession with knowing it starts with Krugman says that's his

this woman gets back into the speakership\nFinancial security respecting the dignity and worth of every person in our ... what the hell does that mean respect the dignity and the implication is that there's a whole swath of American does not respect the dignity\nAnd worth of every that's not what she means she means minority rights being able to trample on the majority that's what that means\nRespecting the dignity in wars and very meaning every person in our party with a psychological disorder you must accept as normal\nThat's what that means [noise] while you're laughing in there [noise] 'cause you know I'm right you just don't believe I've got the guts to be saying this\nThat's exactly what this means respecting the dignity ... worth of every person in our country means you've got to accept as normal every oddball in our party suffering a psychological disorder you must accept it and you must love with them and you must make way for them\n\nAnd if there is some collateral damage she rambled him\nFor some who do not share our view well so be it but it shouldn't be our original purpose what\nWell even the the this is a Breitbart store even they say it's not clear what philosophy meant by collateral damage\nWhat couldn't she means what else\nCould she mean other than punishment she's not talking about\nJust losing because that will happen if if if\nPeople that don't vote for blows issues I think speaker Democrats around the house they live that's not collateral damage collateral damage what happened after they lose the punishment for not vote this is who they've always been\n\nNot just talking about climate change this is a threat against anybody who dares to disagree with the Democratic party line on anything\nSpeaking of collateral damage in case you're wondering what it is let me turn to the Daily Caller eight violent attacks on the Republicans just this year by Democrats suffering psychological disorders upset that the Democratic party

to survive on their own without the media\nFanning the flames or propping them up each and every day that as my precise point Trump doesn't need the media to be who he is Trump doesn't need the media to be elected President Trump doesn't need the media to remain popular but all of these people do ... could not\nCome close to establish a connection with serious number of Americans to be able to

do and we're going to continue the spiders we can't trust anybody where Israel\nAnd uh particularly when Democrats are in the White House and that's a factor now when it comes to the Saudis I Want to share with your question here is really good I remember after nine eleven happened when when I learned that\nIf it was either all Nineteen or white Ninety percent eighty percent of the Nineteen hijackers were Saudi\nI remember I was talking to William F luckily junior about number thing not just this and I brought that up and I remember him getting frustrated with me about it is so what does it ever doing anything I ...\nI don't understand the Saudi Government supposedly is an ally\nAnd yet these hijackers come from Saudi Arabia or you are you saying the Saudi royal family is behind this I said how can we say that they're not\n\nThat is when I began to try to learn about the relationship to the Saudi of the Saudi royal family to Islam\nAnd that's when I started asking experts\nAre at at one of the people I talked to was Andy McCarthy again because he has tried as a United States attorney assistant United States attorney southern district of Manhattan he was the lead prosecutor on the blind shaped case\nAnd it was ending who said that he thought the blind Shaq was just acting out and being a radical inventor of various aspects of Islam as part of his technique to mobilize and create even more membership and his group and then he\nHe started reading the things that the blind shake believes and he found out none of this is made up this this this call for terrorism dealing with infidels it's right there and look around if you read it right\nThis is exactly what what is in the book and he was stunned when he told me it was so when you didn't realize that the Saudi royal family\nIs in charge of world wide Islam because the holy sites or their mecca and a Medina Medina I found that it is absolutely true that the Saudi royal family\n\nIs essentially the the shield and the impetus behind worldwide Islam while in Saudi Arabia the branch of Islam that is I\nFor just to make it easier here and being understood terrorist Islamic comes from ... from those you heard me

the Saudi royal family\nStood by and let it all happened whether they were instrumental in advocating it don't know but Saudi funded charities all over the world promoted while hobby is\nAnd that's what I went back to Mr Buckley aside I don't I don't see how the Saudi royal family the Saudi Government can be separated from these Nineteen hijackers\nWell that's why it's interesting to tell the story of the crown prince Mohammed bin solve mind Mohammed bin ... wants to if we didn't believe him [noise]\nHe wants to reform the Saudi Arabian peninsula the whole country and its relationship to Islam all because\nOf money economics primarily he doesn't like the fact that Saudi Arabia is solely dependent on the sale of oil for all of its wealth\nHe wants to branch out\nHe wants other people investing other industries individuals' investing in Saudi Arabia for things unrelated dollars are Petro dollars oil\nSo he sought out the interest in Hollywood Silicon Valley than the typical places in other countries as well and part and parcel of his reform is the\nI don't know what word abandonment orange me a distance thing for more hobbies\n\nAccording to have been some on Saudi Arabia cannot modernize and cannot achieve his reform goals if ... is still\n\nThe branch of Islam associated with the Saudi royal family\nWell\nThis brings us to show me again and the Muslim Brotherhood they don't want any of these reforms they don't want any western influences in any Islamic country much less\nSaudi Arabia where mecca Medina they do not want while habits of watered down they do not they want the Arab Spring they don't want secularism anywhere and Mohammed bin ... represents a bit of that that's fascinating that he's been brought to a screeching halt on these reforms\nWith a death occurs shaggy this has brought to a screeching halt and now there's a story today that the royal family they they have a council you might I often wonder well who determines these kings\nHave countless sons they've got Fifteen different why they've got kids with every one of their wives [noise] some of the Saudi king can have twenty sons\nHow do you determine which one's the crown prince how does he determined which one's going to be is air it's not just first in line they had a council they have an inter family council a royal family council that\nDetermines the winning edge of the crown prince the heirs and in what order\nThen saw him on Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of the current\nKing Solomon\nWas chosen largely because of his reform ideas but now story out today says it they went off his true or not the royal family is having a crisis meetings and maybe going to replace Mohammed bin ... as clown friends now many people think\nIt was having a crisis meetings and maybe going to replace Mohammad bin ... as clown friends now many people think that this is up to the king the king of tournaments which uh his son just got to be the next king\nBut it's not the case\nSo all of these plans for modernization if they were true I have to throw that I was a cabin up all these plans for reform\nHave been brought to a screeching halt by the murder of job market
