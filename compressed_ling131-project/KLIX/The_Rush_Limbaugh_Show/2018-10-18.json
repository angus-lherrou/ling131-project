previously Georgia stamped out another showing up again if there were ever official linkage to undocumented people arriving ... wow\nI Can't have that can't have that at all so the connection isn't

are getting bonuses\nThey are not happy that more\nPeople are working and they're not happy the economy is growing to the point of I'm serving all the new people that want jobs so why is that who in

is because they can't claim credit for it and it threatens\nTheir whole existence where in people are not capable of this and need to vote Democrat to basically live\nThey need to vote Democrat need

more people rely on themselves get jobs improve their lives just the fact that Democrat Party gets mad\nIf that is all anybody on the need to know by the same token new instances of polio and the Democratic party is not upset about new instances of diseases breaking out we've already cured and they're not concerned about it\nBecause it is harmful if anybody makes the connection\nHow anybody
