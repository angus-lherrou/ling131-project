what type of man it takes to cut the girl to somebody in front of you like that but I can tell you this is an individual probably they were rats rear end about having waterboarding his base\nHe never believed for a second year we're going to kill it no let me tell you\nHe would use his fingers to count the number of seconds because he knew that in all likelihood we would stop at ten\nIt's doesn't sound like a person Who's Afraid of dying Leslie stall says so what happens he breakdown does he cried dizzy fall apart now we get to a good night's sleep you get this ensure\nBy the way he was very happy when he came to watch the last fifty pounds was at least all what gives you ensure you mean like people in the hospital drink that stuff yes dietary manipulation was part of our dire techniques\nIn the eyes of the left we want to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be western\nSocialists they think still functioning\nAt a democracy but but that's that's what they want us so we should be forthcoming\nAnd tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves and this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\nWhich say what you want this guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in history combined the problem with that is that so many people expect politicians to not keep their promises that\nI don't know how big of a scoring points that it is for Trump but it does add up to the fact that you can trust them you can count on them you know they'd be says he's going to do something he's going to do or\nDie trying we don't have that well yet but not for lack of trying and we don't have the full repeal of Obamacare yet but not for lack of trying now the Democrats are often running here on a couple of 'em read birth issues I don't know if you've noticed it or not but all of\nA sudden Trump wants to once again take away health insurance from people with pre existing conditions where did this come from\nOut of thin air it came out of thin air there's no way Trump wants\nAnd with preexisting conditions where did this come from\nOut of thin air it came out of thin air there's no way Trump wants to do this there is no Republican I Want this is the reason the Republicans didn't go for a full repeal of Obamacare is pre existing conditions\nWhich you get down to brass tacks preexisting conditions being covered it's not even insurance there's no way you can get insurance if\nYour house catches fire and then go buy insurance nobody's going to sell you insurance wants the houses on fire or after it's been robbed\nSo we're not even talking about insurance but we are\nAs far as the general public is concerned so I don't know where all of a sudden Donald Trump and every Republican candidate for the house and the Senate wants to take away health insurance or preexisting conditions\nWhen did this happen no Republicans out there saying that it's sort of like when Joe ... a ... a a George Stephanopoulos was interviewing 'em\nWhile questioning Mitt Romney in a debate and he asked and you think that states should be able to ban contraception Romney look the rest of what nobody is talking about that stuff and I I don't care for it to be talking about one on one you think\nShould states have no right to ban contraception Ravi looks around I guess what we're not talking about ... George I don't think anybody I don't think anybody wouldn't even think of this I don't know why are you asking me I just want an\nAnswer quit stalling you think states will eventually Romney answered it and it didn't matter what the answer was it allowed the media Romney discusses states banning contraception [laughter] that's all it took and the Republican war\nWas reborn and that's what this\nPre existing condition garbage let me see what the real issue with\nThe real issue that is raising its head out there that the Democrats don't want to talk about is immigration illegal immigration that remains the issue that color lessons\nRevolt Republican voters no matter what other issues they have that is the issue it has been poll driven and tested in terms of being a\nVery helpful to Republicans and of course the Democrats don't want to talk about it as distinctly they're trying to gin up all this stuff about pre existing conditions where Leslie stall here is trying to do the same thing\nBy suggesting that\nTrump is hostile to our good friends in Europe it just sounds so hostile why would you want to sound so hostile it's like when she was talking to Jose Jose read why would you give them in short that's the stuff they give cancer patients so mean that's not who we are are so you're so hostile and Trump so what is hostile\nThe way they treat us is what's hostile we're not hostile\nShe says yeah but you can't deal with it without he says we have been the stupid country for so many years\nAnd then she finally she willing to get rid of the western alliance no I like NATO NATO's fine but you know what we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO\nYou know what else they said ms interview secretary of defense\nMattis came up Trump's that I Know more about NATO than matter does [noise] [laughter] [noise] I don't work man is as far as the deep state is concerned is NATO any army general wouldn't be NATO\nSo Trump just [noise] as Vanity Fair

broadcast on cable news\nAnyway they go on to crash Leslie stall and trash CBS for letting Trump\nWalk all over them to just continue to dominate with relentless\nRhetoric CBS let Trump get away with

around the time he appeared on tape what Lester Holt and NBC\nAnd indicated he'd fired call me in part due to the Russia investigation but the end of their seemed governed by two motives both of which played in the hands of a media savvy president\nWho's refusal to play by typical rules of engagement has been at the center of his rise you know you people in the meeting and say oh you want he's been

make things out of the trees and they thought I was just insane I pointed\nOut you people misunderstand something yeah we cut down a lot of trees but you know what we plant for trees this is the wood industry they need would right how do you get once you have to grow trees it's not a finite resource and for every tree that's cut down\nFor new ones are planted it's part of the policy a warehouse there is one of the big companies that was doing this they wouldn't they wouldn't listen to it that didn't compute they couldn't begin to fathom that\nThey couldn't understand anybody seriously claim more trees more forest more forested acreage in Nineteen Ninety two than it was in the Seventeen hundreds\nDidn't make sense to them 'cause they don't understand capitalism or economics everything's in zero sum game if a company came along and dropped out a bunch of trees to build a bunch of houses or whatever it and that's that was trees that were gone forever it's why they don't want to cut

I was not familiar with the case or anything like that um but that wasn't that wasn't really the the the powerful peace about it the I guess the\nThe\n... what made it what made everybody if they were all feeling like me and all sitting down and not moving after the movie was over [noise] was\nIt was it was about an abortion doctor yes but let's say this was a movie about a murder trial and but during the murder trial the um there there were two there were there were two things that were portrayed in one was just the ... of what happens\nIn those clinics but even more than that\nWas was that the white level what was the barbarian eight of what happened in the clinics\nOh the bar verity of what happens in an abortion clinic when\nNo no and God's nails in God's nails clinic what happened what was the\nOh that uh that he was he was allowing babies to be born and then after they were born then he would kill him\nExactly that is the vast\nMajority this is why he's called the biggest serial killer in American history God's now killed most of the babies after they were born alive and he did it by snooping there spinal cords scissors now I didn't save is on friday\nI didn't say this on friday about gods now about what he did because I didn't want to frighten people away\nIt's not\nAs you I had to struggle to get this out of you so it's not something that jumps out at you when you watch the way he's right it is about primarily a trial I made the point of saying that Nick Searcy who's the director\nLets the story tell itself there aren't any exaggerating\nComputer generated graphics there there's not a lot of a special effect\nA real or computer generated in order to shock because of the story tells itself the numbers of children born alive killed by this man\nIs stunning and shocking then you realize that the mainstream media never even covered the trial much less money had done they've always done their best to suppress it it was nearly impossible to get this movie main precisely because of what yet\nAnd they've always done their best to suppress it it was nearly impossible to get this movie made precisely because of what yet revealed Hollywood doesn't want this movie made the actors\nIn this movie were risking their future careers by taking roles people like Nick Searcy who um a is as an across the board actor he can take the lead they can take a supporting role he can take or [noise]\nWhatever you want he chose to direct this movie and all of these people in one way or another we're risking something major by tackling it and doing it they couldn't find funding people that run the Gulf funding pages would not allow any kind of public funding for the production costs\nA Facebook Twitter I don't know specifically which one did they wouldn't allow any\nWas Facebook would not allow any kind of a a promotion reference or fundraising for this at all it's actually kind of a otherwise they amazing miraculous buddy if it was it was a a lot of hard work at a lot of time\nTo get this movie made but\nAnd it was a real challenge for maybe how how difficult is it to focus on\nThe fact that this abortion is did his murderous work outside the home he did his share of of ah of abortions in the world but the numbers of born alive that this man murdered it's just stunning\nYou know everybody thinks late term abortion is bad and by the way this kind of abortion\nAnd it's called an abortion if you if it's got a term I'm having a mental block and with the term of this is but in Illinois and so forth when when the procedure came up a bill was sponsored to stop this I think it was but rock Obama who refused to support it\nLeft will not support any limits whatsoever on whatever is called\nAn abortion and\nThe the the the the the thing that left us tried to do in countering this movie is to say well well if\nYou want more God's nails then you go hunting overturn roe versus Wade they tried to say God's now was doing what he was doing the causes women had no other choice they couldn't go anywhere to get that's a flat out lie\nBy the white God's nails clinic if you will none of the none of the year was sterilized people that were getting\nSick and infected with it just it was a pig style was in Philadelphia\nBut I didn't focus on that on purpose because I didn't want to I don't want to eat it\n'cause you don't see it that's my point they don't graphically try to make their point they focus on the murder trial button good going\nOut there John I'm sure he was he was getting sweating and nervous out there what does Russia want to hear what it would have been ain't got it's not that I wanted to hear anything but that is what I think most people will learn that they didn't know if they go\nTo influence the mainstream
