know the big lie is will Republicans didn't support bring existing conditions of course they did that was part of the plan I Know because you're right because I remember that very specific battle\nAnd in the insistence by people like Mark meadows yourself and others to get that in the bill that was passed ultimately in the house\nOn top of that the individual mandate has gone I mean it all the Obamacare was was one huge redistribution scheme where are you going to have the young and healthy literally buying plans that they don't need or want being forced by law that habit\nOr penalized if they don't get it financially and then literally redistribute that money to the sick the elderly and disabled in some redistribution scam\nAnd meanwhile they're young to get off a lot better by paying for one doctor's visit a year to make sure they're healthy and buying at their age you know catastrophic insurance which is going to be like fifty bucks a month\nAnd in case they got cancer heart attack or a bad accident so uh it was never fair to the people in this country they sold us a bill of goods and it never worked out the way they said oh well\nThat's exactly right we tried to repair\nIt a witch and then of course we repealed it\nVoted to repeal and replace it with a much better programs and then of course it failed in the Senate but that doesn't stop them from only telling

average two sheets and five minutes and six shades in seven days been tried power swabs there is no messy strips or trees that you'll have to leave in your mouth for an hour\nAt San when I when we heard this I I couldn't believe it I mean I was deployed on nine eleven uh the Taliban harbored al ... who came and killed three thousand Americans since then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops to include truthful I was deployed over there\nI've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nOr we would you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them in our eight ten but often times uh you know the the the firefights happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on\nThe taxi way as the cat the flag draped casket would come through and there's ... there's a silence there and everyone is leading giving our final salute to these American heroes\nWho perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates and for her to be able to say that she's OK with an American going to jump on doing the Taliban to fight against us I mean that in and of itself should have had her suspend her campaign and Arizona and should make a different choice to not\nReally so I mean you said six deployments that's amazing\nYeah well again it was an absolute honor there's so many Americans who have done that and more\nAre both on the ground and the air and on the the I mean this is this is you know why we fight or to protect our way of life and our freedoms and our liberties and it you know this and it is you know in addition to this a comment saying it's okay for an American to join the Taliban to basically commit trees and she also was protesting right after\nNine eleven probably lead depicting our troops as skeletons and saying stop the U.S\nTerror in the middle east so this isn't just a one off for her\nUh this is the pattern she advocated a shutdown Luke air force base I hosted the president President Trump at Luke air force base on friday to see what an amazing national security treasure it is she's trying to cover up or tracks and with George Soros Chuck Schumer and the millions of dollars that are flowing in to you know uh and it's just not true and we\nGot only coming out on a three weeks before the election I mean it's almost on a daily basis it's like you know a a deep dive dumped has been made but I Would think that has is common knowledge or had to have been common knowledge about her I mean I I wouldn't underestimate remember the allegations against the blind shakes attorney that she invited\nTo Arizona State university I mean that's another slap in the two people\nAbsolutely look at you know we are sort of joke that the Democrat Party should have done better in internal opposition research on her before they had her baby Chuck Schumer top recruit for them to try to flip the Senate majority we knew about her radical\nCats uh we've been telling people about it in Arizona every single day uh and that and the last few weeks or right some some videos and and things are coming out every single day but unless you're on conservative radio conservative TV Fox\nOr another on social media you're not finding out about this and so we still have another a number of independents and Republicans who are not too many and unfortunately that needs\nYeah and unfortunately that need to know every time we have to put up an ad to put some of these statements and like you just played at cost us about seven hundred thousand dollars\nTo make sure the message gets out to the voters as they are voting every single day right now and she's had so much money dumping into her you know and if people do on a supporter of course they can go to make Sally for Senate dot com 'cause we really do need to have to make sure Arizona's are aware\nOf the Arizona are aware of all of this they will never vote for her if they are aware of your heroes background they absolutely will vote for you\nUm I've only gotten to get to know you in in recent months and I got to tell you I'm more impressed every single time I talk to you and I think it'll be a great senator from the state of Arizona hope you're not going to turn into Ben Sasse and run away from me after you get elected but I'm less happen more than my daughter\nYou know it's on you may not remember but back when I was a major in the air force I took out in the Pentagon because they were making our service women wear ... when they were in Saudi Arabia and I put my career on the line and I\nActually sued the department of defence ah five for eight years and got legislation passed to overturn this and I actually went on the Hannity income show during that whole thing ah to talk about how important it was to protect our religious liberties and not say\nIt was a very you know that was that was a good move I mean I I don't like the idea of American Soldiers are are on foreign soil and were there to protect them and help them which is usually the case ah I don't think that we need to do by their customs were Americans we get to follow her own customs or else you don't want us there and then you don't want us there\nExactly that's exactly the way we were there it was a it was a U.S military policy it was ridiculous I stood up for it I thought for it took me eight years but I finally got legislation passed as a citizen or to overturn it and make sure that our values were ... were set up for it yeah\nWell I really I was actually based on the menu and here I'm a ... Martin Luther king's Ali if you're not paying attention to this race in Arizona you need to pay attention Christians cinema you know supporting radicals like the Taliban while Martha ... doing her six tour of duty twenty eight years serving our country ah she's got one of those crazy pink hats on\nYou know talking down our troops and accusing them didn't you choose them of torture as well\nAs she was aligned with a radical uh anti border patrol a group down at the border trying to help uh you know help with illegal immigration and that group ah ... accused the border patrol of torture yes it was a ... again radical extreme group or that she was very much involved in a in the inner path\nWhat do you think the president needs to do with the seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border if they make it to the border what's the best ... playing for the president\nOr this is absolutely ridiculous we have got to\nStop them from coming in and the president needs to use all elements of power that he had shown we're seeing little mini caravans coming in every single day though because they are taking advantage of our loopholes in the law\nI work very closely their president job ah it's often called the good that they'll that was also the Knicks Sally bill that would provide thirty eight billion dollars for the border wall to secure our border and close the loop holes at the cartels are taken advantage of it has to stop every single day right now there's people coming in in ...\nUh and that's a sector that is being overrun right now all they do have been there many times they realized they released into the interior of the United states sixteen thousand five hundred family member units in September the highest ever recorded this is not church president John fault it's a Democrat's fault for obstructing a closing loopholes and securing our border\nAnd the president as frustrated as the eye and he knew easiest everything he's got enough to to get to to put pressure on Mexico and then\nThey usually ... and fully funding all yes\nAnd you have that are built thirty eight billion\nTo to put pressure on Mexico and then\nThey usually work out and finding her and fully funding all yes\nAnd you can afford it our bales thirty eight billion dollars including building the wall I guess there\nWould you vote to repeal Obamacare the both of John McCain decided to change his mind on\nWell San I did vote to repeal and replace Obamacare on that House bill and getting my asking for it right now because it's being misconstrued either Democrats they're trying to uh you know invoke fear in people who have family\nMember wait a minute I Know Arizona didn't how many Arizona's lost their plans lost their doctors and are paying infinitely higher rates because of Obamacare\nYes Obamacare failed in Arizona there's only one choice in fourteen if they have no choice people lost their health\nCare coverage where people right now a tree they think conditions you can't get access to health insurance because of the failures of Obamacare So I work hard to make sure that we were moving away from that I and and towards something that gets more choice people\nMore flexibility at the state level or free market get the federal government you know to not be doing it one size fits all top down penalty taxes and mandate it's failed and so we you know I voted yes again I've got millions of dollars attacking me right now misconstrue ... vote\nI voted to protect people with preexisting conditions are good intentions but their policies are wrong we need more conservative\nPolicies to bring the cost down and provide more options for people to get access to insurance\nOr a ... a really a rock star a hero who served their country and an important race for the Republicans as they not only want to maintain control of the U.S Senate but also to build their majority in the Senate that'll make votes for Supreme Court justice is a lot easier\nGoing up against a very radical leftist in the name of Chris and send them a thank you so much a Martha McSally for all you've done for your country and and the positions you take and uh you

as opposed Paterson who remember he he carried the nuclear football under the Clinton Administration\nWrote the book Darryl ... their religion a duty a welcome both of you Brandon tell me your story what made you decide you worry I guess pretty left and a Democrat and you started this campaign in this whole thing for you is gone absolutely viral what happened\n[laughter] so ah it's great to be near San thank you\nUm so I you know my whole life I consider myself a liberal and my whole adult life I consider myself so I was a Democratic Party voter I always voted Democrat um and that was true even in two thousand sixteen I went and voted for Hillary Clinton and\nI was one of these people who was devastated by the results of the election for numerous reasons first of all the media had been telling me for months and months at a Donald Trump didn't have more than a three percent chance of winning and\nThey also have been telling me for months and months that he was a racist at a ticket and homophobia and\nA monster and basically the second coming of Hitler and that his followers were no better and you know they I think that the liberal media did for me as they did for millions of others are very effective\nJob fearing people making people believe these stories in this narrative that they're trying to push so when Trump got elected I was terrified and I was one of these people going on social media ranting you know screaming sometimes crying you know what I'm saying you know I'll never understand how people could vote for\nFor this monster and on one particular day I had posted about um you know I\nI'll never be able to understand how people can vote for a man who stood before a cheering crowd\nAnd mocked her reporters disability and it was on that day in January of two thousand Seventeen that somebody reached out to me after reading my Facebook posts and said listen I'm just asking have you seen this and what she sent me privately was linked to a Youtube video which was entitled\nDebunking that Trump mocked the disabled reporter and for anybody who hasn't seen this as a compilation of footage I'm much of it is on the campaign trail but some of it even goes back\nTen years ago of Donald Trump doing that exact same voice in that exact same gesture as he did that\nDay when he was quote unquote mocking the disabled reporter but what's clear when you watch this compilation is that this is a voice in a fit that Donald Trump does when he's imitating someone who was caught in a lie or doing something shady or grumbling because they've been caught doing something dishonest and I I Know some stupid now\nDating someone who was caught in a lie or doing something shady or grumbling because they've been caught doing something dishonest and I I Know some stupid now shot but it's like it was the first time in my entire life that I really realized that the media was capable of creating a completely false narratives and then isolating a moment out of contact\nTo push that merits if it had nothing to do with news or the truth\nBrand that let me ask you something now once your eyes are open and once you become aware of their bias and it's like you you you ask yourself ... myself and it's even worse than it's ever been how did you not see it before do you ever say that to yourself\nOh yeah yeah it's absolutely the kind of thing that once you see it you can't see it and what you just said is actually kind of the next\nPart of the story because then I went back to the beginning of the campaign and revisited all of those other moments like Trump calls all Mexicans rapists Trump advocates for the sexual assault of all women you know I went back and revisit those moments and found the same thing time and again that's not what happened\nThat is not what happened but they made a decision after he won that primary or it was clear that he was going to win the Republican primary that it wasn't funny anymore that he was running suddenly it was scary and that they had to turn this man into the the scariest candidate that the world had ever seen so\nThey may I ask you this when I when I tell my audience\nTo expect and I showed a lot of the ads that are out last night and I've been I've been showing these instances people that are in the public eye that are conservative more support the president you know they're being run out of restaurants and I'm Talking about women and children good luck to anybody wants to try and run me out of a restaurant I'll give it your best shot\nYou know I noticed that it either happens to a guy with his wife or or an older person or women\nYou know what when they're a bunch of cowards the when they do that because I'd never treat anybody that way but you know this is the narrative every two and four years in elections in America that Republicans are racist or sexist massage in is that there are homophobic\nXena phobic Islamophobia that they weren't dirty air and water Obama use those actual words\nThat they want children to die\nAnd they'll have some commercial with the Paul Ryan look alike thrown granny over the cliff because they want to kill your grandmother that's what they do that to their play book we're watching it unfold today even Thirteen Days out of the election\nUm do you see now that all of that is not true there's not one thing that is true about that look at the stakes for African Americans Hispanic\nAmericans Asian Americans women in the workforce um the lowest unemployment levels ever recorded for these demographics ever\nDo and absolutely seeing that now and in fact I think a lot of others are starting to see it as well which is resulting in what you just said that even I think the most\nAh these minority groups in particular that I think the Democratic party for so long has taken for granted that this oh these are just automatic vote well that's not the case anymore I mean people really are starting to wake up and they're starting to walk away because they're seen so\nHow many people have joined your movement\nSo that the movement began on Facebook and in that are rich in that\nFirst initial Facebook group we now have over two hundred and five thousand poverty on ...\nYeah all social media platforms we have about four hundred thousand and to be clear for anyone who doesn't know this is a testimonial campaign so these are just people who are going on social media and clicking follower clicking like they are telling their stories about why they are walking away\nSo I mean they're they're making videos they're writing these stories down I mean people are there this is for like a network of support and people are leaving are walking away from the left\nUh let me bring and buzz Patterson as we've been around the block of time or to a new around the Clintons a lot a Hillary Clinton we can't be civil with with people we disagree with something like okay you know if you don't want to be you know I ran into let's say that the senator\nCivil with with people we disagree with something like okay you know if you don't want to be\nYou know I ran into what's that that the senator from that we ran into Linda when we were in Washington Blumenthal I ran into him on the streets right when I was going to do my show a night and then when you know and this was right in the middle of the Kavanaugh hearings and it was being a lunatic and I knew I was ... and how are you what's going on man 'cause I'm\nI have no what am I going to confront him on the street and didn't scream adamant that it I mean I don't get this behavior
