hundreds of eyes are looking straight at you and it's easy to lose your place in situations like this it simply\nUnemployable you rely on your old vocal filler standbys hum a or maybe you just hesitate and stop talking altogether these are what Michael Moore regard calls verbal blunders and just fluency\nOr art was intrigued by this phenomenon and how it infiltrate our everyday lives so we investigated and laid out his findings in his book\nHome slips stumbles and verbal blunders and what they mean\nOne thing he found out is that we all stumble those some of us are better able to finance it than others\nThere are certainly people who you know when they say these things some of them do it well they make it sound natural and they use to fill the pause as a kind of punctuation and I've heard announcers on television do this quite a bit\nAnd there are other people of course who said between every single word and that really annoys me but I quit admired the first instance I don't know that I Am quite good enough [laughter]\nAs a speaker to be able to do it I don't know if it's deliberately maybe that's just a matter of style but that is true that everyone does have their own baseline level of this fluency\nDoes fluency is a name for hesitations like I'm at a to get an understanding of why they creep into our speech there aren't as soon as you have to know how we talk what's going on on our brain and our mouth work together it might surprise you to learn that we don't speak in sentences\nSentences are something that will be more familiar and writing rather than speaking what we're doing when we're talking as there were assembling groups of words and sometimes those words group of smaller or larger units and there's a basic\nArchitecture to those phrases and to those clauses that we sat in our minds first\n... writes about her upbringing and life in rural America in her book heartland a memoir of working hard and being broke in the richest country on earth\nAnd it was actually a pretty beautiful thing I was a pretty solitary kid by necessity to start sort of geographic isolation but I always had animals and nature to interact with\nMeanwhile within the laws of our house there was all sorts of strife and dysfunction much of which had to do in my view with economic struggle\nAnd so that's part of the story too but you know it it is an experience this thing recall rural America that I actually\nFeel quite privileged to have lived in that is an increasingly rare experience an urbanized country\nSmart ... book is about growing up on farmland in Kansas but more than being a book about geography it's about what are you just don't like to grow up poor she says she was inspired to write her memoir because of the way she sees America putting such important son Wilson status\nI Can't say that in those moments let's say as a child qualifying for free school lunches or as a first generation college student not knowing what the term graduate school ... someone talked about applying to graduate school\nNot having the right clothes and so on the other thing that I see now looking back that I did feel discomfort Shane embarrassment I was not necessarily conscious of that I wouldn't have necessarily articulated it that way\nBut the thing is we live in a society that is full of messages for people who struggle financially that that your value and worth is somehow tied to your financial value and worth and if that's the case in the context of capitalism and my family and I are pretty worthless [noise]\nThat's of course the impetus for this book is to provide a sort of corrective of that deeply ingrained social attitude I think that even politically liberal and progressive people I find sometimes called\nSmart said it was her experience as a college student that really taught or what a disadvantage being from a poor family living in rural America truly was\nI was a first generation college student I had already been working as a teenager for years at a really also hustling as a student to work hard for the scholarships that I knew would be my only ticket to a college education so by the time I showed up on campus at age Eighteen hours already tired [laughter]\nAnd then those years they're double majoring working to make ends meet keeping my grades\nUp on campus at age Eighteen hours already tired [laughter]\nAnd then those years they're double majoring working to make ends meet keeping my grades up to maintain the scholarships that paid for my tuition and all those things as a financially independent Eighteen year old\nWas you know while for some of my friends they might remember college as the most to care for years of their lives for me they were really the hardest years of my life and that's the class divide in this country sort of manifest in my life\n... book is about much more than having to work her way through college by not having as much fun as her classmates she says that some members of America as upper class don't recognize the full scope of what it means for others to live in poverty\nThe most crucial thing to point out would be just a very physical nature of poverty and the dangers often model ones that actually that come with that life so\nI when I was in second grade my dad who was a farmer in a carpenter still couldn't make ends meet and those two industries for all his hard labor so he took a side job driving ban for a company that basically picked up industrial waste and then disposed of a percent whatever laws and regulations\nAnd so he would go around and said to places that new oil changes and pick up their spent oil and such\nAnd somewhere along the way you know nobody knows exactly what had happened but likely one of these businesses that he picked up the chemical waste on had improperly mixed things that weren't supposed to be mixed\nAnd so that was in the back of this than my dad was driving and the fumes seeped into the cab of van and and nearly killed him so he was in the hospital for weeks and for probably three years after that was in a kind of mental pays\nAnd you know this is just being a human being on planet earth comes with dangers that you can't necessarily escape with money but so often people who need money to most are the ones that do the least desirable job and they're the least desirable jobs because of the dirtiest than most dangerous work\nMarsh indicated that there are two particularly destructive causes of the wealth divide in America first the way our capitalism can push those living in poverty or they're out of the fold\nNo I'm not a political scientist and I'm not a policy expert but I Do know that the regulation of private industry has\nBasically over the course of my lifetime I was born in Nineteen eighty has led to a country where okay perhaps we have smaller government but in its place we have bigger business that can be just as potent of a force in people's lives and when it's geared toward profit rather than the public good you have situations like today a moment of historic\nWealth inequality when the c._e._o. of some corporation and make like three thousand times the salary of the workers on the floor and so on and so that's one piece of the puzzle I think it's sort of these impenetrable systems that an individual doesn't stand a chance against in many ways\nThe second main issues marsh pointed out was how our health care system in places poor people in positions of disadvantage\nDental care in this country is incredibly difficult to access for people in poverty and actually the Affordable CARE Act that was passed in twenty fourteen as a kind of compromise to the other side of the aisle removed dental policies from that coverage as though somehow\nThe health of one's teeth in separate from the rest of one\nBody and so they're a lot of hard working people who labor sixty hours a week then end up with a cavity that goes untreated\nAnd my dad is in this group he ended up with an infection up into the route that turned into step to so essentially he had blood poisoning from what could have been treated originally as a cavity\nAnd so for somebody like my dad who these don't look like the famous shiny perks\nFame and celebrity that we idolize in this country\nLet's say that he did everything right according to the American dream work he's an honest man\nAnd let's say he gets laid off and then he needs to go find another job he goes into a job interview and because of the person interviewing hair holding classes news essentially or ideas about my dad's case looking like something that they associate with\nDirty people he doesn't get the job and then says he doesn't get the job he can't afford to get his teeth thick\nWhile her book explores these issues and more it's also written with a defiant pride in her childhood\nSmart says society expects a poor girl from Kansas to feel shame that's why she reasons terms like red neck and white trash\nOr thrown around so pejorative ally but ... says those so called red neck tendencies led to some of her fondest memories for instance the time her grandfather ring canoe to a pickup truck and drove the family through the snow for some thrills in a flat area of Kansas\nThat's a story that you know I had a special place in my heart and yet it is something that someone would look at that ... that portrayal within a movie it would be like oh there are some redneck or to white trash thing do\nI write against those words and the center in the book because really what's going on when people want to get high on the horse about their socioeconomic status as the period because of what else is really just\nThat comes from the same place as any other sort of derogatory term we as a society has a gun at least I think to contend with racial slur at an ethic that's about women\nBut we haven't really examine how frequently we needed words and language which are very powerful that on a fairly cut down people just for their poverty\nSarah ... book heartland is available now for links and more information on all of our gas visit our site that viewpoints

that's odd isn't he ran in ... so the guy that ... demon possessed ran and worships Jesus that's really important so I'm not going to I'm not going to turn this into a college class on ... but just to say a few things what a demon do that\nA demon wouldn't come to worship God\nThe person so that's important when you read the story so there's something in this guy there's something you you you see a part of the guy and then here in a moment we'll hear the demon right\nSo he ran and worshipped him and he cried out with a loud voice what do I have to do with you Jesus son of the most I got I implore you by God that you don't tournament me now who's talking\nTruly good ... that's really important to try to dissect those two forty and said come out of the man unclean spirit many ask him Jesus asking what's your name so now who's Jesus talk into he's talking\nThey did I say first of all the demon answered and said my name is legion for where many so let me just say this in passing that scripture right there has built a doctrine that in some when they when they deal with demon possession believe that that is the pre script that you have\nTo cast a demon out you have\nTalk to the demon you have to get the demons named before you can cast the demon out and so there's there's people in some streams that that they they they spend a ton of time trying to talk to the demon\nI don't see it as a pre script because there's other portions of scripture where a demon was cast out and there was no conversation that took place at all\nSo all I'm telling you is is is make sure you don't make a doctor and out of something that\nMaybe you can't make a doctrine out right okay anyhow so the demon begged him or his way that he would not send them out of the country now this is a wild story guys now a large hurt or swine was feeding near the mountains how big of a large her to do more than two [noise]\nWe did for a there was a time about twenty five years ago and an ... dairy barn we owned of an old house that way and I I at the maximum Lee had Seventy one pigs\nSeventy one pigs produce a lot of stuff [noise]\nA large hurt us wind was feeding near the mountains so all the demons bed him Jesus saying send this to the swine that we may honor them some of ask why is that\nOne of the things that you know people that are more well versed in deem and all the G than I Am is that demons need to be embodied\nAre you with me right so they got at once Jesus gave him permission the under Clinton spirits went out and entered the swine there\nAbout two thousand can you imagine two thousand swine that's five hundred and less than the entire city of fire\nI mean I'm just trying to put this in numbers you know this room I don't know how big this room could handle you know pigs but two thousand page says a lot of pigs K.\nThan the unclean spirits went out entered the swine there about two thousand\nAnd the herd random violence down a steep place into the sea and around and see\nWhat a gruesome figure\nSo the only thing that I can liken it to in my brain is maybe a a movie with Native American Indians where they were hunting buffalo I mean that's about the only thing that my brain can wrap around and go wow\nThat must have looked life if you were there to watch two thousand pigs first of all the pig is a pig\nNow how about a demon possess pigs now that's a big of a different color [noise]\nMe it's like wow two thousand them of a moron off can you imagine just the body count the the pile the carnage to not think about\nDays later I mean I'm not trying to be gross to be gross but get a picture of this miracle this miracle endured\n\nFor a long time thinking about it\nPeople heard about this right 'cause ... we're we're going to come across the fact that they talked about this story how it happened they told over and over again how this happened and people could go and look at\nThey all they had to do stand on the edge and look over the edge of the seats and see this carnage at some point in time there'd be no flash left but can you imagine how it's done for how long I mean it lasted a long time and then the thing that could be bleach bones\nYou imagine how it's done for how long I mean it lasted a long time and then the thing they would like to be bleach bones of two hundred two thousand pins and credible somebody asked me they said so that leaves demons die\nKnow their eternal spirits so guess what the\nWhen the pigs died\nThey went somewhere else\nAnd inhabited some someone else amazing okay a couple\nOf things that just keep in mind and the miracle noticed that they obeyed Jesus\nI Want to encourage you as a blood Bob child of God the authority that that Christ game when he when he rose again from the dead victorious Lee he gave that authority to you and I as believers are you with me let me just give a metaphor\nBecause I'm I'm only fifty eight but I've been around a lot of circles and a lot of people that talk about and deal with demons and [noise]\nAnd it's been interesting to me to see how different people approached that subject on on a practical level how they actually deal with it\nI've been with several groups that felt like you know you had to have this conversation with a demon and and you know casting a demon out would take hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and I never quite understood that because how many of you know that every everything has to balance the name of Jesus Christ\nOr are you with me that that name as above all names above all names but if this room you know prior to\nTime this morning Sunday is probably the one that turn the lights on in this room but this room was dark and let's pretend that this the darkness was was represented evil\nAnd win sunny turn the lights on a war didn't take place or you would think ... didn't go I Want to stay\nI didn't know you have to leave him darkness but no I don't want to leave and it got dark and light and dark and later in life and art like and then finally you\nKnow I mean if you know didn't happen that way when you flip the switch and the power of that electricity energizes the Philippines and those lights what has to happen to darkness\nLet me tell you\nWhen you speak the name of Jesus that's slipping a switch the power of the holy ghost in in in stills your words humans had to flee\nPraise praise the lord pastor limb [noise] I'm so happy about that [noise]\n\nIt's interesting when you talk about demon possession do a lot of people and listen I get that you may go your lifetime and you may not ever come across a truly demon possessed person\nBut just in the event that you do I want you to know that the power that resides inside of you is no different than the power and that electricity that energizes that light bulbs and there does not have to be this silly war that takes place between you and some demon\nWhen you speak the name of Jesus do you have the same authority that Jesus game because he transferred that authority to you in a [noise]\nSo you don't approach it arrogant bully\nHim in\nBecause demonic power is a really powerful\nThe power of the Lord Jesus Christ\nIs way more powerful man okay\nImagine you're you're the keeper from you know your caller she hurt her I've never heard of a ... herder but they're obviously was so so those who said the swine the sheep ...\nTold

to connect with one another to love and to be kind to one another\nAnd and that not look for the religiosity at every turn\nThere are times for that there are times for reflection there are times for deep prayer obviously\nAnd to sit and ponder the things have God whether it be through meditation godly biblical meditation or to connect with God in those ways all wonderful\nHowever\nHe's being

saying to let this go you were saying the harbor any guilt it wasn't my fault you know I was a child and I and I didn't rescue him I I panic\nBut and you didn't have the ability to rescue him\nRight I didn't and so it can't be your fault\nRight and I and I took a long time to to realize that it wasn't my fault and but\nYou know just to let it go I mean just to say goodbye to him um to pray for him and\nI I don't know it was just a really difficult thing to go through and being a paramedic I've seen it will drown and bit on the other side of it too um there was a really strange day\nI Want you to take all those the physical things in in seeing someone lose their life obviously very potent scripture says do not fear those that can kill the flesh but those that can kill the spirit and want you to think about all of those people that are grounding spiritually every single day because no one wants to do anything about it they're embarrassed to share their faith or whatever it might be\nAnd the situation you're describing is that you immediately grew into a person who said you know what I Want to know what to do and became a paramedic which you witnessed with your daughter was is that you know the symbolism of of baptism is the deaths in the burial\nAnd the resurrection\nAs they come up out of the water and I think all of that that imagery is very powerful but what you do with it is up to you ... you know the same knife you may use for a tracheotomy an emergency tracheotomy is the uh\nFull but what you do with it is up to you ... you know the same knife you may use for a tracheotomy an emergency tracheotomy is the uh is a nice that could be used to kill somebody and just to not put value a positive or negative on these things the water the knife to\nAny of these things but to see them as a proper usage and improper usage and what you've got you've got to see both in the same body of water and\nYou got to see both sides of the beauty of that water and the power of that water in the sense of that it could take a life um but to dwell on it or somehow\nI'm a let it weigh you down when it's obviously been a a you know positive or productive in your life piece of your life because you've taken it and said I'm going to do something good with it you have to let you have to let the power of that lake\nOr the mystery of the lake go away but you don't have to forget what took place there you don't forget what you learn they're going to forget the life\nUm but you couldn't do anything and guilt is irrelevant it doesn't mean anything has no benefit in this particular case I think that you should enjoy the beauty of what your daughter went through\nAnd that should be a significant part of your like equally as significant as the death that you witnessed because if you really believe what it says in scripture\nIt says that the fear is not in the flesh being lost but the spirit being lost and so you were able to sit there and watch your daughter come into a new life in Christ and that's a very powerful and wonderful thing and I'm Sorry that you went through that experience but it's obvious that it has\nDone something and meant something in a way that has become very very productive in your life that glorifies gone the other gives the enemy total foothold\n\nDale welcome to the Jesus Christ show hello Jesus I Do\nI'm I'm the
