women are subjugated by the mountain men run your house right was but that that's what this means patriarchy white women benefit from patriarchy by trading on their whiteness\nTo monopolize resources for mutual gain other words they trade on their whiteness defined rich white guys to marry they sell out the sisterhood they sell themselves out\nAll to be placed on pedestals\nBut in doing so they

understand is\nThe American left today despises America as founded\nAnd this may be a bit of a simplification but I Do this in order to communicate and be understood\nAnd it's very essence the modern day American Left as taught and educated over the past two generations\nThrough middle school high school and college has been taught to hate America because America is unjust from our founding days because it was founded by white men\nAnd white men found a place for themselves and it's loaded everybody else and everybody else has been getting the short end of the stick for over two hundred plus years\nAnd only now\nIs the awareness insensitivity to this day and realized only now are the victims of this white privilege of this white power only now are they standing up and demanding to be heard only now are there are rising up in a righteous indignation and\nDemanding fairness and redress and the only way that can happen is for the white power structure of white privilege to be destroyed\nAnd replaced by a coalition of all of those who have been victimized\nSegregated punished\nMistreated abused what have you Byron them reclaiming or not reclaiming but claiming what is just lay there\nAnd that is America and its political systems and that's what young people have been taught and now\nAs as evidenced by that column I wrote by are read by Alexis Grinnell or any other of

you think that the way they framed him with the media is something they're going to use later on to frame the entire Supreme Court\nLet's see there's actually a story with that exact point may the here and I think I moved to the bottom of the stack but it is is a woman making the point that Kevin raw\nIs as good as guilty because he could have done it and he could have done it because he's a man he could have done it because\nHe has male genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe lousy for the cameras could have done it well if you're old woman with the sun is and a husband that you love and some brothers and you're watching this you wouldn't miss\nOne is transpiring that men are automatically guilty all it takes is an allegation the obligation doesn't require any evidence in fact the fact that there is no evidence adds to the fact that the allegation is likely to have happened\nBecause that's\nWhat men do be cause\nMan can and men can because\nThey have the genitalia necessary to do it I don't know if you're an average ordinary decent woman watching this stuff how in the world you want to sign onto that well you don't\nAnd so now these leftist women

becoming less and less\nDependable because they weren't buying Obama an Obamacare and because of that they were becoming racist a traditional Democrat little guy voting bloc they\nExpress no interest
