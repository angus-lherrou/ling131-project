all in one thing I noticed a a inhibitor right before the program yesterday and I missed it I didn't I didn't catch this until after the program yesterday little Bryan's daughter\n\nThe CNN media critic\nWas on CNN yesterday complaining that Trump is in the media too much that Trump is talking too much that Trump won't shut up he is doing great damage to the country is damaging the media because he's too they all\nDo you ever heard of the drive and buys worrying about too much access ... actually you know what they don't have that well they do have access Trump stops in talks to them wherever he sees a pack up and gathered\nNow he may not accept every interviewer request which they would define as as access but they cannot say that Trump is hiding from them like Obama did\nLook I'm forty eight and one in the primaries actually it's much higher than that because I endorsed a lot of people that were successful that people don't even talk about but many of those forty eight hours you know where people that have no chance in some cases\nWe look at Florida you look at Donovan in Staten Island he was losing by ten points I endorsed him he won I can give you a long list of names look at Georgia governor\nMany many ways has and I will say that we have a very big impact I don't believe anybody's ever had this kind of impact haven't they would say that in the old days if you got the support of a president\nOr if you got the support or somebody it would be nice to have but it meant nothing zero like literally zero well some of the people live indoors to have gone up forty and fifty points just on the endorsement\nIn knowing where in that state does Donald Trump say he doesn't even addressed the house being lost he doesn't even accept that premise a pie offers\nIt as a premise told they say if Republicans lose control the house with a ... do you believe you better responses\nBut no I think I'm helping people that becomes a headline Trump tells a pie he\nWon't accept blame of GOP loses house now the eight people tell you well that's essentially what he was saying no it isn't essentially you are miss quoting\nDonald Trump does not looking at himself as a negative at all he's not looking forward and seeing the need for a skill says a P he thinks he's helping people he thinks he is helping secure victory but it's not even in his mind that they're going to lose and somebody's going to blame him\nThis is why Trump never\nMisses an opportunity to talk to the media is why he tweets over and over and over again so now we got a little Bryan's daughter at CNN soundbite number one this was actually it was Sunday Morning I got I guess\nI was mistaken I thought it would have happened yesterday Sunday Morning on his program reliable sources talking about Trump\nThe president of the United states is the country's biggest promoter of misinformation and he's been an awfully Saturday mood Bailey super talkative holding ... interviews of cats on air force one called in the Fox news one like this weekend and woke up and call then again the next morning\nAnd the result is even more pollution in the air and on the air\nI Wish this weren't the case I Wish the factors weren't working overtime on his comments\nHe says it Trump's new media appearances so confusion in division ... trouble lies all the time\nUsually in definitely a good thing for the press to have more access to powerful people Trump the downside of that access to the same so much stuff that's on through that it's so there's confusion and division\nThat's the powerful people but when Trump the downside of that access to these saying so much stuff that's on through that it's so there's confusion and division that's where USA Today that by running the presidential off at the other day full of ... and that's what Fox and friends that by putting up on the phone for forty six minutes and then not correct in many of their students\nTo read a little little Brian is speaking for all of the media what he's saying is damaged\nDamn it we can't find a way to tell people how Trump's lying and spreading misinformation he's not giving us a chance to do our jobs he is expressing frustration Trump is sucking all the oxygen up another room\nNever have I heard this before the drive by media whining and complaining that there's too much access the president's talking too

News\nUncertainty over a blue wave to NBC News fine Democrat and GOP voter registrations\nA Democrat and G O P voter registrations at the same level as past election cycles\nA but but but but but but but but but\nThe Democrats had Michelle my bell out there during the whole big voter registration drive out there\nThe Democrats have been registering voters in prison they've been registering voters is a DMV they've been registering voters at the at the at the at the medical marijuana places they've been registering voters everywhere how in the world is it possible\nThat democratic voter registration levels at the same as past cycles the Democrats have been telling us that there's so much energy there is so much excitement there so much motivation there so much inspiration to do nothing and hold them back and yet and yet\nThe generic ballot once again is showing that this massive Democrat blue wave is not as big as once thought\nAnd now NBC is is is very very worried they're worried that something\nThat's not a blue wave may be shaping up here\nThat's what this headline is certainly over a blue wave NBC News finds Democrat and GOP voter registration at the same level as past cycles comparing registration activity for twenty four teams are twenty sixteen with activity from twenty sixteen ... current\nHelps put these numbers in that context but it should be noted that twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen include I complete\nPicture of registration in front of those years\nWhereas twenty Eighteen only includes registration activity up until this point in time what that's all you need them if you're not registered yet the odds are you're not going to be registered in time to vote so it's that seems like a little\nHope will we don't have a full database numbers for to do so they say well you've got enough to know\n[noise] so how can this be how can voter registration with Democrats are supposed to be smoking us in\nVoter registration 'cause there's so much more interest there so much hatred for Trump there's so many people that want to fix that mistake and then\nA column from the Washington Post by Megan McCarthy dull trying\nTo help the Democrats are she believes are morally superior and smarter than Republicans\nHeadlined will the blue wave collapse before it reaches the shore\nWhat Megan McCarthy all in this op ed Washington Post is doing is trying to help Democrats is saying that the Kavanaugh hearings backfired\nOn the Democrats because it alienated man and now she's warning the Democrats to stop to hide their agenda of identity politics until they get into power she's telling you guys have got to put the masked\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if\nThere is a lot of pressure brought to bear on Mahler to reveal this release it are are Rosenstein whoever\nAnd somebody\nLike Trump says well okay hard if you want to see it go ahead and they release it and there's nothing\nThat indicates Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything in it on obstruction because folks in one of the week they're sixteen never Trump anti Trump paid mongers on Mueller's team if they had the gods yeah what a week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to get one key a blue wave\nIf Mueller doesn't have any of that than there is no way they want this released before the midterms that's why\nThere ... or has it ready they're going to try to take advantage of what they can make people think the report says I remember they have two years no more than that and a two and a half years of steady reporting that Trump and Russia colluded\n\nSo in their minds they're probably thinking a sizable number of American voters believe the Trump\nRussia collusion happens so Mueller's report is Randy it's to be released Susan create the impression that it's only a matter of time\nNow before Trump is tied to the Russians were collusion and use that way to impact\nThe voting in turn out prior to the midterms gum just going to tell ya if this report doesn't advance this narrative that Trump cheated and stole the election they're not going to want this out before the midterms you imagine the left town that what you don't know\nYou don't know how many\nCommon ordinary everyday democratic voters literally believe that Trump won this election by cheating with Russia you'd be stuck on the number of your\nFellow Democrats citizens in New York and Los Angeles and San Francisco in Chicago who believe it like gospel\nDespite all realm of common sense despite every bit of knowledge we have it there is no evidence for just like how many of them believe both the Ford\nTheir politics requires that they believe that it's mandates they believe that if they are told\nBefore the midterms that the mall or report doesn't have this evidence and will not lead to President Trump being indicted on that basis what does that do to turn out\nNow don't misunderstand I think Mueller's report whenever it is released is going to really be targeted at Trump as an incompetent as a bull ... who are in gay injured the United states electoral system\nWith his hires and with some of the people on the staff like Carter Page I think they're going to fire both barrels at Trump as an incompetent who nearly brought the world to nuclear Armageddon\nBecause of his incompetence and stupidity but I don't think there's going to be any evidence of it and the fact that there is no evidence is what tells me they don't want this out\nBefore the midterms I could be wrong only have to wait and see it won't be long

another policies highly antagonistic to Republicans Trump on the other hand\nGets approval from only five percent of Republicans and that's where it's been throughout his presidency so Republicans in

destroy the country over the last uh pay to a a sixty years\nWell I don't think that\nThe media\nIs right now focused on separating Trump from his voters I think they they know that's too late\nI don't think that's what their objective here in the midterms is um I think they're very frustrated they haven't been able to do anything could be it would the icing on the ... I think their primary objective now is to flood the zone\nWith anti Trump voters\nDemocrats made up of every disparate coalition a group you can find they are trying to assemble this gigantic Democrat Party that as a combination coalition of minority here minority that just constant Adam altogether and get a big majority party and that's that's where they're trying to generate the turnout\nUm\nBecause they know they're not going to distance Trump from uh from his voters so the the focus I think is on joining up\nA first time participation\nUm and that's why this this enthusiasm thing is so important and the inspiration and stuff and the anger so that's why I think that they have strategically become the party of anger I think they are using this anger\nAnd they are exploiting it to generate turnout\nBased on what they think is the majority of Americans have hate ... I I think they they they move past the idea that there's a bunch of Trump voters that regret it and can be inspired to show up and vote Democrat as I say if they can make that happen to be icing on the cake\nI think you can see the frustration in them every day you can see the frustration in perusing\nThe news as I Do more and more stories that are starting to raise red flags about the blue wave\n\nAnd there are some big brush them from doing this on purpose they're sucking you when they're making you think they're given up they're making you think they're trying to disparage trying to make you think you got it in a bag no they're not going to ever pull that off not here not with me\nBut I don't think that's the case either I I don't think that they are I Would have that much discipline to be able to have media wide threw out the entire\nLeft wing media universe a disciplined approach to runs fake stories about the blue wave not happening I think it's a legit I've never I've never believed there was gonna be a blue wave\nI never have\nWilling to put that out there and I if I ended up being wrong Soviet I'm not afraid of being wrong it doesn't happen\nEnough times for me to be worried about it\nBut it is I have never thought because common sense does not suggest that like I said yesterday where is the evidence that Democrats\nHave been able to put together a winning coalitions and flooding the elections in a way on the outside of areas they dominate like New York Los Angeles San Francisco Chicago they had been losing elections they had been losing seats left and right starting in two thousand ten that hasn't reversed\nThey didn't win with the cabinet thing they haven't won with anything trying to get rid of Trump they haven't been able to stop Trump on an even they're stupid travel uh order the layers using the judge is Trump is succeeding implement\nThey haven't been able to stop drop off even they're stupid travel uh order the layers using the judge is Trump is succeeding implementing his agenda there's some things he hasn't been able to do it like a total repeal of Obamacare but\nThey have not been able if you you would think if all of these things were true people hate Trump regret their votes a wish it had never happened regret that Trump is President Trump wouldn't be getting anywhere near done what he's getting done there'd be universal opposition to it if\nThe Democrats are right about all this but they're not write about it so I I I\nThe evidence on the ground isn't there that there's a blue wave waiting to happen there is evidence all over the place the Democrats are Boston and fit to be tied over the fact that they're losing\nThen you couple that with their their mentality that says winning is their birthright power is their birthright their entitlement but elections haven't been going their way how in the world\nStopped to think if all of this that they're saying is true Hillary wonder ones in the first temple to never won in the first place if all this talk of a blue wave right now is true\n\nThey thought they had it in the bag and two thousand sixteen and they were revved an energized too there were there wasn't any talk of Democrats not turning out back then anyway I'm a little long segments going to be short\nAll of us that I read about it in the paper tomorrow Raj Shah ... be network\nWhen you put a safe in your home what will you put in it what are your most valuable possessions well there's just one brand to say if you should trust to put in your home and that's\nRight oh saves the craftsmanship of their iron works apes which are made in America would amaze you it takes skills sweats and talent to produce the most beautiful and secure or safe in the world and that's what rhino saves are\nBeautiful creations that help keep your possessions secured part art\nPart furniture and one hundred percent security rhino saves are built to protect you and your family from the uncertainties of this world now\nHow do you get your own rhino metal safe well check out their extensive dealer network online at rhinos safe dot com veteran owned and veteran operated for over Twenty years that's our age I Am old rhino\nSafe dot com they make the delivery and insulation easy by with peace of mind rhino safe dot com\nDoes your dog it's scratched tinker shed like crazy come to die for our quarter\nAnd Ninety Days plant dynamite dying to fight for life\nPick up to to the darker sides get the third to pre temperament to treat lavender dogma said shampoo made with all natural coconut ... aloe great for healthy skin and soft shiny counts but no itchy harsh chemicals lather up rinse away try darker sides by to get one free at dynamite dot com", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "17"}
