the people that she abused and then you got ... where there is plenty of evidence and accusations against him where there was no best occasion but it's basically the double standards\nIf they hear you're raising a great point if they cared about the issue they would be demanding FBI investigations\nWe can go back now to Juanita Broderick and we can certainly go back to Keith Ellison where there's Dr reports and text messages and\nAudiotape made even the videotape of him you know being emotionally abusive physically abusive towards his ex girlfriend so yeah I think that would be a

bringing up the true for everybody\nI'm Glad to be here every day thank you for giving me this microphone\n[laughter] I'm basically all I wanted to say is is the obvious this of this whole case is that um sword it's perfectly willing to do\nA judge Kavanaugh what she has accused him of doing it to her assaulting her or him on a daily basis with this fall state in the first and\nThen just so much fake uh evidence everywhere\nListen she she identified and there's a there's a part of me that really sympathizes with this is such a serious issue and and I don't think we give the Republicans enough credit for how they've handled this including the president they handled it with the proper seriousness the topic deserves she gave the names of four people\nAnd none of the pork in corroborate her story including the guy that was supposed to be an eye witness to it at that point\nThey really can't go any further with it and he adamantly denies it so it's um it's a matter of just simple okay if somebody corroborated it we'd be in a very different position today\nI got to take a quick break final have power free for all our Sean Hannity show and we will continue from our nation's capital

[noise]\n\nMichelle mocking here some of my work you know one of the biggest outrageous I reported on was the trial of abortion doctor ... now and the woman goes you know when it comes down and there's no police report and I helped expose the crimes the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions directly from governor regions often not to ...\nWhen the producers of the gods now is he came to me for him I jumped to the camera I personally donated to\nExactly I mean Republicans bless their hearts are so literal that they offer this stuff every single time and they feel that they have to debate the details of this or that case when actually there's nothing to do with the details with justice itself this is a tactic designed to hold onto power when\n... an Andrew Gillum got the nomination for governor in Florida My very first thought was the sentence is going to be erased watch this has to be they're going to paint him as one within twenty four hours they flip around some use some harmless phrase next thing you know the lead of every show Ron to San Francisco racist you knew that was going to happen because it had to happen\nAnd luckily there there are in Nineteen Ninety eight a radio ad in Missouri by the Democratic party said uh you know elect Republicans black cross a cost is going to be burnt on people's\nLawns or ... well the James Byrd at I mean Al Gore telling a predominantly black audience Republicans have the wrong agenda for African Americans they don't even want to kill you in the census at all\nAnd just really outrageous claims and you know one of the things I'd like to see come out of this that what has now become a predictable tactic that they get called out on this\nBrett Kavanaugh up until two weeks ago yesterday was a gentleman gentlemen and now all of these allegations all of these solicitations and it doesn't matter like if Michael ... is making the claim that thirty six years ago\nThat there was a gang of boys that were roots\nPerls and then waiting in line to gang and trail raped them and that this was happening with a regular occurrence but nobody said it at the time nobody told the teacher a law enforcement official apparent that it just kept going on and was covered up for this long\nBut there's I Know where I go to why went to school and one kid got in trouble for anything everybody knew within seconds\nWell it's ridiculous I mean his client is alleging that she went to nine consecutive ... gang raped in a row and never said anything to anybody and no one else did either in she on the tenth one was right for sale and didn't say a single word about it for thirty seven years okay I don't have time for that actually there's a whole country\nWith all sorts of real problems to address ten to ... you really have to be a Republican senator since you had to take that seriously these people fall for the same character every single time it's football\nAnd you have like the senator from Arizona's like oh really need to give us a hearing really if there are plausible claims being made yes they should be investigated this is a guy who's had six FBI investigations into his background in a space Twenty years\nRadical clearance that allowed him ... codes took a nuclear arsenal he was fat vetted and yet we needed another on the basis of claims that have no sister actually shut all remnants hacking Christine for it I'm just making the obvious point\nShe claims that this happened she named for people she says repressive all for say it didn't happen\nAnd no one has the brass to ask our questions in the\nBook it's a joke at is what's actually happening is a joke and only the Republicans in the Senate don't know it's a\nJob well this is about either some said they had no recollection amber of anything like that ever happening or being at any party in the case of her best friend she said well I I don't doubt what professor border saying but I don't have any recollection but also professor of foreign identified one person\nAnd that was mark judge Jim mark judge having been in the room when this alleged assault took place and he has said over and over again that's not true now they made statements under\nPenalty of felony and if they so when the FBI goes back to them if they changed their story they will be admitting to committing a felony\nSo I'm not really expecting a whole lot to change here except now the Democrats are put out a statement earlier today and they are now demanding all the witnesses telling the FBI how to do their job and meanwhile when they had a chance last week to talk about Mr Ramirez or\nA Michael ... client they passed and they punted and they didn't bring it up\nBut now they want to end it into that aspect and put some\nBut why we playing along with this I mean they actually\nCan tell you why because Jeff Flake and Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski they they wanted this extra worked on it was supposed to be limited in scope and uh just a limited amount of time it didn't turn out that way\nJeff Flake is not in control the Senate they could pass it without flake and where are the leaders other than ... and I hate to say it Lindsey Graham seems to be the only person willing to tell the truth but where the rats were the other Nineteen Republican senators out there on television make their case not just for Brett Kavanaugh but for common sense\nAnd presumption of innocence but where are these people and\nThey they control the United States Senate they haven't passed any of the agenda pretty much that the president land on they're giving the finger to their own voters and on this one thing they can't just tell the truth why is that for art and what are they afraid of exactly I don't understand\nWhat do you think you've been in cable news a long time you were back in the crossfire days I think even had a stint shortly at them as NBC I don't know how that worked out for you but uh I got fired yeah um well I mean I think that they are\nThen his poll conspiracy all hate Trump all the time but I'm now you've been doing really well and the Fox news channel news shows doing really well and uh\nWhat what is the difference that you think is happening with cable news today I mean we're on the opinion side of things and Fox obviously as a news division but I kind of look at what I Do is\nTalk show host as being the entire newspaper we report news sometimes it straight news we even do investigative reporting other days and we give strong opinions other interviews where people give opinion\nUm we do sports we do culture pop culture it's to me it's the whole newspaper all these other people claimed to be reporters and they're anything but\nWe make a lotta news on our show and we have reporters working on the show there are only job is to find new things to fleshed out do interviews I mean I you know I I had been in this my whole life so my family that I don't feel insecure about you know why you're not a journalist whatever I don't care what you called me but we bring new facts\nHawaii every night and I see our job or to try to explain what this means to really confusing time it's I wrote a book about it that's what the book is how do we get here why did this happen why did Trump get elected ... who didn't get a black to grow up what actually happened and what actually happened was\nThe people in charge made a series of incredibly dumb decisions about our culture our economy our foreign policy they never said sorry and they never learn anything and so ... got mad at punish them are good for them to why we're so that's I\nThat's what I think my job is is to explain workers me and I think maybe disagreement but I think that's a valuable thing to do right now\nNo I think the other thing is I'm a believer in strong opinion but at least we're honest about it\nI don't it like for example there'll be days on his radio show we're all we're doing is reporting news same on TV there'll be other days we're doing investigative reporting there were days I'm just giving opinions and taking calls from people that have opinions and that's what it's all under the umbrella of being a talk show host\nYou know people say well Hannity you even said you're not a journalist no but I Do journalism is part of what I Do but we don't just do that [noise] um anyway talking\nA little bit weird that like all the attention that we get there is like nine people in the media who disagree with the prevailing story line and they need to be crushed her silence

like does I wouldn't say yes who wants to live through this\nWell I think the the contrast asked a question here said there's a report out today or poll out today that the FBI supplemental background check doesn't change things\nSixty percent of the people lay the judge Kevin I should be on the bench so if it if that doesn't you know all I can say is it the stakes are high who would follow Kevin

the votes he needs he is a great judge and destroy what I think it's been a process that will destroy the country\nI got to tell you I don't think anyone would even want to run for office under these conditions or you know even for you taken a strong position I mean you've been mirrored in slandered or by all the right people just so yeah I mean people that hate me too so I don't\nKnow I don't think you find out later on I don't think you had a finer moment and all the years I've known you and you know we've had disagreements over lean a keg ... Kagan Sotomayor there is true\nBut I I mean where your righteous indignation and your leadership has has stood out and I applaud you for all you've done and and uh I Hope it works out the right way thank you sir\nThank you for the research you do to prove sack versus fiction you're you're the best on television talk about what actually the truth and make\nSure that eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program could break right back we'll continue\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know\nFledged investigation is now being the seventh from every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work but if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed that these four people were at the party\nNobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse in her case\nUm was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen and then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nWell the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that Mr Ramirez was calling former yell classmates and asking them if they remembered and that she wasn't sure sure herself a village Brett Kavanaugh\nSo that should go away and this one I think is the worst of all and I I guess there's no standards at NBC News any more if they're going to put on somebody that they can't corroborate her stories whose changing or story almost you know by the hour seemingly\nOr even the Democrats um declined to fully embrace three Julie sweat mixed story\nBut on the original story that Christine forward a story I think what we're going fine and what we're already finding um is that the people who gave statements to the Senate Judiciary committee like PJ Smith and mark judge amazingly enough\nThey're telling the FBI the same thing they told Judiciary Committee which they have no memory at all\nOr to support this now I think it's probably a good thing to get additional recollections or you know remember a Senator Whitehouse\nNow I think it's probably a good thing to get additional recollections a you know remember a Senator Whitehouse and other Democrats made a big deal at this party entry and the Brett Kavanaugh calendar July first Nineteen eighty two thirty six years in three months ago by the way\nI'm very interested who is that the party and\nIt didn't match up with a recruiting for its account of this but they thought this was a big deal so let's talk to those people and I think my feeling is that I think there are three additional people calm Bernie and squeak\nUh who had not been interviewed earlier a and I think you're going to find three more people who don't know anything about a Christian for it's a allegations so\nUh I listen I I I don't think this FBI thing that ... is a bad thing I think that they will find out um that there is no evidence to support as we did find out actual real evidence to support it then I changed my mind but I don't think it's fair\nWell if you go through I I thought it was really devastating new report by Rachel Mitchell I'm now she's the independent prosecutor she prosecute sex crimes\nAnd she was hired by the Senate and I think rightly by the Republicans that they wanted to be extremely courteous and thoughtful and and take this very seriously and not make a political so they brought in an independent prosecutor to to question professor Ford who showed incredible respect on her\nBut she pointed out of he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove itself and then she goes on this cases even weaker than that\nAnd then she Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them and for reasons discuss below I don't think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nAnd then she went on to list all the issues there was no consistent account and she gives the example after example of when the alleged assault happened I mean the dates keeps shifting back and forth dramatically actually\nThe failure to previously identified judge Kavanaugh as the assailant are inconsistent descriptions of the alleged assault a failure to remember the details who invited forward to the party how did you get to the party where did the party even take place how did you get home from the party um\nAnd and it goes on from there but every case is similar in as much as there's no collaboration there big holes in the stories and at some point when do we ask\nIs this becoming a witch hunt we know that Deborah cat says her friend sending out emails and she's a woman that went after Paula Jones and supported Al Franken so she's not exactly\nConsistent on the issue of of sexual misconduct and they're sending out letters to the tea or so and so do you know anything please call us at all no those letters when ours\nI Know please some core operation you know the ... case right in the air at times they said they call they talked to thousands of people not to me that says twenty four people or more I mean that is a lot of people can look at it on on the Rachel ritual thing\nYou know she was a lot of criticism of her and um I think that the the way she approached it was not\nA really good way given the limitations of a Senate hearing where they always did she had to be interrupted every five minutes but she did\nLose a lot of information I was looking today at her questioning of a Ford about her therapist Andrea therapists notes and the white we even know about this because remember Ford says it took place in the summer of Nineteen eighty two she did not tell anybody for pan\nAbout ... because remember Ford says it took place in the summer of Nineteen eighty two she did not tell anybody for ten twenty thirty thirty six years to two thousand twelve and she ... she says she's in marriage therapy with her husband and she tells\nThe therapist about that and she later also tells an individual therapist about that as well and she checks\nThe therapists notes and therapists notes do not mention the name Brett Kavanaugh and she says as a matter of fact it's only her husband remembering that at the session she brought up Brett Kavanaugh's name\nThat is the only evidence that it took place in the therapy sessions and by the way you would think such therapy sessions and the note there are would be confidential but of course she gave them to the Washington Post so there's probably no longer\nA confidential so even even her account of how she finally mentioned it to someone after thirty six years raises a lot of questions\nIt really is amazing now we have Judiciary Committee Democrats now they're wanting to investigate the quote ice throwing incident in college and this is what it sounds\nLike you're telling the truth but that's what they say\nWell now we have the the democratic hope uh Hawaii senator the one that said demand to just shut up and sit down and Renault yeah Geraldo is now saying that she wants that investigation into the ice throwing incident\nI'm at a ball game and on top of that now they're questioning the veracity about was he truthful about is drinking he said he ... he liked to drink beer then he likes to drink beer now he said yeah there were plenty of times like a lot of college in high school kids I drink too much beer\nBut they're saying well he must have blacked out in this event\nUm nobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said this somebody I blacked out correct\nSo this is a fishing expedition this is now a destroy Kavanaugh expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him so here's objects question ... go ahead we don't want to get out of\nThe things that are driving range from an emphasis on the the sex misconduct allegations too was he truthful about his drinking and I think that's a reflection of the fact\nThat there really isn't any evidence to support the sex or allegations and now they're talking about whether he told the truth\nAbout drinking although he mentioned many times in his testimony\nThat he did um in fact drink today rocks published an article about his testimony about his drinking that never recorded a single word of his testimony about his drinking Kirk is mischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nAre they going to let it go there thank you so much Byron York a widow's actors on\nWashington Examiner eight hundred nine four one showing us our toll free telephone number as we continue
