campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving that Trump was a potent storage Trump wants to Tony comp was\nCompromised by Russia or because it was Russia that enabled Trump to get rich and his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents the first thing they did was make a B Line key word search however they search it looking for Russia\nRussia and Russian names answer big fat zilch zeroed not a sudden now they're on to something else now they're back to what's always been said about Trump that he got rich from his dad now

investigation\nThey were but I'm telling you they ... they were so sure\nThat that's how they're gonna get Trump that's how they're going to make Mueller's investigation and pay off get Trump's tax returns if you just think about you remember this now in this big long story and the upcoming Showtime documentary no mention of Russia\nOr Russian finances as part of Trump's wealth when they saw that that habit just devastate him so now they have to go looking for other things in this that that that that was supposedly not Trump but I'll tell you that's Angus King who's a senator from Maine as an independent\nOr was telling a couple of journalists you know you people if you think that this is gonna hurt Trump you have got to learn something\nNew people on the left doesn't Angus King is an independent he goes with the Democrats you've got to learn something every time the New York times or CNN or the Washington Post attacks Donald Trump you wouldn't just blew Trump's supporters even title to him\nYou think that Trump supporters are going to be talked out of supporting Trump because of the New York times it's never gonna happen\nAngus King said this isn't going to hurt Trump with his base it's not gonna cause to happen what you all want to happen you want to separate Trump voters but this isn't going to do it this is just going to make them sick joined even tighter\nBecause this is what they expect you want to do they're expecting you to try to destroy they're expecting the media\nTo be joined at the hip with the Democratic party to take out the guy they voted for an elected Trump's voters admire him Trump's voters celebrating Trump's voters back him 'cause he's the only person like him out there in politics today that they can support\nThat's Angus King I'm\nOnly time will tell if this was going to have some deleterious effect but folks look at all the things that the media is dredged up since two thousand sixteen campaign that they thought\nEvery one of them was going to be the silver bullet every one of these things they came up with was going to be the final nail in the coughing\nAnd the NBC Access Hollywood video oh speaking of NBC they've been

happens\nAfter comes in other words this event if he had happened\nShe had all kinds of potential dates where it could've happened\nAnd every time she reported this the date changed it became the summer of eighty two only after she began to consult with Feinstein staff and Anna Eshoo staff and her lawyer Deborah cats and I am convinced that they\nDecided to claim that day was eighty two so asked to coincide with where Kavanaugh might have been able to be placed\n\nShe still and this is fundamentally crucial she still cannot specify when Trump was right she can't specify where\nMeaning the house\nShe can't specify the time of day she doesn't remember how she got home that that the floor plan for the house also changes\n\nShe ran out of a small bedroom door bathroom on one instance

it\nUh and the timing of all if you put this whole packaged\nTogether\nIt just [laughter] and the reason for that keep a conservative off the Supreme Court I just don't think any of this spontaneous happenstance\n[laughter] [noise] I don't think Feinstein just received a letter she didn't know it was coming just don't believe it can't prove it just don't believe it I don't believe he's minding our own business one day in a letter from a constituent who said I don't want to be known I don't want to be named and I don't want this taken any further\nWell then\nThere's the ... that it doesn't make any sense unless you put it in the proper context of what the express purpose of this is which I happen to believe is forcing cabinet have resigned to withdraw or for Trump to\nWithdraw from I think it was beginning to unravel because Trump and Kevin I'll hem hung in\nAnd my unravel I mean be exposed for the phone is that much of it is any weight Suzie I'm Glad you called thank you thank you very much Miami, Florida next Robert your up great to have you\n[noise] hey Russia that does from a lifelong will soon I've been listening to do it for Thirty years [noise] um I just want to thank you for everything you do for the country and ah especially your leukemia and lymphoma assigned that you do once a year it's a fantastic it means a lot to me [noise]\nMy question is what's what do you think is going on with the Mueller probe because it ... if you\nDon't well now that's an interesting question what's going on with the mother probably here's the latest I heard other Muller ... the the story actually has a sentence Senate play\nA special counsel's office and Robert Mueller to third us choir most\nIn most most honest man in Milwaukee when it is shedding prosecutors\nShedding per se that when your cat\nOr dog sheds it means losing hair a mother is losing prosecutors meaning there were ... the jobs almost not in their ... their ... their moving away and going off to other things there's less and less for his team of Trump haters to what to do I'll just\nRepeat what I said at the very opening of the program I don't think this tax story would have run today\nIf Mahler we're still hot on the trail and had something and if the Ford story weren't beginning to unravel the New York times story wouldn't ... when I saw\nOn drudge this massive New York times during my first\nTo unravel the New York times story wouldn't abroad when I saw\nOn drudge this massive New York times during my first reaction is remember folks I Am a student of the media and the left and nothing happens by accident the times did just finished the story\nBy deadline last night there by making it able to be published they've been holding it\nThey've been working on it for a year they've been coordinating with the Showtime network they've been producing a documentary for the past\nYear documenting how the times found it how they reported it how they prompted how they wrote it the fact that this thing was released and published last night for today first reaction I had was a cabinet thing must really be unraveling\n'cause it's time now to turn attention to Trump from a new angle and it's not really new its taxes\nThe latest news correct me on this Mr ... if you've seen somebody more recent\nBut the last story I saw on this is [laughter] Mahler [laughter] [noise] [noise] I don't know what to believe in if that Mueller is showing various people Roger Stone emails texts and asking them what they know about it\nWe're down now to Roger Stone\nIn an investigation that started with everybody thinking Trump She did with Russia and Muller was the guy that was going to find it and when we got Trump's tax returns we were going to see that it's important\nThat enabled Trump to hold onto his money and get more But Trump's wealth is directly tied to illicit activity with Russia will there isn't any Russian anything in the New York times story\n[noise] so [noise] um\n[noise] [noise]\nWe're getting down to the nitty gritty ... you know ethics\nSay that a special counsel should not right and release a report\nWithin this close proximity to an election or because of the impact that it would have and they of course are a unbiased ended its only jak given the Justice Department and they're not about affecting the outcome of elections I which is all they've been trying to do it for two years\nI wouldn't be surprised if they released a report you know a couple of days before the election which excoriated Trump for irresponsibility excoriated for a bad attitude experience in for having really really shady friends with all that but doesn't accused him of anything\n\nIf it's not supposed to happen before the election and that's when it probably will happen\nIs the way these people operate but but maybe it won't\nOutside of that I'm like everybody else I don't know what Mueller has I don't know what he's going to be a lot of what he's going to report um the zero not at all I Know is that the drive by media of decided to try to make something else a bigger story today than the capital story\nWhen Rush Limbaugh only the only on the high net worth\nGood
