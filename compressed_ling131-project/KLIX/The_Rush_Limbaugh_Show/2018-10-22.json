do you think's behind this because this there make the trying to make this look organic but it can't be it can't be organic something like this has to be planned\nAnd so I'm asking myself who's behind

reason well it could be they want to embarrass the Trump stir it could be that\nThey want to demonstrate that cold hearted ... mean spiritedness\nOf Donald Trump by having him do what he said he wouldn't do not let them in basically shut down the border if the Democrats are thinking\nThat man oh man did they not get it if the Democrats are thinking this caravan just by itself helps them given the midterms then there's something besides this caravan that has to happen for this to help them such as\nUnfortunate events that might inflict harm on members of the caravan half to happen to the drive by and Democrats could the blame on Trump because otherwise this seemingly is a microcosm of what Donald Trump what Donald Trump elected\nThe way to look at this caravan if you really want to know all the way to look at this is as a microcosm for what's been happening every day for who knows how many years it just so happens that we now have pictures of seven thousand people invading the

occurs every day and has been at the southern border for many many decades\nI mean it's it's an invasion that has some foreign led to a minimum twelve million illegal aliens of the country and these

here\nThis is the ultimate October surprise that we're still trying to figure out who's behind this here's Louie Gohmert from Texas He was on today with Sandra Smith on Fox question what can you tell us what you're seeing the way the president's responding to this what are your thoughts as this mob makes its way of the border\nThe president made no bones about it and are actually he can take his lead from the Democrats a Democrat time Woodrow Wilson not one of my favorite president ... ten Nineteen sixteen ... gangs came across the border and New Mexico and killed a bunch of people\nAnd not only did he for Seventy five thousand or so of a new thing called National Guard troops on the border President Trump's aren't going to send people into Mexico but he's made clear that this basically is an invasion and these me stop\nAnd Louis continued to\nClose the border you gotta stop bogus asylum claims and\nBasically have those claims for asylum only allowed at our embassy or consulate in the home country where these people are coming from and also we need to\nRemember that asylum claims are not legitimate if they're not made and if we're not the first country they come to after leaving their country so I bought a mile a El Salvador Honduras they can't make a legitimate asylum claim and Jeff Sessions is not going to let that happen\nNow Louis knows Jeff Sessions he keeps the they do I talk to the lawyer he'll talk about Jeffrey is talking to Jeff and I don't even know who is probably the who you're talking about Jeff Sessions with Jeff Sessions of big buddies that means he's talked to sessions about this but these are\nAll great points they already qualified for asylum in the first country free country they find themselves in after escaping\nTheir own country\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any\nThing in the next elections there is not a single reason to vote for these people under any breakup commonsense take a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this and frankly\nI don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there has been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nIs that six months ago nine months ago on the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taken a generic polls that the Democrats had a twelve to hurt gene point advantage of the American people will realize their mistake electing Trump of the Republicans I couldn't wait\nTo put Democrats back in power now that argued against real life real life since two thousand ten is the Democrats have been losing elections left and right\nBut for some reason the two thousands actually live germs the American people were all\nOf a sudden going to admit all these mistakes they made and put Democrats back in power I don't believe it but we got media narratives that a gigantic blue way of what's going to happen and we had that media narrative go on from December last year all the way through\nSeptember of this year and then and then\nOh I'm from December last year all the way through September of this year and then and then the generic ballot started type thing and then it began\nTo look for me it won't be as big a blue wave\nAnd Republicans look like they might actually gain seats in the Senate and\nAll known now the president's approval numbers is higher than it's ever been CNN's on poet forty four percent rafts my son has trumpet fifty one\nThere is nothing\nHappening that suggests say blue wave is happening I frankly don't believe there ever was one I think as we get closer to the moment of truth I eat election day people have to start reeling in these mad and kept for ... projections because they want to get as close to accurate as they\nCan for the sake of their business\nThere in the polling business they don't want to be wildly wrong again and again and again after all of\nThat's the case would hire them so now we're\nTold well there's been a shift a little man\nIt may be I'm starting to see stories here five ways the Republicans can hold the house seven ways the Republicans can hold the house foreign ways they could lose the house when a month ago there was no way the Republicans were going to hold out now all of a sudden we're starting to see it as a blue wave may not\nI don't think they ever did I don't think you'd ever did exist I think it made up\nManufactured you're going to get the poll result you'll want depending on when you take the fall and who you decide to put in your sample\nThere is no way there is simply no way that a political party openly promoting this invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand illegal aliens is going to be swept to a massive landslide when the American people are not angry that we have not\n\nStopped this the American people in mass are not wanting more are illegal immigration the American people in a majority no matter how you slice it are not asking for a political party\nTo stop paying attention to the border and let everybody who wants them in the American people are not there the American people never been there the Democratic party is there and the Democratic party wants you to think a lot of Americans are there but they aren't\n\nGoing through your own poll wherever you hang around do you think we ought to basically eliminate the border let anybody wants to come in and I can guarantee you less than ten percent of the people are going to say yes and yet\nThey can look at a drive by news media every day and you would get the impression is a lot of Americans that a lot of people to support this idea\nThese are so poor people there Thursday in Hungary way to make sure we have so much they have so little we mark what the\nThat's not a position it's going to win the election if it were or we would have had amnesty back in two thousand two\n\nIf that was the position of a majority American people Donald Trump ... never gotten the Republican nomination\nIf the people in this country wanted mobs of seven thousand or eight thousand to be admitted into the country no questions asked to be granted asylum truck when I never got the nomination he certainly would not have been elected president so you tell me what's changed in two years to make the American people think we'd go up\nKnow what Trump was wrong we don't need a wall this proves we just need to let these people in that's the way to stop the chaos they want in let them in we should feed them we should house than they have nothing there port are coming from ... countries left them\nFlynn that's the way to stop the chaos they want and let them yet and we should feed them we should house than they have nothing there port are coming from ... countries left them that's not\nA majority opinion of the United states the media is going to try to make people think that way look like they're mean spirited cold hearted heartless and all this but it's not the case\nThat is not an accurate description of the American people\nSo I I none of this to me makes any common sense whatsoever that Trump is in trouble because he wants to build a wall that he's in trouble and the Republicans are because they want to secure the border\n\nAnd yet the media reliably very subtly at this point sympathizing with the people on the quote unquote care of him trying to find a way to make Trump look like the bad\nGuy here and that's just not where the American people are one other
