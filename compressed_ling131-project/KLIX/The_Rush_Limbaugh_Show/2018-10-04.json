corroborate Ramirez they weren't able to corroborate a swipe neck they weren't able to corroborate that this is now the seventh FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh\nThe leftist others but they didn't talk to don't jump forward if they don't talk to Kevin ... that's right that's that's not part of the deal they testified under oath what more can the FBI or do you think the FBI really thinks that these people don't change their stories from what they've testified under oath\nBesides that Dr forged testimony changed any way in terms of the timeline of the reason the FBI didn't talk to Ford or Kevin always 'cause they've talked to a cabin off or how many times over the years\nUm but they testified under oath\nAnd so the the thing is no reason to talk to them they go out and talk to people they claim can corroborate what they're saying that I couldn't find something so I'm watching CNN too they've got CNN and Fox on it in here and it was probably ten minutes ago ten minutes for the program started and I began to um\n\nGet the impression that the Democrats think they've lost that gives a little CNN report it only looks a little to me\nHe was describing Jeff Flake Jeff Flake said this is very thorough this is this ... this investigation is very very satisfying to me\nAnd the CNN reporter said Jeff Flake today\nActually sounded like a Republican and that presents a problem\nJeff Flake it sounded like a Republican they last friday he sounded like a Democrat but today he sounded like a Republican and they went to Susan Collins Susan Collins says hey you know I look at this I'm very satisfied this was a very thorough\nHad been saying you has come to pass the Kavanaugh hearings are back firing big time on the Democrats\nAnd NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll out today found a big swing in public opinion among men following the hearing with at ten point increase in those saying they plan to support a Republican candidate in the upcoming midterm elections right\nNow I'm so this this is happening and they only primary changer difference here has been the Kavanaugh hearings and the and the left reactions to what I've even\nSeen stories today among the never Trump or conservatives that this whole thing may actually reunite the conservative\nMovement well we will ah will say about that but clearly there is a reaction is and it's it's it's it's root level simple\nThis is so easily understood it is\nThe worst smear campaign many people have ever seen in their lives many people you know even as Lindsey Graham found out the other day there are a lot of people today that they have no idea that Hillary Clinton\nRan the operation to destroy women who surfaced saying that her husband Bill Clinton had abused them or rent them or mistreated them or what have you\nLindsey Graham talks about what James Carville said when you drag a dollar bill through a trailer park and he got booed because\nThe millennials in the crowd had no idea that that's who Hillary Clinton was the same token those people are not live here Robert Bork and many of them are not old enough to remember what happened to Clarence Thomas Anita Hill so this is their first and that means is the worst smear campaign\nEver that they've seen could anyone be smeared more\nCan anybody be smeared more than Brett Kavanaugh has been smeared\nWe think that it can't get worse but the left will always make it worse Kavanaugh has been smeared\nUnlike anybody since Clarence Thomas\nBut he's been vindicated to he's been vindicated by fact she's been vindicated by evidence even vindicated by witness cooperation seven different FBI investigations he is vindicated by a life well lived when you\nBoil all this now and I think it's going to be really hard for any Republican vote against the guy\nAnd in fact I don't know this but I wouldn't be surprised if some Democrats Senate Democrats\nPrivately behind the scenes urging recount\nOh for capital as a way this has backfiring on them\nDon't know that it's a wild guess and only time will tell when we get to the vote but\nThe FBI investigation that the Democrats want it appears to have provided cover\nFor both Susan Collins

faced\nThe meaning is they're coming out that many they're depressed or there are no expressions on their faces they're not happy in a stone faced their shell shocked or something or other now\nWhy would that be why well did the Democrats on that committee actually believe Christine Ford did they really believe what she was saying\nTo I don't know how anybody could honestly\nFolks without an I I'm not even being part is when I say this she can't remember where when\nWhy the people she says there weren't there and yet these Democrats although for did the Democrats and the committee really think that an FBI investigation of another five or six days was going to somehow produced corroborating evidence that would wipe out the cabinet nomination\n\nThey really thought that because my my thinking all along has been they've known that this ... nothing other than the ... this is all this has managed to all they've got\n... they really thought that this FBI investigation was going to find something that six previous investigations in countless other interviews and written questions having produced\nWell that is shocking to others to God I Know I Know I'm I'm sometimes naive but I fought this has\nBeen a scam from the get go and if they're all in on the scam and at the scammer was delay hence the late release of of of Dr Ford's letter\nDetailing all of this so they work out a Schumer's office and they're all stone faced maybe they thought that they had flake or maybe they felt they were going to get Collins Collins inflate of come out and what they have said\nSaid last night on the Senate floor\nWe all know the president cannot lead us through this time\nWe know that in this position only unable to restrain has impulse to divide us as mockery of Dr for last night in Mississippi was wrong\nWhen it doesn't really surprise anyone who is\nMr ... senator Sasse I have an alternative view and are not going to presume that you are listening but maybe somebody who knows you is I Need you to consider something senator Sasse you and\nNumerous other say that President Trump mock Dr Ford in his rally south haven Mississippi earlier this week and then you suggested that the Trump knows what he's doing despite all the criticism he gets\nThat he is doing this is who he is he can't help it\nLet's just say I signed that gets the other way around I think Trump knows exactly what he's doing I think Trump\nHas a behavioral patterns strategically ... it's called pacing and really briefly explaining it again in setting up what's to come next\n\nPresident Trump originally spoke about Dr Ford one of these sites compelling testimony reinventing he couldn't turn away from it if she's telling the truth Kavanaugh's God he's got no prayer if Kavanaugh's allied\nAnd it's definitely it's gone Trump said all of this and everybody so wow this is really unusual for ... no it's not unusual\nTrump gets himself on the record not every time but in many issues he gets himself on record in the approve the Washington establishment way and every time he does it do not some of you panic\nMaybe you don't have any more but when he first started doing this light Paris climate accord yeah yeah there may be something here we're going to look at it they don't always going to vote no doesn't matter\nYou can remember countless times where the president\nYeah there may be something here we're going to look at it they don't always going to vote no doesn't matter\nYou can remember countless times where the president's initial statement on an issue of seemed to dovetail with what the swamp things but then a few days or are we go by him and the president's becomes really is and he starts speaking out against it\nAfter he's put himself on the record he does this for credibility and he does it it's something called pacing\nAnd it relaxes the opposition\nIn any number of ways he's doing the same thing here with Dr Ford he knew right off the bat that she was saying things that nobody could corroborate that nobody can prove that she couldn't prove and what he did on Monday Night was not marker\n\nHe explained it to everybody\nThe truth about her\nEverybody because of what Trump did at that rally everybody was forced to look and listen to that little way of on Dr foreigners shaky uncorroborated among provable test them on the drive by us we're never gonna\nTell the truth about Dr Ford the dry buys were not able to ignore the rally they tried not even Fox televised Trump's rally\nBut because he said what he said about her he forced the drive biased to cover what he said in the process the drive buys reported what he said and people like Ben Sasse another started giving me the vapors gave me the vapor who am I got Trump is always uses horrible ... remaining is not fit\nWhat Donald Trump did recounting\nThe absurd inconsistencies in her testimony Donald Trump calling her out on everything has been play now on all media when all day yesterday\n\nReporters are now asking senators and the press secretary questions about it in the press briefing yesterday\n\nThe fact is the drive by media did not report the inaccuracies of Dr Ford's testimony\nThat drive by media did not report on on the none of the collaboration being possible they did not tell their audiences that's the foreign people forward and placed in the room when her incident happened claimed they weren't there nobody knew that folks\nOther than you\nBut people don't watch the mainstream media had no idea that Dr Ford couldn't backup what she was saying that people watch the mainstream media had no idea\nThat the foreign witnesses foreign claims were there all deny it and don't remember being there and one of them was one of our good friends\nThat Dr ... we're not reporting any of that the dry buys were reporting what the Democrats senators I Believe her she is a credible witness as far as the American people who watch only mainstream media is concerned a woman was telling the truth the head back up she hadn't collaboration and capital was guilty\nSo Trump goes out tells the truth about her\nShe doesn't know what she doesn't know when she doesn't know where she doesn't always she got home she gets it on the record to drive by half to report it and for the first time in their lives people who watch mainstream media actually heard [noise] look at it this way think of the millions of people who had never heard the truth\nAbout Dr Christine's Ford and her full of holes testimony think of a million just never heard it until\nTrump went out and characterized it for everybody\nPolls testimony think about millions with never heard it until Trump wipe out and characterized it for everybody think of it this way think of the thousands of voters in Missouri in Arizona\nIn Michigan in Maine and West Virginia and North Dakota Alaska who now know the truth who never would've known the truth had Trump not\nDetailed it for people in his rally\n\nCollins mansion Heitkamp McCaskill flake Murkowski they knew\nThat there was no collaboration they knew that there couldn't have been any truth to what she was saying by virtue of witnesses this is why Trump did it this is why Trump does what he does if we had an honest media millions of people will do what do you know that Dr Ford story doesn't add up\n\nIf the media ever told the truth about this there wouldn't be any protests today are not nearly as large envelope\nIn voluminous\nThe people at these protests but I think she's telling the God's truth they think it's gospel they don't know that her story can't be backed up their media hasn't told him the Democratic senators haven't told them only Trump did it's another reason why they hate it\nBut we don't have an honest media and sold millions of people had no idea\nOf all the holes in the Christine lousy foreign story now they do and here's a little cherry on top since Trump did that and the whole media reported on it and Democratic senators and the like we're asked about it what comes three days later today is FBI report\nSaying no cooperation for what Dr Ford said\nSo Trump says that\nPeople like Ben Sasse another never Trump has go literally insane but if Trump hadn't set it nobody would know at the Trump did say it millions now do know and here comes the cherry on the top the FBI report we couldn't find any cooperation for her story end of the week Trump was right\nDrive by media wrong Democratic senators wrong Ben Sasse wrong\nAnd Trump doesn't do this accidentally it's not like he's lucky and stumbles into this stuff this is Trump strategy and it's all related to the pacing\nOf how he originally or initially eventually I should say gets to his real thoughts on any issue brief

you'll have a head start\nAnd you'll be more likely to stay with it\n\nIt details the suffering and the sorrow the joys and the triumph of the apostles and all of the key figures\nIn Christianity following the death and the resurrection and the central Jesus Christ which if the resurrection doesn't happen in Christianity\nDoesn't exist that and and that's one of the toughest things to make people believe how in the world that you can't physically put your arms around that resurrection from the dead\nBut it's a key element of Christianity it's one of the big stumbling blocks that that people have I Can't even imagine that I mean I heard I don't want to mention any names liberal\nTalk show host really rating Chris did you really believe that camp you that's why you people are nuts you can't really think there's somebody die and came back to life that's why that's why people like you're crazy\nWell\nFor Christianity to be what it is that had to happen\nAnd my brother David is\nA devoted to helping people believe that has happened by accepting what's in the Bible but before you can accept what's in the Bible you have to open it\nAnd so this is it looked it it's it's not simply a primary it's its own story of has its own telling of the tail but it's designed\nTo be sort of like an introduction\nTo the Bible into Christianity\nVotes estimates but this focuses on the book of acts because that's where it all is\nNow don't just read the book X. forget everything else but it's all there in the book at so that's why they chose the book of acts to start this [noise] so and I I
