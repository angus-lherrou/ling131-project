Schumer\nAll right let me get into this this case that has really been a mystery in terms of a global affair crisis I'm the president now said that he has dispatched his secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia immediately\nTo discuss what's been going on here and it gets almost more bizarre by the sec and now the allegation has banned that the Saudi ... crown prince ordered the killing of this guy Jamal ... now he's a Saudi national who's been critical of the Saudi royal families Washington Post contributor\nAnd he's a U.S resident but he's not a citizen he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey October the second he hasn't been seen by anybody since that day\nThe Turkish government had suggested that ... was killed by a Fifteen members Saudi his team who then dismembered his body and smuggled out and\nOf the consulate in pieces to an unknown destination but so far the evidence supporting that up to today has been heroes some reports claiming that could show these murder was recorded but to date and audiotape know videotape not even the Turkish government which is no great friend of America is currently feuding with Saudi Arabia over other issues\nSaying an absolute saying it's absolutely sure could show he was killed by anyone they can't say it let alone the Saudis now there's just began to break moments ago\nAnd a reports of now surface that Saudi Arabia is preparing a report in which in fact they will admit Jamal ... of the Washington Post columnist now this is a very dangerous we start seeing journalists killed\nWent missing earlier this month was killed by interrogation gone wrong\nUm when he entered the I guess the Saudi consulate in Istanbul right here to talk about it we have Morgan Ortega's is with us national security global affairs analysts former U.S treasury attached Shay to Saudi Arabia lived in Saudi Arabia two years\nAh she along with dam bond Gino former Secret Service agent author as well as the now best selling book a Spygate thank you both for being with us um Oregon you lived in Saudi Arabia two years there's just breaking there's been a mystery up until like an hour ago what do you think\nHe I yes I Lived there for ... fountain pen\nIn Iraq than I anticipated something like this breaking and the reason I get it because when the president that this morning and he's sending secretary on paying to Saudi Arabia that mean for secretary of state when at fifty people in the world certainly in the government has canceled author plans to try halfway around the world um\nSaudi Arabia that made the secretary of state when it does these people in the world certainly in the government has canceled all the plans to fly halfway around the world um I\nI Do is incredibly serious then and then they said ah we're we're going to be under tremendous pressure to come clean with whatever it is so if there were purchased he believed and we're still going to have to because\nIf if the records out there is what what comes out or is that the Saudis are claiming some sort of responsibility for this looks like they're not going to they're going to claim the senior leadership was not involved\nBut that people are in charge of it who ordered it would be held accountable there's a lot\nDuring how was your there's no until now because it shows how would they not know until now uh when it happened in their consulate in Istanbul\n[laughter] that's a fantastic question and I think the big takeaway that I hung from this report we'll see what happens with Decorah cherry on pay me to them all at the readout as it does not only need to to come clean on this and and satisfy\nPresident Trump the secretary compel you know they have an audience and and the Congress and the Senate that they're also accountable to mind you this massive arms deal is a memorandum of understanding it has not been signed by the president there's bipartisan consensus for sanctions people like Rand Paul have actually\nThe very vocally among supportive of the relationship I don't agree with senator call for a number of reasons that I could go into why I think the relationship it is important but the Saudis need to understand how serious that says we need to know who's going to be held accountable and I think that they're going to continue to see massive a\nMovement away from their big finance arm is just a few weeks secretary Mnuchin supposed to be there we saw the Dow fell off this afternoon as reports\nAnd they were threatening to stake here yeah well they were threatening you know maybe even using the power of their oil of impact than any\nOf the there was a price to pay or any retribution from the U.S than bonds you know I mean is getting more bizarre by the men and how to somebody in this particular case walk into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never get seen again\n[noise] [noise] yeah that that's highly unlikely sure there are really two aggravating factors year one year already brought up the fact that this happened\nIn a consulate I'm a diplomatic facility that that I mean that breaks every single a protocol moral ethical role imaginable\nSecondly Sean uh aggravating as well I mean aggravating is is probably enormous enormous understatement here is that he was a member of the media and I think this has ever permissible please I'm not saying I'm suggesting that this makes this even worse on the scale of Savage reads the fact that this individual aka so he was a member of the media makes it even worse now\nHow could it happen in a diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing it's highly unlikely but having said that you know there's there's two sides of this there's the side that said way back let's see let's get the facts looks like some of the facts are starting to come out now but we do need the Saudis\nThere's this is not a ... as simple as a black and white situation we do need the Saudis the relationship with the Israelis are starting to improve\nWe need them where honor razors edge with the Iranians of their nuclear program so this has to be viewed that way and I do\nThink Trump get one more thing though show I I think the Saudis did screw up big time when they seemingly tried to make these veil threats that they were going to respond you know we were supposed to be responded to there was no you can't just let this go so that was a bad move\nYeah they're ... to ... and just\nTo say that the thing that not only the threats that worried me that Dan just said it seemingly the Saudis need to answer why they lied to the president on this you know the president came out and said that they came and\n... among the crown prince that called Jared Kushner is working on a peace deal unless there's something that we don't know do about it look like they have like the president and I think that they need that there's a lot of explaining to be done there\nWell I think they're going to try and pass it on to an underlying that was in the

going to go out there and create fights and put start brawls or not I won't support them\nThat's right I agree too now whether a group we're getting into some ethics rather group as a hate group has to do with its ideology and what it's\nDoing why you'll say steals many folks who covers you've heard of\nProud Boys which is supposed to be I I read a male chauvinist group um and the that's the first time you've heard about a first time I've heard about him and he has been in the news for how long now\nAnd you're telling me well I barely know anything about them and you're also telling me

abortion doctor Kermit costs now how the woman goes into a funny comes out of there is no\nPolice report and I helped expose the crimes the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions not from the gods now movies amazing ... perhaps the most holistic zeroed in America bring friends and family who do not want to pass up the unique opportunity to change our mind about abortion drugs though\nRedistribution scheme now if you deal with direct primary care direct access to doctors and we've talked about health savings accounts that we've also talked about\nAtlas MD Dr Josh amber and Dr Lee s gross this model now has been duplicated around the country and what happens is there's no pre existing conditions prejudice at all\nIf you can afford a cell phone you can pretty much afford a a direct access to your doctor no insurance no problem you pay for what you need fifty dollars a month for an adult ten dollars a month per child\nThey negotiate directly with the pharmaceuticals so they have Ninety to Ninety five percent reduction if you have high blood pressure if you have a cholesterol problem you walk out of the doctor's office with the medicine\nAddict greatly reduced rate than you'd ever pay at any drug store it's actually it's now been implemented in his working in over five hundred practices around the country\nIt was pioneered by my friend Dr Josh ... joins us now atlas MD and Dr Lee as gross president of doctors were patient care\nI'm I Am I pretty much explaining it right is there anything I'm missing and I would call this concierge care for every American\nI the only problem is Sean every time you talk about it at our phones will start bringing and we've got regular patient [laughter] so you have a lot of them to write [noise] we we have a you know a A R own panel there and yeah we're fulltime families additions but no you nailed it [noise]\nI mean so and you have all these pace now the bottom line is I think most people like me\nAnd I have friends of mine that are doctors or you know and friends of mine that will take care of me friends of mine that will take a call at three AM if I'm not feeling well all which has happened it occasionally in my life\nAnd these guys you know I ... I mean I pay them and they take my insurance does but they do it as more of a friendship but this is something ...\nAbsolutely\nYeah attacks plane how you're making it work there and how it works for your team exactly\nUh you know I think this is like a lot of things um Silicon Valley style or Netflix or Amazon Prime uh people are being be over there they want a better product faster cheaper easier and and that's what Dr gross and I've done with our respective clinics\nIs just decrease the paperwork that headache the hassle of the middle man so that now medicines are pity pill now you can call ticks email your doctor now health care with your own private doctors cheaper than a cell phone\nI said this has now been implemented how many places did you get this finally up and running around the country I don't think you're explaining detail enough here explain exactly what this service does and how this can be implemented for every American\nSure there's over a thousand doctors doing the direct care model across the country and\nIt's a flat membership rate based on age it's insurance free for unlimited home visits work visits office visits free tele medicine's so you can call tax email your doctor we have no co pays for anything any procedure we can do in the office is free of charge\nStitches biopsies joined injections ultrasound heart monitors long monitors um and then wholesome medications in labs for up to Ninety five percent savings\nI mean this is a grassroots movement and patients just need to get out and let the doctors know that this is a better way to get health care and they supported and and that's why I think we've seen this gross so much in the last several years\nAnd then what's missing is the fact that it can be duplicated now I don't know the exact complications that might exist in say a big city like New York city you know nine million people or Los Angeles and San Francisco but in small towns and smaller cities it is working Dr gross that's the point\nThat it's working everyone I think you know people really need to understand is that you know this is not a decision between you know\nUh the Affordable CARE Act I mean we want to go down there to try to take down the path of socialized total government controlled health care you know at a time where people are able to choose their health care decision was based upon their individual DNA or going to take a one size fits all approach to health care it doesn't make any sense and\nYou know Democrats don't want their healthcare chosen by Donald Trump any more than Republicans Wachter healthcare chosen nightmare Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi so you know why are we inserting the politicians into health care with it but the government control health care system when you can have a better way through a direct primary care relationship when\nWe leave this is the failure of Obamacare you spend billions and billions more\nAnd you get far in theory or care because it never really was about the patient really was always about\nRedistribution of wealth and you know I can go over like I did yesterday all the top number we already have redistribution of wealth in America at the top three percent of taxpayers paying the majority of income one percent pays almost forty percent the top fifty percent of wage earners\nPay Ninety seven percent\nSo what they've tried to do is ... ... for example they forced the young and generally healthy Americans to buy expensive plans that they didn't need and couldn't afford and then penalize them if they didn't get the plan when they would have been better off paying for one check up a year right out of their own pocket\nAnd also getting a catastrophic plan if God Forbid they had the accident or got cancer or at a young age which rarely happens had a heart attack right Dr amber\nThis is a one size fits non model um it's too expensive for young healthy people and it doesn't provide the service that older\nThe only way and so we need to streamline the whole system the problem is that politicians have always tried to\nEnsure everything but now we're to the point of ensuring\nYou medicines that cost a penny a pill I can get a thousand ... blood pressure medicine for four dollars and Ninety cents\nSo the big box retailers will show you Ninety pills for ten dollars is highway robbery we knew cancer or for for six dollars a month in some cases\nThe fact is now we just need less insurance that means health insurance is can compete on quality and and lower their price just like your Fifteen minutes we'll say Fifteen Percent on car insurance we need to get back\nTo a competitive model for the patients are in control and cares affordable and insurance is just for the big stuff but the rare stuff\nAnd where are you with Congress though in other words these are solutions no insurance no bureaucrats you know doctors being able to do what they do they are the innovators in this up front pricing lower costs no government meddling aren't all that is true\nHow do you get Congress how many people are in Congress that are supporting your model I Know for example Rand Paul and I think Lindsey Graham or two people say well block grant the money and then let the states determine how to do it themselves which would that would I think open a path for people like you to expand at an even greater level\nNow health care's local I mean that's the important thing you know the health care should be between you and your doctors and one thing that's clear as the cavalry is not coming from Washington to say now if we wait for solutions from Washington it's not coming we need doctors and patients to get the other six cause problems themselves\nAnd that's exactly what this movement a movement that says that don't eliminate any it asking for permission from from Washington to take care of our patients\nYeah well look I Hope that these people in Washington and here you but it's it is interesting that the one look every American worried about their health care rightly so every American has been burned by broken promises you know and the fact that the Democrats have this perception that somehow they're the great\nThe great solution the health care after the Obamacare debacle is laughable to me but unfortunately with voters three weeks out of an election that's how some of them feel as I read these polls\nSo uh anyway I really appreciate both of you being with us Dr Josh number Dr ... grows the probably one of the defining issues that caused people make people think the Democrats are actually going to help them and it's not\nA we appreciate your time eight hundred nine four one shown as a toll free telephone number if you want to be a part of the program I
