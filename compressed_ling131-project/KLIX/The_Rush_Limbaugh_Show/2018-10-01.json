that the Gulf ... pages I'm\nI'm a way to get Democrats suckers I. E. voters to pay for this so that it doesn't cost people already have a lot of money anything than you could try to make that point\nThat the Democrats are using these poor people but I don't think you're going to be able to find a way to stop this too widely you jumping Sarasota, Florida Hi great to have you here saw what's up\nRussia just wanted to make a suggestion or an idea it's kind of a fantasy I don't think it would ever work but\nYou know the left as always behave like bullies and they'll do anything and they've never had real pushback from our representatives on the right in Washington so you know when you know ethics and your dirty tactics I often they have benefits for you coupled with the fact that\nYou know you never have to suffer the consequences yourself for like a bully there's no reason to stop when your tactics work there's no reason to stop and say no Foley is ever stopped until they get punched in the mouth that maybe it maybe it's time that you know we don't want to become them maybe let's say for a year that's\nIt was a standalone Graham said it it was great it was impassioned\nAnd that was the end of it\nIt was never to be heard again out of the mouth of any Republican and saw grams impassioned allegations of the Democrats was followed by agreement\nWith Jeff flakes\nTo me that the FBI being allowed to do one way but it has to get their fight and all of fine senator Graham's point and he even went along with with like\nYou can't do these things as one offs if you're going to tell people who the Democrats are if you're going to try to inform the country what's really going on here you have to do it every day and you're going to have to do it multiple times a day it's going to have to become\nThe central focus of your strategy on a day to day basis but it never does we've had plenty of occasions in the past where some Republicans done a one off like that and it's been great and we have celebrated it and we shared in a way to go and it dies\nExcept for here on TALK radio or maybe on Fox News but it dies\n\nWell Lindsey Graham didn't have to become them to do what he did he just had to be honest and he was Lindsey Graham didn't have to\nWorry about losing his soul in order to\nTake it to these people and by the way did you notice not one of them on the Democrats I cared aware about what Graham said none of even got mad at it not a single one of them even wanted to refute if they didn't kill the only thing got a rise out of them was winning Feinstein was accused of leaking her letter\nSo she turned around and asked her staff did you guys get but no they said they didn't Lincoln Mr journal we didn't Lincoln I just asked my staff they said they did oh what\nAbout an investigation ha well Tom ... says we're going to investigate Feinstein we're going to invest in some of these other things that needs to be followed up on\nI for one I Know investigations are innocent but I'm getting tired because all they are for the way\n\nHow hard is it a stand up and say Brett Kavanaugh is credible enters denial\n\nHow why is that so hard she didn't have any evidence that she made a credible witness how well she was really suffering and in may so\n\nDoes that establishes credibility an attitude doesn't give us credit belly pain and suffering doesn't equal credibility Democrats are always in pain and suffering over something\nNow want to go back to my production\nMy original prediction was that if the Republicans do not vote on this\nIf they don't vote out capital of that committee him he doesn't get voted on he's if he's not confirmed Republicans are going to have held up pay because voters are going to be fit to be tied up being led down again then\nThe Democrats kept pulling stunts and it became\nConventional wisdom in this case up Republican voters are going to get some kicked off Republican women and mothers are going to get so mad because they've got sons and I hate seeing what's happening in the capital and they don't want imagine that happening the wrong PIN they're going to show up and gross or I Want to take you into the future and I want you to think about something\n\nIf Brett Kavanaugh just think about this is a hypothetical I'm not predicting if Brett\nKavanaugh is not sworn in early next week\n\nIf you can hypothetically envisions a day where Kavanaugh is not confirmed not sworn in\nAre you going to be ... are you going to be so mad that you can't wait to vote are you going to be so mad that you feel betrayed\nBecause if that happens to take that moment where Kavanaugh is not sworn in meeting he has not confirmed in the Senate\n\nYou think it's going to be easy for the Republicans who say do you see what happened to Kevin off where are the majority that we couldn't get him confirmed you need to come out in ... how does that work\n\nThat's going to be pretty difficult asking Republicans to come out and vote to keep the majority\nWhen Kavanaugh was not sworn in as everybody thinks that what voters are going to remember in November is this the unfairness that Kavanaugh the dirty tricks and Democrats are playing\nBut stop and think Kavanaugh is not sworn in\nAnd the Republicans think wow we're set up now man there's so many out there\nWere guaranteed to get their votes weren't going to there's going to be a Republican away because of what happened to Kevin Ball and then a Republican start campaigning and they start asking people to vote for them based on what happened to Kevin Oh you mean that he's not there or you mean you didn't get sworn in your that majority\nWe know it's very small majority but you're the majority and he's not sworn in and you want us to how does this work folks\nMy point\nIs it's very easy to sit here and say in the midst of all the Democrats trickery that it's going to fire people up on the Republican side are going to be some ticked off as\nMy point is it's very easy to sit here and say in the midst of all the Democrats trickery that it's going to fire people up on the Republican side are going to be so ticked off at his soul man they're gonna show up and vote like they've never voted before\nBut if that's going to be the attitude if he's not sworn in\n\nRepublicans have been asking for the majority for a long time\n\nThey keep working and voting mostly because of Trump voters do they keep showing up because of Trump\nTrump alone will be able to make the case Trump alone will be able to turn a cabinet to defeat the turnout but the Republicans in the Senate and house I don't know how they do it vote for us Kavanaugh was defeated\nVote for us so it doesn't happen to the next nominee is that really effective I just don't I don't\nI hear too many people talking about it seems like every time you want a big turnout when you have to do something so that people get fired up I've been hearing this since I've been doing this show back in Nineteen Ninety two people call here instead of rush Clinton needs to win then people will see how bad the Democrats really are people see\nHouse don't say really are you kidding we lose and in sale ourselves we're going to win and we're still doing it here with Kevin also Kevin on doesn't make it this is going to really fire people up why do we have to do was to fire up\nThe base that doesn't make any sense to me it ought to be the other way around\nThis is another trick I think that gets played on Republicans your base is going to be really fire enough if Kavanaugh doesn't make wait a minute the Republicans are the majority how the hell\nIs is is that advocacy for reelection or election that the guy doesn't make it\nWell rush voters are going to be so mad yeah at what the guy got railroad\nRailroaded in our guys couldn't stop it and and we're supposed to say well okay man we're really loaded now that's going to really caused the turn up the ... sorry ... I don't think it works that way\n\nWhat people in in the hypothetical I just gave you what's gonna happen is that voters are going to be out there saying even what we vote Republican Democrat still run down\n\nAnd it doesn't equal show up keep elected Greece got to be the other way to\nWin this we have got to be the Democrats not lose to them\nAnd by the way I've had a lot of emails from a lot of uh people who think their expert political analysts and they all well not all but I mean a whole bunch of them have this theory that the way they get the base all fired up we want to let them destroy\nA great life great patriot a great American his whole career his future maybe his family in order to win them in terms how does that work\nYour football team loses make you want to become a season ticket holder\nOr is it one day when that you want on the bandwagon and you want to be on the team\n\nDo we have to keep losing to fire up our base you talk\nShe asked me the media's behind that the Democrats a Washington establishment I got to take a break be back after\nThis seems like ... more than ever rush a leaky I beat Mitt work [noise]\nVeterans active duty military military spouses if you are in search of new homes announcing I'm going to tell you about American finance sings the a home loan it offers you exclusive access to some of the industry's most competitive mortgage rates and there's no downpayment required no monthly\nIt comes to running your farm you have enough worries marketing your grandchildren me one of them over one hundred twenty five years in school or people I have been committed to understanding your business than providing superior service and let them find the most competitive option so you can focus on what you do best\nVisit them on line at Idaho dodge schooler dot com that to Idaho dot S.
