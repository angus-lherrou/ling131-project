R. I. V. Mitt\nHey folks the IRS does not mess around you know this they have the power to take everything\nYour bank accounts your paycheck even your home in business now if you all back taxes it's about to get worse the IRS has added a small army of private tax collectors and their job is to find you to track you down you need to co opt them a tax relief\n[noise] last night and the ceremonial swearing and Brent Kavanaugh Supreme Court was their living room ... Ginsberg\nWho well never mind\nYeah she was a way [noise] um [noise] you know she's admitted that she shows up at the states of the union speeches having two little blindly\nTo get through the night why she is seen falling asleep at the court says there's nothing wrong with that uh\nI'm Elena Kagan was there the Harvard law school dean who way back when hired Kavanaugh to teach at Harvard Elena Kagan who now says I don't think he should be on a corner I I'm\nNot sure that this is going to do the court any good\nA Justice Thomas was there a whole bunch of people Anthony Kennedy who is a Kevin O's replacing and here is the president of the United states we're starting to hear an audio soundbites seven he is apologizing Kavanaugh on behalf of the nation\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett\nAnd the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nThose who step forward to serve our country deserves a fair and dignified evaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nJust calling them out this covers right this is not done what normally when you get to the ceremonial swearing in you follow the script and all of that is in the past it's not to be referenced again the fight is over everybody acknowledges that\nThe result is the result by moving forward except that it's not the way it is anymore the Democrats are not stopping the fights not over to them the Democrats are openly promising to impeach Kevin all their openly promising that continue investigating Kevin on they are openly talking about packing\nThe court if they win the house of representatives to nullify\nThe or the power capital has as the fifth so call conservative justice on the court they're not pulling back at all this is going to be where over\nAnd so Trump is calling them out and I'm telling you folks this is crucial we don't I I Can't think of any former president would ever do anything like this in defense of his nominee in defense of his principles\nI Can't think of one who would do it and it's just as important with the Trump do this as it was important when Trump at a rally\nExplained to the American people what the American media had not told them\nWhen he recites the essence of her testimony\nThat when the drive by said that he was mocking Dr balls the Ford he wasn't mocking he was simply informing the American people what the media was holding from them that she couldn't tell anybody where it happened she couldn't tell them when it happened she wasn't sure where the house was\nHow they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required if you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do\nIf you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable saying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up with this\nThen that's what we'll do it has nothing\nTo do with anything other than Kavanaugh isn't them and he therefore doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court\nFor the rest of it the history onyx the child like wailing and immature the is the result of the\nLiberals socialist mindset on people young people immature children that don't get their way or the suffering psychological disorders of one way one kind or another\nVideo and video of these kids on Saturday afternoon to literally calling at the doors of the Supreme Court they get in to try to stop the real swearing in they were literally calling at the doors\nThere wasn't any humanity and miss this was just raw hatred and fear\nCoupled with massive site disorders event promoted\nNot denounced all of it promoted and encouraged by the powers that be in the media and the Democrat Party and the ... of the left\nAs I've been saying what a decent people do in response to this decent people are we're we're not going to become them\nThey may have as an objective with a real one nation and total human destruction\nDo not doubt me on this that may sound a little extreme to those of us that are here on the periphery but do not doubt me that is their objective total destruction and ruin nation well how do we find that these people are not going to try to ruin their political opponents gonna try to beat them\nBut we're not going to become who they are we don't have an image to become who they are so given that how are they stopped\nIt's a serious question\nIf they are willing to do anything including ... fat joke career and life political murder\nTo stop things they don't want to stop people that they don't want how do you how do you oppose them how to you beat that back\nThen you do it with decency to do it with politeness do you do it with manners I'm Sorry I'm going to\nCut it sorry never Trump or is it the right manners and ... and so forth isn't going to cut it some people might say Russia ... the church is rock solid the churches where enduring about [noise] uh not anymore\nThe churches are like every other institutions sucking up the people they hold power everybody needs money churches need money all kinds of people need money and if the people are going to give you money demand that you be a certain way and be open to certain things then you're going to do it this is habit take a look at your papa\nAnd what's even happening to the Catholic Church in places\nSerious serious problem when talking about the preservation of what I call our way of life underneath the umbrella of decency\nSo we're very lucky we have somebody willing to push back against it from the highest\n\nLevels of power in the country Donald Trump fear loosely pushes back on it are caused amount identifies them\nThey're not used to this they don't know how to react to it media is the greatest illustration of that not knowing how to react to being called out for what you really are\nI mean everybody's accused the media being biased over the years but nobody accuses them of fake making it up\nParticipating in the open and want to ruin nation of people nobody ever accuses them of that and I'm not I mean we may hear but at the highest levels of governance never happened before there's Donald Trump doing it\nAnd from the East Room of the White House here is more Trump last night this really triggered him when he declared Kavanaugh innocent\nWhat happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process [noise] our country a man or woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty [noise]\nAnd\nWith that I must say that use are under historic scrutiny were proven innocent thank you\n[laughter]\n\nMargaret analyze your father is a great man he's a man of decency character kindness and courage who is devoted his life to serving his fellow citizens\nYou know what that is I'm Sorry never Trump or his but that's just pure class\nThe time to look at those two little girls and tell them that their father is a great man\nThe United states taking time out\nTo tell those two young daughters\nOf breath and Ashley Kavanaugh your father is a great man every father wants to hear that every father loves having his children told that he is a great man few ever are afforded that\nOpportunity but Trump did it last night\nAnd then from claiming Cameron knows innocence I mean that is akin to taking all of poison the arrows at every Democrat launched it Kevin all the past two weeks and firing them back at once right down the throats of every Democrat Senator on the Judiciary Committee and every member of the media\nTried to ruin the Kavanaugh to openly proclaiming him innocent\nHe can't do that that was in a corner law he doesn't know but they had him guilty didn't say he was guilty simply on the basis of the allegation\n\nI Want to say one more time I don't believe anything that we went through the past two weeks starting with the realization that Christine Blasey Ford and written a letter to Dianne Feinstein I don't think any of it\nWas spontaneous and I don't think any of it was happenstance I think every bit of it was an orchestrated in campaign just like every other October surprise in politics is\nI think the Democrats were in on it I don't know whether Boise forge privacy was violated I don't know if she was in on it or if she was also a sewage\nBut somebody suggested she write that letter Monica McLean her buddy who has FBI connections to Preet Bharara who hates Trump the yesterday and why the United states attorney as well as all these FBI people trying to prove Trump Russia collusion\n\nI don't think they ever expected it to get as far as it did they thought Trump would pull back withdraw the nomination or the Kavanaugh would pull out\nAnd they would never get as far as ... as it got there it was clearly illustrated she had no evidence no collaboration no nothing\nIn their strategizing of this events I never thought I Would go that far one of the reasons is there used to Republican presidents caving nominee gets in big trouble pull a nomination presidents don't want the grief starts reflect\nPoorly on them as they go to the nomination look [noise]\nAnd more work nominate we can't sustain this you got to pull out nominees Assad damn it's like one sorry nominee I'm pulling my support comedy\nFor us to get together for the good of the country blah blah blah blah blah but he pulls out didn't happen here Trump refused to pull out withdraw ghetto capital that's where the gum up the works anyway I got to take a lot a brief time out

I'll get right to the point I have one comment one question and comment is it going around this talking point that ah you know since his cabinet victory that ah the president is teaching the Republicans how to fight I\nActually think he's teaching that Democrats what it's like to lose and I don't think anybody's picking up on that 'cause they're not used to losing like this there used to the Republican just given it and and the question I had was what do you think would happen\nIt 'cause I don't know what's gonna happen I actually think this blue wave talk is is not true from what I'm seeing out here what do you think what happened\nTo the Democrats in the media if instead of a blue wave if there was a red wave I mean what do you think actually what happened do you think they self destruct I mean what was the day after local\nI have been you know I think it's a good question because I myself have been thinking about that in terms of survival um and safety\nBecause I think if the Democrats do not win the house and if you if you listen to scuttle but sounds like everybody is preparing for the Republicans to hold the Senate maybe even expand this their whole there but the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are going to retake the house\nIn numbers we haven't seen and who knows how long since Nineteen Ninety four\nAnd I've been wondering what if what if all of this is just a bunch of ... a media\nAnd and and polling unit manufactured\nJust like it was in two thousand sixteen\nThey were not very many polls in two thousand sixteen that got even close to being right Rasmussen was won by the way Rasmussen as trumpet fifty one percent approval the CNN approval number for Trump is forty one\nOr the ... the polling David the drive by us trust shows them just even now after the Capitol hearing expanding\nThe blue wave\nMeanwhile do you know that the Republican candidate just as an aside here on the Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven points back\n\nThe Republican I got a note from Newt Gingrich about this overnight\nThat the Republican to I'll have to find it a buck the Republican governor of California is is closer than is running a scam or new some than anybody would ever have believed possible if the Democrats do not retake the house\nCops are running around trying to prove this guy's a reprimand of the first order and now I'm\nNo no officer you know\nOur government is separating the two words at our\nAm still having them\nAnd the cops rethought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero

be more educated more informative smarter\nBut that's gone we have replaced informed people educated people learn in people with Avon so load block cab idiots\n\nWere not separating and Trump never did separate families at the border that is actually Democrat Party policy it's related to families crossing the border illegally seeking asylum\nTrump in fact wrote an executive order to end it which was beaten\nBack on the basis that it was unconstitutional lift the statute in America today says families will be separated\nManaged to protect the kids the reason for the reason for the separation is the parents are shoveled off as the holding cells while their cases are adjudicated\n\nSo I'm watching this stupid show and I see a guy who inning under normal season will be a pervert with a bunch of kids in cages in his basement converted into a quasar hero because he is rounding up kids that Trump is separating from their parents and saving them\nSo I went to the DVR and I cancel law and order and you're SUV I get rid of that had been out there long enough twenty some odd years anyway so and they're all dropping like flies they all feature stuff like this in it\nSo you really you think\nThat two hundred nine Republican House seats coming up for grabs be cause people all over this country are fed up with Trump and the Republicans separating families [noise]\n\nUh\nThe debt wasn't explained to hundred nights certainly says it's really a lot of Republican retirements what yeah committee chairmen are retiring because they're limited\nForty three members are retiring some of them are committed German and the reason they're quitting is because they don't want to go back to being average ordinary members when you're a committee chairman you got perks you got attention get t._v. time you know you matter\nBut when your term limited out of your chairmanship then you quit and you're part of your time they're into big box in the private sector you know there are some Republican retirements but there are two hundred nine of them\nBut my my only point is foreign there to be this kind of blue wave forty four forty seven of retirements does not explain it not with the Democrats think they've got two hundred nine seats leaning in their favor\n\nOr you don't think it's policy well ... there were people if this is all true there has\nTo be something or a series of things\nThat the American public is just fit to be tied over and want to take it all out of Republicans as again the media to Democrats will tell you it's Trump the people's country hate Trump they're embarrassed of Trump but that's what they think\nThe evidence that the country hates Trump just isn't there\nAny even at even if you look at the leftist opinion balls at forty one percent approval
