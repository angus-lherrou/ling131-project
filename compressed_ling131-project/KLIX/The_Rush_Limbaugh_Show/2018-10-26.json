close up shot of the van before they put the book the blue tarp on it\nAnd I'm just I'm just going to put it up as it ready to go let's let's let's switch to it if you're watching on the digital

is what I just want you to who are listening here and watching the ... this is what is being reported\nIn a number of different publications now as I just I just want to caution you that since this is what's being reported first impressions are now being registered by people as they hear all of this I Am reporting it to you under guidance\nAnd telling you that I I'm just telling you what I'm finding in uh in various publications that are that are floating around there has been a a mad cap and desire to id who ever was sending these bombs as a Trump supporter a all week long and they have not waited\nThey are they're moving at light speed\nTo make this association such as in this headline suspected make America great again bomber ID as Native American Trump supporters say it's our ... or say Iraq\nA fifty six [noise] so [noise]\nThere is still have this this one I'm Still trying to figure out somebody sent me this\nScreen shot of a website that list is party is the Green Party which doesn't jibe with any of this\nI mean the Green Party would be all in on CNN the Green Party would be all in on um a bunch of things that are anti Trump so some of this that we are being sent and seeing doesn't make a whole lot of sense so we're still in the process of trying to track it all down\nNow in the midst of this there continues to be news reported about the mid term elections and there are some other news that was reported and discussed about the bombs before today when people were told the identity of the bomber and showing pictures of the bombers van\nAh down in in uh in plantation Florida and one of the things that I had intended to share with you today as a Chuck Todd was on the MSNBC yesterday we every audio I lifted the ban on MSNBC to report this that Chuck Todd\nSaid that he was afraid the Russians were behind this scare\n\nChuck Todd said that he theory the Russians couldn't be responsible for the mail bomb scare of that has targeted top officials in the Democratic party as well as CNN and Robert De Niro quote I have this fear it could be some Russian operation out there are designed to do what's happening now\nAnd that is so all of this confusion\nChuck Todd added that we shouldn't rule out the possibility the Russians are behind this and the male bottom scale is dividing the country and that's what its purpose is this was on his show called meet the press\nDaily now I ... the reason that I [laughter] the Russians\nWhat is known worry about that is that here you have the moderator of meet\nThe press have Chuck Todd who still\nBelieves despite the fact that we haven't seen any evidence despite the fact that there isn't any evidence Chuck Todd still operating under the belief that Russians stole the two thousand sixteen electric\nBetween ... between these crazy right in these these national rights groups planting bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in the selection for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing into turmoil I really do\nYou think that as we sit here today the deep state thinks they're going to lose their not an American to win the house back\nDemocrats in the middle of the interesting thing not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back so all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is I mean Democrats in the deep state loses and they can say the legend invalid too much was going on we can't we can't stop democracy can't function this way\nYou ... and you really think that the\nThe deep state here sent this guy or prevent he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here and hates the left when in fact they orchestrated you think that\n[noise] do you do you think that the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent that been corrupted over the past four or five years I mean like I said rush three years ago I Would have said I'm Crazy I mean I I I can put nothing pass them of course when you think about what the repercussions could be for them if they don't\n[noise] I mean you're talking about some very high profile people being out a lot of trouble theoretically he'll ... eventually the gears of justice grind slowly but you'd like to believe eventually\nSome of these people are going to pay for what they've done\nWell wait a minute but why why is it that happening now the Republicans round the house of representatives now why do why do they have to win it again in order to conduct these investigations that Jim Jordan says are coming up\nI think Trump will have more to do with pushing it forward once these elections are over I think there are deep state\nAnd Jim Jordan I says are coming up\nI think Trump will have more to do with pushing it forward once these elections are over I think there are deep state people on the Republican side who helps slow roll this thing I really do\nI think Trump will be the one ram routing it wants these elections are over if he gets the big win because this will be a mandate about him if they really\nSo I have to say let's discuss the you think Trump is essentially on the ballot\nIn in this election there's no wrong answer her don't don't miss don't misunderstand my tone I'm trying to learn what you think you you think the Trump is essentially on the ballot that this these midterm elections in part or maybe ... close in Toto are a referendum on Trump\nNo doubt about it look at the effects he's having when he goes in and campaigns for people in the states that was supposed to be such trouble for Republicans I think he's definitely I think these people on the left think this was going to be their big moment when they finally jam it to this guy and get all their investigation started I think they think this is the beginning of the African now I\nWill if somebody was I was I was reading a a tech blogs yesterday and folks I really appreciate you indulge me talking about this it's my hobby not keeping up with the blonde or has been keeping up with the\nTech and to keep up with the tech yeah have to read the stuff and\nIt's all written by among young millennial journalist\nAnd they have ever since election day two thousand six day and they haven't been in various stages of panic and I I'm a ...\nThere was a reference in one of the tech blogs to a poll showing the red wave of the blue wave was not going to happen\nIt was not nearly as big and this particular blogger was in a mile to panic about it writing about you know what we all have been thinking that what happened in two thousand sixty and was an odd confluence of events that\nThat gave us a one off result that's not really representative of America that Donald Trump and these Republicans is not who we are\nAnd then the guy says but if the Republicans hold the house of representatives and we're gonna have to come to grips with this is who we are and that we are not running the show in truth and it was it was um it\nWas like I wouldn't say there was panic and ended up reading the written word but\nIt's slowly dawning on some of the the last two years they have lived with the belief that what happened in two thousand sixteen was unusual irregular a one off that it shouldn't have happened it was an odd\nConfluence of events have banned candidate with the Hillary Clinton and so forth of overconfidence by people on the left but that um\nThe people have been waiting every day for these two years to fix this mistake and the Democrats are going to storm the ballot boxes on Tuesday in November and correct dismissing now they're starting to begin to quite may be this is not an oddity\nMaybe maybe we're not the majority\nAnd it kind of dovetails with what you're saying here do you believe for example that\nA Trump voters and Republican voters right now are actually\nLosing momentum devote because of his mom's\nRush can I share something with you here I went yeah Trump rally I went that a Trump rally two weeks ago it was in I was in Council Bluffs right across the river and I think the uh mid America center seats\nFor this event and we're sitting like twelve thousand I'm not exaggerating there had to have been twenty five thousand people outside there in that line there were more women than there were men that were ever going Americans and they were nice people but I'm telling you there were a lot of these protesters and my instinct was I Want to say something to these\nMan that we're ever going Americans and they were nice people but I'm telling you there were a lot of these protesters and my instinct was I Want to say something to these protesters one I got down there like me and many other people we don't want to start trouble with them it's like we don't have the inclination to get in their faces an act\nLike they do and so many of these Trump supporters are not the kinds of people that are wearing it on their sleeves right now they're just going to go in and how how how could you hold it against the guy is doing such wonderful things for the country I mean he really is\nAnd I think a lot of those people are just going to go in there and they're going to vote because they now realize that they got the momentum on their side but they're not the kinds of people that are out there where under sleeves like these crazy radical leftists are all doing\nWell it is it is a ... it's it's standard old conventional wisdom thinking that people voting impulses or energy or desires ebb and flow like this\nI mean the idea that ah this week a bomb scare stories can dampen enthusiast I I I don't I don't think that describes the average Trump voter I think the average Trump voter is immune\nTo all of that and more maybe I think more than the average Trump voter I I\nI don't think they have to be told how important to the election is I don't think they have to be reminded to vote I don't think they need to be told the stakes\nAnd yet there are people that continues you got to drive turnout Russia got to tell people how important it is is I think they already know I I'm I'm I don't sense that there is a\nUsual lessening of enthusiasm or a gaming of enthusiasm based on the ebb and flow of news I think people understand how important it is it that was it's as important now is it wasn't too thousand sixteen and in fact it may even be more important now that Trump is in office and the policies have been in that\nThan the idea of this stuff needs to continue or maybe more important like Trump said at one of his rallies I think the ... the rally in Houston\nHe was talking about how he he produced he's got he's got a track record now\nHe said two years ago on the campaign I was saying we're going to do this we're going to be great again and we're going to stop this we're going to make a trade deals better back then it was just\nWords he said was just words but now two years later I produced meeting is not just words it's real now and I think Trump supporters understand this I I just think they're immune to the um uh attempts\nThat are made elsewhere to this spirit them a or to somehow weaken their enthusiasm so we'll see a it won't be long haired Jimmy I'm Glad you called thanks for the extended time we'll be back after\nThis

just the nature of the ... what safe talk all safe talk what was the Ixtoc well it was\nA it was it was my way of illustrating absurdity by being absurd\nUm that\nOccurred back in Nineteen eighty four eighty five and and back then and safe sex was all the rage\nFor a number of reasons not spreading STDs and not getting pregnant and therefore not needing abortions a abstinence which works every time it's tried was being laughed at and pooh poohed as unrealistic you can't say just don't do it that's not going to you're going to do something so safe sex\nA came up and it basically meant to use a condom so I thought\nThat I Would ah demonstrate the folly of this belief\nBy demonstrating safe talk and what I did was over a series of days I just do it once but first I grabbed a condom and I stretch that tight and I placed it on the microphone we have photos of this being taken approval before they ever did OK I'm dreaming about\nWhat the sound effect of the condom being placed the microphone was almost think of all\nAnd then after the condom was in place to demonstrate safe talk I wouldn't I'd asked or do you think now if I said\nAfter the condom was in a place to demonstrate safe talk I Would I asked her do you think now if I say anything that offends you that this condom will protect\nIf other profanity if I start engaging activities you don't want to hear as well this

were additions and a additional aspects to it as it happened it wasn't just a a one time\nThat it had a point to make so was ongoing and then that was followed by shortly after moving to New York a
