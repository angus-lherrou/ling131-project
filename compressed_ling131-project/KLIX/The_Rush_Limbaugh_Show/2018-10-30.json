happen [noise]\n[noise] I went to an event\nOut there last night I might not have not been going to too many events but I went to an event last night I Can't tell you the number of people I ran into these are donors I went to a donor event like a bunch of people\nI think there's going to be a red wave like you can't believe I Try to test on them I rather than joined them in their enthusiasm I tried to talk them down a little bit I just wanted to test whether they were being emotional or whether they actually fought it out\nSo Iran or you do it's got to be a red wave and\nIt's gonna be big it's going to shock everybody people are going to be starting just like they weren't two years ago I said okay well I Hope you're right but let me let me give you some facts\nOn the ground forty yeah oh yeah we're going to get to the birthright citizenship is it just a second here but I Want to set it up with this 'cause man this is great what Trump is doing on birth for all\nThis is exactly why Trump was elected\nAs my good friend in the car the enemy and said you gotta have somebody that's willing to break the furniture you have to have somebody willing to turn things upside down if you're actually going to get things done and the left is beside itself today CNBC it's headlined Crump\nTrump's attack on birthright citizenship is just the latest attempt to rile up the GOP based\nEverybody's saying he can't do that that's a fourteenth amendment he can't universally with an executive order reverse the fourteenth amendment we want to discuss how maybe he can he's going to run into activist judges that'll that'll turned him down here but the point is that you need somebody like Donald Trump that's all\nThe fourteenth amendment is what grants citizenship to anybody born in America and it was intended it goes back to the Eighteen hundreds it was intended\nTo grant citizenship to slaves and their descendants and how old are you how do you think modern African Americans they would feel if the fourteenth amendment\nWhich was used to grant citizenship to this slams and their descendants is now being used a grant citizenship to anybody and gets into the country just for the purposes of giving birth here\nAnd so this is something it's long been thought to be untouchable Trump is saying I look I think I can fix this one of the executive order and the reason he thinks so it is because\nBut all of these events were designed\nTo cause this blue wave weren't designed to create this massive voter intensity and the turnout\nBy Democrats and even now in the early voting Republican turnout is much larger than democratic turnout unheralded that's unprecedented Republicans seldom show up this while in early voting it's hard to explain it away\nFor the conclusion is that there has been no blue way there is not even been a blue ripple\nThat you might even say there hasn't been a blue drip\n\nSome blue bubbles are bursting recall the blue bubbles are areas of blue support last time blue congressional districts and major coastal cities so this guy is off the firm\nBelief that a conservative red wave or Republican red wave is coming and is on the way [noise] [noise]\nMany other people are either it's I've I've heard some people that were rush look if I\nGot to be very very careful those forty five Republican retirements that's that's such a toss up I don't know how\nTo factor all of that that's more retirements in a single year than where ever used to having to factor in\n\nHere and the power of incumbency and those forty five seats\nHas been or has been lost I think by the way the political professionals are going to be hyping the fact that as things stand I this is probably what you're going to hear from a lot of places things stand now looks like the Democrats might when my house by two\nMaybe four seats and that's going to be designed to get you to not get lazy and over confident that don't don't be dispirited by any of that you hear the evidence that there is no blue wave is the is the\nEvidence of panic that is\nPrevalent throughout the drive by media because their efforts to derail\nTrump have failed\nEvery one of them including the big one\nForcing Trump out of office because he supposedly colluded with Russia is Robert Mueller was supposed to have it delivered to go to the special counsel buying now all was supposed to have core Trump Trump was supposed to be on the way out by now\nDo not doubt me that's what everybody on the left held out in great hope\nFor the special counsel investigation\nBarring a natural report they had been hoping and praying for\nA week that would be\nThat the report does say that Mahler found hard evidence that Trump important cheated and stole the election from a court shows\nIn any such leaks that's the big one that has blown up do not doubt me on this by now\nMahler was supposed to have delivered the guards that drive by media was supposed to have delivered the leaks so now it's off the plan B\nAnd plans see and so forth and that's why I say that kind of\nIt's obvious panic also argues against the fact that they feel confident\nIn a in a blue wave let's take

these years is the honoring intellectual results yeah have a heated campaign you may have political parties and all of us really don't like each other but whoever won the election decided who\nHad a chance at running the country and both sides acknowledge that and it wasn't that long ago\n... you can go back to two thousand two when the Democrats lost those mid term elections in shock George W Bush's first midterm elections after winning in two thousand a drive\nBy is on the left what convinced that they were going to sweep the house the way they were going to sweep the Senate away with people were set up with the Florida recount remember all that yeah that Al Gore got jobs the Democrats got cheated and Democrats were loaded for bear out what happened to Republicans one and added seats in an off year election\nWhat the Democrats they accepted it for the most part and they started talking about how well we're gonna have to modify some of what we believe are our values are basis
