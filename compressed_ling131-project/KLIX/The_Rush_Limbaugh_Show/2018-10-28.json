called the ... and ...\nAnd they have either six or eight eyes they have fangs that have venom in them to do their prey and kill them and they also are able to produce silk\nThere are three types of spiders that are usually depicted on Halloween the black widow brown recluse and the tarantula you don't want to handle the black widow or the regular was since they produce them that is harmful to humans but truly Antos says that the tarantula who is a different story\nTrenches are actually very very interesting spiders no actually most tarantulas are pretty docile and people keep them as pets you find them in and pet stores\nTarantula or like any other spider so they are per day shifts but usually it's on organisms that are smaller than than what's cool about trench lives is that they have little hairs all over their bodies and when a prey\nComes along and it's it's about the right side they'll get the right amount of vibration to those hairs and that will take them to come out of there are hiding area and to to grab their prey\nSo it's a human walks by that's way too many vibrations on their little hairs and typically they're going to stay put\nOut the spider ever end up as a symbol of Halloween drawing on those says that like most of the holidays favorite figures it's a mixture of folklore fear\nAnd soul first she says that the medieval times spiders were thought of as the companions of which is like the black cat\nSecond fear of spiders is common in our country and finally the fall season is when spiders make their most dramatic entrances into our habitats\nIn many parts of the country that's in temperate zone you've got the fall weather\nThen Armstrong is co owner of nether world haunted house in Atlanta and president of America haunts much organization of the top haunted attractions in the U.S\nHe says there is some debate over the holidays true origins is it from a Celtic festival a Roman feast Christianity he says no matter who started at Halloween has a lot in common with each culture\nWanted of course it's a harder celebration it's at the time of the year where the nights become longer or where it starts getting a little colder in the classical mythological\nDeaths in reverse cycle it is it's a period where we enter into I guess winter so it's a start yeah if you will so it's both a celebration of the harvest but it's also a time when the veil as fan and people think about the dark and I think about ghosts and I think about ancestors\nFor shorter than that tradition tradition of the Harvard tried with you know the celebration of the Harvard tried with darker part of the year that I'm going to get a little colder\nCold days and early nights lend themselves to the feeling of impending doom and death and all things creepy and scary even carving the pumpkin has its origins in a dark and unsavory character\nThe pumpkin imagery is tied to the contract that the Jack o' lantern and there was a character named Jack was so often even the devil didn't want him so he fed 'em loose to roam the earth with a burning ember and it was actually in that turn up even after ... with the burning ember to turn up\nAnd then when the Irish immigrants came over to America they had a much better saying that it's kinda hard to carve out a term credit found the pumpkins that became the Jack o' lantern and it kept the name of attack it was a traditional character in the story\nOf course black cat images are everywhere on Halloween and that's because they were thought to be the familiar of witches and very unlucky to come across\nArmstrong says that the holiday has traveled from Ireland to America and now back to Europe where children and adults both take part in the u._k. where guy Fox stay in November was the big fall celebration Halloween attractions have become very popular\nI was just over in England a few months ago at a very large divide there called ... hours and I discovered that they have a huge Halloween celebration I mean the theme parks have embraced Halloween like no one's business I mean it's actually the second\nThey have a huge Halloween celebration\nOf the theme parks have embraced Halloween like no one's business I mean it's actually the second largest money making call a day after Christmas but we have\nAnd the other thing that's happened\nWith Halloween is that it was a tooth all day but it's sort of kind of grown into on adults and young adults holiday\nIt's now a lot of the traditions that were family trick or treating you know twenty Thirty years ago now there's a big focus on Halloween parties it was a focus aren't going to haunted attraction\nUnlike family holiday times like Thanksgiving and Christmas Armstrong says said Halloween has become more of a party time like New Year's eve\nAnd with the Halloween party come to mask the makeup and the costume we asked Dr Janine a scarlet about that aspect of the holiday Scarlett is a clinical psychologist scientist and self proclaimed fulltime geek\nShe's also a practitioner of superhero therapy and it's coming out with a book by that title next July she says that costumes allow us to hide our true selves for awhile and become someone who's attributes we might admired\nThere's something really exciting about dressing up about pretending to be someone we're not we're usually going throughout our day completely may be inhibited are confined by or environment or social but when we put on a hot still maybe we can pretend to be someone good friend we can almost\nTry on and defend the lifestyle for a second\nAnd at that moment maybe we don't have to be and then have it may be it can be really exciting to do that\nFor that reason many people actually really enjoy driving up a different characters sometimes even checking out the completely opposite characters of their true personality\nScarlet says that the character you choose me say something about your personality that your aerobics or like a certain time period in history or not\nIt means different things to different people there's not one blanket statement for everyone for some people they just like certain ... certain characters for others they like to dress up as they very heroes that a fire them for example some people always go as\nBatman for example or pat burrow because they really admire these characters and they want to be like and others like to address those ... and I have some concern parents sometimes contacting me an asking me what it put me and if their child wants to dress up as the joker and Batman\nAnd it doesn't mean anything on time it's just fun to pretend to be bad and usually the people that try to do and they're not\nThe kind of people that will do anything like what the character they selected would do it's fun to roll clay sometimes\nGame play a role play it's actually healthy for people it when we're literally play all the time but when we grow up kind of lose that ability\nHalloween costumes are sometimes funny sometimes heroic and a lot of the time scary why is it that we want to be scared we go to haunted houses horror movies and allow ourselves to be frightened on this day like no other\nWhen we're afraid to we we kind of bond together and when we're close to other people who are also afraid our bodies actually released a hormone called actually chosen that makes us feel good so we can be scared and excited at the same time and the physiology of fear and joy is actually the ...\nThe ones we know that we're being scared on purpose it's exhilarating\nIt's not so much the chance to be horrified that makes people go to haunted attraction though Armstrong says it's more the element of surprise\nIs that when I go into our distraction I'm not truly afraid\nArmstrong says it's more the element of surprise\nThat when I go into art attraction I'm\nNot truly afraid of art attraction but if I open myself up to observe what is going on around me I can be startled just like anybody because that's the key aspect almost anyone can be startled and as a sudden shock someone jumps up as a loud noise something unexpected happens\nAnd that almost anyone can experience that and that is a thrill you have a rash of adrenaline afterwards you feel good\nIf you're scared and it's something truly truly horrifying that's happening in that's a bad feeling you know that's a feeling where you're like sick and your stomach but when you get startled and immediately you realize you're safe and you laugh it's a great feeling\nArmstrong is in the business of scaring people with his haunted attraction you can find them in almost every city in the country this time of year whether it's at an amusement park or an old house but what makes a good haunted attraction nice days\nTo the haunted house going public in general people just love a traditional heart housework scary it on\nAnd in these days has a very high production value the modern attractions you see the offer amazing special effects\nThey offer projection spinning tunnel incredible characters lots and lots of actors lots of excitement so when taking an attraction I suggest you worked for one that really has the production value that really you can see what it's about it's like\nGoing to a blockbuster movie you know look at the marketing materials talk to your friend and pick on that he was good for you\nEven the experts can be scared at Halloween as our guest can attest to\nI get scared by mundane thing that gets scared by rain on a busy night [laughter] I get scared by things that\nMake it hard to operate by business and not afraid of the darker particular critters or any of that it's more the more mundane things that people and visit her for eight of I'm afraid that the things that that ... and then I I Love walking gag and at the same kinds of traits may out\nZombies they don't even exist in real life starlet says that psychologically people are more scared of things they don't know

else and she didn't have any money to do it right now I guess I guess the only safe thing as ... medicine was expensive back then\nShe came to a place you spend all that she had the Bible says and she didn't get any better\nBut she said there's a couple of things that we tried to glean from this she the word says that she said if I can just touch the him of his government\nSo if you read it like that you just kind of maybe don't get the depths of that but in the original language that says that she kept saying within herself she kept saying within herself if I can just touch the him of his government will be made whole well what do we call that concept of just saying within yourself what do we call that\nWe call that meditating on the word of God right so what we found is that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God so so she heard about Jesus and what we discovered that from the story it wasn't just at the moment that she heard about Jesus you've heard about Jesus before\nAnd that began the trigger something on the inside of her right we understand that faith begin to ruin her faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God Romans ten Seventeen and so when she first heard about this miracle worker\nThey begin to ruin her faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God Romans ten Seventeen and so when she first heard about this miracle worker about this guy that many people were healed their diseases\nYour first responds isn't cool that's mine maybe on sometimes it takes us a while to grab a hold of it to where we really believe it I mean to where we really say yeah\nI can grab a hold of that it's just like salvation they tell us that when a sinner here's the gospel message that Jesus Christ came to save us from our sins\nAnd all the truth about who he is that you know he was born of a version that he died he rose again\nAnd then he took it upon himself all the sins of mankind and that threw him we can be said you know you hear somebody somebody hears that and and hasn't come from a church background very rarely\nCan they believe that at the first hearing right in fact statistics say that somebody has to hear the gospel message at least five times significantly before they come to a place of belief well we get that that's just meditate and that's that's hearing truth and going\nReally really wow period again me\nBegin to meditate on a like a couch she was on its cut and gets more and more out of and then all of a sudden years ago in the seventies do you remember the Ford commercial or a light bulb came on right where a light bulb came on and that's that's that's the\nSort of the easiest pitcher is that all of a sudden there was a guy I'll never forget just love this guy and I was sharing the gospel with him and it was years I just I just love this guy and I just thought you know I'm just gonna keep sharing the gospel with it he would end every one of our conversations like\nThis he would start crying tears would run down his eyes and he would say this he would say past her show you don't know what I've done and I just find a really hard to believe that I could be forgiven for what I've done\nIt in every conversation that way this went on for a period of years so in his mind\nHe heard the truth but the truth was too good to be true he just couldn't grab a hold of it in for him he just couldn't see how God forgive him I to this day he's never shared with me what he did but it could just tell after a while this I I don't know what this do did but man it must have been pretty big dog\n'cause he'd say you you don't know what I've done\nSo after a few years I had the privilege of kneeling down in a back yard under a tree in the shade in the summer and I led that man that Jesus Christ it took awhile for him to believe that Jesus could forgive him for all of us\nAnd and obviously for him something was so horrible that he didn't feel like there was any way so this lady says that she kept saying within herself\nWell what was she doing [noise] she was meditating on truth and during that time of meditation the Holy Spirit of God was able to take that truth of God's word which is foundational ... ever have legal building blocks\nThe Greek word is Logan us write\nThe building blocks of God's word to all of a sudden it became not a building block but it became freshly spoken to cold rain or by the Holy Spirit that it went from that age truth to that your truth and she was able to grab that\nAnd so she said if I'm just she just kept saying if I can just get to it touches government all the\nJesus ... something that happened pretty phenomenal how many you know not all touches of the same it's really important to understand that not all touches of the same but that touch with a touch that changed her life\nJesus said who touched me the disciples responded very sarcastically ... series or are you serious Jesus really really look at the crowd here we can hardly walk here it's taken us forever to get through this guy's place and you're asking who touched me\nI Love that part of the story All right\nSo then she said your faith daughter your faith has made your whole we spend a bit of time on that I think I don't know we did it in for a service or second service but the subtext of that the second tax that's that's not written is that it's not just that you know 'cause some can read that in St Paul meant she did it all see it was her am am if you know\nIt takes God and I know people would say well we know that but I think it's important to always remind ourselves that we're at the mercy of God that's a great place to be\n'cause his mercy from everlasting everlasting in other words it's him that did it is so he's in your face the kicker is they've always have to always has to have a target\nSo we know this that it just wasn't her that caused this to happen\nAnybody goes down that road is a very very very dangerous road because then it begins to you begin to do things that you don't need to do things\nAre you with me but it was him in other words if if if you could put it in and full text daughter\nIt's your faith in me dismayed you'll stay always has to have a target always has to have a source would be a better way to say that so now we're down I don't know probably in the thirties yeah who touched me All right there I see it\nSo he said go and teach your field of your affliction\nNow we pick up while he was speaking I'm inverse thirty five of mark five\nSome from the ruler of the synagogues house came and said\nYour daughter is dead lied trouble the teacher any further so you can read the story and into the other gospels Matthew chapter nine and a new chapter eight you can read the same account one of those accounts says is\nThat the the ruler of the Senegal came and said your daughter is dead so don't trouble the master any further in other words this guy's a busy guy okay so so you know he didn't make it here she's dead and so don't troubling\nAs soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken\n[noise] he said to the root of the synagogue don't be afraid so so think about this O. J. iris came ask Jesus to come and lay hands on his daughter 'cause she was at the point of death\nAnd I'll listen to think about if you're Jay iris think about this story from jail recess standpoint if you look at the story from the lady with the issue of blood standpoint\nThat's a great story from her perspective right she she just knew if I can just touch the him and his government will be made whole so so there wasn't anyone or anything that was going to stop her from touching it to him of his government there's truth there how maybe you know you get focused right\nBut if you're Jay iris are you thinking you're liking this crowd and liking this delay\nI don't think that if you're Jay Irish and that's your little baby scripture tells us that that this little girl was twelve years old and if that you can you just imagine J iris just kind of going you know what can we get this road on the show show [laughter]\nInsects she's dying I Need you to get here now and then\nSomebody from the house Congress and Jay irises with Jesus and the whole crowd and there's there's tons of people around and it's not a private moment is a public moment and it and it speaks up and says listen\nYour daughter has died there's no reason to trouble the master inference so now we got a funeral they have right\nBut as soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken he said that the ruler do not be afraid to say it together say do not be afraid\nThis is so powerful listen in the area of the healing I'll just say this and this isn't again this isn't the teaching on how to obtain hailing it's it's not that maybe there's a\nPoint that can be shared that might might touch you might you might maybe somebody shared with me this morning that filled in a puzzle or you know whatever I don't know but whenever you hear contrary things to the truth of God's word I Want to encourage you don't ignore it\nIn the community to come out in the\nThirty years ago you know we're going to have a lot of Chinese a lot of candy and we want\nMake sure you come on out here maybe that Russia when he springtime you know I have friends how can I have a great time and we all knew the ending\n[noise]\nNews then talk on the radio dishes news radio Thirteen ...

[noise]\n\n\nWhen [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] that we've seen [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nIt is the Jesus Christ show I\nOnly host having to be with you this Sunday as I Am every single Sunday right here answering your questions and talking about things a truly matter in life\nAnd the afterlife I'd love to hear from you if you have a theology question or life situation anywhere in the U.S ... eight seven seven holy host\nNumerically that's eight seven seven for six five nine for six seven and we'll get your your your calls in just a bit here did you know you were a pagan\n\nAnd the reason why I wanted you to think this way is because of course Halloween being tomorrow it always around this time start stirring up questions about uh\nYou know the origins of Halloween and should Christians participate or there are things that Christians should not participate in in life yeah sure there are a Christian liberty is far and wide and the individual Christian has to use you just have to use your discernment\nTo know what's going to be beneficial what's good which glorified God all of those things should be thought about\nWhat to throw something out or to say that it has no value when if you addressed it slightly different it would be fine that really you're dealing with the origin of something that doesn't even exist anymore\n\nSo the roots of Halloween yes are found in paganism but that doesn't necessarily mean because ah Sal when was this this Celtic festival was celebrated a one point and it morphed into all saints day in all saints day a morphine or to the day before\nBeing all Hallows eve and now morphed into Halloween\nAnd then over the centuries and centuries and centuries this once religious\nFestivals\nBut at night and the uniqueness of the experience and not all the previous\n\nPagan rituals is important to being a balanced parents didn't understand anti balance Christian and understand how you interact with this world\nYou were in this world for a reason and that that reason really is to glorify God and you find ways glorify God would you rate the leaves or do the dishes or do your job\nOn you celebrate\nThe problem the God of Christianity has with paganism or any other belief system for that matter if not with the general practices of the belief\nNecessarily but the fact they worship another God altogether [noise] this is the problem this is where\nGod says I have a problem exodus twenty three twenty first three you shell have no other God's before me\nThis is where God's concern is\nThere isn't a commandment about you should not dressed up in fun and make believe or you shall not receive sweets from the hand of a neighbor or anything like that\n\nOh I'm sure that somebody would like to twist scripture defines something like that but that's not the case\nIt's really about being having a community and experiencing that community\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nJust for show will return in a

left\nHand there if you're wearing or wedding ring\nYou're wearing something with origin in paganism in ancient magic\n\nAnd the concept of the circle as it is seen as this andel essence timeless\n\nThing that you can wear and it suggests a kind of repetitive are unbroken time and space and you can see it in many pagan uses a such a Stonehenge\nAnd others that predate Christianity and\nEven in Christianity itself there are symbols and practices that come from or were used by pagan the cross itself\nIs a pagan symbol\nAnd wasn't even used very very early on in the Christian Church\nBut you don't think of things that way\nYou don't think that there's an overlap or there's a mainly at all but there is a sure you and your everyday life and even in your face\n\nAnd his Eighteen Seventy eight essay on the development of the Christian doctrine John Henry Newman who\nWas originally a priest in the church of England and later a cardinal in the Roman Catholic Church wrote these words they use of temples\nAnd these dedicated to particular saints an ornament id on occasion with branches of trees incense lamps candles holy days an seasons use of calendars for sessions\nBlessings on the fields the ring and marriage all of our all of pagan origin and sank defied by their adoption into the church\n\nAre all of pagan origin and sank defied by their adoption into the church so even across the joins me churches has pagan Oregon's also the beloved fish symbol used by many to identify themselves as Christians whether it's on your\nClothing or on your car\nUm it was used by pagan generations before Christianity the new age movement Hindus towers Buddhist\nAnd others use the symbol of the fish to express their own beliefs different beliefs as well\nThe symbol for Virgo the sixth astrological signing the Audi act if you look has a pagan fish in it because of its the direction of the fish people don't always noticed that\nIn the dictionary of symbols that states that Virgo is based on the he break let her mom and the Phoenician symbol meaning fish\n\nSo as you can see you'll you'll have to run very far\n\nTo try and distance yourself from anything as pagan roots or is associated with the religions other than Christianity and it's not that it's not a noble cause to run away that says resist the deaf the devil and he shelf way\n\nYou don't need to be running everywhere in fear you have Christ in you and if I Am for you than we are the majority\nNo man can be against you\nSo running away from these things and not understanding that doesn't help anyone and sometimes makes them sexier to younger kids and more intriguing than it would if you allow them to be this simple secular thing that they are and put your own spin on it however you might want to\nBut how much more important is it that the things and customs and your life or all dedicated that God rather than looking for the devil under every stone\nCelebrations like Halloween can seem on the surface like a contradiction to Christianity I get that that really is more about how it's celebrated than where it came from that matters\nAnd you see this throughout the church there were many things that even our Jewish brothers and sisters dead even the early church did that pagan is dead but they did it to the right God\n\nWhen churches shy away from ... Halloween and opt for you know instead of celebration\nOr of a harvest festival or something like that it gives children more of a reason to be curious about why everyone else's celebrating something they are not in maybe\nEven seek out more about paganism than they would otherwise and and not to mention celebrating the harvest in any way shape or form has pagan origins as well\nSo you're sort of changing it but not everything everything in life can be used for good or evil\nA knife can either kill in the hands of a mugger or he'll in the hands of a surgeon\nAnd he must remember\nKen either kill in the hands of a mugger or hue in the hands of a surgeon\n\nAnd he must remember that how you use it or partake in something and you were intent is important and I know that it that you know it's easier just to cut things out and if that's where you feel led to and God Bless you in\nThe important thing is to serve God and to ah serve your family in a way that is helping glorifying to God and if you feel something in your life is not healthy or good or glorifying to God and then of course cut it out\nBut sometimes in\nIn removing these things ... Lee without understanding where the true we come from or or the other things around you and your life that become similarly you you missed the bigger picture and in doing so uh it's\nLike those surgeries there were a doctor will tell you there that's not necessary Sergio wouldn't do this because you can go in and mess something else more\nWhy not put restrictions on it in a healthy way\nOr be interactive with your children in a way the Halloween you can be something dealing with fun and creativity and those types of things and not death in December meant\nAnd glorify God because remember first Corinthians ten thirty one above all of this so whatever you eat or drink or whatever you do\nDo it all for the glory of God\n\n\n\nBless her heart for sure\nMessage\n... owning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload but what if there were\nA business degree to further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur isn't thought leaders and what if you could earn that\nDegree and it's a little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line to find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five that's ...

if they were in ... evil masking maybe go out at dusk before it gets too dark it's okay\nBut the whole point is that a pretty much we're following you know taking holiday\nNo actually it's not any more that's that's the true point is that it's not anymore and if anything if you could imagine an old decay building that was used as a as a you know a showing crack\nOr something James that has been re painted in re fixed up to be something that is more productive and better and that should be honored it's not about what it used to be it's about what it can become\nAnd that that really is on the
