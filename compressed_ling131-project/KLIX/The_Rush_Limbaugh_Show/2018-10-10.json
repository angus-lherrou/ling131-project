or are they a\nFight the guy that I was sitting next to brought his daughter he took\nA lot of small they switch thought her I was just amazed that the ... I don't think that there's any massage any whatsoever of the Republican base I think that\nOf course there isn't this idea that this Republican war on women isn't completely manufactured ally\nYou know Mitt Romney being asked in a debate by Stephanopoulos do those states ought to have the right to ban contraception wide\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happened just by writing a story a legit\nAnd of course their buddies in the ... floor gladly\nAccept an allegation is fact and an act on it you know we needed to show a pattern here is a Christopher Smith bill Ohio your next I'm Glad you waited five\nHigh right very very cool to talk to you [laughter] thank you um so I\nWas just wondering I was concerned and money to get your thoughts you mentioned that front of it yesterday but with this novel as it is and that Hillary claiming that they're partying needs now civility right now I'm\nI just get worried with the\nMoms and they left as an accident and them threatening or if they begin to help people um\nIt just had me worried about provoking violence um in to the point where we don't do anything pressure on fire but come stickers in our yard on our cars because we truly are the silent majority we're not out there\nShowing it I mean I've been to rally but um it just hasn't really scared and worried because you can all living my day each day\nIt's totally understandable you you mean you need your your your support for Trump is not a way of rain but you don't\nYou don't feel safe\nPublicly demonstrating that are showing it was basically right\nCorrect couldn't I don't blame you a bit\nYounger who worry me is if you said you were thinking about dropping support for Trump just to make oh no\n[laughter] no no no I just it it worries me with um\nI Do a lot of people are worried about this and I'll tell you I think ... I think there are a lot of people like you who just don't want to call attention to themselves 'cause this is an insane group of people and they're showing a willingness to a salt and a timid data intact anybody and you're right to think that violence is just around the corner\nAnd who wants to bring that on so your point is that there are a lot of people like you who are going to vote the way Trump would want them to vote for him I ... for Republicans coming up in this election that nobody maybe counting\nYes um you know nobody's got signed in science and a yard sale everybody I talked to is a hundred percent mad guy though ... and nobody talks about it and it's almost like you know we with her about it like ... are are you okay with Trump oh\nYes it's out in the old in the old Soviet Union people would go to the bathrooms in their house to whisper to each other what they really thought because they were afraid that the state that the regime was listening to him\nAnd so you're basically just driving describing the same thing the differences that in in twenty sixteen there were Trump yard signs everywhere you went in states across this country they're not there now with our purpose it on the ballot either so\nYou you might not be all that many Trump signs to be put in charge but but your point is the outward support for Donald Trump is is being suppressed\nSo I think\nWhat you're concerned about violence is shared let it grabs soundbite number nine listen to this ... this is Rand Paul it was on Fox in France today\nAnd uh a mostly and usually at heart a\nYou have a big fear about this rhetoric your fear is that somebody's going to get killed\nSomeone almost did I was there at the ball field when Stevens police almost died from a very very angry violent man\nWho is inside and really via rhetoric on the left and this hasn't been reported enough\nWhen he came onto the field with a semi automatic\nFiring probably close to two hundred shots at us shooting five people almost ... he was yelling [noise] this is for health care\nHe also had a list of conservative legislators Republicans in his pocket when he was willing to kill so what happens when Democrats said get up in their faces they need to realize that there are a lot of unstable people out there there are people with anger issues there are people that are prone to violence there is going to be an assassination if this doesn't ratchet down and\nI think the other side needs to really calm the rhetoric down\nPretty much what you're saying you're afraid of violence being visited on you and here's Rand Paul fearing that an assassination is going to take place the Democrats are not going to call their people back the Democrats are not going to ask them calmed down I think some Democrats themselves are afraid of these people\nBut privately I think the Democrats are encouraging this privately I think the Democratic party wants America to think that this\nIn unhinged behavior is pretty natural pretty normal that it is representative of of a majority of American people are like a Democrats want that perception out there they want the anger\nAnd the un has behavior justified\nOn the basis the trumpet so unacceptable Trump is so bad so dangerous so sick so whatever but there's a lot of reasons they're not going to tamp down there's a lot of reasons they're not going to distance themselves from it and there's a lot of reasons why they're not going to ask these people to back off a little it'd be more responsible\nThey don't think it would help them\nThey think this kind of on the hinged I'm Sorry for not having a better word but I don't know better when I many times can you call them insane or not riot or\nMentally disease or what have you but regardless what you call them the Democrats think there's value in these people doing what they were doing in the Senate office building and confronting people in elevators and basically frightening the\nWhatever it takes what ever it takes\nTo get done what they need to get done so don't don't think that they're going to get a dose sensibility or responsibility and asked for it to be dialed the back part of it I think is that some of the Democrats themselves are afraid of unleashing misbehavior on themselves\nWhen I'm not going to be said Russia ... worth\nPrices are for these buildings only
