Baker divulge as in the middle of my story about them all types of south because many times\nI've heard you and I've heard Greg say the media has been complicit in this well sky a a Baker gave us an unbelievable anecdote of complicity in November right after the election right after Trump wins the reporter David Corn of Mother Jones\nGives a new version of the ... ... copies it's different from the one the FBI has sort of steel and gives it to Baker and then Baker turns it on to the a counter intelligence people why is that important first off it's not a job a reporter to be getting evidence the FBI which we're supposed to report facts not become snitches but more importantly the timing\nOf it is so important the FBI just fired Christopher Steele for leaking um\nAh the existence of the investigation and all that dirty hat on Trump just before the election he gets fired they televise the court they're no longer using him and hear it becomes a backdoor a journalist becomes a backdoor to continue to receive information for Christopher Steele this is not\nHow the eyes of process is supposed to work and I think it's another key revelation I mean I I think they ... give us several key revelations I Won the challenges the credibility of Rosa theme one that shows the media uh uh being complicit in in the effort to unseat Trump and three as a direct\nInvolvement of the Democratic National Committee lawyer and turning on evidence pressuring\nThe yeah I think of what happened in that time from\nThe Christopher Steele July fifth twenty sixteen walks into the FBI and Europe\nHe gets turned out they don't act on 'em right away they if they're not excited about it a few days later he goes to Bruce or the number four official in the Justice Department Bruce or puts pressure on the FBI department by reaching out and doing it a month later you've got a the the ... lawyer coming into the FBI again\nPutting pressure on to the system there was an enormous amount of political pressure to get the FBI to find something uncomfortable for election day and I think when we look back at this we should all be alarmed fake Donald Trump out of this\nAny candidate any American who had been treated this way it really raises civil liberty concerns that really raises abuse of power concerns or who should all be concerned by body\nOf evidence that now we're farms right Greg Jared has written in his book\nIt is so scary that when you put it all together and now the pieces seemed to make it literally at the end for those the puzzles together usually start on the outside and you get all the square parts on the outside and then you start filling in the pieces of the puzzle then the next thing you have a tree then you have the grass and you have the sun\nAnd slowly but surely it seems like we now\nUnderstand a lot more and that is that we had\nA group of people\nThat literally set up an entire phony Russia investigation the very people that exonerated Hillary long before they investigated her the very people that literally signed off on warrants that are based on information she had provided by committing fraud\nThe very people that literally signed off on warrants

we think we could use against them on top of a pony investigation that they've\nThey initiated through a media release strategy again of the ... you\nKnow one of the things that really ticked me off if there was a plot to frame Donald Trump again the title of my book is I went through meticulously\nThe FBI guidelines and the department of justice regulations on winning how you can launch a counterintelligence investigation of an American citizen\nAnd what I discovered is that the FBI violated every single solitary provision of their own guidelines they had no\nCredible evidence of crimes no plausible intelligence to justify a counterintelligence probe importantly they had no probable cause and yet on July thirty first two thousand and sixteen they officially\nA launch this investigation Peter Struck signed the papers he had just finished meeting with Christopher Steele and in fact the same day that James Comey cleared Hillary Clinton\nTwisting the long controlling the facts his FBI was meeting for the first time in Europe in a building with Christopher Steele\nWho had compose this phony dossier that the FBI\nWas never able\nTo verify and yet they ran with this dial

how are you good to see him\nVery social and thanks for having me or I didn't think uh this title would be as appropriate as it is often lost Seventy two hours but my we are in a fight right now for the future of the Republicans\nIs a fight for the future of the republic the one thing I Love about you and I've come to know you very well is that you are a patriot\nAnd you understand evil in our time evil abroad the need to defend and keep America strong and you understand the political aspects of it as well because if you elect the wrong people and we're going to have policies of appeasement again in that renders us more vulnerable\nJust look at the last eight years what do we ...\nWe had a commander in chief who started his presidency with an apology tour and then he blamed on the bad things in the world on America\nWhat resulted the rise of ISIS Russia invading its may but Chinese Chinese re militarization of the end of the above administrator and just one metric take take politics out of it for a second we had sixty five million refugees in the world that's moving we had\nAt the end of World War two when you don't have American leadership the world is the most dangerous place now about ... thanks to Donald Trump we'd have a modern chief who believes\nIt has also speech listen to what he says about ISIS about what the Chinese are doing what he said at the

godly man\nBrett Kavanaugh in the last fourteen days a man who had the probably the cleanest most spotless record in an American public life goes from being a stand up standing federal judge ... to amass\nRapist they will use every tool because they lost the election and that's why the next thirty days are so important shown\nIt means ah everything and then look everything's riding on this I don't know if you want to ask me three weeks ago I Would have leaned in on the side that history would would win out because the party that wins the White House usually ends up losing seats in a midterm election that totally not happened three times\nOnly only picked up seats three times in the last hundred years the last was\nAfter two thousand and one an attack by a number eleven September eleventh um but there's so much at stake here and that is what ... literally jumps off the page as I'm reading through your book that we better defeat America's enemies\nAnd we'd better do without apologies the tactic orca we don't get to do that\nIf we're not in power right\nWe we have to take very seriously this concept of the left so the left has been taken over by the radicals thinking about the fight that JFK would not be allowed into the Democrat Party today a hardcore anti communist drawing national security he wouldn't be allowed into the DNC what do we have\nWe have the crazies we have the will cost you a court has is we have the Maxine Waters in control who have made a pact with the devil may have said very simply the ends justify the means we want power and we will use any tool well guess who used our philosophy in the past about philosophy drives to the labor\nCamps to drive to the ... and Dr death camps whether you are right wing extremist whether you're a fascist or whether you're a communist that's the philosophy and we've got to stop that shall we have to stay true to the principles of the republic\nYou talk it in a book about the a will to winter and and again the title why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies and here's what we can't have any more and you talk about the will to when you talk about will\nIs if you go back to Vietnam we lost fifty eight thousand brave Americans and we allow that war to become politicized yes and we pulled out you know in Iraq and Afghanistan we pull out\nLeaving it dates of all withdraw and we lost nearly six thousand kids in the end so many others comeback without their arms and legs in their in their faces just figured\nFighting for their country we cannot commit American troops ever again\nUnless we are willing to win the war if we're not willing to do what it takes to win the war than we are not get involved ever period unless we have to have to win these wars or else don't start to be involved in them\nSo so my book is about two things it's about all the threats we face as a country so whether it's ISIS Russia or China but the second part is much more important this is the one who hitting on\nIts do we have the will to defeat our enemies because Vietnam is the great example we were the most powerful nation in the world and a bunch of guys with the wooden sticks and Ross the rifles defeat us how's that possible\nBecause we lost the war at home because we allow the left to undermine our will to win and and one of the most important things is the individual real to win in addition to the the ... of the threats I have\nTo go back to the Bobby was two hundred years ago I talk about a Korean hero adjusted pulled her I talk about a man\nWho spent six and a half

dot com promote Hannity this offer ends on friday\nThat there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a the OJ to on the president of United States\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one\nAnd I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measured I tell you who's not measured at this particular point\nUh you you've got Rod Rosenstein believing that he can hide behind the fact that he's the number two at the oj I can tell you got to people on the phone today Jim Jordan Mark Meadows who are not going to let that happen\nOkay Jim Jordan why is this even an issue why isn't you you have the power to subpoena Rod Rosenstein who you're not and bring them in and put them under oath\nYeah I mean and this is why that should happen and I hope I hope chairman Goodlatte will do that we've already subpoena the Medicaid memos and the kitten that most of what the New York times\nCited that said there were people in that room with Rod Rosenstein who set by the time was talking about recording the president United States so we have the FBI former chief counsel a council Jim Baker saying he took that as seriously when he was told about that meeting that Rod Rosenstein was thinking about recording the commander in chief of this great country\nAnd we have in the Cape memos that reinforce that we've subpoenaed that became memos and we've ... time to come in and answer our questions neither one of those things that happen\nSo that that you know it's a rather than it is leading that you played Shawn he he talked about trained he he talked about facts and and the here and do this and how our our our ... our justice system works well one of the hallmarks\nOf our justice system is transparency show what the documents give us the Cape memos and more importantly comments or questions that's what bothers both of us well why would the committee allow him to pull out of this\nWell I can tell you the committee has shown weak leadership\nOthers both of us well why would the committee allow him to pull out of this\n[noise] well I can tell you the committee has shown weak leadership and I'm I I hate to criticize anybody\nA but we've had two weeks I can tell you this the speaker of the house\nThe majority leader of the house a Jim Jordan I with chairman Goodlatte in the room and and two or three other staffers we all agree that what we would do is move expeditiously to have him come into a transcribe interview and if they did not if rod did not because I suspected that he wouldn't come in\nA than we would subpoena him and compel him to do that and I can tell you that ah it's it's more ... on why he should not be transparent and and I for one I'm tired of\nSo we're basically saying Republicans that have the power ... and could literally force him to come and testify under oath an answer these really important questions if there was a plot a scheme a planned now you've got three people corroborating Lisa Page Andrew McCabe announce James Baker\nAll saying that he talked about taping the president of the United states\nIn the hopes that it would provide materials that they can invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment he says no no no I didn't say I was just joking about it I don't see what's so funny about it and said sarcastically I don't I don't even see any sarcasm and that and they are saying that they all believe he was saying it seriously\nYes that that that is accurate and even if he was joking you ... that the guy who was in effect running Justice Department\nShould not be joking with support it's about recording the commander in chief of the United states that\n... that even if it's a joke that is not something you do it particularly at the time that this was happening remember this is back in May of twenty Seventeen when the whole darn cities in an uproar because on a night the president fired Jim Comey on seventeenth ... signed they lower the special counsel there there's one other here's your email happen in between there\nRemember Lisa paid set up to that point they never had any evidence of Trump Russia collusion but there was a menial leaks strategy\nSo that when they were creating an atmosphere where people were thinking there was some type of a reason to appoint a special counsel which now gets back to what the insurance policy was the page and struck we're talking about and it seems we got our answer now\nWell you're right I think not only were they leaking narrative and gyms exactly right you know there's a whole lot that has gone into this you know we're we've got actually a memos that have been subpoenaed testimony that there\nAre a narrative that was put out there by the department of justice and FBI and yet they knew that many of the things that they were putting out in the media could not be substantiated I\nI Would go even further than this you know you you did the lead in I'm not even sure that Rod Rosenstein read the five the application\nMany side you know when you start to look and here's some of the testimony is chilling the amount of documents that they failed to read and I I'm not so sure that Rod Rosenstein even well\nDidn't they will read them do we know they failed to read the more they didn't care I\nMean there's two different possibilities here I'm One of the big problems with all of this is every single item we're discussing here and the Grassley Graham memo pointed it out the Nunes memo pointed out that the bulk of information used to obtain the visor warrants\nThat that they were literally committing fraud on the size of court they never substantiated they'd never verified they never corroborated any of the steel ... of this is Christopher steals you know dot CA and as a result was used as the book\nNever corroborated any of the steel ... of this is Christopher steals you know dot CA and as a result was used as the bulk of informational pain the warrants and the problem is not even steal agrees that there's any truth in what he wrote\nWell they today that's correct that not even a steel and Simpson believe all the things that were given to Bruce or but here's the other problem\nIs is even Bruce or knew that some of the things that he was writing there or not accurate\nAnd and yet somehow they get put in a a three oh two and they get used as a justification to actually a further investigation in terms of the president United States it's just sickening it truly is sick me\nAll right so what's the next step why isn't good latte and Gowdy demanding that that Rod Rosenstein appear tomorrow under oath and answer these questions whether or not he talked about several viciously taping the president of the United states for the purposes\nOf of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment we need an answer to that\nYes we do and the American people need an answer and that's what we'll be pushing a chairman gets to do the indicated that he would do that so now is the time obviously to get that done and make sure Mr Rosenstein gets in there to answer these\nImportant questions now that we know that there's there's actual documents that talk about what took place in that meeting back between midnight and may seventeenth\nOf twenty Seventeen or he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a ... individual who's come forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McCain who came right from that meeting so look we've got a subpoena we've got to bring him in so we asked the question\nI Will take a quick break more with congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina congressman Jim Jordan um Ohio and more on the latest why won't Rod Rosenstein answer these questions under oath will take a quick break come back we'll continue also more
