'cause I don't like the way I mean Trump is making America great you know I Believe that\nBut what about if someone gets in office after him and then I go in there Twenty years later it's maybe going to be a huge mess because of the way America's millennials are going like my sister and I just want to be one of those who gets up there and says\nI'm done with this I Want to change it for\nGood for you um there are a lot of\nAnd says I'm done with this I Want to change it for\nGood for you are there are a lot of people a lot of parents who have kids your age and younger who are really scared about the future of the country has always been the case I for my whole life I have heard people say\nThroughout my life that they don't want to have kids who wouldn't dare want to bring kids into this world that some I remember hearing that when I was Fifteen myself so it's nothing really\nReally knew that I'm sensing today when people say there is a people who have kids not so much to do that I was thinking about it people who have kids are really really worried about their futures because of the way and the left\nHas become more radical and more anti the general concepts of America it's scaring people what kind the country or their kids going to grow into I mean there's always going to be an American about what's going to be are they going to be free\nAre they gonna have to conform to some of this extreme wacko left as them in order to not be hassled build up their lives there's some genuine fear about is if you want to tackle that\nMore power to you and journalism needs people like you in it\nWell and I don't like what you're saying I don't want my kids are my younger sister to grow up in America where\nThere's just a bunch of people that don't even belong in this country hurting and citizens going around trying to do that stuff too I don't want to grow up in a country where you can't even have a gun to protect yourself or to last or a\nCountry where veterans are put behind illegals I mean I\nJust I that's the one that makes me so angry as the\nWhy do you think that's happening why do you think so much attention as being lavish on of the people you referred to as illegals coming here who are not citizens but yet being uh granted access to so many things given so much for do you think is happening\n[noise] ah well there's a lot of reasons for one thing Obama made at all just come our way and you know um but I think just because they think they see what we're going to go there and nobody's gonna stop us you know well maybe the military is going to stop this Tylenol\nUnderstand why America why do you think there is so much for a tolerance for it why do you think so many people are wandering them here and and and want to do nothing to stop them from from getting in cyber you'd think there are so much tolerance for the illegal fallout aspect of this\nI don't well a lot of people who are voting they don't know anything about why [noise] I don't know where to stop why would they ah I don't know why the people are wanting to give away their money to them\nFive I think that they're saying oh well poor people you know their country's war stricken well you know America has out there are people too they can't just give away money to these illegals coming and they're like well they may bring jobs here\nHow are they bringing jobs here when they're going to go work at I mean they're getting a working actor holes cut agriculture or something 'cause I Know there's a lot of illegals that live in California and there's a lot around where I live but\nI don't know the answer is that they worked cheap number one for the people who want the river cheap labor cheap labor is the answer the other side of it uh you you talk about\nThe people that don't want to give the money the people who are behind these policies are damn well making sure that you and others are going to give your money they're not going to be giving theirs but the\nAnswer the answer to the question is because the left\nBut give your money they're not going to be giving there but\nThe answer the answer to the question is because the left wants power and power to them is more and more people in capable of self reliance\nMore and more people in capable of helping themselves\nAnd the best most concentrated group of people that fit that bill are a bunch of poor ill educated or uneducated people don't even speak the language flooding the southern border you get 'em in their human beings we're a compassionate\nCountry they have to be fed they have to be taken care of the Democrats want the credit for doing all that they want to get these people registered to vote as quickly as they can\nThey looking at um purely and simply as voters it's not about compassion and it's not about giving them a good life it's not about any of the things that they want you to think it is it strictly about creating let me put it this way rarely the Democratic party\nAnd do not doubt me on this I knew when you do to research or journalism career you will find that this is the case the Democratic party needs a permanent underclass\nOf uneducated or poorly educated people who are not capable of economic sulfur live because they can't speak the language because they don't have any education those are prime democratic voters those\nAre the exact kinds of people the Democrats want to build a majority around because they won't be for ever grateful I eat dependence on Democrats and will constantly be voting for Democrats no matter\nWhat else happens that's that's the reason behind it nobody will ever own up to it nobody will ever admit it\nBut what they are really is just on a documented Democrats it's not that they're undocumented citizens or aliens undocumented Democrats that's their status right now and the objective is to get them documented to get them registered and to take care of them\nGive them health care make their track here make their trip you're worth it\nBy giving them exactly what they're coming for now some of them are going to be able to take care of themselves some are going to get here and they're going to run rings around people some in any group of people that large are going to have a wide disparity in some of them are going to be quite confident\nBut ... those are going to be the self starters and those are not that people Democrats are interested in I just really hideous I get that gets it gets really hideous thing of Democrats what people\nNeed people who are\nIncapable of self reliance and that's not helping those people at all that is not compassionate Democrats want you to think that's all they are and they are none of it it's the exact out there using these people and hoping that they never amount to much\nThey don't have much faith in them any way but they are great voters great dependent voters in their eyes so that's what this is about look I'm I'm Glad you called rally or exceptionally well spoken your home schooling is working and you're I I Hope that you hope you do get a journalism journalism these people that are interested in the truth\nI also want to thank you
