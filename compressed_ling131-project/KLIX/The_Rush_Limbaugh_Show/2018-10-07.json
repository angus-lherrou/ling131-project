TV phone added to your price guarantee over Seventy nine Ninety nine per month on line with a two year agreement\nOr the kingdom pol or whatever it is and in that\nUh agreement uh you're allowing the church to discipline you in the way they see fit and that is okay I wouldn't always agree there are many\nAh groups in churches that X communicator kick people out for reasons I think are asinine but that they go into it knowing that that's the and I see this in Catholicism a lot a lot of people say I'm a Catholic but I don't believe X Y and Z and it's like well that's not really fair\nBecause that's what the whole system is if you just don't want to drop the named sauces him 'cause you're attached to it\nThen you know say I'm a social Catholic or something\nA huge amount of fire otherwise it's not fair to the church\nThey are trying to keep a belief system alive and\nThey're the ones that are allowed to make the rules and you can either be a part of it or not be a part of it um but when you kind of try and be a part of it and then go buy your own rules of the church organization has the right to say by we don't we don't want you are involved with us\nGreg welcome to the Jesus Christ show\nFirst of all thank you very much for taking my call I appreciate it oh my pleasure how can I help\nYou if I have a question and I got a second part of that question first of all I Would like to know who the holy ghost is and is it true that the holy ghost is the body Jesus is the heart and the brain is God\nNo a that is a\nHad best that is something called a an economic trinity that's when somebody tries to make an analogy or for people to understand the trinity in a way that is in the physical realm or things like that and what happens is it breaks\nBut for people to understand the trinity in a way that is in the physical realm or things like that and what happens is it breaks down because that that that's not the case now it may help people understand well ah\nYou know this is kind of the positioning and how they work but the reality is they're they're all equal now\nYour heart your body and your mind are all equal in the sense that you can't live with one or or the other they all have to be tied to one another so there are parts of that analogy that that might run or have some legs to em but ultimately when you start breaking it down and it doesn't make sense because the\nUm because of the positions being different doesn't mean that the substance is different so the Holy Spirit is the third person in the trinity and the Holy Spirit has very specific\nA duty is if you will and\nResponsibilities and focus but as far as being equal with the father and the sun\nScripture says absolutely Matthew twenty Nineteen second Corinthians Thirteen fourteen the Holy Spirit is equal with the father and the sun the Holy Spirit was there at creation the Holy Spirit was there at every major event it's not like oh well the Holy Spirit we don't really need him right now but the\n... the position the focus of the Holy Spirit or\nIs it specific just like\nI'm the son and just like the father have specific things\nThings that are done so it's always spirit a gave Christians gifts or whether it's prophecy healing miracles\n'em I said when I departed the Holy Spirit is going to come and dwell on it in a ripple lever Holy Spirit referred to as the comforter or the helper and so the way some people describe it the logically to kind of wrap your mind around it is\nThe Holy Spirit brings you to me I bring you to the father so there's that uh\nThat process that moves you forward and in position that essentially the Holy Spirit is that\nExperience she'll side to your face here on earth\nBut it's God one hundred percent and even in that concept saying it's it's a he would be to have the same way you would refer to me as a he or to the father is a he not because of gender but because of the uh\nTerms that are used in scripture so it is a person to person in the Holy Spirit and\nPeople get confused because father son you can persona fi but Holy Spirit seems ambiguous and kind of cereal and floating and all of those things but the Holy Spirit is a person that you're a person\nOf the trinity the third person of the trinity not the body\nOr was there were explaining that way [noise] to me I I think I might just adding\n[noise] it's it's a weird that the trinity is complicated in some ways because it's not something\nIt's not something that that you can put in a box the same way and although there are things you can look at on earth that point to the concept of a trinity or one thing in three nature's there's something called the triple point of water\nWhere I'm at one point in one moment water is solid liquid and in gas form\nConcept of time time is one thing it's time\nUh in three yesterday today and tomorrow or past present and future you can't separate them\nOr you can use a clock to try and do that or you can use the sun rises and goes down for really you're not separating time\nBecause it's different other people and you could change your clock you put more hours on it if you want to do or you could do whatever you want doesn't change time time is what it is it simultaneously three and simultaneously one\nBut it doesn't mean that it's easy and for some reason though it's one of the attributes of God that everybody gets stuck on\nYet there are all kinds of attributes of God nobody understands like ... or ... or any beyond the attributes being everywhere at once knowing everything you can't comprehend that either\nBut it is what it is\nAnd that's what separates God and then the case of the holy trinity there is something special in the Christian belief system because you're dealing with one God in three persons in this case the Holy Spirit ...\nRole in in the entire dance is to will\nAnd to comfort\nAnd to bring you into the understanding of the sun which is the bridge between the sin of mankind to bring them back to the father\nBut because the father and the sun are such human\nAnalogs you look back and you okay that makes sense it's people put those into categories very simply and then when you get the Holy Spirit people uh it over complicated because what's the Holy Spirit I Know where the father is and what a son as but technically the father's not a father\nThe way you think of father is in the sun is not is on the way you think of San ... except\nIn the physical sense to marry\nSo I Know it gets a complicated and weird and but it's not really something you'll ever truly understand\nUm but it's not something that should be putting a box like that well it's the body and and the heart is the sun and the mind has got that sort of just pointing at the positions and things are on there to do list I suppose that we have to do every single day\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn\nTo be a part of Russia or seven seven\n\n... when I reported air hog okay

that it just turns me away and so I'm just confused I don't I don't know I Want this on this bird in the hole in my heart to stop I Want I don't want it to be there I Want to want to be okay\nAnd I'm looking for it but no one's ever really have the answers and I'm doing my own so\nWell what are your questions\nHow to live for the how do I believe that like throughout the wait for AmeriCorps to ask you just keep studying the raft you just fake it till I make it I don't know\nYou have it every day every day you experienced things you use face every day\nAnd let me explain this is what a lot of people in the church won't tell you\nThey want you to believe that faces this thing where you just jump off every moment that you don't ask questions that you don't wait for answers you just do it and that's what's safe it is and that's not face is that portion that you can't know no matter what you do you can't know it\nAnd that exists in life so Ninety percent you know and you should know and you should learn and study ask questions but there's going to be a percentage Gary there's gonna be a part that you can't know for instance\nYou look at a chair and you trust your eyes and you say my eyes say that's a chair my eyes see that that's a ... would share my belief is my understanding and my experience is that what is strong that when it's put together in this way does a carpenter probably used would glue\nAnd nails or screws to combine them together\nTo make that chair\nAnd that that chair is probably at a regulated construction in such a way that it will withstand me sitting on it\nBut the minute you sit on at the moment Gary you put the entire weight of who you are on that chair that faith so with God it's no different\nYou do everything you can to study to learn to to find out things but there's a point where you can't no you don't know if that cheers going to hold you up to sit in it and there's nothing in life no one can hand it to you\nKnow one could point you do a scripture and go this is the one that's going to make all clear this is the one that you're gonna Christians act that way sometimes they're eager anyway this is what's going to do it or oh you got to do is it's not\nAbout that is scripture says test all things hold fast to that\nBut you will never know you will look both ways when you get to the side of the street before you cross it and the little sign will say green and you'll trust everything but you never know\nThere are people that have been hit by planes that fell out of the sky when they're crossing the street you've been taught to look both ways no one says look up\nTo the minute you step into the street it's with faith you don't know all the options you'll never know all the variables you'll never know all the options but you are to study and to learn as much as you can\nAnd then there's a point where you have to have faith you have to walk into the street or you'll never go anywhere you have to sit in the in the chair or you'll never have rest\nAnd you just have to do it\nYou're not standing around everywhere 'cause well I don't know I mean it looks like would it looks like a chair I I'm trusting that it was made by a manufacturer to proper specifications are going to hold me up or well the sign says green but I don't know if they're not working properly and what if the light is really read\nThe sciences green so I'm going to walk across the street or\nThis stop sign was put here but I don't know if the person driving can't read or doesn't understand the science if you start doing that you will never do anything you'll never move to point one\nThat's not how you live in ... in your everyday life but for some reason you giving yourself permission when it comes to God that you can throw every other thing out the window that you do on a daily basis and make it different for God\nAnd I'm saying sit in the chair\nStep out into the street [noise] trust the science look both ways get all your information as much as you can but in order\nTo actually apply something there's a point of trust and appoint a face and if you look around\nThere is nothing in this world Gary nothing that doesn't have to point out side do explain its existence\nYou have to point your parents who pointed their parents went to their parents the acorn points to the tree that points to the acorn that chair that we talked about made outta would have to point to the tree and the carpenter and all of these things and I'm saying if everything in the universe\nIs contingent has to point out side itself to explain its existence than the universe itself is contingent and has to point out science itself to explain its existence there is a lot of reason for the existence of God there's a lot of reason\nAnd intellectual understanding for the existence of a creator there's nothing in science that ever says something comes from nothing science says the cause is always greater than the effect of the effective\nSuch is something in the cars can't be nothing there's plenty I could do this all day Gary but it means nothing if you're not willing to apply it to your life\n[noise] [noise] I understand do you yeah\nSo what do you do next\nContinue studying against that take take take that at first I guess I'm going to build on it\nIndeed you have to have a foundation your foundation has to be dirty just like anything else did your parents ever have faith\nTalk much about that I mean there are good parents like that pathway lobster here but I mean we didn't really go to church or anything like that\nNo grandparents or anything where people\nAre now they no one ever talked about that kind of my friends talk more about it but it's not they're not like Christian they're they're very much for them and I guess\nAs spirituality spirituality doesn't get you much on its own because it doesn't it's like a\nThe concept of free love rather than a relationship it doesn't it doesn't land anywhere there's no accountability and I think you need accountability and\nIt it you need that structure so this is something you're going to have to build from scratch no one\nIs pointed you in a direction and I'm saying that if you get into scripture\nAnd you find yourself a good Bible teaching Bible believing church that is palatable to you the way they worship and all of those things um give them a little bit of your trust to learn\nAnd then if any red flags go up or you have any concerns you called me back okay\nShall get and then we'll talk again\n\nCheese cheese\nKnees men\nYou\nWe don't
