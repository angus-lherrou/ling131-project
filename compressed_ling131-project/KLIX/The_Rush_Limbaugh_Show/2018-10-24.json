me joined the chorus of everybody from from the turtle Mitch McConnell Paul Ryan to virtually everybody we here at the E R B network condemn sending anybody a bomb you know when I first became aware of this I was when I went to Sacramento\nThere's some people now that think the Republicans might end up uh fifty seven fifty eight seats in the Senate it's all a toss up I mean nobody really knows right now but the point is the conventional wisdom is not settled on what the Democrats always thought it would have been telling us that would be I met his Republican\nMassive landslide defeat that doesn't look to be in the car so if you're a Democrat operative\n[noise]\nAnd the mob tactics haven't worked and in fact if you're a reasonable Democrat operating and you're looking at this objectively you might make including this mob action couldn't be hurting it could be really firing up Republican turnout as\nIn the post Kavanaugh period there is a cabinet affected it's going one way pro Republican documented or what if these mobs pointed at Republicans minding their own business in restaurants and in the airports whatever these mobs attacking\nPeople aren't doing anything to anybody and sending supposedly rice and\nTwo Republican senators who was in college you're a Republican or a rat or a democratic operative you might start to conclude this is going the exact opposite way we intended ah\nThese mobs or not inspiring even more hatred of Trump these moms are not causing even more hatred of Republicans in fact as looking like it's\nCreating more support for Republican so that would be the best way if you are a democratic operative and your panicking right now 'cause this is it if you don't if you don't get the house now you got two more years of Trump\nAnd expanded Republican Senate Republicans keep the house Trump's breezes to re election in twenty ... this is it just like we think it's it for us\nBut they have thrown everything they have it getting Trump they've thrown have they've had the FBI but I've had that deep state sign it cool and they have thrown every trick media at a lights doing they're tough lifting for them and none of it's none of it none of it has worked\nSo what would you do democratic operative best way to turn all of that around\nHow about a day like this\nAbout a day like this where you create a scenario where it looks like a moms are on both sides it looks like the Republicans have a mob Jew or at least in a ... some Republican out there sending bombs to the Senate good [noise]\nFormer Democratic presidents and and a

going to be from people who are actively engaged in and these events each and every day and informed about them\nAnd the reaction gives me a gives me great solace and comfort because your reaction is pure commonsense if somebody really wanted to hurt somebody with a bomb there's ways to do it this is not how you doing this or that these bombs having gone off these are pipe bombs some of them are large some of them are small we don't yet know what was in the ... with shrapnel what was it tax\nWas it nails was at a bookshop where\nWe don't we don't know any of this yet none of these bombs would

struck thing and the Democrats um anyway we have a lot of like and they it's let's see what else they put out there next\nWell exactly exactly this is why I was telling people back in June and July to polls here really don't matter a hill of beans I think however the polls now\nDo not so much in accurately without any doubt predicting a winner but the polls today can be highly influential and decisions and action\nTaken by political people now I just I I Love Tonya thank you very much for ah for calling\nI'm a and again for mentioning Bob foreign it really is one of the finest guys anybody could ever made [noise] ah I look at the psychology of people and I'm not a trained psychologist\nBut I Am fairly\nExperienced here at analyzing predicting understanding the left\nAnd I know their mind set on many things one of their mindset on power is but it's there's that that they are entitled to it and whatever it is denied them by way of elections they really really resented and they resent the people who made it happen which are the voters\nSo today's American Left as angry as it can be that people have voted for Trump the hatred for Trump is actually directed at hatred for people who elected him and compounding hatred and when those people will not abandon them the left is making every every effort it can\nTo distance Trump voters from Trump they've tried everything they know how to use to damage Trump to force him out of office divorce Kavanaugh out of the nomination and to try to convince Trump voters they made a mistake none of its work\nUse to damage Trump to force him out of office to force Kavanaugh out of the nomination and to try to convince Trump voters they made a mistake none of it's worked the degree of frustration they are feeling is something you and I cannot relate to\nWe can try\nBut the degree of frustration they're feeling at having lost that election and two thousand sixteen when they thought it was a landslide victory and subsequently everything they've had the most powerful influential people in their movement all coordinated working together to destroy Donald Trump\nAnd it's been like ... you know spit balls at a at a at a battleship they haven't Denton Trump and I cannot tell you\nHow frustrated they are easy easy for them to take out Republicans when ever they want they are able to do it and if not take them out damage them tremendously\nBut they haven't been able to even score on Trump salt they began this movement of promoting\nIn the media that there was going to be a blue wave they created this movement based on the fact they and they created as a whole cloth something it did not exist a national\nAttitude of hatred for Donald Trump they simply took their own attitude and they transferred it to a majority of Americans for all intents and purposes then it began reporting the news that way everybody hates Trump\nThat now that they've seen Trump and actually hit him to despise him they regret voting for him they wish they could get their vote back that became a narrative that's been the narrative for two years that narrative is what led them\nTo hyping this blue wave\nThat it was the only commonsense view and a half now that now that people seem trumpet action I've seen is bad manners they've seen whatever is about in the left taste now everybody's seen it now they regret it now they can't wait to get rid of Trump every special election every Democrat was going to win it because why everybody hated trumpet everybody hated themselves were voting for him\n[noise] well it isn't coming to pass\nThe blue way if they said the existed maybe never has\nThe blue wave based on people who hate Trump now they've seen him in action can't wait to vote against them now we're learning much of that was made up much of that with soap operas scripted media narrative\nNow we're getting down to the nitty gritty now or two weeks away from the election and there isn't a blue wave of Republicans look like they're going to gain seats in the Senate even in Democrat Paul's and the blue wave in the house it's looking iffy iffy and now with Republican turnout\nWill feel Democrat turn out in early voting early voting is one of the Democrats get to run their fraud scheme Forbes early voting is really the illegals votes and the dead and vote and all these other things it's purposely set up and the Republicans\nWhy it appears there are more sophisticated than Democrats ever considered the Republicans are not letting the Democrats get away with what they usually get away with\nThe Republicans are showing up in droves they're out performing at political rallies Trump won twenty thousand people Fifteen thousand people another twenty five thousand people outside block Obama can't even draw one thousand Joe Biden Hillary Clinton can't draw flies there is ab\nJet panic\nSetting and now you've got this caravan coming up and the Democrats have missed playing this caravan even the

this down for the last six months to the last six months there was going to be a blue wave there was no doubt about it it was going to sweep the Democrats do massive control of the house representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump\nAnd that's been the the soap opera script for at least nine months\nAnd then the things that are supposed to supplement it like the Kavanaugh

this mob of people storming the American border there's no reasonable Americans wants to just open the floodgates unless those people and for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not where the American people are right now\nThe only commonsense nickel thing to do is to oppose this but because Trump opposes that the Democrats instinctively have to say they're in favor of it they are that
