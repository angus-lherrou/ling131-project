telling us since the campaign since Trump came down the escalator three years ago\nJune of two thousand Fifteen the media has been telling us and noted experts in the Washington establishment have been telling us and its Trump's going to self destruct\nSomething's gonna happen and drums going to blow up and everybody's going to see who the real Trump is and everybody's going to be shocked and surprised and sad mood and then everybody's going to want Trump's wiped away\nBut it never happens\nIt never happens instead [laughter] we keep watching his his critics self destruct Trump's opponents melt down now practically every day over the fact that Trump isn't melting down\nThey melt down over the fact that they can't make Trump melt down\n\nWages example Pocahontas herself you want to talk about melting down and self destruction you are looking at it\nElizabeth Warren you don't want I think I think there are there are four women here that attempted essentially an October surprise against Donald Trump and they've all bummed out where to Hillary Dianne Feinstein focus on us\nAnd who's the other there's there's one other woman they've all mounted things these are in October and all of these I think we're destined to to to destroy Trump and by extension the Republicans\nOf course Dianne Feinstein running the balls the Ford scandal\nAs an October surprise or Hillary Clinton and and and hurt constant a needle and prodding out there she's got something planned and always has had it it always blows up on her face\nAnd now Elizabeth Warren I is\nIs melting down over this

votes came from California the second thing is that we had a story yesterday that there are three and a half\nMillion registered voters above the number of bodies in America about orders are three and a half million more registered voters then there are voters\nWhich means there's all kinds of fraud potential fraud taking but but but even if those two things throw them out it doesn't\nIt doesn't cancel a fact of the Democrats have been losing elections left and right now we have they couldn't stop cabinet every October surprise that they tried to mount has blown up in their face and Elizabeth

back on the upswing now kind of since the cabinet nomination a\n... it's it's kind of not like it's kind of just the Kavanaugh fight has energized Republicans far more than Democrats\nAnd all these

we're supposed to believe that Donald Trump alone\nHas provided the energy and the imposition of ... wake and the Democrats the comeback show up and\nRe take everything they lost well the problem with that is the Democrats lost because Republicans won the Republican voters showed up in droves in every one of those men terms and the presidential race two thousand twelve in two thousand twelve presidential race Democrats continue to lose seats even though\nObama won his reelection nobody else the Democrat Party\nDidn't much was bragging about\nSome of the Republicans came alive first it was the Tea Party Obamacare and all of the spending the\nEnergized but then it was Lois Lerner the IRS at all the other scandals that came along when guys they there was nothing that Obama was doing the

backdoor way\nTo do damage to the second amendment people want to know part of what Obama was doing every chance they had to vote against it\nThey did\nExcept they didn't have the guts to vote against them because of the racial component thousand twelve so now we're supposed to believe\nThat that trend\nSees the Democrats holding the fewest number of uh like\nThat was on twelfth and now we're supposed to believe that that trend that sees the Democrats\nHolding the fewest number of electoral seats they've ever had since two thousand in the Nineteen twenties has suddenly overwhelmingly changed simply because there's so much hatred for Donald Trump\nAnd its hatred for who Trump is hatred for his tweets it's hatred for his personality it's hatred for his manners or lack there of its hatred for the white ... aims its hatred for its hairstyle it's hatred because it'd be mean spirited and what that\nAnd that alone is what the media and Nate Silver telling us all gr this massive Democrat blue wave\nThere is no trend that suggests Democrat blue wave plus\nTrump is uniting the Republican Party has one more Nate Silver bite here from the same pod cast continued now listen\nWe're in this weird zone we're number one I remember we ever had a split in the forecast like this is pretty unusual to predict the likelihood of a split is unusual were also I always says what are in the eighty twenty zone and we're now in the eighty twenty zone in both places that makes me nervous and remember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate but\nDon't win the house which means like\nThere's a forty percent chance that one of those two productions will be wrong so you know not quite fifty fifty but we call something a toss up it's forty percent or greater almost a toss up that you'll have one of these forecasts\nGoing like this for you let me translate this\nThis guy is nervous as he told me he's sweating bullets there's a fifty fifty chance that he's wrong\nHe's ... he's never seen a split like this he's talking about Democrats winning the house Republicans winning the Senate he is never seen anything like that he that I don't know how to do this\nAnd we consider it a toss up it's forty percent one way or the other but I guess he's tell I guess he hasn't this latest idea what's going to happen in this election and he's very nervous over the fact that he can't figure out he can analyze he doesn't have the slightest idea what's\nGoing to happen here now he didn't want to come out and say it that way\nYou need to have the ... the expertise to experience that I have to translate these clowns when they start throwing their numbers around and their percentages and stuff but let me just very quickly well\nYou know when this weird zone where I don't remember

likelihood of a split as unusual we um you know I always say uh wouldn't want any aid each one of his own and we're now in the eighty twenties on in both places that makes me nervous\nMeaning eighty twenty Republicans keep the Senate eighty twenty Democrats when the house and makes it a nervous eighty twenty that's as close to a lot of it makes me nervous\nAnd we're now in the eighty twenties on on both sides of this remember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate really\nThere's no chance of Democrats win the Senate but don't win the house which means it like there is a forty percent chance that one of those two British ... going to be wrong [laughter]\nWell there is a pretty good indication that Democrats are not going to win the Senate and he's saying its impact we don't
