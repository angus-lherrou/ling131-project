time caller actually\nThank you I like to have you back with us and sorry it's great to have you back with us here oh\nThank you very much um what is it my husband and I were talking last night and we came up with some really good common sense points to make that kind of illustrate why we think these packages weren't actually nails\nI'm it he's their comments just questions in the first one to me is how likely is it the male multiple packages to multiple places all over the country\nAnd have them show up miraculously at the same time and if I really don't want to say they across we've exact same time that that's not that's not common sense I mean I just don't see how that could\nWalk there were just sort of the De Niro package didn't arrive until late yesterday or maybe this morning the or George Soros package arrived the day before truth CNN got their little Clinton's support\nI there was a ... throw the whole group of us in the dead like four or five of them shows up all of that I thought well how do you know it was a priority mail\nIt couldn't have been I mean if you looked at the packages easy way obviously your first caller is you know what I was going to one of the Congress cells can make the fact that there wasn't enough postage on at the U.S post office he even accept it um the other thing is these these were these were oversized packages\nThat you're obviously not taking them and and paying for them you know have enough weight and paid in ...\nI'm your you'd have to stick the post office box Wright houses boxes don't even have enough ... wind whipping oversized package into\nThat doesn't make any sense to me and and I know some of the show that the distribution centers that makes sense I I I get I get that but some of them actually did show up at the residents so you're going to think that\nOkay well what are you suggesting that what are you suggesting here but\nI think I'll probably get I'm Sorry that I just do I mean you know workers are trained to look for the well this is a stupid looking packages cheesy it's a joke I mean it looks like a joke even if I can see that there's something in there and if you look at their address too don't you think that after going through it\nA it was almost the exact opposite it was almost so basic\nThat everybody was scratching their heads and wondering what was so remarkable about it a Steve I appreciate ... as I say I'll take it out but I have a chance to Jerry in Springfield, Massachusetts starting next hello sir\nHi Raj REO I'm good\nGood good I just wanted to duck tale on your point about America giving more than any other nation I think what you were talking about was the government itself but also give more than any other nation and the point is is that\nI have the choice when I get to charity I give it to I don't have the right how my neighbor who they should give it to and that's actually what the government do it they're telling on\nWho they are going to\nBasically what they got from our tax dollars they don't give up the choice and that's my point\nA good point too it's a classic illustration his reacting to the soundbites we play the John Case there was a ringing his hands and guilt over the facts of caravans coming and it's just for the grace of God that we're not in it\nAnd that because we're not in it but could be an except by the grace of God we've got to stop building walls 'cause God doesn't want that\nAnd we've got to realize that that were just plain lucky it's kinda like Clinton Richard got part the winners of lights lottery you know we were just minding our own business one day and we got conceived in a room mate in America\nAnd we got into America and and man that's that's so much luck that that we shouldn't feel weren't anything special or so the fact that we weren't\n... means that we all we really do and we gotta we gotta learn to walk in the shoes of others and that's the wrong way to look at it with nobody has any trouble imagining what it's like to be poor that's why so many people striving not to be governor it isn't hard to imagine\nWe don't have a lot of people in fact\nUh most people in this country go up and down in terms of annual income or people that are in a lot of money and lose at all there are people that are in an average amount of money all their lives and that's it but basically people in this country no poverty\nIf they've never if they have never been in it they certainly don't want to be they know enough to know not to be and that's the great thing about America if you don't want to be there are ways to avoid being in poverty poverty in this country by the way it was a relative thing\nCompared to poverty around the world United States poverty is not really poverty I get in trouble every time I point that out but it happens to be true a statistic lay financially however you want to look at it but but the the way to look at these disparities is not to simply say oh\nOh that could be me and then the run around and feeling guilty about it\nUh\nThe way to deal with this is not to run around constantly imagining well you know it was one accident and I could have been in that care of and and then having that\nImpact the way you deal with it that doesn't help anybody it's not a ... but it does make you look like you have lots of compassion and lots of care but that's a great thing about liberalism never solves anything\n[noise] liberalism as a\nGutless choice because you never have to solve anything all you have to do is talk about how much you care and all you have to do is tell people how much pain you're seeing\nAnd how ... comfortable it's too soon fear look at the suffering and the starvation its citizens and you are automatically credited as a person with great compassion you haven't solved anything\nAll you've done to say that you recognize and they're telling everybody else they've got to do something about it and that's liberalism solutions\nAre wherever the answer is and solutions to these problems are exactly why they have been happening in the United states the past two years\nSolutions\nBy the way before we go to the break I just want to remind
