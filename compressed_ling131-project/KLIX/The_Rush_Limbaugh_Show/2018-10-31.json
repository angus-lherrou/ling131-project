you would not\nBelieve it I mean I I I'm dealing with people who are just so anti immigration wouldn't run this was\nThis was folks this was all and back in Nineteen Ninety it wasn't just strictly southern border immigration and he said you know I remember those debates all the way back in the early Nineteen hundreds back in the days of Ellis Island you immigration has been\nA\nPolarizing subject to this country for as long as we have been doing it and he started telling me stories of the\nUh efforts to image shown new arrivals from western in Eastern Europe and he was\nTelling me that there were so many people didn't want any of those people from Eastern Europe Western Europe average people as\nHis point was the arguments haven't changed the issue has been something that is Constance but the one thing that has changed he was talking about even back in Nineteen Ninety when we were talking about he was talking about legal\nImmigration he was saying back in the early Nineteen hundreds late Eighteen hundred the controversy of them was about legal immigration and even with legal immigration ever people opposed to opening up Ellis Island in preventing masses\nOf humanity to come in and for reasons similar to intercept the day\nThe differentiating things today is that the legal immigration is seldom even discussed and we have both political parties in predominantly one of them now\nAdvocating from Austin is advocating for illegal immigration and then using opponents of illegal immigration as examples of racism and bigotry\nSo forth so while the issue has always been around and it's always been a controversial thing\nImmigration and how we manage it\nThe idea that illegal aliens should be automatically\nGranted citizenship or amnesty upon their arrival that is what's new to this debate and that\nIs what the uh the Democrats in the American left today are are advocating and they're doing so on the premise that America is responsible for the economic plight of these people that we\nA superpower have taken an unfair portion of the world's resources we've gone around the world and taking what we want and we have not compensated people privately we've tried to impose our way of life and so\nZero sum game if the American people are wealthy than somebody asked report\nOut there and so therefore the American people are guilty of something\nThat was an unequal distribution of wealth the laps as in all of these countries in Central America South America so poor compared to us\nAnd it's not a coincidence got to be our fault something else so it's only fair that these people are fleeing a rotten economy isn't were torn strife that the United states allow them in as a means of apology\nAnd it becomes a definition of compassion and the real purpose behind it\nIs to transform America and to\nKind of nation it was never intended are found a debate and that's the difference is legal and illegal immigration to the subject has been around that's been controversial for as long as it has been happening but the idea that illegal loggers have legal claim on whatever they want in this country that's\nThat is what's
