suffered many things from many physicians she had spent all that she had and was no better but rather grew or so we get this right I don't I'm not going to go into the background of this but but whenever a lady had her when it says flow blood that it would be something akin to her period right\nAnd and any any Jewish lady that had that could not go outside could not leave the home I couldn't go into public right to do so would be breaking the law and so here this lady's can you imagine for twelve years so it's obviously something more than just\nA period right okay so here she is\nSo it's obviously something more than just a period right okay so here she is she she's she's\nOutside wrong decent I Wonder what was going to her brain put yourself in her brain probably to the point of tried everything else right\nSo she suffered many things for many physicians in other words here try this listen uh when people today in America usually you find it I find it in terms of talking with people when they get cancer everybody and their dog has the cure\nEverybody everybody has a cure well if you just only do this\nIt'll work if you know there's no don't do that in and right so so\nBless their hearts everybody that wants to help one hell but the the recipient that person suffered\nMany things for many people are are you you know what I mean I mean they they have to sit and and usually they're friends right so they can't turn them away and say would you just shut up I'm tired of listening to every cure known to man would just be quiet right instead they feel obligated that they have to listen\nAnd some of the things you know that whatever it may be from from sort of a natural approach to whatever approach\nAll of it involves what they're going to spend a ton of money getting set up\nTo do it the way you're really supposed to do it right and if you missed any point it won't work\n\nAre you with me it's probably one of the closest things I can think of today that this lady so when it says she suffered many things for many physicians is probably just had a tougher to a ton of different\nRemedies that were the cure if you'll just do this you'll be fixed you'll be cured right\nCost her all over all of our money she spent everything that she had so the ladies at a spot she's just simply desperate right she's out of spot that just says there's no other place to turn there's no other place to turn and they've you know sometimes that's the best place we can be\nA usa\nIn fact I think one of the things that may be hinders us in America I thank God for all the medical ... and I've watched a\nCouple of shows on some medical stuff that just blows my mind when we listen to these things that you know we're not certainly doctors or anything like that but I've been around the world a whole lot and those words that we hear that we look at one another and will sit there during the show and\nPut on our phone and goes what does so some such mean [noise] you know and we're like\nWow but all of that's godly that wisdom came from ... know wisdom that man has came from their own\n\nI mean so where does medicine fit inhaling don't ever look at it either or\nTo me that's the silliest way to look at it I just look at it and go you know God loves people so much he'll use whatever remains are you with me so so thank God for all the stuff that's out there but it all going to cost money right and it's all going to be at the end of the day you know human human wise\nAt the end of the day it's still\nA guess\nFiddle work to practice you know the license to the doctor has on the do they have a license to\nSo I don't mean that in a bad way but it's just all it just means as we're finite means in every human being that a doctor touches and deals with is is unique and how we need the lord only\nIn the middle of it so she spent all she had\nThat a doctor touches and deals with is is unique and how we need the lord don't like\nIn the middle of it so she spent all she had and was no better but rather good we're so she for twelve years you can only imagine at the end of twelve years were you when you find yourself in the spotlight this that she found herself it's like there's nowhere else to turn\n... what I was going to if any saying is that here in America we have such great technology available that sometimes I think\nIt's easy for us to say

welcome to the Jesus Christ show hello how are you um [noise] I have a question for you and I have\nTo wonder how hot and this is the first time and fifty years we started going to church and at the leg while we get the kids for a low [noise] anyhow I had that problem in their heart\nThe ability and your family you know we had just something grandchildren\nI found that [noise] so and that's never happened in his extended family on his side [noise] I don't I don't understand except you have very large heart\nIndeed I I I think that as a\nThat is normal to believe that and wrestle with that that part of life and go well where are you God now or where\nAre you with the children and and to try and kind of you know put that in a place that's comfortable even with your face is difficult so first and foremost I think it's completely normal and a healthy place to come from\nUm however there's a lot more to it than just will help them bad things happen and how bad things happen to children the reason why people tend to go to children is the assumption that children are innocent because they're so young\nTechnically in the scheme of things not the case um a lot of people don't think about this but you know if if a child have the strength\nIf you didn't bring it it's food it would crush your head\nUm the child doesn't have that strike so a wrestling with whether children are are innocent by biblical standards or not is a is not necessarily worthy of this discussion but is an academic one nonetheless I Will say that uh uh\nThat this question deserves a little more focus so if you if you have a moment I'm going to ask you a genie that hang tight as we take a really quick break and I want explained a little bit of a the dynamics of what goes on because everyone comes and says hey\nHow come you don't do it this way God or ... wouldn't this weight work wind up being much better and we'll look at those options and I'll show you why they aren't better at all\n\n\n\nAnd I just don't really mind\n\nLandmine man\nJesus Christ will return to normal to be hard on the show\nNow\n\nOptics move crazy amounts of data at even crazier speeds and fighters by rising it's the one

nine Ninety nine per month with a two year agreement\nPlus get two hundred dollars toward a range of Google and that's smart um devices and a one hundred dollar visa prepaid card when you order on line\nThe consequences of anything that people did wrong and you have to allow consequences in life 'cause that that helps build character\nIt's like um if you think about all the wonderful things in life that you know ability courage all these things\nDo you need those don't exist without adversity do they uh you know a fireman or a firefighter cannot be a hero without a fire\nOr some sort of adversity same with a law enforcement or anything like that\nSo the balance of adversity\nAnd faith in strength and ability and all these things love versus a indifference or even hate that these things only exist in this world in this way because this is not the best world Jeannie well it's the best way to the best world which is heaven\nAnd the reason why I say to the best ways because you have to go through this process\nOr to understand\nAnd therefore once you're in heaven there won't be that there won't be any a disability in heaven there won't be in tears in heaven there won't be any of that\nBut here there has to be those things as long as people a mess with the genetic line by doing what they want when they want\nA and a once again I Want to clarify this because some people try and push this on to the parents and if you remember in scripture\nI'm as someone came to me and said uh you know this man's blind why is he blind is it something is it a sin he did or send that his parents did\nAnd I said ... and neither had nothing to do with that um but the line the genetic wind does have impurities in it that people are placed there that were never supposed to be there in the garden it's not the way it was designed\nAnd so these things take place and I know that that it affects people and affects people like your husband [noise] um but he has to see that in in order to eradicate all of that I'd have to eradicate everyone's free will and in doing that then what do you have\nThen you have an entire planet um that is disabled or spiritually and more morally because you\nIt's different like I I'd have to program you\nAnd it's it's like saying you know that you can keep your child safe if you walk in closet to but then what does it become\nSo I'm not going to lock you own closets and make all the decisions for you when I'm going to do is I'm going to stand over here and I'm going to show you every single day by knocking on the door of your heart that I Love you and then I Want to come in and if you allow me to come in\nAnd you you seek my will end you read my scriptures and spend time with my people and and pray to my father and these types of things then you will start to learn that the system's okay\nBut meanwhile you know I'm sure your husband's speeds on occasion or does things that are against the law even little little breaking little rules here and there because he thinks it's okay but that that can affect people you know can that throws off the system too and and that's in a small way but in a large way\nThere are people that the effect it differently and they you know will cause other things because of greed or because they think they're more important or they feel they're entitled or whatever it is and all that plays a part in there somewhere I Know you know uh I I Would hope that maybe maybe your husband might get the opportunity to call some time so we could uh\nYou know that this out together but I'm\nReally the option on the flip side is much worse than people think it is\nThat what you have to take away is so great that I don't think people really I'm really understand what's taking place Charles walk into the Jesus Christ show\nAnd she is Charles uh I have a cousin who um confirmed atheist mhm and uh you gotta love that yeah for an atheist unfortunately she's are suffering for state for bladder cancer Mm and uh you know we're we're discussing um\nTheology religion added um [noise] first question was ah you know just kind of threw me off but it's like um caught ah\nI mean how people saved if they've never heard of Jesus Christ like a an average ... back in ah fifteenth century okay Borneo and um [noise] you know I tried to explain or about a\nGeneral revelation excellent actual revelation romance I don't think I did too good a job okay\nWell yeah but you are right you are right on the money with that and in Romans one a\nIs an excellent place to start but I Will tell you this um uh\nOn this program we focus on truth as you know and we focus on a answering questions because that's an important part of of understanding and having faced a is is knowing what you can now the interesting thing is that no that the quality of the question then what's being asked is important as well\nBecause you know like a a child when you go to correct a child you say you know a a little Johnny you've got to stop doing this and he says but to me was doing it\nAnd that diversionary tactic to get you to focus on to me and you're going to wait I'm Talking to you I'm here you're dealing with somebody talking to them about God and they're saying what about people that don't know about God and they're not one of those you see the only person that can ask that question has heard of me\nYou can't ask the question unless you already know about God\nSo it's like pushing it off on someone else was there should be accountable for themselves you see what I'm saying that they're going oh but you know you're going you need to know God they said well what about the people that don't\nAnd it's it's it's an academic way of pushing off what they should be realizing themselves so that's the first part I Want you to understand\nAnd it's it's it's an academic way of pushing off what they should be realizing themselves so that's the first part I Want you to understand because it's kind of diversionary nature um but secondly\nI'm God says that no one it's not about ignorance this game is not about ignorance it's about acceptance or rejection so God's not playing with people's lives and like their dice and saying okay well you know this person's going to get a better better opportunity that person know scripture says that no one\nUh gets better or worse opportunity as a matter of fact it says the second coming won't happen until everybody has heard the gospel everybody has the fare option\nTo receive order reject now Romans one is you as you started out with was a perfect perfect place to go because it talks about the difference of general versus specific or special revelation the differences is that it said in in Romans one that there are those that can just come out\nOf their mud hut you know knowing nothing and see the glory and know the authority of God just like you can learn something from a a painting\nYou learn something about the artist or what have you people get caught in the in the confidence in the bowels of the name of Jesus and they think okay what's the power in the name no power is not in the confidence in the bowels the powers in the authority\nJust like the old movies where they said stop in the name of the law it wasn't the L. A. W. had power it's that the power and authority given by that jurisdiction a in a in the a justice of\nThe United states gave them power and authority so that could be seen outside of the courts now she\nNeeds to understand that even a an aborigines and a Fifteen hundred could come out and see the very nature of God and things that surround them and that's what they used as general revelation to understand God\n\nIt's a shame the blame US military can\nAnd the train mostly stations to\nA honeybee leaves the chances\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there is ...\n... helped me find the best home pros in my area to handle any kind of project you can read reviews the pros check their bail ability to even book appointments on line and when my wife love most is that home advisor is completely free to use\nIt at ... dot com or download the ... to get started\nNothing changes your life more than God or love moving your credit score a hundred and twenty points I'm John Hope Brian founder of operation hope I want you to go to operation hope dot org and take your life back\nGet your dignity back joined the hope seven hundred credit score community program and take your life back go to operation hope dot org today or call us at Ford zero for nine four one to nine one nine today\nTexting roles for alerts and offers me automatic tax message message to reach me applied\nHello America this is Martha Stewart now you can cook ...\nIt's easy to forget about frozen foods and take out instead join me for grade home cooked food introducing Martha emerged O'Neill kid ... fresh ingredients was my wonderful easy to follow recipes and delivered breaks your door\nHurry opera ends October thirty first go to get ... dot com and switched to the one hundred percent fiber optic network\nOne hundred percent phenomenal\nChoosing an energy company raises many questions can make my electricity and natural gas worked smart [noise] working I find the company the business news the market options to fit my [noise] millions of homes and businesses there's one answer\nAnd to me the fishing I\nThat's what makes us Elise America's Choice burned more constantly seem dot com slash\n[noise] news and talk on the radio\nDishes use radio for change halo yeah ... you can [noise]\nHere comes the caravan I'm Steve Rapaport Fox News thousands of migrants resuming their march toward the U.S Mexico border\nThey busted through Honduras they went through about a mile and now they're trying to Capitol Mexico right now they are north of that river\nNorth of the bridge you saw people on yesterday so last night\nPeople got frustrated found a bridge or the Mets\nRight people got frustrated found a bridge Mexico's process about six hundred and forty people get a visa for potentially asylum here could forty five Ninety Days people got for us if they weren't so last night in\nAcross the river swimming people came in droves\nBoxes William ...

earth creationist believe it's ... it's round six but that is based upon\nUm [noise] that is based upon genealogy and scripture that are not even complete so the assumption is well these genealogy would roughly you know roll up to about this time so that's got to be the beginning and errors when it never says that in scripture anywhere and never makes that statement this is the age\nYeah people will come to that conclusion and they'll stand on it and not have any leeway and on this program and we say there's a lot\nOf it is in the essentials unity there's no way bringing the essentials on this program ever so in the central unity in the non essential liberty and all things charity\nSo in the essential who do you say that I Am the trinity the resurrection the virgin birth you don't mess around with these things salvation through grace by face through faith by grace and these things don't mess with them that is what makes a Christian a Christian\nBut the things about like the age of the earth that's not a mandate if he wants to believe that that's fine ...\nBut that's not a mandate that's something to talk about it in house discussion\nSo the scripture really is not an appropriate one to use as a matter of fact Paul is the one writing this Paul was incredibly educated very well educated but even goes on to say if you continue to read um in Corinthians or he goes on to talk about a\n... that he wasn't using that in this context and ... says when I came to your brother and I do not come up with superior already of speech or of wisdom but claiming to you the testimony of God\nFor I determine uh to no nothing among you accept Jesus Christ and him crucified he was putting aside academia\nToo too focused primarily on the gospel but not\nPutting in a way for good it's not that didn't have any purpose because they use that later [noise] but uh he says and I was with you in a weakness and in fear and in much trembling meaning that it's at the base level of understanding and not just at this place where um\nHe's parsing everything but just knowing the simplicity and the beauty of the gospel he goes on to say in my message and my preaching were not per a\nPersuasive or words of wisdom\nBut in demonstration of the spirit of the power that your faith should not rest on wisdom of man\nBut on the power of God so this is an argument about faith there's going to be a place where faith and reason meat absolutely faith on the show we talk about faith being that which comes after reason or when you can't reason anymore\nYou know you look at a uh a chair Jay and you can reason okay in look structurally sound it looks like it's made out of what it looks like it's bolted together it looks like it'll hold my weight\nThat's reasoning but when you sit on it that's faith that everything you just reasoned is true and you are perceiving it properly and that's going to be applied properly\nBut it's faith when he said in that or you test those that reasoning\nThat's how they're married together in what Paul is doing here I'm In its fullness of context is trying to explain that listen if you try and get so weighty and you try and just use wisdom you may get the point right but you miss the flavor of it it's like trying to dissect music or art\nNow there's the law of thirds and that beauty comes from the laws thirds meaning that the the face is a separate it into thirds and when it's balanced in those a\nChurch Sherry points it's more beautiful the body when it's symmetric as more beautiful and you can look at those things but truly a dozen defined beauty and that's what it's saying that you can't define um the beauty of scripture and the gospel and salvation just academically and then if you go down that path\nYou're gonna you're you're going to have the first part of knowledge just a simple knowledge\nIt's just the application of knowledge in proper context and that you missed the point altogether\nAnd that's what's being said I don't go to school or education is bad that's asinine that doesn't help anybody\nThat's not that's not going to help you if you're not going to help anybody 'cause then you don't learn and they had to learn scripture and they had to be written and I had to be written in the language they understood and all of these things that come from academics\n\nMm\nWhy\nAre there are so when ... songs
