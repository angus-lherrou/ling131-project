o'clock or oh you also under reference school buses now we've been back in school for golly six weeks yeah and there's still some issues out there\nYou know I'm sure people probably get tired of hearing me a pound the drum on this one we we seem to have talked about quite a bit but we've written more school bus violation citations this year that I can ever remember writing\nA a couple of those are violations that uh myself or other deputies who witnessed firsthand most of them come in to us from the school bus company\nA by state law when a school bus gets passed a they're required to turn in a school bus violation report for them to their local law enforcement and oftentimes when they fill that out the bus drivers required to\nGive as much information as they can um the most important things the most important identifier would be that license plate and that's all they're required to be able to identify as the license plate and if they can give us a description of the vehicle that certainly matches that leads lens credibility let bus drivers they actually got the right place with the vehicle descriptor\nAnd then it's up to the law enforcement agencies will investigate that to this decipher who's the driver that vehicle was\nIn all of the cases that we've had this year where we've uh enforced this uh we've had great video from the school bus companies at the most of our school buses in our county schools have a stop arm cameras so in the school bus comes to stop and that stop our comes out the cameras recording\nAnd captures all that a video\nThat occurs and we've seen you know children getting ready to cross the street to get on the school bus or the school bus drivers honking their horns and yelling out their side\nThe the whole just continues to pass right through a sometimes at a slower speed but we've seen it forty five fifty miles an hour where the person just simply wasn't paying attention and on one particular video sure looked like that person was on their cell phone that's dangerous and uh the the fine for that as a misdemeanor it's not an infraction\nAnd the minimum amount that a judge can order as a hundred dollars but it's punishable all the way up to three hundred dollars\nAnd a misdemeanor find on your record certainly is not going to help things with your insurance company I Would imagine your insurance rates are probably going to go up quite a bit\nAmericans as why Idaho Falls made that move on individually on cell phones because probably there's been concerns and all around the state about people doing this or if it impacts the safety of children\nOr that really gets people interested and upset one of them passed child safety and you know we've seen some of those issues here and just twin falls just this year ... children have been hurt because people have done I'm not around those stop arms um and there's just stories that go from years back\nWhere where people have asked the school bus and children than entered luckily not killed that some children have been killed his results but not here in twin falls county and that a recent past but in other areas\nYou know I when I was a kid a ... a neighbor friend of mine and he was a year older than I was but he he was actually struck right outside of school and uh he had to spend a couple of months in a hospital and uh\nAnd he just to this day he has a you know when he walks he he he's not in any pain that I Know about the way he walks a right that you would think that he might be a ... he was never the same after\nWork and we're seeing the on not just cars go through or farm trustworthy and semi trucks go through these stop arms can you imagine the\nDevastation that would happen if a child got hit by one of these\nA double or triple trailer semi trucks and so we're we're really out trying to make a difference and try and get people to realize those flashing red lights with the stop our main stop and they'll proceed through with that\nYou know sometimes it can be tricky because a school bus driver before they come to that stop not read those red light start flashing stop arm comes out\nThey're required by law to activate those yellow lights two hundred feet before they come to that stop so there should be plenty of time when you see those yellow lights flashing for you to say wow I should probably you know something's going on here this is not my attention I should start slowing down\nYou know you see in a traffic light a lot of people they see that yellow light that go from green to yellow and they'll hit that gas pedal get through\nTo try and beat that red light or we don't want people don't and that when it comes to a school bus you see those yellow lights come on slow down get to brace trying to figure out where that school buses going to stop it stop accordingly if you stop on a yellow light in the school bus goes past you and they're still flashing yellow and they eventually turn red\nOr then proceed on you've done your due diligence diligence to make sure that you're trying to be a safe as possible when we've got students loading are unloading depending on the time of day\nWhen you mentioned it's a forty eight and a conventional is joining us so much when I was kind of sheriff's department red forty two I magic value this morning on news radio Thirteen ten ... news

probably as early as probably in his mid to late eighties at the time because he had been an author written some books about uh about Columbus in fact I think he'd worked for ... machine but a ...\nDuring the interview remembered him telling me that if my birthday so I guess he was like eighty seven and I\nHeard about a year later that he had passed away from cancer but he had refused or any any painkillers\nBecause he said he was a he was he was going to die and imitation of our lord I don't know if that was pretty courageous of a of the man to do that that's suffering that's obvious

sovereignty of God resigned twenty three forty one on magic valley this morning on news radio Thirteen cents\nLAX and news radio Thirteen tend to Tom I'm running mentioned ... percentage on my team is also available if you've got a question or comment that the two zero eight seven three six zero three hundred five to zero eight seven three six zero three hundred you know if we ever had speaking we we opened up talking you out of a Roman Catholic priest I knew that if we ever had\nA priest who was a are taking of the show or they would not I should point out be able to take confessions over the telephone those would be invalid you can't do them over the telephone or the Internet\nAnd are just going to share that with folks today up when you talk about the sovereignty of God a sovereignty most people understand that maybe in a government style form and uh and and there's some similarities but you know I think it's a much bigger definition when you're talking about the lord\nAnd sovereignty is really a very simply understood as God is all powerful\nThere's nothing in life that happens outside of his control outside of his permission and even outside of his decree that all that happens\nYou know from the the scripture speak about the polling up the sparrow to the ground you know even bad or the young lie lie in that cries out for food that over all those things got his offer and that there is not one square inch of creation that is outside of the control and power of God\nBut here's a question for you a lot of people look at that and then they think that every action though that they're doing in life is all part of that too but uh\nThey're still free will among creation as well\nOn that is a very difficult question how do we reconcile these two things that humans are responsible creatures we're volition all creatures so we have the ability to decide are we going to do a are we going to be and yet um you know going back I'm\nA John Deere mentioned the story of Joseph but we can also mentioned Jesus himself you know the apostles will say um you crucified the son of God you did what God at pre determined what God is planned so yes they are culpable they are responsible for for murdering Jesus Christ\nAnd yet Peters able to understand that this did not happen or by some you know\nChance that this was decreed and determined by God and that of course for Christians gives us so much comfort that in all of our sorrows and you know cancer and\nYou know job loss in divorce or whatever it may be that that we're able to realize that well people make decisions and will suffer\nThe consequences of those if they're bad decisions but even so that over all of that God is in control God is managing\nThe whole state of the world's affairs and I'm so nothing happens by chance but all things happen according to his sovereign good pleasure\nI was I was going to add myself to that I think a lot of people out there some days you know they think gee I made that I made the left turn on the way to work when I could have made a right turn on the other way\nTo be concerned about in life but a lot of people that get so paralyze about decisions that are making because I don't think they're worried about offending you\nWell I think and the big question apply always comes up why why God why did you let this happen why is this happening to me why does that happen\nTo my family why did this take place the we look at I mean something as a as huge as a as a hurricane which we've dealt with some of that\nIn our own country on our shores uh this year in a couple of interview to the\nBig ways uh and and people look up and say my everything I own every possession light is gone is destroyed now and they stand there looking and saying why God so we don't have the picture I had somebody give me an illustration one time which I thought\nWas kind of good and you know most illustrations eventually break down um when it comes to trying to parallel to scripture but I think it's pretty good at least at least consider um the perspective because our perspective is we're looking directly at the issue\nBut gosh perspective is he's looking at not only in the past\nThe issue presently but also in the future ahead where we don't see and so we we can use association of we're we're a boring are way down the river and we're looking at the Rapids that are right in front of us\nAnd we're saying oh my goodness I have to deal with this and God is saying hang in there because I Know a head there's calm water and then also he has his perspective is he's looking down\nAnd he sees the entire river he sees the entire journey of our lives\nAre all at once whereas we only see what is ahead of us and and so the question of why is the always that comes up we don't have the ability to answer why except that we trust God in the midst of this storm\nI don't think about a story like that but we'll take a caller quickly get to call in before the break and we don't get a chance to answer it we can do it following Natasha starts at nine thirty color Europe next ... go ahead\nYeah morning bill you know uh I was saying to this segment here and I can't help but think that we as humans are so quick to always blame God when there's a catastrophe when we have lost a job or like the pastor said our hurricane\nTo hit our shores but we decided that we failed to realize that there's also a power that's out to destroy\nGod's creation you know and he will do everything to do that and I kind of look at it this way because I've talked to you a little bit for in the past where I haven't always made the right decisions I when I come through those situations after I started\nWas like a short break we've got more coming up across or could center John Martinez

L. I. X. or John Martinez along with Chris ...\nAnd bill colleagues and uh we've been talking about suffering and the sovereignty of God today could I ask you Chris because you mentioned during one of the previous breaks that you've sort of come up with your six ideas are explanations of\nCigarettes I might help people out of their situation\nRight so the question is when we are going through suffering as as we always are we get people asking us why is this happening why is God doing this to me and um\nI think having some ... some reasons helps us accepted even if we don't understand it\nAnd John mentioned the first ... first reason as to glorify got and that's really the story of the book of job right or all of this happens to joke joke doesn't know about the conversation God had with Satan and have an where God says hey have you seen my servant job no one's right just like he is and\nThe whole point of the book is really to magnify glorified the sovereignty of God in our human lives even though we don't always understand\nWhat the lord is doing so I think for people just to understand and they're suffering you know I Need to praise the lord he is in control I Know that he loves me and I'm you know if I'm a child of God all things are going to work together for good in this suffering\nLike the second reason is is to sanctify us I mean quite frankly uh we naturally left the world we have idols in our hearts shore\nYou know we want to live for today and not have a perspective of eternity in so suffering as a way of just chipping away at our idols and making us seek the kingdom of heaven seek first the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness so ... suffering does that sanctify purified sauce\nAnd thirdly it brings us into a closer relationship to God it really opens up our eyes to to to God is you know Jesus said come to me all you who labor and are heavy late and then I Will give you rest\nBut you know if I'm resting and then my come the retirement or my vacation home or my brand new pick up where my you know whatever it is that I've achieved the thing that I've wanted if that's my comfort if that's you know the the world in which I live and then think\nWho has got to us right and so suffering not only to purify of some you know with all the way those idols but it it just draws us close to the lord so we can say lord you're everything you're all that I Need and\nUh so that's important you see that\nI particularly we see that people who are going through cancer you know or through some great disease or illness or they have a child with a disability and and they start speaking about the relationship with the lord it's a privilege for us pastors to be\nIn their homes when they're talking about that relationship with God\nBecause they have learned and suffering what really matters you know who is ultimately in control and um I Know that God is their father the father of ... the carnival comfort in such a third part of suffering it's just to to bring us into that close relationship with God\nAnd a fourth reason as to bear testimony\nTo the world you know Christians are are given the privilege I Believe of of living a cruise to form life so God permits us into trees suffering so that we can demonstrate to our friends and neighbors\nThe man who has suffered ultimately for humans and that's Jesus Christ so\nSo we become sort of a lens or an image by which we can reflect\nThe cross that's a powerful testimony you know Paul\nAnd the gentleman who called in earlier spoke about that there's that component of Satan you know said and also does things in ... daddy he said it was a messenger of Satan to torment me and God didn't allow that to be removed part to keep Paul humble sanctify Paul\nBut also enable Paul to preach the gospel in an authentic manner to be able to say you know we do live in this world of suffering but look at Jesus who has suffered for us to Barrow is so that's the fourth reason to bear testimony to the gospel\nAnd I'm a fifth one is to enable us to comfort those\nYou know the scripture says that God comfort solace in all our affliction so that we may be able to come for those who are in any affliction with a comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God and bill you began the hour we're just talking about that as pastors to be able to sympathize with people you know if we\nDid not suffer then how would we be able to minister to people and so that's another reason for suffering as it enables us to\nStep into other people's sorrows and say hey I maybe I don't understand it completely but I I Do understand that somewhat and my prayers are with you you know and that's important just to build up the body of Christ\nAnd um and finally the last reason is\nThe purpose of suffering is really to prepare us for everlasting\nLife for the world without suffering listen to the scripture from second Corinthians for poll says\nSo we do not lose heart though are out herself is wasting away our inner self as being renewed day by day for this light momentary affliction is preparing for us any turtle weight of glory beyond all comparison\nAs we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen for the things that are seen are transient but the things that are unseen\nAre eternal especially in America where we have so much affluent so much wealth a\nWe have we have you know we're near sighted and suffering ... has the ability to clear away the clutter and say pressed to award the heavenly sigh and the new happens in the new earth you know and the yeah Chris that'll preach brother [laughter]\nIdle sermon outline and I'd have to deal that perhaps\nDesk talking I got\nAbout my own personal life two thousand and one at the end of the year uh I I was working as a television news director in my entire broadcast career\nFor the previous uh Fifteen Years have just been one upward trajectory and you really start to feel proud of yourself and you know because I had just moved hopscotch long quickly from job to job promotion your promotion and in the end of the year I was told we don't need you any longer but it'll be cutting back\nIn from the seismically we're not on the same page anyway and so uh I'm Out of a job and a within a span of sixty days I lost my job a broke my left leg oh man my wife said I'm\nI'm going to be suing you for divorce I don't want to be married do any longer\nSo at this point I even had a stretch where I was living with a friend a and I had bought a pair of glasses before all of his game down puts apparently it was an imperfection and the frame and I talk with him I was taking my glasses off we're talking this kitchen and the glasses split in the middle and of course now you're thinking how am I going to pay for this\nAnd I I it was my glasses broke\nI look up we're now my friend who was not a cost so he said I Know what you're thinking [laughter] or do you immediately I mean it was almost like he was my counselor at that point", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Top Story", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "25"}
