she was younger and Dennis is was just telling us that he took his story\nToo is up or some folks in his church and uh and then there's was gonna say went from there you went from there on to speak he was Senator Hatch his office\nYeah what happened was that a much lower\nBishops who ... his office which talked to them for me Wednesday night and I didn't hear anything further on Thursday and they didn't figure I Would because it was the sub committee or those kind of you know watching you to not watch you\nGood subs to the committee meeting and um then on friday a smoke\nWith a has his office they may be at least transferred me off the couch says D.C office and they immediately transferred me off the grass leaves office which got me to the investigators for the Judiciary Committee a majority\nSide and they\nReally took me over the coals I mean I\nI I ... it it felt\nLike I had committed a crime and they were they were interviewing me they were there were cross examining me and um they brought some things that I had no knowledge of it and kept coming back to that as well and you know because of where I live where right up against the mountain so I figured well\nMaybe it was the cell breaking up but it happens so frequently in there for them on the phone at the time with I remember the number correctly but they were they were asking the same thing in a different way and then you know the and I won't get into the questions because I think that they weren't that held in reserve\nBut they they asked me to particular questions over\nAnd over again and I'm now I'm starting to get irritated because you know I make my phone could cut out that much while I had my wife's listening in on speaker of the whole time and I'm Glad I did um\nMy wife used to work for an attorney and she told me all they were doing was trying to see if you're credible witness they're trying to trip you up to see if you were if you were a coming forward\nWith real information or if you're trying to make part of it up or whatever like okay well then I guess I'm not angry but you know you would like to be trusted at face value but apparently that they cannot now\nAnd then by the way you know I get that not everyone likes that I have taken a the the path that I Would say and\nI'm\nOnly the Washington Post reached out to talk to me nationally um well that's that's not true PJ Media are contacted me and uh I didn't check my Facebook Wednesday night I just wanted to go home and get away from it and when\nWe reached out to contact me and I never contacted them back never heard of him for one thing and um for another thing ah I didn't I didn't want to let this out until I knew was going to go out and then\nUh I did hear a from CNN for their their uh I guess their their Internet page their Web page and I heard from ABC in Chicago it wasn't for um the newscast per se I think it was also for their their cyber rag\nAnd when I'm\nOn the Washington Post contacted me at no sooner hit then I got a call from the Washington Post no sooner hit the judiciary committee's websites than that and I got a call from someone who overall it did a very good job\nAnd I was going to say that there are people probably at the post to still with some institutional memory would remember you from television\nOh you know the reporter who who interviewed me I'm not sure she is as old as my time back with Julie was but\nShe was very she was fair she mischaracterized one thing and I think it was an accident um and I and I do want to clear the stuff I did think when we first approached me she might be a prostitute she might be a high end call girl because\nI was three hundred and fifty pounds and Julie was frankly really a knockout I mean it's Thirty years old she she made that black dress look real good\nAnd um\nKnow I ... and I'd been in Vegas and approached by high end\nBut that black dress look real good and um you know I in a bidding Vegas and approached by high in her hookers before and I knew how to say no but Julie never once brought up a day you know do you want to date you on a there was no\nDiscussion of sex for money there none of that um and I was flattered that she uh she was interested so good when I went over to replace I began to realize that there was only\nBecause I was on TV and and it was kind\nOf an opportunistic thing for 'em\nBut Julie was not a cog or or the other thing is that I'm really disgusted with frankly is people say well you're ... a being slut shaming I never called her a slut\nAnd the people who are so against slut shaming currently ones calling her a slots and I resent that she may have different sexual proclivities but that doesn't require\nA label that doesn't require saying things about\nHer in that regard and that really came up yesterday and ah finally on one of my Facebook friends threads that came up and I just said\nNo you know you're the one called ... not me and uh and I resent that do you know guys are guys do some very similar things and they're not slots oh yeah okay fine well done much keep that that balance out\nWhen I got to let you go but um I I just want to tell you or ... or your honesty is very refreshing uh I'm Glad to call you a friend and uh I Wish you well on this I Know that wasn't easy to do\nThings still no it has not been easy um and then we would have thought twenty three years I

and that type of crash like that\nOr not to mention we had other crashes last week where a person that wasn't even their fault but they didn't have a seat belt and and uh they were you know cash from the car and they would have been fine tune and walked away from his take on a part in that sense and so on so\nYeah you know it's it's a you know I understand we're restricting freedom when we put on that seat but I'm not sure what type of freedom that is I mean do you go on a rollercoaster and and said not to strapping on the roller coaster and you know what to say so you know a\nAt me were ten dollar citation it's not a big deal if it doesn't go on your insurance if you get pulled over I I Will tell you I'm gonna say if you're not wearing her seat belt um but um it's not that big a deal but it's really up to you and on on how you want to survive today\nSo I thought about you a couple of days ago something you told me a couple of months back about staffing as I was watching a Rocky Mountain law enforcement have you ever seen that show\nI've heard of that but I don't know if I've ever seen it\nIt's it's it's very very good idea and it gives you a real insight into how a lot of it's filmed along route Seventy so it's a bit softer here uh\nBut I was watching the parts of the program a few days ago and and there was an episode where\nA ... deputies in the course of it attracts state police deputies local police and it's a role in this particular county and there was a shooting and apparently it happened out in a rural area and what happened was a tenant living at a farmhouse\nHad shot somebody in the yard and at night and then called nine one one and so they were on their way responding and\nUh the the law enforcers we're talking uh uh to the camera man about how\nWhen these things happen in your into rural county and this was in a very rural spot they said it's going to be at least twenty minutes before we get there they said the great thing about living in rural areas mostly people are out of the country can settled their disputes on their own but when we get something like this\nIt's like that but your point I think a couple of months ago had been up the public and this was your personal point that we probably could use more law enforcement or might not that's not likely going to happen but it it shows you that when you're working in a rural area like southern Idaho that these challenges come up all the time\nRight you know I mean you want to please their age that but the reality is is I mean I\nI hate to say I mean we try to be proactive and sometimes we are proactive but with their numbers a lot of times we're just reactive and we are going to be careful when we go into a situation like you just said there's been times where we're ambushes have been set up for police officers that way so we're going to get up we're going to get prepared and\nWe're going to go in and safe is unless there's an immediate threat and then we're going to go and no matter what like a school shooting or something like that\nThere's nothing that's going to stop us back but um but yeah if if we got the time to to prepare ourselves in and then we will so it's going to take a while\nThere was another thing I saw on this program and up a deputy gets a call from the state police because he has a canine unit and they had that actually had a at a traffic stop or where they talked to some women who were in a was a a blue Honda rover Honda from the early nineties and\nThey had assumed that the women have drugs but they didn't have any way to detect them so they radioed ahead and said you know we think if she's got drugs you should probably bring your canine unit so he waited\nFor the harder to come down the road and when he saw it and he he hesitated he said I've got to let them think that I'm not coming after that so they gave her a little time then when he got on the highway suddenly realized there were two identical a blue Honda's with California place [laughter]\nAnd uh and he said oftentimes this was what I didn't know he said oftentimes they worked into vehicles like this so when I'm going to pass the first one is like you're going to be on the phone selling or there's a there's a a\nA deputy coming up behind you on the highway a un I was unaware that they operate that way of the some of these are they called the meals that stands drugs so you're transfer\nYour meals or whatever you want to call them so if if we're talking a higher in trafficking uh big loads and stuff like that yeah you should never assume that there's just one\nThere's there's always you know ... we of course when we're kids you know what was that show the band it or whatever yeah OK in the band it or\nYou know there's always something that's going to try to take you off your trail and and and our uh our drug enforcement officers are are are are troopers and the deputies that are trained and that they understand that and they're always looking for the ... if you will not to mention there's always a danger once you get the real car pulled over that there's that second vehicle as well so\nThe first the first that the people in the first the ethical denied knowing anybody in the second vehicle and then finally one of them admitted okay that's my that's my husband in that car so they stopped the other car which should kept going down the highway and ah so how can you don't travel with your wife [laughter]\nThat was what the suspicions kind of crowd let these crazy I've never seen a reform I live here [laughter]\nWell to bring that up because I I think that the public has to realize is the state gross 'em\nThat eventually law enforcement all have to grow with it but it's just like the city when it had to ask were you know more firefighters and occasionally I have to ask for more police officers but as we see the valley grow a there's going to be ... you just you will not be able to police it with the same amount

X. and news radio Thirteen ten dot com but they'll collie\nOther number would be to zero eight seven three six zero three hundred to zero eight seven three six zero three hundred subject today and uh you know we were just talking off air at that dovetails a bit uh with the conversation and that that\nThe story of the individual shared with us on the air or between eight and eight thirty this morning and and we're living in an over sexual ... culture and history\nAs a as a as a testimony about the difficulty it can cause you would life and I'm\nA ... ... talk a little bit about how Christians can cope and this sort of world that we're living in today because\nYou drive down the road you see a billboard you turn on your TV you see something even in the middle of the day that's not appropriate any longer a U turn on the radio you hear lyrics to music and you immediately turn it off because you don't want the kids in the back seat to hear these things come up all the time\nI I think that maybe maybe the the the fact that we do live on I hear many people identify as a a hyper sexual ... society we've probably always been hyper sexual lies but it's a it's so readily available and it's everywhere but it is it the the access\nTo it is just immediately in front of us um ... you can't even listen to the news today without fear of how they're going to describe how someone is\nIt's in front of us um ... you can't even listen to the news today without fear of how they're going to describe how someone is given testimony about uh their encounter without wandering should we be listening to the testimony of what they're talking about even\nYes intensified of course by social media inability to play or information on people's faces a lot of the moment and uh the Christian has to navigate this and of course you and I both know disarm and this is what God has called us having these given it to us through ... through the Holy Spirit but the word of God\nIf you have a ... how do you know working fire\nGate has a website for business and she thinks it's going well but the problem is\nIf you have a ... how do you know working for you\n... it has a website for business and she thinks it's going well but the problem is she has no idea if it's working out for our website company said they send their report but that was literally months ago\nWere interactive can help with consistent monthly reports and he had anytime access to your sights metrics you always know what's going on with your website\nMy name is I mean I Love her online marketing is our number ... enact\nGood at having a red fault if you don't know how the final point I had only\nGetting easier even quite thank you I remember that you can log in to the site and seeing that check with parents where interactive either federal dollars at the height and their allies to prove that I'm here locally and the magic ... but the reason I think he had a nation right let's get started with your free ...\nPet parents ... [noise]\nI Know it's hard to believe but cold cold winters are right around the corner whether you need repairs right away or want to avoid problems in the future it's called the professionals at brands eating and electric today the ... will make sure it's done right the first time\nProblem free cause the winds are founded Ramsey eating and electric twenty six hundred overland avenue in early ... six seven eight zero four or five Ramsey heating and electric they failed warm winters and cool summer\nOut the word created a very short commercial break there so you wrote on what they can get directly to the point of a of the call [noise] uh from our previous caller in Studio with us pastor Paula Thompson pastor up there more than a collie handling the telephones on magic probably this morning on his radio\nThirteen ... news radio Thirteen ten dot com a color brought up an interesting point you know and and I was just sharing the story myself a fair about uh [noise] you know taking my daughter to see a historic movie one time and it was a very clean movie except for one line in the movie which made me just\nSit in my seat and cringe when\nShe was a little girl at the time and you wonder how do you keep your your kids away from this number to the caller's point was I guess\nYou know and how do you teach parents because parents themselves just don't always know\nYeah we live in a world that doesn't believe in absolutes bill um scriptures are all fall of absolute sense so my expectation to anyone listening\nIs that the truth comes from the scripture it is the truth is the moral compass it is the righteousness of God and also points out the ... as a man and so um\nMy tradition simply get you get your just sound like a preacher I get your heart in the scriptures and the Bible is infallible inherent to warn of God\nIt's inspired by hand and that's that's where we need to go\nYeah I think I think as well we can see that as time progressed as it moves along if things aren't addressed in a generation\nThen the next generation takes where the previous generation had advanced or had progressed\nAs the pop word today is and they'll take it even a step further and so the the reality of the church's duty here is to keep things in center keep things on truth keep things on the point of guard leading us and righteousness because if that\nDoesn't if the church doesn't do her job in that the culture has no conscience the culture has no discernment to know where the line is\nAnd so the church really has to pick up her duty again and and raise up families raise up moms raise up dads raise the children who will walk into righteousness if anything I think culture pushes against absolutes yes and\nWe need to point out and say you know I call a spade a spade that that was sent\nYeah I think I can even related to an experienced my wife and I had about two or three years ago we had we we like to go to the theater to the live theater and we had some friends invite us to go to a show that that either they were promoting her in and within about ten minutes I knew I could not stay in this show any longer\nAnd so I had to make a decision in and do I stay and endure it and let everyone around me who knows I'm a pastor or think that this is okay or am I going to have to do the hard thing here and with my money is wasted it's gone I got up and walked out of\nThat and I don't regret it for one moment for one moment it was a trashy non\nNon helpful non righteous moment for me to be in it at a fire yeah\nWalked out of a movie theater myself many many years ago I was just there with friends and they got him followed me outside what's going on and I said I'm not going to watch that yeah and\nUh we'd go on to a comedy movie that had been promoted as being somewhat of a mild comedy and it turned out it wasn't terribly mild and I just this is nothing that I Want to sit through\nYeah and we're we're finding today is that there are ... there are fewer and fewer of those moments where we could go to and enjoy recreational moment with with our guard down so to speak and think this is going to be good just because I like doing this we gotta we gotta make decisions ahead of time\nAnd I think that's what gets in trouble and I think that's a little bit of what my charges if we don't have our guard up we're going to fall right and we're going to find ourselves in some some sticky masses that we don't desire to ban to\nHave to say that any of us are perfect but the fact is that if God is supplies the truth we have the ability to know what is right and what is wrong and to be able locked in that and with a clean conscience is the desires of Christian\nYeah and I think today you know we we as as as dangerous as the Internet is it's also a benefit in some respects there are resources that a family can go to and read about a movie before they go and see is this the kind of movie I Want to take my children to and and how many of those scenes that\nUh they they don't want their children to to be exposed to can they avoid by going into researching out the movie before they go there\nYeah you know this discernment not only on a on a moral courtroom basis but\nAs a pastor you know I call you know the whole issue of of of churchgoers ... testing the spirits of scripture says\nUh is important in and sometimes people they change you know it's about started preaching for the experience right for the entertainment um ... there's it's very instead of just if we want to talk a little bit of born about that the whole issue of how the Christian needs to be a brand and not swallowing everything after pastor says him does just because he has the authority right\nNow the pastor should have his ability to be able to do his homework and and and rightly divide the word of God\nUm and they should be able to open up the scriptures and and if they need to ask questions pastors approachable right um so it's one of those things where it's even a discouraging within the church culture itself for people to say you know let let's just this kind of go wherever the winds of change happens or the whims of false doctrine goes\nFor people who may have a question about should we go see this film more about this particular television show now of course today you can have\nVarious Web sites that will give you a lot of detail but even if they come to view of the two of you generally would would know because a you sit down with other pastors should discuss these things\nCurrent topics current events cultural things come up and a and there's the shared a knowledge that you have about all of this sort of someone says they stop you after church and they said after\nWe were thinking about going to the movies today and saying this so what do you know it's a good way to start\nAnd and I I think that I I I Would love it if more people would actually want to know what do you think about this show\n[noise] yeah and and I I think that I I I Would love it if more people would actually want to know what do you think about the show um you know I I\nI 'cause I Would I'd be more than happy to tell the politely it's no good [laughter] but\nThere their focus on the family as a resource called plugged in I think is the name of it and that's one resource that I go to before I go to any and I my wife and I don't go to the movies very often anymore um but if we ever do I always go to plugged in and read about them yeah we go to plug\nIn as well as rod and ah and ah Sammy tomatoes that gets or not a lot of those those websites tell you how many customers what kind of seen what kind of inappropriate um especially if you have young kids you want to know exactly what's what's going to be in the show and to be honest with email sometimes I'm not in that entertainment thing um\nListen to what's going on around me and ah I can very ... very clearly pick up a little bit about what's going on in in in\nYou know really to to exercise discernment to just go to a an a major network television website and look at the new shows that are on the season right now and the very pictures that they're using to advertise in the new show is enough to tell you I don't need to watch this movie I don't need to watch the show it's garbage\nI have a Facebook connection no I don't know where he finds the time to answer my questions but what I I I Know a new movie coming out or a book\nOr something along those lines of credit but question and say what do you use it seems Cal Thomas and or even a ride back and he will say it will tell me what he thinks it's sometimes he actually writes movie reviews in his column along we say like\nUm but I've always found that amazing that he probably gets hundreds of messages a day from people have you always takes time scales me this one but probably not be a good idea\n... more in the studio with\nUs you fires I'd do that I didn't start any of the wildfires [laughter]\nAnd do\n\nThe

more insult Thompson before we get back to do like to ask the masters a quick question about the ...\nThe grace of God belied a pastor east side Baptist church it's located at tool for eastern drive north here in twin falls and or or or a weekly gatherings begin on Sunday mornings at ten thirty and in the morning and six thirty in the evening\nAnd I have trouble adjust shepherding a magic valuable church and we are too old for me to have any north on the corner of getting in main street and ah we gather on Sunday mornings at nine AM and and uh\nUsually get out of there about twelve thirty we have a central clash following it and fellowship and we'll have to introduce you introduce yourself I think more importantly pollen I guess if if you come introduce yourself so that we can get a background in anger each in the name of crashed\nHumor I think you're getting out of twelve thirty but you won't be able to tell the time by the big clock [laughter]\nThat is the correct we have a caller as a reason why not grow [laughter]\nGolly you're up next year I'm here I'm Gail I Exxon pastors roundtable\nLooney revert to the topic is Judas as scary it guilty a blessed to be and really go to heaven or not they do\nYeah you know I I think this question is asked ... every generation has to ask the question I don't think it's an out of bounds question to ask but uh you know ultimately we don't know I'm\nAn individual's heart or their condition before the lord and we can certainly see some things in scripture that exposes about a guy like Judas\nThat gives us reason to believe that he's not going to be in heaven because of the sovereignty of God and Jesus knew that he was to be in this position of the sons of perdition\nAnd that he is is a denying and betraying of Christ um was from heart he owns his own heart he wasn't forced to betray Christ\nAnd so he ... he'll be judged because of his own heart\nWhen someone tells us that he's without excuse the whole issue his fruit clearly showed that which was um on godly a there was no redemptive value I Would think and when he was dealing even though he was around Christ I think that's what's remarkable um however [noise] and the upper room you have all the disciples asking\nYou know as Jesus as identifying to portray or\nThey were asking ourselves isn't me as it may cause we all have sin and yet uh\nI I think very clearly not like you say Paul not being the one who who determines desk but I think ... the tax tells us that that he was a guy who was a um outside of crashed\nAnd and that his position of that is not because he took his own life it's it's it's because of his heart exactly\nBut he knows that thing of conscience that led him to realize so yeah mostly done was terribly wrong and I think\nThat's what led him suicide I think so I think the weight of the reality of this was so enormous and I think would probably be the case for anyone who takes their own life that their conscience is they're in such a wrestling match with their own soul of such that they don't see\nYou know there's a lot of things inside of it I Can't make a psychological position on everyone who takes their own lives but in his eighth of a deep seated position to be at a place to take your own life I was going to say\nA lot of people out there are there so troubled to\nGoes back to a little bit about what we were talking earlier with discernment a lot of people uh they get that encouragement I think sometimes from what they see in the world the realm and they do that and and and you know that\nWhen someone is actually encouraging you those are the people that you should not be associating with and we have seen in recent history that people are actually out there on line encouraging people to take their own lives right don't associate with them\nRight exactly and and I would take that to to the broader spectrum of everything in our in our culture\nDon't associate with them right exactly and and I would take that to to the broader spectrum of everything the in our in our culture today an individual can be encouraged and even convinced that it's morally good and just thing to do that which God would oppose\nThat take divorce you take a sexuality a\nSexual identity do anything here you're going to find someone who's going to encourage you and they all have flashy words to convince you that your actions in this way are approved of God\nYeah you think about I'm thinking about just a lot of questions from west to callers the whole issue of\nOf judgment comes down to either receiving Christ or not or almost one either you're a without excuse or you are in Christ Jesus and so that's one of those things that's that's the judgment line that's what gets my personal justified or not justified\nAnd um as you and I both know somebody's in Christ Jesus they're born again scripture says this money on three has a transformation a second printing is five Seventeen that all life has passed away um I don't think there is any indication of prescription that you just had that I agree\nWe have a caller color Europe next year on the air on kale I Exxon pastors roundtable\nRamona and
