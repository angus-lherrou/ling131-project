... magic valley this morning a news radio Thirteen ... news radio Thirteen tend to GOP so showing you a story\nThis morning that I happen to find on line this is cool this somebody working in his garage\nThat could end up not only making a fortune but he could change the way our military fights in the field um he's come up with some space age looking rifle a that would replace the M. sixteen which has been in service for fifty five years\nAnd uh this thing is like nothing else I've ever seen before but it's got four barrels and it it it almost looks like the the writer so I was like a shock to an except it's not it doesn't shoot shot it's just you you you can you can dress for bullets on a target at one time\nYeah it's pretty amazing look and it's it's electronic as electronic trigger kind of like a paintball gun you you pull that and there's an actual leader that that tells the firing pins to fire it's got a big aluminum block\nBut in the garden and it feeds through the gun um you know it's a prototype so I imagine with ah some Pentagon money and his original idea they could they may be able to make something out of this that would be a\nPretty futuristic weapon I'm that's really what I'm what I'm waiting for you know I'm looking at all these things and\nThey're all variations on a theme I'm waiting for the next big actually new development is going to be going to electronics because you think about like triple yeah [noise] you know the weight of a mechanical trigger some you know you can get 'em pretty light a\nLoop liability um but with something like this electronic the fire you could just turn the dial and make of this light is or as heavy as you want it to be with just simply the tournament dial 'em rural\nReliability electronics is thing that scares me you know it's funny how firearms young people talked about a man they're pretty reliable I mean generally you look even back to a bold action rifle whose guys about hunting rifles fifty years I'm like if you had to ever do anything to it and they're like no I'm just shot at and Charlotte Charlotte\nYeah we get shot guns in the Punjab the looks like somebody's been using it for a garden rake\nYou know like like pandas they actually work me I had all the time with the low dose of money on it but a\nPretty amazing designs\nI was gonna say this guy do this in his garage though that's what caught my attention and he was it's just to tinker and he came up with this and you know put some thought into it in advance and he comes up perhaps who might end up being the most revolutionary firearm and American military history\nPossibly I mean it's a pretty cool concept or for barrels all directed on one point of impact\nWould be pretty devastating you know four bulletin hidden that target the same time it reminds me of ah\nFounder of Savage firearms uh\nHe creed invented all kinds of stuff all different kinds of stuff and then he invented the Savage model I'm Nineteen Eighteen Ninety five actually was his first one and then my made Eighteen Ninety nine and a model line the United Savage which still to this day is\nFar surpasses most lover action rifles got six round rotary magazine you could shoot pointed bullets through it\nUm it's a really great design the only reason they don't make any more because the machining involved\nThey said it would take is kind of counter so you look at the site has gotten tells you how many rounds or left and the guy that's a really great designs my favor a hunting rifle ever but it's still way ahead of time and it was designed a hundred and ten years ago you know\nIt's kind of color color you are on the air was forced Anderson from Washington street bonded eight forty seven I'm ...\nYour questions first universal able to go is shaking league is slower elopes or are they able to take advantage of the military surplus with ... Lear redo coats accuse\nMost of the firearms some of the firearms that they're using are fully automatic but they're issued to the department are not issued to the individual so they'll have like a a\nLike a gun room where they'll have theirs are armory they'll have that stuff and it's issues issued out on I Need to use basis if you have a\nParticular drama that comes along use that word drama and you're going to need that then you go to the room and you load up the van and you\nYeah ... exactly um but I as far as surplus I don't know I\nWhere the some of the old military vehicles a surplus vehicles are issued to the police departments and things like that there was a big debate and how much do we need to issue these guys I think the biggest thing that we need to\nDo is first of all support our police departments makes a great but it makes it much better relationship between the police departments and the community when we support them\nAnd also some of them need some sensitivity training to be honest with you because they go out there\nAnd they the things that they're subjected to on a daily basis they're generally dealing with the lowest rung of society day in day out day in day out day in day out and that won't great on you you know when they make you a little jaded so\nIt comes to running your farm you have enough worries marketing your dream should be one of them for over one hundred and twenty five years in school or people I have been committed to understanding your business than providing some barrier service let them find the most competitive option so you can focus on what you do best\nVisit them on line at Idaho dodge schooler dot com that to Idaho dot S.

calling the rivers in significant the U.S Mexico Canada agreement requires that cars be made was Seventy five percent North American components to escape terrorists forty percent of each car must also be manufactured\nIn facilities where workers earn sixteen dollars an hour or more on average crucially Canada's also cracked open the door to its dairy markets where American farmers\nAre going to back up a little bit there Mr Trump made it clear yesterday during his remarks on this new deal and it still has to go to over to Capitol Hill senator has to still sign off on it but he made it clear that too many other countries were flooding automobile parts into Mexico and Canada\nAnd then they were getting labeled as being from those countries and then shipped north end of the United states and he said well that's not\nHelping the situation out here when it comes to manufacturing strict you might end up paying more for automobiles because you won't have all of these cheaply made parts from other parts of the world on the other hand as Mr Trump pointed out you need these manufacturing\nPlants if you expect if you've ever get into a big shooting war that they can and has made this comment and some of his books as well why did we win World War two well simply because we were cracking up planes and jeeps and tanks\nAnd ships like no one else on the planet could American industrial might one that war are these things or just rolling off the line with President Roosevelt said I Want this number of ships in Nineteen forty one and this and forty two and forty three\nNot only did he get what he asked for but he scads and scads more and so the United states was just overwhelming the rest of the world with productivity and and we don't have\nThose factories here any longer at least with the ability to do that Mr Trump's point was you keep those factories open and you know now that you suddenly if you've got to pay somebody sixteen dollars an hour you may as well do it in the u._s.\nI'm an unfair advantage any longer so he's not happy\nAbout it well okay let's just get right to the point Donald Trump then got what he wanted and it's going to help American

contrary to the dire warnings in many quarters Mr Trump's unorthodox methods having set off ruin us trade wars are caused a global depression\nYou kept hearing all those things and I told you yesterday it was not reported widely but the Washington Examiner report it did on Sunday the Chinese are cutting tariffs on many products and ABC News in conjunction reported that the Chinese manufacturing economy is starting\nTo feel the pinch from what Mr Trump is done with terrorists just saying they got a billion and a half people feed every day they have to come up with millions of new jobs every day for people who are moving in from the countryside this is going to cause them some anguish\nUnless they come to an agreement with us and they stopped test after various patents and other properties that are developed in the United states just has to be done sooner or later because it is a national security matter\nAnd for those people out there saying well little is changed Mr Trump said a couple of things when he was campaigning he was going to renegotiate did this deal this North American free trade agreement to benefit American farmers in American manufacturing those two things he has done\nSo when the mainstream media tries to tell you well we got nothing really new out of all of this\nNow you know now you know\nAnd when one of his fiercest critics is writing in the
