[noise]\nWe um [noise] uh [noise] we're talking to 'em Larry's wise or he is the president of governing accountability Institute a producer of a documentary\nCalled the creepy line the creepy line dot com um we're talking about Google and Larry I've never I've never\nBelieved in you know those dystopian movies I've always made fun of them and said yeah this is this is crazy you know the corporations out to get you\nBecause of their algorithms because they are so all encompassing that is the world were headed towards what do they tell you when they say algorithms that we have to keep that top secret because\nThey what they argue is this is for reasons of of a state secret um and and you know that they need to protect our trade secrets they need to be a a you know making sure that nobody gets access to it there's some truth to that but there are a lot of things that they could do to demonstrate um\nThat they're offering a fair product in service to people and here's a single and they have lied about this before you know ten years ago or so you had other companies like trip advisor\nAnd Yelp who were saying that Google was artificially suppressing their rankings in Google in favor of Google owned companies which okay you know Google has the right to do that but here's the thing Google flat\nOut lied and said absolutely not we don't do that our algorithm is pure it's true the best results or ... or or organically at the top\nWell here's the problem the Federal Trade commission the European Union\nYou are fiddling with the algorithm you are screwing these other competitors and you're lying to the point is when Google says you can trust the algorithm you can trust us they lied before and their line now\nAnd I think the only question that remains really is how are we going to deal with this um you know there's the old story that Henry Kissinger said when he was on the national Security Council you give a president three choices do nothing\nTake my solution or semi nuclear war those your three choices are in this case it's kind of like that we can do nothing\nWe can try to deal with some sort of the regulatory issues related with Google or we can break up these companies those are the three options that we have it I think we're really at the point of point number three 'cause this is not\nA monopoly like standard oil sands oil that's going to dominate the hallmark of this just controlling the news flow in the United states\nIs in the end this is in the and Peter ... controlling everything yes Google is ... the most likely company in the America in the American world\nOr to come up with a guy yes who ever who ever gets to a first controls everything there's no way to beat it once you have a guy yes this company is the most likely in the free world to come up with it\nIf we don't have them eat contained in some way or another when they get to a I worked hosts yes\nYes that's exactly right and here's the thing it's not just to go the company a lot of people don't realize this I didn't realize this if you use safari on your apple product you're actually using the Google algorithm and that is Google information um if you're using if you were using um Yahoo\nYou're using Google the point being Firefox is Google the all these entities are using the Google algorithm so even if you say I Am not going to use Google dot com and you're using unless you are making very specific choices for other options if you using any of those others\nGoogle is the one that's dominated by the way Google pays apple nine billion dollars a year Google actually pays apple\nTo be the algorithm of choice for safari that's how much they value this information\nAnd want to dominate the space\nSo I Want to talk to 'em a little bit about um what can be done um with the algorithm or I'm\nAnd more importantly I think they are analyzing all of us look there's\nThat this is just the beginning let me tell you this boogie story you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay the center is the main city of aging how many people that you just look it up for me what are you still how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle there is so much monitoring going on they just did a test they release the guy they they uh took a guy picked somebody said go into the center of the city\nJust go hide okay [laughter] they had a picture of the guy and the the Chinese tested this new brand new system and then\nAfter like an hour or two they gave the leaves system the picture of the guy and said find him\nIn eight minutes he was in the back of a squad car unbelievable in ... minutes yes city of twenty two million coin tea to millions amazing in eight minutes yeah so the and this is without AI right this is the kind of stuff that is coming that people really need to pay attention to\nThat's right and and Google or is it the forefront of that they they take a position of pride that they are the forefront of exploiting future technologies real quick though on Gmail this is very important for people to realize that just shows you how\nFar Google goes I used to have a Gmail account now what Gmail does they scan every email the comes into your Gmail accounts and ... ... email you send out you know what else they scan if you've ever written a draft\nEmail let's say you're mad at your cousin and you know I'm sick of you know cousin crest and all the crazy stuff he does and you're in late one night you write a draft and you say you know what I don't think I'm going to send that to Chris that's just me\nBeing on just a second I Want to make sure this is writing a draft but that's not saving it as a draft correct It's just you ... it counts the delete delete delete delete delete delete it's not even saving it as a draft\nRight correct that's correct is scanned by Google so Google knows more about you than you know you can have a very open and completely transparent relationship with anybody in your life your spouse your best friend or whatever the Google knows more about you than they do and they are very aggressively going to retain that information\nI was your best friend or whatever the Google knows more about you than they do and they are very aggressively going to retain that information but they're using it against you here's the key thing it's not just privacy is manipulation\nBecause they want to take that information and not just sell information to advertisers they as part of their mission want you to steer and move your life in a certain direction that they deem is the way the direction your life should go\nThere to beat her choice or the documentary as the creepy line a couple of pushback and a couple of sure or at least problems I have 'cause I'm with you on Ninety percent of the\nOne issue I have is Google is awesome it's all of the products that they make are better than everybody else's product at a similar ... and it it would eat an incredibly inconvenience me\nTo give up Google because all of their products work better than everybody else's ... doesn't know [laughter]\nWhat are you there because I mean yes they're everywhere they also do a really good job or when it comes to designing an easy to use product right ...\nThat's that's a great question and it's not easy I mean there are alternatives search a systems out there um but none of them are as good as Google and it's not really that I don't know I think that's\nA a a road that people will go down that you shouldn't go down that what we should go down is we should be talking\nTo the people in ... no no no we should be sending people who understand this fight to Washington because by the time we talked to Washington it's already over we need people who understand the ethics of what's going on with high tech\nIn Washington because they need to have this conversation right now it's not about us changing our behavior fry it to the point we must corralled Google\nAnd break them up or corral them in some way\nNot with just little litigation because I'm a ... litigation but are not just little simple laws of what we're going to cut because they'll go around that that fire\nRight okay moving even one other one yeah you said this earlier and it made me very uncomfortable and my suspicion is it makes you very uncomfortable to which is your solution we see we're leaning towards breaking up these companies and\nAs a capitalist as a person who does not want the government involved like or in private business I mean how do you how do you have a bridge that guy\nNo I mean I I think that's a great point and I came reluctantly tests as I looked at all the possible things to do with Google here's the problem a into this space the way that technology is moving how\nGoogle exerted some market dominance it really we really do not have a free market in search\nUh it's really impossible in fact one of the guys we we interview the vice president of Yelp or in in our\nUh in or a film and the founder of Yelp said he wouldn't start up today because it'd be impossible Google would smother them the only reason that Yelping these other entities have survived as they have built up enough brand equity when they were founded what Fifteen Twenty years ago to where they can exist so we have a situation where they're truly is not a functioning\nA monopoly and by the way Google's market dominance is partly related\nTo its political alliance in Washington may pass laws and rules all the time to squelch competition a veteran in Santa Fe and to do things like\nThe platform ing yes we are not a publisher we're a platform right then they go in and they edit will now your publisher you're not a platform so they play it both ways and they're they have the money to do it\nAnd that's a hugely important point because when they first want it or it was set up the regulation for the Internet it was if your publisher you're treated as a media company if you're a neutral platform which is what Google and Facebook claim they are they say we're not going to ...\nIf your publisher you're treated as a media company if you're a neutral platform which is what Google and Facebook claim they are\nThey say we're all gonna end any content they even use the analogy were like a telegraph we're just taking a telegraph message from Peter and we're sending it to go in and nothing else is happening when we all know that's not true now they're editing or they're censoring so they are acting\nAs publishers but unlike other publishers they don't face the legal or regulatory burns that they do so it's a competition\nOr even the public scrutiny even the public you sound like you're crazy if you talk against Google editing but I Know that they are like the wouldn't one solution be to make their algorithms transparent\nAh yes that would help but the algorithm is changing constantly and and I do get I Am sympathetic to the argument that this is a trade secret that they work very very hard to develop and they have um I think by breaking them up\nInto pieces and by the way I don't think it's just two companies I think several different felt so bad [laughter]\n[laughter] um I think it would be would be extremely helpful in the way to go on this\nBecause otherwise they're going to continue to rigs or market dominance ... the other thing I hear conservatives talk about and I find this terrifying is to make them a utility oh no no\nNo I don't know what the chilies are like here in Dallas oh no [laughter] not Texas we don't really have a we have to open the energy all that so we have five different energy company ... and yeah we don't pay anything yeah like the notion of\nMaking Google a public utility ... which really means you're making it a government utilities ya now means you've got a government controlling search no ... no interest in that whatsoever and what you are seeing is this merging of Google which used to be generally out of politics very little lobbying very little interaction\nWhen Barack Obama's elected in two thousand eight you saw this enormous influx of Google people into Washington DC and they stayed so we're just now\nOne of the most plugged in if not the most part been corporation in America so this notion that there are kind of these wild cat or out of Silicon Valley that are like independent from government is just totally ridiculous [laughter] I could spend two days with you um I really enjoyed this I'm going to take a hard pass on that ah\nHere where half an hour [laughter]\nPeter ... is a president or the government accountability Institute the documentary is called the creepy line how do you see it\nUh it's going to be available shortly on

market's going to take a big dive and we worked hard for this he's been stressed about this\nFifteen maybe really bad\nOr what type of a percentage would you give your broker based on how he has done for you now let me put it a different way\nWhat type of a grade would you give your broker when it comes to keeping your money protected and safe from any downturns in the market in other words how what are your broker\nBeing your money protected and safe from any downturns in the market in other words how would your broker be graded based on your philosophy because everybody generally has a certain mindset about safety\nSome people say well I'm I'm willing to risk you know Seventy percent of my retirement savings I'm I'm willing to risk eighty percent some people say well I'm I'm only willing to risk ten I don't want to have any of my money at risk I I'm willing to risk zero I Want one hundred percent of my money safe\nSo I think probably one of the first steps you need to uh to do is determine what your risk factor or your risk tolerance factor is and does that line up with your broker so here's a good rule of thumb\nA Suzie Orman came up with this in her book road to well I don't really like the site very many people on my show I talk about a few uh Patrick Kelly is one of them an award winning economist\nOr I talk about him Robert Shiller I'm a Nobel Prize winning economist I talk about Robert Shiller because he's predicting a downturn in the market of somewhere between forty and sixty percent\nI'm In the near future so that's kinda scary because I I don't see very many people on my radio program\nUh but I Want to I Want to talk just for a second about Suzie Ormond she has a little rule called the rule of one hundred uh in her book called road to well don't know how you feel about Suzie Orman\nI just I just wanted to mention her because of this rule in her book and here's here's the generally the way the rule works whatever age you are is the percentage\nOf your retirement assets you should have pulled to safety\nSo if you're sixty five Seventy years old you should have somewhere between sixty five and Seventy Seventy five percent of your assets pulled to safety\nIn other words no risk you should have a goal to safety so that when the market goes down not if but when we all know what's going to have and that's that's not a question I'm sure your broker would agree with that or it's just a matter of time it always has gone up and down and always will go up and down\nAnd it's gone up really really good over the last five years so that's not a question we know what's going to go down\nThe question is when and how much so getting back to that rule the rule of thumb or the rule of one hundred is whatever age you are is the percentage you should have pulled to safety now I preface that but that's\nNot everybody falls into that category of wanting to put their money or keep their money at\nRisk in retirement this is my professional opinion I've been doing this for women in my sixteen year of doing this now I Love what I Do\nAnd it's sixteen years I'm proud to say that not one of my clients has ever lost a dime due to a downturn in the stock market because they can't\nAnd I really liked that fact that none of my clients has ever lost any money due to a downturn in the market and yet they still have the potential for upside market close now I Know of many of you or maybe in your car today or maybe listening in the garage working on if you project but wherever you're at\nProbably the first thing that comes to your mind is how is that possible well that's why you need to give me a call I Want to put together for you\nMy free safe money information get\nIt includes my one hundred and Fifteen page book called safe money there is no cost there's no obligation for you the best thing that you can do is to get informed when it comes to making decisions about your retirement savings and your assets so give me a call ... eight five five for one two\nSafe that's eight five five for one to seven to three three give me a call that's the first step and making the right step toward a good safe\nAnd then two three three give me a call that's the first step and making the right step toward a good safe retirement so again let's get back to my original point how would you grade your broker\nIn in how they have protected your money how how they have kept your money out of harm's way\nSo if you were to say well my broker is you know I'm so into and over the last few years um I've done extremely well well I I don't want to talk about how well the market has done 'cause we know the market's done extremely well it's fantastic\nWhat the market has done since it's low in March of two thousand nine um it has more than doubled\nThe Dow has more than doubled the Dow in March of two thousand nine was at sixty six hundred\nIf it would have gone to Thirteen to that would be doubled will be no us even far above that it's up to Eighteen thousand [noise] so ah say Fifteen hundred I'm a Eighteen a thousand is where it's at right now so the issue is and how well the market has done that's not what I'm asking\nI'm asking you to grade your broker on how he has done in aligning with your philosophy of keeping your money safe or at least most of your money depending on where you're at in life\nBecause for some people they simply do not want to take any more risk in retirement but for many of our listeners they don't know where else to go\nThey'd been with a broker for many many years and he's\nDone you know a ... okay job I mean I guess everything's been good and the market's done okay and ... yeah I I lost money back in two thousand and eight and nine but didn't everybody well no none of my clients that\nWell okay well what about back in two thousand and one in two thousand two you know nine eleven happened and that kind of triggered some things and we had a really bad downturn in the market I mean everybody lost money then I mean the market tanked and it was you know one of the worst disasters this country has ever seen or when the twin towers fell and\nAnd why we just had to really bad years of volatility I mean everybody lost money that didn't they vote no none of my clients lost any money\nThe key was saved money investing is to never lose to eliminate\nThe possibility\nOf loss due to a stock market decline\nThat's what my clients have been doing now for over Fifteen Years\nIt's not only possible I Want to show you factual information on how it can happen how it can work for you how save money\nCan be a great place for you to invest for your financial future and your retirement years that's why you need to give me a call request my free state money information get eight five five for one two safe\nThat's eight five five for one to seven to three three give me a call I Want to get this kid into your hands it's free there is no cost there's no obligation to you\nSo when you're when you're grading your broker and you're thinking about how his philosophies hopefully line up with yours\nHow well do you think he's done so let's let's set aside what the market has done because the broker any broker myself we don't we don't have any control over what the market does we don't have any control them when it goes up we don't have any control of when it goes down\nIt's just not something we have any control over so you know if you call your broker and you say gee the market's down\nYou know ten percent in the last six months I I think it's time to get out he's gonna he's not going to take blame for that because the market is in control of that and on the same token if the market's gone up Fifteen Percent in the last year\nDoes he take credit for that well no he really can't because nobody can can\nFifteen Percent in the last year does he take credit for that well no he really can't\nBecause nobody can control the market so we can't really great our broker in the coordinates to the positive or negative fluctuations in the market the way that we grade our broker is does his or her\nInvestment philosophies line up with mine and if the answer is no or the answer is well not really or the answer is not very much\nThen you need to kind of re evaluate whether that broker is really where you should be because if your philosophy or your mindset is look it's time to get to safety on I'm getting older now I Want to preserve everything we worked so hard for I don't want to have\nAn experience another downturn in the market like two thousand seven and eight I don't want to live through another downturn downturn like two thousand one and two you can't afford it in a retirement the stock market can be one of the worst places you can be I really truly believe that that's why I Do what I Do\nAnd I have my clients and save money strategies where they can never lose any money due to a stock market downturn [noise] so what kind of a grade would you give your broker has his investment philosophies lined up with yours\nHas he made sure that your money is protected and you won't leave or lose anything in the market next time it goes down because it's going to happen it's just a matter of time and of course a whole nother part of that equation is how long will it take for the market to come back\nThe next time listen that's why you need to call me I Want to get my free safe money information get into your hands eight five five for one two safe that's eight five five for one to seven to three three\nAsked for my bonus income maximize or I Want to show you how you can get a lifetime income guaranteed that you will never outlive I Want to talk about that a show you what that looks like so give me a call ... eight five five for one two safe\nWow very cool how many she will be coming down main street or in children\nSo it's a band and a band up sheep in between Fifteen hundred and ten thousand it varies a little bit depending on the rancher and you know what their instant this had been like a with their sheep over the summer but it'll be about Fifteen hundred sheep trotting down main street for everyone to see and enjoy and celebrate\nWow how long does it take to get all of those she through town\nWell so are the sheep are the last part of our parade we do have some other performing groups and um she camps in teams they head off the parade from the beginning and then the sheep bring up the rear and from the beginning of the route to the end they tried to long pretty fast\nYou'd be surprised if only a few minutes from when he cut town that when they're out of town [laughter]\nWell I I Want to get into the specifics of what is offered for everybody to come up and all the different things they can be involved in but look sort like this ... I Know there's some things that are new this year but we want to make sure and let everybody know about because you tell us what's new\nHappy to show our she too was gathering is always the storytelling aspect of our event which has been around since the very beginning and it happens on friday night this year at the sun valley opera house or screening a couple of films and the first is called ... editor of the documentary film that\nFollows a couple of herders to leave their countries abroad and come over here to work as hers and it happens or some of the rangers featured in this particular from Idaho streak ranchers and it really tells the story of this worker you know who makes the choice is lifestyle choice it leaves his family to try and you know do better by them um\nBy making money in this industry and so it's a it's a really interesting film at one of the filmmakers it wouldn't be with us to talk about it or excited about that\nAnd we're going to open up that evening with\nA short film that Carolyn do Farina did called sheep herders with cell phones which speaks to end of the same topic with the advances in technology it's a it's an interesting glimpse into the world of hurt or\nGetting to the right spot at the top of the mountains to try and find the cell tower that will allow him to make a call home and then the rancher who has to meet him out there to change out the battery every once in a while so that's interesting glimpse also into the life of a herder and\nOr pleased to be bringing those films a to every one on friday\nNight and then we have will have ranchers as well thought filmmakers president to do a cute age so that that's always an interesting part of our evening and and really one of the\nPrimary parts of the entire festival is the story telling because part of keeping the history alive by sharing the story of what's happened in the past and so that's a and what's happening going to happen in the future so that's new this year for all sorts thrilled to be doing an encore presentation of the film we did last\nYear that sold out which is the shepherd is of the glaciers that filmmakers and then from India\nYou'd be doing an encore presentation other felt we did last\nYear that sold out which is the shepherd is up the glaciers that filmmakers and then from India will be back with us to screen his film again and it is a beautiful documentary that had one international award at a story he feels about his sister who one of the last shepherd says in the high Himalayas it's a beautiful piece of work and\nIf you saw last year come back in the end if you haven't seen it this is your chance that it's a really beautiful them and then in addition to those things in our films were bringing in a really fun ban which is a party part of our weekend it was a Jack the catch him and it's the dusty forty five\nOut of Seattle some people may have hurt them perform somewhere in the north west but they're going to be a whole lot of fun for us we're thrilled to bring them in and then um we have a new performing group the ruby mountain already bumped up which is a bass group that does more modern ... thing and they'll be performing at our book like air on Saturday and in the parade on Sunday and\nThey haven't been with us of course so we're excited to have this year\nWhile that sounds like a big party and we're just talking on the new stuff so far\nThat's how that's yeah at some of the events that happened but these are new elements to them so yes it's a packed five days of event that activity that's for sure\nBoth took another bread when we come back I Want to talk to you about some of the other events I see on here and and how this all relates to a Idaho agriculture and regional agriculture as well okay thanks\nBro great tools primo prices at ... ... talk to her Seventeen twenty save up to two hundred dollars on so what tools like the smoke brush was premium hammer drill and impact driver\nIt all off with Syria savings on the rest of the line\nUp your fall and make filling up your to shut easier than ever to do to fail to her seventeenth through the twenty eight only at your favorite movie and be a bar\nMm you work hard play hard and you wear burn durable clothing to fit the bill no matter what you're up to available and your favorite the and be\nTo Nineteen Fifteen burn has supplied busy Americans were were wearing a bright made affordable and made to get to work whether you're earning a living for just living large burn clothing rugged comfortable and perfect for the whole family to burn gear DNV supply and be ready for wherever life takes you [noise]\n... no but we're back I Want to ask you about the religion of this to agriculture I mean obviously just in the title or we're talking about agriculture but there's so many different things going on at the festival or regarding livestock and of course sheep specifically I see cooking with lamb a\nWolf is classes and things like this how does this festival help to teach people about just war versatile animal and more\nProductive and valuable animal sheep are\nYeah well I think there are several arms to that um the first thing you mentioned are ... which is our classes\nWhich is spending dying weaning like will and I think that that's becoming a bit of a lost art and even scored large manufacturers a lot of people don't really pay attention to what they're wearing or how the world gets from that animal to their sweater and so I think by keeping the world that classic going we also have\nA couple of ranch or to the story other will on Saturday they repeat their story some of the tradition of and trends and our folk life there\nAnd so we really are trained to to help people understand fiber and how it get from the ranch to your closet so that's one element the cuisine element that what we're doing has really grown over the years we do we have\nFarm to table dinners and cooking classes and land that several of our events and American ran as having a bit of a resurgence um\nEspecially with the young people these days I think chefs are learning how to better prepare lamb I think sometimes it got the old rap of button that people were were eating and that's not what land is all about and it's a very nice\nIt's as often forgotten compared to maybe the beef industry or the pork industry and so we're also trying to teach people how to prepare and enjoy Lance and that's another element of what we do I think also just by being in the presence of sheep that\nSomething new to a lot of people and we'd have to worry about the parade and and being in the presence of Fifteen hundred sheep but even out at our sheep dog trial you know they watch the border collie work\nAt how to herd cheap and that's a whole another element of the industry so we're really proud to be not only celebrating which is a lot of the things we've talked about already with a lot of our that there are more cultural in nature but certainly the education part is a huge part of who we are the festival\nYeah absolutely you know it's funny I I Try and buy as much rule as I can jackets socks lawyers shirts I really do and I I absolutely will and it lasts forever\nAnd unbelievably nice product and and I I'm with you I I feel like it's making a comeback you see so much more of it now especially in terms of athletic clothing and and things like that but ah\nI I Love wearing wool but I buy it for the quality and for for the longevity\nAnd it's such a you know such a good luck it especially out here in the west a it's a great fabric\nTo wear but the new thing to me is cooking with wool um my my daughter has decided to show sheep every year in the county fair down here in any county and so we always like a companion lamb to\nRaise up within so we started a butchering a lemon and eating eating land bless eating all because that would be on a [laughter]\nA little ... you can eat lamb us to do but anyway\nAbsolutely delicious I Love it and I we raise beef and that's what I always has been my thing but I Will tell you what lamb is just absolutely delicious and I thought I Would just automatically mess it up but I don't it is just great\nYeah and we're thrilled that theory in addition to the story of world\nThat we have a couple of ranchers sharing at the fair the executive director of the American landlord is going to be with us to see her and she's doing a story of land so we really are we really are educating and I think it's wonderful\nTo see that so many of our area ... I'm not sure about everywhere in the world but I Know here locally many are serving lamb dishes on their menus regularly and so\nNot only to promote the industry and promote the nutrition and nutritional aspects of land\nBut it also certainly helps with shuts learning how to prepare it and then that way consumers are enjoying a well cook fish\n... let's talk about your farm to table dinner really quick is well obviously that's going to feature limb but what other producers local producers original producers will be contributing to that\nSo we had to farm to table dinners this year one on Wednesday night the night the festival opens in one on Thursday and we have a different rancher each night providing the lamb and um we have them at our local would reverse the state ability center and they're kind\nOf our local year round farmers' market as well as do a lot of a private event catering events farm to table that are year round and they use locally sourced food produce and everything else so not only will and be the centerpiece of those meals but it will be rounded out by some wonderful local food\nA natural and organic from our area and so those are really find more intimate side\nA dinner is that you sit down kind of family style and enjoy and it's really a great opportunity to get to know some people that are attending the festival to get to know the rancher and here again you know literally from from farm to table from ranch table what you're eating and just enjoy each other's company as we started with us too\nClose to ignore the break when we come back I Want to ask you some more about the sheep dog Charles okay thank Eddie and be supply we don't let anything by August down because we have Bob boots the ultimate put where", "show_name": "Top Story", "year": "2018", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "06"}
