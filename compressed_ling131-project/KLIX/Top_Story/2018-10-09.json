substance\nBoat you know Steve I think it was three years ago we had a tremendous debates on the floor and the Senate or about medical marijuana\nAnd there was a lot of you know we we have\nWe all feel for people that have those needs to use it for medical purposes and so one of the things that we did is we passed the bill to allow EPA dialect to be in a clinical trial\nEPA dialects is medical marijuana but it's produced in a lab in London\nEngland and it's a\nDelivered by a doctor's prescription ... by a pharmacist for especially for children who may have epilepsy but it could be for

getting and so uh\nI pass that bill three years ago the governor signed that bill three years ago and we've had a clinical trials are\nAt St lukes and for two years and just this last year the clinical trial was completed and it was to turn in America on medical marijuana has some\nBeneficial properties and so we made it available for folks is and that's called up at the Iowa was it's the same thing you'd be buying on the street but you buy it through the proper channels and say you know exactly what's in the bottle and you know that are produced in the lab\nAnd England and and it's available for you I I don't know how people can think that that's a negative\nCompared to something that they buy off the street or they buy through the mail that they have no idea who made us or how

senator I understand that he used and uh [noise] forgotten the name of early friend Martin read would record would again we're older would\nYou guys are going to be a participant in a discussion or don't kind of a debate on Monday at twelve noon and feed the troops club and your subject material is going to be proposition number two the expansion of\nMedicaid ... ideas within the state of Idaho so what can we expect as an outcome from that particular debate\nI Hope you can expect that we will be honest about the situation and uh\nI think Maxine bell will keep us honest she's a she's a wonderful lady who's who's been in the Senate or house longer than anyone else but I think the the issue is whether or not you know we try we try and try to try to find solutions to the Medicaid expansion issue and not\nJust in in in our bodies and lots of sand in\nWe have never found a solution that the majority of senators and representatives in Idaho can vote on and feel good about and so we've we've tried many different approaches last year last year I thought we had a great approach we had\nA two waivers that we're requesting from the federal government ah to allow us to do that\nAnd the fans were behind that but the body over in the house would never get a majority vote they took a ...\nVote a ... said they held the bill for a while longer and\nThen they came back and took another vote at the end of the year and they just couldn't get it out of the house\nSo senators we never even really solve the bill or had a chance to vote on a map that was you know we've we've talked on the phone was the ha she has been a\nAnd Washington DC they've told us they told us time and time again you guys come up with a solution for Idaho and will be happy to to let you try so\nThere are a lot of solutions out there it's just so we haven't found warmed up the legislature ally to haul it was willing to put forth to the people or if there's a tremendous cost the Medicaid expansion and I think that's the that's the issue you're going to be a hundred million\nDollars of Idaho and and people just are not willing\nTo devote that much money\nTo to the issue they feel like there are clinics out here that people go to their doctors are trying to provide solutions their insurance companies are willing to work with folks are but we haven't found a solution that everybody is happy enough yet that saves crash crash or the legislature\nSo let me ask you a question me let's suppose or just fast forward a bit less opposed at this particular proposition number two passes with the majority vote from the voters in November um\nVoters refused to address that issue Wendy population is saying you guys got to do something\nWell we know they have the ... the devils I Will say the devil's in the details you know when they when they say yes and I think the majority of Idaho would say yeah let's do something or do I think it will pass I I just very confident that it will pass\nBecause most people want to see something done but then but then I'm going to say look at it from our perspective as the legislature what what are they really say we have a plan to we have a car is there enough money in the tail a\nI think there has to be several bills that are presented in the legislature that the legislature announced a pass to implement\nThe will of the people one would be the very first one will be it'll have to go they'll have to determine a cause\nOf that and they'll have to go before the jam packed committee the Finance Committee and when and that's the joy to Finance Committee looks at it and it's a hundred million dollars they'll say they'll vote no ... no we we're not going to find that so\nIt you know everywhere you look I made all that may come to help the welfare to maybe as a bill designed to expand Medicaid and that's happened before and like last year it may be held in the house or it may be held in the Senate\nSo as much as the any it's really easy to say yes let's expand Medicaid but the devil's in the details and I don't know what those details will be I don't know what that bill would look like I don't know whether you the Senate or the house in Idaho\nWhether they would agree to that bill uh I don't follow the J back would be willing to fund that bill so far the government\nHas never a governor would veto bill that we would stand you know that there are a lot of stopping blocks\nThat prevent that from happening even though that so people know I'm not saying we won't try our hardest to get something done because I think we really will and if there's a referendum by the people of Idaho every one of us would take that very very seriously and say look the people that we represent\nWould like to see the expand Medicaid and if they pass a bill and they say yes let's try to do that then we'll I think we will try our\nHardest to come up for the bill that works that's ah financially feasible that both bodies in the Senate and house would pass and that the governor would sign up so I think we'll try our hardest to get something done as fast so referendum that the people tell us like to see happen\nOkay Lee thank you very much we appreciate your time this morning and uh you have a great little to reach bite down there and drive safely Bush\nThe expanded Medicaid program and so we're once again flying vine here

[laughter] and the amount of time they expect me to do the work is way too long [laughter] well when you\nKnow they were sitting there talking to you you forget\nI'm you know one of the things that that that we face in state of Idaho is that the ongoing concern of education costs [noise]\nAnd and we have done extraordinarily well in the state of Idaho or over the past four years we have ... it included or increased the spending levels for education almost a hundred million dollars per year now that doesn't mean that\nIt's the same hundred that means we have a expanded it by an additional hundred million dollars\nTo things that are driving that well not to but I just want to mention to saying there is a growing\nUm\nEmphasis on the part of school teachers\nTo become a little bit more demanding\nIn there a compensation now we remember lots of conversation lasted a winter and early spring when several states had teacher walkouts as a result of a we're not getting paid enough\nAnd and Arizona was one that was a particular maybe because they were right you're close to home Oklahoma was a another one that we saw that um the schoolteachers in ah\nArizona a got a a Nineteen percent pay increase over three year period of time um Oklahoma schoolteachers got over six thousand dollars in pay raises\nThen when they went on strike ... right yeah\nBig numbers whether they also had difficulties in North Carolina Colorado in West Virginia and Kentucky and and Idaho's numbers for paying schoolteachers is not that\nMuch higher than ... states I just named mhm so how come we don't have that same difficulty in Idaho\nThat is a good question a part of the answer although not all of the answer but part of the answer is one of the things that I've\nRead little emphasizes when he talks about education in Idaho and he says okay we have increased our spending an education significantly and the last four or five years\nOr we have added a hundred million dollars a year and and we are in the process now of of uh our ... this this will be the fifth year or of the five year plan that uh butch otter put together that said wait a minute we're going to have to become more competitive and\nAs a result we've got to be more thoughtful about ah teachers and teacher compensation [noise] so we're going to the plan right now is uh we'll probably see another one hundred million dollar increase in spending for K. twelve education\nOr with in the upcoming a legislative a cycle\nI'm we spend a tremendous amount of money on on uh education in the state of Idaho [noise] as a percentage of our total budget ... not one are taught to state budget is um [noise] oh\nDear three point three or three point four billion dollars and and at the present time we are spending two points three billion of that\nApproximately sixty three percent of the general fund for education now forty eight percent of that goes to K. twelve [noise] the other then that's about one point eight billion dollars\nThe other five hundred million dollars\nEnds up going to what we call her higher education a bucket which is you know colleges junior colleges specialized training trade schools et cetera so we we we have increased our teacher salary a lot in the last five or six years\nUh last year they had to as three point six percent raise but we're still behind the rest of the ... the the states with regards to teacher salary now we think we're\nMaking pretty significant increases but those are percentage point increases there not absolutes and so we see it at a pretty healthy\nQuestion mark as to how much have we really increased a teacher spending now when we talk about a hundred million dollars of additional spending NBA education budget\nYes the the largest portion of the\nEducation budget is always going to be focused on teacher salaries so that's gonna be a you know we put a hundred million dollars in there I don't I cannot tell you how much of that is going to fall down to the teacher\nPay scale line that their career ladders and so forth but not every penny that is going to go to the teacher salary and we still have to\nFund these other uh\nEducation classroom school costs we have another caller with us this morning\nSo we'd like to take your calls thanks for checking in with his welcome to magic value this morning\nMorning gentlemen Steve you just hit the topic I was going to bring up as far as where the money was being allocated to um you know when you say we we've increased a hundred million dollars well that sounds like a I mean that\nIs a really big number five we have to look at where the hundred million dollars is going to and yeah you said it's going to feature salaries but what teachers that go on does that go on to the actual teachers is that actually going to administration is easily get on the state of Idaho a website you can see what every state employee makes in a first year starting our future I think we're a thirty five thousand dollars now\nWhile you're administrators are making well over a hundred thousand dollars\nThe lakes and at first year starting off teacher I think we're at thirty five thousand
