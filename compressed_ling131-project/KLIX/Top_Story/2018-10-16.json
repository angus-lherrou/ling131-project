they're often times when I'm asking questions and she might be some questions are the candidates are thinking how could they are not asking me about this because I think this is really important what what do you wanted to add that we've been we've never brought up here today\nWell\nI I think that Idaho is a really good shape because of our Republican leadership and the governor's chair lieutenant governor's chair and the legislature a good steward stewardship a tax dollars means a lot to me and I just think that that\nThat's part of the reason people are coming to Idaho is because we are responsible and\nOne of the things that concerns me about\nThe Medicaid expansion is that it will it will mean a ten point five million dollars out of the Idaho budget which could impact education and transportation and those those things that need lots of attention um\nI just hope that we can continue to be a solid open um creating legislation that works for everybody one of the things about the Medicaid expansion is that it's\nGonna it's very the way it's set up the the way it's set up now it will be very spending there's ten point five million dollars from the state and nearly five billion dollars from the federal government over the next ten years and I just think there's so many better ways there's that we could we could help\nTake care of Idaho's a health expenses one one that I feel that the Idaho ah\nIdaho ones are facing steep curves as far as paying premiums and health care expenses and there has to be some way to bring that into line they're they're basically I'm losing\nThe American dream you could say because of the huge risk that they take if they get sick and need and need help the cost of health care and the premium cost us a health insurance or just skyrocketing and we need to change that\nI was gonna say we referenced up proposition to or what your position on proposition one\nWell I I'm I'm I'm I'm not sure about proposition one I think that that I'm well I'm not totally\nIn favor of more um gambling machines here and there but you know that's just me my grandmother bless her heart she loved to go to the jackpot and play the machines and I would\nTake her and she had a blast and so I I'm kind of out of the frame that that um live and let live and I just I Know that\nThere are folks that are gambling that shouldn't be gambling and it's a it's an addiction for them and hopefully this will join us for that on\nWhich are like a lot of Idaho and we were kind of looking at this and ... as much as I look at it and say I have nothing against the tracks\nTo learn of Idaho ones are kind of looking at this in ... in my case I look at it and said I got nothing against the tracks being a\nProfitable I don't necessarily have any interest in going um but uh I guess are the arguments are nearing about who gets whatever from it seemed to me to almost be like to say this trivial um but that's me uh\nI Know a lot of people out there do have a huge stake in it one way or another but it seems the opposition they'd be funded by one particular special interest group in North Idaho\nYes I agree I and and uh so I think probably in the long run this all end up in the court said again and\nWe'll see how it how it shakes out I I just think that that it it we should protect the little guy that's trying to make it and not not have them be abused by greater powers\nWe've got about a minute to do anything else you wanted to add\n[noise]\nWell I Would say that that um I Love Idaho and I I'm a first generation Idaho and three sets of great great

news radio searching Ted Koppel with college\nSo I I I spend a lot of time uh I got to the point I have to say I'm this is what to do for a living in it to be in the middle of all of this discussion on\nWhenever the water cooler talk is are the big stories are but he's an ally is reaching near the end of the confirmation for Kavanaugh I felt like a deflated bowling I mean it was just exhausting\nAnd a nice mini vacation that followed that as well but it just there's got to be a serious question\nOh but it's just ... days it got to be a serious question here how you can ever first of all you gotta have respect for the judicial system and you've got people now and if they're hammering the high court it's going to have\nA ripple effect down through the local level and I don't know how you're going to put the genie back in the bottle on this one\n\nWell are ... are you talking about specifically about court issues or\nJust general public perception\nWith regard to court issues I mean it the court talk is getting all consumed and you know combined with the political talk I mean you have this this moron who's running for Congress in New York um the lady whose name I Can't remember if a lot of ... and it\nUh and and she was on\nAh the other day saying that what we're going to do what we are going to do the the the Republican or the Democrats when we get the house we're gonna we're gonna impeach we're going to a we're going to impeach cabin uh\nOr going to not confirm any more you know or judges that are put up at any level by by a\nTrump although she misunderstand as she often does that the house doesn't do any confirmation of judge is um and then she said we're going to pack the court are\nAnd we're going to pack the court with you know liberal justices and so yeah those kind of those kinds of things if they're picked up by mainstream Democrats\nAre really scary things because um if\nWhichever party is in power just decides you know we don't like the nine justices we have on the court so we're just going to arbitrarily make the court and Eighteen member court and we're going to put nine conservatives on or nine liberals on there and so the whole thing will be a entirely based on\nA who is in office at any given time I mean since you know I I don't remember when they added the ninth justice spent a long time ago or six young I Do rag the other day and so Eighteen sixty nine and of course President Roosevelt or Franklin Roosevelt tried\nUm a notoriously to pack\nThe court with extra people because there's nothing in the constitution tells you how many people are on the court so if you come into office as a president and you look at the court and you keep losing things six to three or five to four and you say\nIf I only have five more you know conservative justices on their boat we'd win everything and you just to point five new ones are that\nThat problem will get worse and worse and worse once you start doing things like that and I think we've seen some of that already I mean when when Harry Reid got rid of the requirement that there'd be a super majority to ah\nApprove federal judges obviously that came back to bite him and perhaps even the country when Trump started nominating his Supreme Court justices so now we are getting\nThe nomination process and the confirmation process for judges is at fifty one percent deal um if I can ram my guy through even if he's hated by forty nine percent of the country\nI can do it if I've got fifty one percent and that is over time going to lead to a court that is as divided if as the population is\nHold that thought we've got a caller with us in color you're up next did nine forty six on K. L. I. X. with prosecuting attorney grant loves\nWell we're new called her a moron I agree I don't want to sound a little abrasive to agree with that but I think that they the people who have looked at her\nShe's not alegria but and and again I\nYeah yeah that's what I meant yeah they voted for excuse me I didn't mean to say that but my point is when you have\n... I was so worried because I'm surrounded by people who are who are in ... or ... or distracted or whatever it is but they know nothing and they listen\nTo that rhetoric and they don't even know that it's complete it's ... it's completely wrong\nAnd and and just like last night on HBO there was some sort\nOf election talk going on was a forum and some of those people don't even know nothing and I said it myself you know when we have a land a\nGovernment that people by the people for the people that people have that no matter what you see where do you find your news where do you find your truth are you able to discern\nWhat your information is truth or not you delve into it to make sure you know no we get here to first words out of somebody's mouth and then we start spreading the word or whatever it is we're doing all hang up\nOr you know he brings up a point or when you've got these people the rhetoric is they they want to pack the court they want to eliminate the electro college uh they want to start to proportionally I guess electing senators or eliminate the Senate altogether I guess as if you've got to parliament\nAh well eliminated electoral college I don't know what you do a senator sets a it's a weird thing because the Senate is designed in the same way the electoral college is to give a\nYou know a different mix two states that have more people are excuse me the houses the Senate is gives every\nState one won a equal vote to two senators and so I don't know what you do when you start saying we we should just you know popular vote should win does does that mean that Idaho doesn't get two senators 'cause we don't have you know or\nYou know one fiftieth of this say in the population a so you'd have to start looking at the whole system built by the founders if you eliminate the electoral college then you'd have to really address the power that the Senate has um and you saw this discussion during the Kavanaugh hearings you saw\nSeveral commentator say well this just isn't fair you know look what look what's happening or because of the Senate is the one that is voting not the house which is population based uh we are now putting a person on the Supreme Court\nWho is supported by less than fifty percent\nOf the country that you know counting by senators are and so okay that's true because that's the way it works especially now that you know Harry Reid got rid of you know the the super majority for approval so if we want to address that", "show_name": "Top Story", "year": "2018", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "16"}
