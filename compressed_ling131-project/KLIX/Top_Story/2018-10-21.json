twenty hey one of the biggest upsets the produce took down number to Ohio State shaking things up in his seat s\nP maybe it's chaos I don't know but this is how it all came to it and take a listen I\nTo hear her off saying\nWhat what kind of a cold was that three two one I mean come on real\nYou're talking about retiring the enemy and where you win yeah I'd rather Richmond, Indiana\nAnd they're all in college and I call I'll tell you right now All right so we want to\nGo quite there but yeah I'm In Ohio State what happened we know what what the deal was going in with their defense has been very suspect very much a one dimensional off ants Twain Haskins has been phenomenal and he was great last night but they can't run the ball very well and they can't play good defense and to get shut lacked\nLike that by ... do you got to look at the rest of the scheduling deferments and all of a sudden last regular season game of the year hosting Michigan the fighting ... look out now but I'm losing that first game against Notre Dame they might run the table\nRight and that's going to be a heck of a sort of very impressive last right now as we look at it looks don't you think keeps on when he was go back to Twain asked us for a second the quarterback as Ohio State university whom people were saying is the highest my candidate I look at the stats last night\nThis guy threw the ball I mean you must be icing on his arm today Seventy three attempts or you're hitting me they can't run the freaking football forty nine for Seventy three feet of water the Seventy yards\nBut I mean you must be icing on his arm today Seventy three attempts hitting me they can't run the freaking football forty nine for Seventy three for the Seventy yards you cannot ... I don't care college\nPro semi pro women's football you can't win when you thought about Seventy three times you had to have some sort of an odd sense of balance and they couldn't get it if they couldn't get it passed the red zone they couldn't get into the hands of they were like allergic to it is all field goals whatever it may be they couldn't score\nAnd they gave us five hundred and thirty nine yards\nWell and that's the thing is they're not trailing by Ford touched down the entire game you know I get that at the end you got an air it out near trailing by a lot of points but that wasn't the story line the whole game and when you're down even Twenty one to six\nIf you ever running game that would help balance out your bad defense is keep your bad defense off the field you know\nSo they're not able to run the ball effectively and that hurts them it hurt him big time last night and it could hurt him going forward and you also have to throw out there the loss of Nick ... because that hurts the defense\nBig time as well as he leaves and he's getting ready for the NFL but you know what you can't pin this on him leaving because he wouldn't have been healthy enough to play in the game anyway\n... and I can't imagine that it's just the morale was so down because Nick both the left I think we're going into movie trailer mode if we go into that\nArea or a week that's what we see as a crutch that really is I by the way I have no problem whatsoever what with those is doing you know because every college coach is out for himself they using people that show up and spit them out so look you know what good for him he's hurt he could come back\nMaybe later in the end maybe possibly get hurt against do stay on the sidelines get the big bucks in the NFL and you'll probably be in the first five picks up the other trapped in April so good for him I have no problem I've heard people say that he's a he's a he hurt his team is that a team made is I Love hey Tim and look at the coaches look all coaches do\nWell I get it but I see it slightly differently where why don't you go back\nWhy don't you get healthy why don't you train while at Ohio State going to be doing all of those things on your own time now so you could still do it at Ohio State and if Ohio State is out of contention for the college football playoff which they very well may be at the end of the season then you say hey I'm getting ready for the NFL\nBut why not at least give yourself a chance to come back\nIf you're in the college football playoff and before he left we didn't know that they wouldn't be there right in my line changes right now why would you pull the plug early on and say I am out of here no questions asked I Would have at least stay there\nThen the center consigned

or whatever it may be that is the lowest form of life you could ever do this but the guy's face that he lied said he did do a book Chris Paul was wiping the spin off his face if they try to punch them

that's when you get blessed with the hands as well so I can understand like ball players were ticked off the one thing I don't understand is\nWhy Brandon Ingram pushed James Harden and the first place I don't understand there was a complete overreaction but yeah you can be frustrated but you don't go like shoving people and get tossed in the process so it was just melt down by Brandon Ingram well\nThe good news is I mean if people are LeBron haters out there and there are plenty of those uh this takes away from the old one to record the Lakers have at this point in time because they're

take them a little while to jail and Andy trust me I don't want to do a whole thing on the Amy Schumer deal and the stuff and all of this but I just want to say this 'cause Sammy K brought this up in

until you Neil you're not supporting the goal right are you just ... right now\nLike I really think about that and the like how many black players in the NFL have not taken a neat does that mean that they're against being treated better in this country of\nSo why does not want to Ask Amy Schumer that question say any you know if they're not nearly does that mean they're not supportive I mean ask some investigative report or someone on on those news talk entertainment shows entertainment tonight ask her that question instead of the gods ... question asked writer you know effort which\nHe has to pay ... I could care less I yeah ... it's a dodge and idiotic take Claritin like unless you Neal you are not supporting the end of racial injustice really right\nI don't see the logic in that maybe that are completely wrong maybe that's what it is\nWell I'll tell you oh I Am supporting my guy Jim harbor I like Jim how he got a lot of heat and all of a sudden he needed when yesterday against Michigan stay

and play Ohio State so you know what\nThis opening day last Notre Dame looks better every single week there's no today's undefeated and Jim how about right now late it on Michigan State yesterday Twenty one of the seven I'm happy to hear by the way it wasn't a game with a lot of points but it felt like Michigan was in control most of the way\nThis is what it sounded like well Michigan jumped ahead in the third quarter to take a listen\nPatterson football factory crow crow throwing they found the right side\n\nHave you on that Seventy one will hit a hard time saying Michigan\nTouchdown man Who Forgot it sounded like [laughter]\nI'm by the way though Andy how about this in terms of total yard itch Michigan gave up Ninety four yards to Michigan State Ninety four yards that that is great the fence and Michigan state's off ants\nUK Ninety four yards you could literally gain that in one drive and they gain that for the game that the beat down right there\nWell this is not a good Michigan State team I Know and they're held to Ninety four years but also in Michigan State didn't\nAgain that for the game that the beat down right there\nMan well this is not a good Michigan State team I Know and they're held to Ninety for us but also in Michigan State did not have a convert any of the twelve third downs they had all day yesterday this is not a good Michigan State team and I I tell you what I'm losing any sleep over it because I think what happened\nLast year what what happened with those players that as an amazing to me that marked Antonio is still there as coach didn't they get rid of the president the president's gone the athletic director is gone but he remains that to me is amazing but that's a story for another day\nYeah yeah it is I just want to hear that final call again Andy for him and listen to me again with the wind [noise]\n[laughter] [noise] it's it doesn't sound as bad when you isolated it's just when you hear the whole call but I'll say this Andy\nI don't want to overreact the other way when it comes to a gym Harbaugh\nAnd what I mean by that is sometimes our opinions are more of a reaction\nThan an opinion because Jim horrible has been getting crushed for losing too many games based on what his contract what he earns all of the things he just hasn't had the success there at\nAt Michigan has fared well against Ohio State we know that he's had a couple of big losses against Michigan State yadda yadda so I don't want to then all of a sudden with Jim horrible rattling off seven straight wins and writing the ship I don't want to make it sound like oh look at Jim\nThis is what Jim horrible was paid to do he's supposed to take down teams like Michigan State\nSo I don't think that we should go above and beyond that just because some of the critics have gone above and beyond nailing him when they have in fair to well you know what I'm saying\nYou said something very interesting because I pick up on every word you say because it's worth listening to that is by God gave me two years in one mouth because I listen you said that he's getting a lot of heat yes he is because of the money has been paid in the contract has\nI agreed to some extent but are you telling me that if he got paid less money or some other ... was coaching Michigan not well not a big name my car by making less money will not get that\nHeat I disagree I think Michigan has that history of football and it's supposed to be Michigan State which is a an arch rival\nOf theirs so it doesn't make a difference how much money he's making maybe the more money well if you make a lot more money look look at the we talk about that with the group situation ... absolutely right I mean but he's not getting the heat that heart pies getting me because he hasn't been there

and\nIn Fifteen minutes you could say fifty percent of moral car insurance be like that were rolling right now Panthers eagles today Orientals playoff bound perhaps relay are we're going\nTo be in this business was lost to the Redskins twenty three Seventy the eagles beat the giants beat him up badly thirty four team at both these teams beat the giants and I got the alliance for you right now are you ready Carolina Philadelphia Philadelphia given up five minus five\nYeah and you know what's funny is everybody freaked out about it and the eagles team the defending\nSuper Bowl champs collaborating the terrible giants who cares that's what they're supposed to do like we were just talking about horrible\nNot throwing rose petals at his feet for beating Michigan State which is what he's supposed to do why would we throw rose petals at the feet of cars and when's Doug Peterson in company but the eagles show lacking the terrible giants last week why\nBecause he lives with Andy that's fans do in Philadelphia that's hey look if you get a a fan in Philadelphia after winning the super bowl to eat\nA horse manure still do anything and I saw that on TV right they were going crazy after the super bowl so that's what fans do and that's your sports great in a sense in a sense it does\nIf they smack around the Panthers today which I I don't think they smack him around maybe they win this game\nBut if they words when by three touchdowns that's something you point to and say hey\nAll of a sudden Philly they look like they've right at the ship that would make more sense to me and what they did last week against the giants team come on I Know it's uh divisional opponent I get all of that\nBut to beat up the giants and to get the better of their off into blind and make the light look old that's what everybody's been doing okay so we should all of a sudden just by in completely that the eagles have figured it out because they smacked around the giants last week if they do it today that's going to make a big difference\nI tell you what I couldn't agree more because everybody's beating up on the giants was not a big accomplishment but at least they won and that's a step in the right direction for the eagles but last week in Newton was I\nGuess you could say someone on fire was twenty seven forty two hundred and Seventy five yards two touchdowns he rushed to forty three yards but here's the the funny thing if you look past the initial stats of twenty seventh of forty two Seventy five he only had six twenty yards per pass attempt\nSo basically what they do how do they get back to the playoffs I mean the eagles I don't know but\nHe only had six twenty yards per pass attempt so basically what they do how do they get back to the playoffs I mean the eagles I don't know but as far as the Panthers a concern as McCaffrey and that's their office right now and they run the ball maybe about fifty fifty percent of the time they gotta stop McCaffrey the eagles do and\nNewton maybe doing his legs and Newton's arms can the eagles do that I think they can at home I really do\nWell I mean look I think it's a little bit more than just that\nBecause you get ... back he's a good tight and so he's going to get a handful of targets today and ... I mean I'm not going to say he's an upper echelon wide receiver but he's at least capable\nRight he's a ... candle making some noise on any given Sunday so I think it's more than just Cam Newton and Christian McCaffrey granted those guys are the bulk of the ... I don't think it's the entire often but you go against the number two rushing defense in football that's what's Philly has they give up about\nEighty yards per game so if they're able to slow down a Carolina off and that average is five yards per Kerry and put it all in the hands of Cam Newton that's going to be tough if you make any off one dimensional with Phillies pass rush\nAnd that theme is throwing the ball and that's the only way they can gain yards man that's a tough tough team to beat in the eagles have one Thirteen of their past Fifteen at home as well\nYou know and me I I look at this game I\nI I think the over under was like forty four forty five points I don't think they're going to score the others could be a low scoring game for some reason maybe I just with the defense on the on the Russian side of the ball with Philadelphia and maybe weather conditions which I don't know right now but I Know on the east coast is kinda damp and it could be wet\nSo I think they're not going to pass the ball as much as they would so I I don't think that over on the line I think it's going to be way under that I really do I need to be a low scoring game\nYou might be right might be it's tricky when you get forty five he started thinking about this it's a twenty four Twenty one ball game you know right that's not high scoring\nSo in today's NFL if if you're trying to get under forty five you don't have to have a team scored like thirty eight points to have a chance\nForty five is relatively right in the middle in terms of an NFL total so we'll see that Philly off and they looked a lot better last week against the giants and again\nIt was the giants [laughter] so I Want to see what they do against the Carolina Panthers today because that Carolina Panthers defense they can make you one dimensional as well when they slow down you're running game so we'll see if Carson ... who seems to be regaining his his form from last year\nIf he keeps going in that direction that's not an easy often to slow down either even though it's musical running backs at this point\nAnother quote the great Brian no because I remember a lot of the things they say most of the things that you say this is a tremendous gain more so for the eagles and the panther should they lose today they didn't do what you will always tell me a lot of teams do they get real tight\nYeah real type because there'll be three and four and then they'll be looking like they have to when they have to win and an end to the press will be on building the pressure that they receive from the media will be unbelievable that\nThat you'd be right that they may not be headed back to the playoffs as a Super Bowl returning team that you know they'll just be out of it now next week they go to London\nOf all places jak civil dental by and then it doesn't get an easy because they've got Dallas New York then they've got a little bit of a respite with the giants again so this is a tremendous game for them but really is more so than Carolina they lose today they may have to pack it in I hate to say that and you'll be right they lose today I think it's over\nThere's no doubt about that now I Know your dolphins fan I Want you to speak with your head now with your heart as I said this game I kind of like the lions and they're close ones but I like the lions I just think that they have too many weapons and I I don't trust below under censor at a rally\nUp [laughter] yeah well you might not have to trust them that could be the good news is the Detroit running defense is so bad\nYou might get a heavy dose Frank Gore and Kenyans rape today and take a lot of that pressure off of old pianos plate you know so I\nI agree with you I think that the lions probably come in after a by I think they probably get a road when I I don't love it I Love the over more than anything more than picking the game I think there's going to be a lot of points scored today I Would take the over forty six and a half\nI Love taking the over in these gains in the heat Andy because you just see the fences we'll look at the bears when they're trying to tackle ... Wilson last week\nSo amazing and you saw the Kenyans Reich fumble at the goal line that the bears recovered a Keim Hicks on the sideline big defensive lineman he was doubled over he's just like\nI Can't win meant it is a good way to\nDo that again\nThat was a key mixed on the sideline it's hard to play good defense in heat like that so I Would say the over in this one more than ... when he mentioned that\nBecause we first start discussing this game you talk about maybe Detroit going from a dome it to the elements of people assume elements is rain when snow or whatever it may be heat but remember also and I got to believe that players of players and like Miami has to handle those elements to even though they are the home team\nThey have to play in the heat I mean ... there's going to be easier for them because they're they're they're defensive lineman after playing that eat as well so we'll see if they wilt right\nYeah there are a little bit more used to it obviously there are a lot more used to it but that doesn't mean it's easy so even if you're used to it it's it's not a walk in the park so yeah that Detroit often and especially think about this past rushing if it's passed\nHeavy and you're having great success and you're able to keep Matthew Stafford clean and it's tough to to not wields if you're constantly trying to rush the pastor or play pass the fence what have you ... it's just really tough to play good defense in the heat\nBryant no Andy firmly colas ... suddenly and by the way for free weather's daily go to Vegas covers dot com that Vegas covers\nDot com now one of your hosts has something in common with the Arizona Cardinals will tell you all about it and bought a barrel betting which is ... a barrel bathing and it's very good next\nWhat's the story of this story is we have opinions on the line who think they think ...
