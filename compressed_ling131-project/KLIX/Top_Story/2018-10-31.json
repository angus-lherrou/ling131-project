it's a a light environment we take the medicines seriously but everything else in my opinion should be a little more light hearted and a lot more fun so it's not your typical doctor's office that is a cold sterile or\nAll business uh we do plenty of business but it's a we try to at least be a little bit light about what's going on and in spite of some you know pain suffering and illness\nUm so our office you can reach us by phone at two all eight nine three three forty four hundred that's to await nine three three four four zero zero and you can check us out on the Web at a trip family medicine dot com lot of good information there prior pod casts a\nLots of information about what we do even with cosmetics and uh we should talk about scary spider veins but our continue you can also reach us on trip family medicine at\nFacebook at your family medicine so those are probably the three main ways that contact us we're on a film or street across from the post office and desert industries and uh we are growing like crazy so you know ... ... please feel free to come and be part of that practice\nI remember reading a a comic book when I was a kid and uh there was a series of comic books called Boris Carl off comics of all thanks to okay and uh and it was as if bars Carl offers they're reading the story but it was in print and there was one episode where a fellow ah is scared to death literally scared to elementary and we we\nWe we've we've heard that phrase I think a lot I was scared to death but is it possible for someone to be scared to death\nUm unlikely or ice I suppose if you had a heart condition that it just pushed over the edge to heart arrhythmia that's a possibility but\nFor most people if you get so scared that you're having a full blown paying that panic attack\nYou'll hyper ventilate to the point to where you actually pass out are faint as the other word and then when you wake up everything has reset and you're fine you know as long as you don't hit your head on the way down usually won't die I can I can see a heart attack doing it though\nBut that's that there is also the fighter flight reaction I was some friends of mine owned at camp out in the woods or you know a few miles out of town when I was a young man and they said oh we're having a big picnic and party there\nOr why don't you come out and so I drove up to this bat\nWrote you know and it's there's no lighting around other than the natural sky and I saw long driveway and I thought well I'm not so sure I Want to drive cars you know if that's what it or not yeah so I parked the car along the the main road which was dirt but I parked along the main road and I started walking down the driveway and her rustling\nIn some of the leaves in in to my right probably a deer and it was more afraid than I was but I turned\nOn her the wrestling instead of like running idle lead over a ditch and yelled and I ended up standing and some shrubs [laughter] and then not whenever I had been there was gone and then I ended up walking down to the\nTo the camp in the yellow as to terrify whatever your attacker\nRight and this was thought I'd a planned it just happened you know that it has to be that way\nLet me kind of have to use that to springboard or you know the fight or flight response is really interesting because you know it's what saved our ancestors from real life or\nYou know threats life and death threats um the uh\nYou know you think of the ancestors who or what would you use the term today chill during you know an attack of pain is or something like that\nThey probably didn't live long enough to pass on their genes very much so yeah this is deep in us and starts with a a part\nOf the brain called the amygdala that just says this is bad you know whether it's scary or whether it's life threatening and so you really have to mean responses and that is run or fight [noise] and it sounds like that day you were ready to fight\nLife threatening and so you really have to mean responses and that is run or fight [noise] and it sounds like that that you're ready to fight or at least threatened you know to fight and then run and uh\nThere's some fun things about being a not as big a guy as you know my kids are I learned the idea of you know renting works you know you can fight but what's that about something about live to fight another day you know\nI'm here learns to run away all their lives to fight another day something like that I'm not that I ever would have gotten into a fight I'm too mild mannered\nIt's not as a wife um so anyway the adrenaline and it pumped into our drugs bloodstream that's what's going on with fight or flight it's mainly about adrenaline and it causes budget shifted larger muscles for fighting or running away the ending increases your heart rate uh which increases that blood flow to the muscles\nFor their uh because they have now increased metabolic needs they gotta they gotta use more oxygen worse glucose things like that but it also decreases the blood supply to non essential organs especially like the GI tracking the kidneys\nAnd so people that have chronic adrenaline\nGoing into their system because they're always anxious tend to get Tommy troubles and so if we treat the anxiety or the fear\nWhether it's real or not even tell me tends to get better that's a sideline but\nFor the fight or flight response yeah you know you don't need to digest right now you need to get out and live and run and fight or whatever so that's the fight or flight response that what's different between that and what people like about being scared as they feel to things they they are in this fear mode\nBut they've done it in a what's reasonably safe environment you know like the haunted house are sitting at the movie theater or telling ghost stories around a campfire his rise we used to take a carnivals where you go through that\nAnd and get scared I mean think about the uh [noise] uh right now we've got a big or corn means across from the hospital and they have a huge set of you know polls with a a basically a a bungee type apparatus\nThat has a a capsule that you sit in and it catapults you up and bounces back and forth and ah you know what's the fear that while\nBeing thrown into the air is inducing your fight or flight response or during this relatively safe mode I mean yes it could break down and that makes it even more fun 'cause it could go bad\nBut pretty much got multiple safety precautions that that ride is not going to kill you and so\nYou're frontal lobe says okay we're we're in a pretty

is not also not only just a\nA running for office but he has a background in economics and during one of the debates on this issue I Believe\nOther subject came up in the past and uh just recent past and I think that his view is we we probably have too many doctors and lawyers in Washington I'm paraphrasing not necessarily quoting at a but first of all of us just once You're welcome to our ...\nThank you very much bill\nAs it were just having a bit of a conversation off air about a year economics background and you're kind of pointing out the your two schools of thought that have been dominant in Washington for about eight decades and you feel that we have to have a new approach in government and you'd like to be their voice\n[laughter] yes absolutely there um you know there are two basic approaches one that the Democrats take the one that Republicans take and on just an economic philosophical level um both of those approaches are wrong\nAnd so I think if you bring a new approach I'm a new understanding of macroeconomic ah you can actually kind of bridge that divide and put something in place that will work and and created an economy that's not reliant on the federal government but it's actually the engine\nAnd the foundation for for doing better things in our society\nWe should we should point out that the Keynesian view which is I think then the the most dominant model in the west or well since the great depression and that is that you prime the pump even among Republicans many of them have at least adopted some of that and you feel that that may not necessarily be a the best approach than going forward\n[noise] yeah so that Keynesian approach um suggests that the government does two things\nFirst printing money and lower the interest rates by doing that and the second thing is run a government or a budget deficit I'm\nHaving a government spending money that it doesn't have either of those is the state level and actually printing money you know causes us more problems down the road in might stick things in the short term a bit further down the road it gives us a lot of problems and so we've got to get away from that approach\nWhen when

air with us because\nOur six days away from election day and he is challenging Mike Simpson or mushers the Democrat and he would like to unseat a twenty year veteran of the house of representatives of data dimension to generate a busy schedule\nThis morning and here's an appointment of turn the clock but within the next few minutes um I asked him if he could give us an elevated elevator speech extended elevator speech people know the reference\nSuch but we've got a bit more time than that if you could help people exactly while you're doing this while you want to do this and they do what your vision would be you could you to be the guy getting under the hood during the tinkering and fixing this government uh how do you how to hit the ground running I've done all the metaphors mix metaphors now go ahead\n[laughter] yeah I I'm a husband and a father I've got a two and a half year old son and\nA second child on the way I Want to make sure when they grow up they have an economy that is fair and rewards them for the work that they put forward if that's a lot of effort a lot of reward not much effort not much reward but it's got to be fair I Want them to have\nAn environment that is queen where they have clean air clean water and I don't want to be settling my son and his generation with trillions of dollars of national debt so the big three issues for me or fair economy clean environment and and getting rid of ours\nAnd doing regulation in an efficient manner um typically through the tax system not through like some large bureaucracy a with a bunch of regulation\nIt's a new approach to economics and I think that's the key I'm not coming in as a Democrat saying the Democrat ways better in the Republican ways bad I'm coming at this from a new angle where I can sit down with both sides give them credit for the things they've done right criticized him for the things they've done wrong\nAnd work with both sides to get something done in Washington\nI read a couple of weeks ago a story and at first I was a little ticked off because they thought Mitch\nMcConnell's supposedly it said that the Republicans were looking because Social Security benefits and [noise]\nAnd then I at the more I learned about it the next few days when he was saying is it's almost impossible to get any reform done on programs\nAre ... and these are going to be true budget busters and years to come out because he said we got split government and nobody really wants to make the hard decisions and I think as a reference to split government as an expectation that the house is going to flip to the to the Democrats obviously\nAnd and and I heard that and I thought you know this is the this is a real issue for this country is in another Fifteen Years just three programs good entirely eat up the budget so do we have to ask people to pay more in taxes are going to tell people sorry it's no longer available\nYeah yeah\nYou know I I Am of the approach ... and I said\nThis in the book if you want to balance the budget you really have for options you can cut Medicare and Medicaid you can raise taxes you can cut defense spending or or you can do a combination of those and really the combination is the best way to go because if you try and do it\nWith any of those things individually you're going to destroy you know our healthcare system um and our economy\nYou're going to destroy the military um if you raise taxes that much you're going to destroy the economy and our incentives so you really need a combination of things and that's where my expertise really comes into play I Know places where we can raise taxes\nAnd actually improve\nThe economy um instead of destroying it but you gotta understand economics I'm In order to do that um and that's the expertise that I bring that table we do have\nTo reduce our Medicare and Medicaid um expenditures in my mind we go to a single payer system and how bin that cost curve down um\nWe have to reform Social Security I think you do that separate from the whole budget a situation you know that was the Ronald Reagan approach\nUm and that's kind of the way I look at it you look at that system as a separate system from the rest of the budget um you know we need to make our military expenditures more efficient I put that in the book as well and like I said you know I think I can raise revenue in ways that aren't going to hurt the economy\nBut when you went from single payer system we only got about Ninety sections to go and bending the cost\nPer don't look I remember the stories that I read about uh the creation of a Medicaid and Medicare or at least would go down to control costs and it clearly wasn't the case and and so you know it sounds great to look at it in theory but it doesn't tend to work that way [noise]\nYeah yeah well I think any time you're going to do a partial sex or the way the Medicare and Medicaid or did you're not going to get that cost control and you've got the same thing with the Affordable CARE Act um\nIt just wasn't comprehensive enough to control costs the way I'm\nThat they should be and you know the Republicans did a Medicare part D expansion back in two thousand three right or they cut it\nYou wrote prices the way that all major insurers do they for bad in that bill um you know in our kids are paying the cost of that\nTo shake [laughter] before we let you go one more time or just let people know how to find you on the Web and do a little bit about where they can find a book\nYes a or website is it ... for Idaho dot com and

yesterday you heard that clip from Hillary Clinton [noise] uh you know common in just a little flecks all look alike when there was some confusion front of the question or between Cory Booker and uh\n... no I don't think they look anything like it either I think they're called her looks like a slightly darker version of a Thomas the Dewey [noise] first got a little bit of a looked like Warren Moon where a\nBook or has an entirely different look especially that shape Ted that's become a style that's been with us for Thirty years that's a very long\nStanding style so Clinton a comment that they all look alike now I suppose you know it was considered a joke and I don't know that she was trying to be racist\nBut if a Republican said that you know what would happen number to Joe Donnelly who's the Democrat running for reelection to the U.S Senate in Indiana was asked a question about the diversity\nSo he decided to talk about his staff and uh he mentioned that he's got a guy on staff who works for him\nHe mentioned that he's got a guy on staff who works for him was Indian American that is the guy's family came here from India and then said but he does a good job he didn't say and he does a good job ... body does Goodrich\nAnd I think you made the same slip when he mentioned he's got somebody out of his staff where we said was African American\nSo in other words well yeah there are minorities but you know they do a good job as if they wouldn't be a you know you wouldn't expect them to do it and now he didn't mean that\n... buddy again for Republicans said that can you imagine\nThere'd be out with a hammer or something that was all ready for the crucifixion media would be ready to pounce in that situation\nComing up on nine forty four collie with you until ten am a magic value this morning a telephone number to reach the program to zero eight seven three six zero three hundred to zero eight seven three six zero three hundred I think a lecture in day is going to surprise the few people\nAre up until maybe just the last couple of days I was buying into the fact that Democrats would take the house obviously not the Senate but that they would take the house of representatives but the development was what\nThe president has done when it comes to talking about birthright citizenship you can call it what you want\nBut the president he's playing my friends the other side because they have to take a stand on this now and when they simply said oh well can do that unconstitutional mean spirited whatever they're going to say about it\nA lot of voters out there don't see it that way and it's not as simple as saying well it's in the constitution no ah we played this earlier if you weren't with us Jonathan Turley is a professor of constitutional law at George Washington University in in Washington now he appears on several networks not\nJust Fox News channel but this is from our affiliates the Fox news channel this is Charlie speaking on TV\nLast night on Fox and remember he's a Democrat\nBut he said the president might be on to something\nYou know we're about a hundred and fifty years later and finding out what this amendment means there hasn't been a debate since this was first ratified all of this debate turns on the six rather ill chosen words as to what is it wasn't meant\nBy being subject to the jurisdiction of the United states some of the draft or is that the time clearly evidence to believe that non citizens that come to this country whether they're diplomats\nAre undocumented would not have immediate citizenship for their children and so there is a good debate here there are three different types of interpretation that have been put forward I\nCan't imagine how people can say with such certainty that this language means that anyone in the United states for any reason um can have a citizen or when they give birth on\nOur soil I that's not the evidence from the text of the amendment\nMany people at the time clearly didn't hold that few now it's not a eh that's not a frivolous view there is in good faith arguments on both sides but the Supreme Court has never said with any clarity or finality what it means they only I\nThink that that's what that's what kind of move that forward Ken uprising dealt with an executive order to make that change [noise]\nThan I think is more doubtful I I think Lindsey Graham is right that the best way to go about this as with legislation\nBut you see you got the ball rolling president may know instead of an executive order will stand\nBut you get the ball rolling and then you try to get some legislation and you get the public clamoring if this turns around the election in the house and you get Republican control maintained eventually this is going to make is where the courts then and then the court can have a definitive answer for release\nThen a definitive answer from the court defining birthright citizenship\nThinking about that for a moment and people say that Donald Trump doesn't have the skill to do this seems to me that he continues to run circles around the media and the left Lindsey Graham appearing on Fox is well last night with Sean Hannity he was talking about\nTwo things that have come up that have definitely definitely given a big push to Republicans ... election day six days from now\nIf you're a Republican and you're not excited about voting here
