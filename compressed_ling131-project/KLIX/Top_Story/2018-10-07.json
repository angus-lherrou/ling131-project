I\nDon't go here as just the actual fight was a bit enough the real story is what happened afterwards which oh\nAnd when I was just take a listen tennis match\nOh no no no\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWell you know hands [laughter] [noise]\n\nAll hell breaks loose last night I tell you what it is a scam it just sham it's a fake it's ... it's you know they do for PR maybe look and they should have known and you know this they should have known this was going to happen\nTo this was bad blood between the two that was building since last April when kinda McGregor when all the way from Ireland to confront could be doing that media day the Barkley said that when the girl that Dolly from the bus\nAnd he was on a pastor on the bus it was it was ugly is just you you don't want to see stuff like that in the world of sports\nI I just don't see it the same way I Am and I get it from us these point of view the commentators immediately were like this is not professional this is not the image that we want to portray I get all that because they don't want that to be a common theme and other fights going forward but just as a fan\nJust to sit on the couch that was entertaining [laughter] the fight and next thing we know\nCould be but it's just going airborne over the octagon wall diving after a guy one of his are members of the crew complete cheap shot jumps over the wall in his car McGregor in the back of the head total ...\nIt but I'll tell you what ... you can say it's disgusting and you can say it's the ...\nTerm Joanna Dowling by the bike and we've seen crazy stuff left and right but just pure entertainment value I'd be lying to you by that I wasn't entertained by it\nWell I'm going to go one step further you know what I'm going to meet you halfway in that squared circle right now we do but at the payment I'll give you an example ... let's go back to the Yankee game against the athletics the other night when the Yankees won in some clown was wearing an athletic shirts and hats\nAnd the stadium in New York City\nAnd he got drenched would be a yeah I watched on TV I left there was at the tanning causes disgusting yes what I Want to be there no ... but there are certain things that I could laugh that but there was a clown move all was a stupid move to discuss the move just like the thing last night at the UFC it doesn't do any good for the UFC sports it does not do any good whatsoever\nI disagree also\nLike to think that does does no good whatsoever when we're leading off our show with it [laughter] this is the fight game this isn't like\nYou know a try outs for the convent you know this isn't like that this is the U.S the crazy stuff happen it's just hilarious to me how some people could look at the economy McGregor throwing water bottles and an opponent in a press conference setting\nAnd look at that and be like oh man that was the odds and then turn around and get on their high horse this\nWhich could be was just flat out scotch big an outrageous that I just since the showerheads are flapping up and down it's like if it's leading up his show it's not all bad for the psyche game of all things\nShows and and this is very similar to newscast as well anything that's out of the ordinary usually takes priority and\nThis was certainly out of the ordinary yeah we can talk about the college football games and we will we could talk about the NFL and we will but it's certainly just like a newscast on local news if you have eight houses in a subdivision and the one house is burning that's the house is going to lead on the news this something that's unusual\nIf you have eight houses in a subdivision and the one house is burning that's the house is going to lead on the news this something that's unusual and this was very very unusual yeah\nRight and it's being talked about and it's being focused on\nAnd that's not all bad for us to see if you think that last night won't help sell the next fight we get a rematch between ... you're crazy so to sit here and say there's no good that can come from that spectacle and that's disgusting display and it's not true\nYou know what they will sell tickets they will have a rematch it'll happen again I'm not surprised that happened but you know what it's it's a stain on the sports to me I'm not approved\nYou know I I thought I was there I I'd say wow I brag about that I yeah I was there in person I

discover card we treat you like you treat you now here's the stage for my partner my partner Brian no from the great state of Indiana\nA big Notre Dame fan and we're going to put the spotlight of them right now I watch the game last night halftime you know if you know did they offend you kind of pie you know it's a little bit\nSeventeen sixteen that they have over no today but I watched that defense I mean really interests smothering I've never seen defense like that in years I really haven't they go on to win they beat biotech and Blacksburg last night by score a forty five twenty three tell me your opinion in that game but that's I think the Irish right now will not have a dent in their schedule the rest of the way\nWell I mean look nice when last night and you think about last week's game against Stanford that was the first top ten game at Notre Dame stadium since the Bush pushed game Thirteen Years ago isn't that amazing\nThough to beat Stanford and all of a sudden at Stanford Wayne looks a little less than ... because you think about stand for getting gifted again by Oregon and then getting blown up by Utah last night\nBut that was a big win for Notre Dame and to come off of that emotional big win at home go on the road you're only up Seventeen sixteen at half time a lot of motion in that building and they play very well in the second half so yeah I'm impressed by their defense and also Dexter Williams is a very running back\nI didn't like ... book last night he was inaccurate far too many times ... considered when your boat raise them like that when you didn't play your best foot pause positive sign for the future\nNo doubt about that give you that the positive side of the sort of the move away from the Irish because you can keep on glowing a talking to them as they made me sick so enough they they want and you're happy and you got your time and this and that's it rarely\nAre good but you know I Know because it's like with the message and stuff you know I I got it I really do but now with that show the patriots now forget about the pages of ... them out because the guy the other day thirty eight twenty four Brady reach five hundred touchdowns by the way it's funny because they'll always remember he passed that five hundred\nSuggests Gordon our eyes and maybe we could close the arguments painting versus Brady that's all I've heard for years and I've always said whoa hey I had the stats\nBrady had the titles I'll tell you right now here and now we're going to close the story here Brady has both Bernie as both right now so that there's no more argument would pay than Brady Brady got 'em both he's demand varying in this story\nAbout that argument or settled\nFor anybody with half a brain a long time ago I ... it's not even close Peyton Manning how many times that he just absolutely wet himself in the playoff moment\nNo doubt ton at times man for interceptions against the patriots and the play offs the pig pig six can you imagine Andy for a second can you imagine\nIf Tom Brady threw up six to lose a Super Bowl how people wouldn't come close to glossed over it if they do and Peyton Manning 'cause they like him but it's not even close in terms of who's had a better postseason resume and who's the better individual quarterback Tom Brady by a mile\nRight I couldn't agree more ... and we'll leave it at that and the patriots it back in the demise of the patriots is a well it's too soon although I I tell you I understand that because most people want to see them lose you know that this way life right don't you agree\nSee yeah right but you've got to still be reasonable there isn't another team right now Andy where people are emotionally emotionally idiotic about that's even close to the same level as the patriots\nThink about that for a scientist sport any forward anything that you want to poll the\nWarriors in basketball\nYou know we can root for them to lose I Do you do you don't like Katie joining a Seventy three when ... but we're not unreasonable we're not like oh yeah they're going to get tripped up by the grizzly this year as long as connelly's healthy likes or at home when it comes to them and the patriots have not seen\nThis before they stumble out of the gate they'll play great in September they play a lot of young guys and try to figure it out and what do you know they always do so it was doom and gloom and they were one and two\nAnd then off at two games in a you know short span of time of a sudden they're healthier at three into and it looks much different with Julian Edelman back in with Josh Gordon contributing\nI'll tell you one thing that's not that healthy the Pittsburgh Steelers I don't know what's going on there and I think there's rumors in Pittsburgh that they basically want their head coach my Tom and gone they said he's lost a locker room Steelers are home today one two and wants to record that play the falcons who are not much better than one in three fabulous last of the bangles that's all I'm going to say about that at Cincinnati so we move on steel is Larry ...\nFive hundred and ... year last August ... you know\nSteel is left at home to Baltimore and right now or you know I forgot to look at sea that's how did I get them out anyway because I'm not a line guy but you are so we go there but I Will tell you right now fountains are probably win this game I really believe stop to stake him today\nThey might I mean this is one of the handful of big games featuring teams with horrible records right because you had\nA Dan Quinn earlier this week falcons head coach say\nHe believes the falcons are better than the record indicates\nAnd I agree with him you go back to the old school Bill Parcells line you are what your record says you are\nThey are one in three football team right now but going forward there a higher caliber than that Andy I Would look at it like the dolphins were three you know and they got throttle by the run into patriots at the time\nSo your record doesn't tell the full story going forward every single time so many injuries with the falcons defense that the Achilles heel for them so I expect this to be a shoot out I think it's going to be a really high scoring game but for the falcons to drop to one in four or the Steelers to drop to one three in one\nAfter losing a home game that's what would happen if they lose to the falcons today\nMan you're in a hole you can't afford to lose this game if you're either team\nAnd what is it really has to do just gets ... Jones involved more than the ... really right now is the first NFL history which sits touched down to the team's first four games in ... Jones hundred Seventy three receiving a it's been in the first player ever\nWith forty one one hundred yard games in his first Ninety nine games will get those guys involved that's your strength that's basically a straight get them involved and that's\nThey have to do they just got to get defenders involved in defending [laughter] you know that their issue as these events that's the problem they scored in the high thirties the last couple of weeks in the last ... games you also mentioned that yeah I I was gonna say real quickly though if you look at the Steelers\nTo happen because they're on the field so quickly they score and that's the end of it but honestly the total at yards like they give it up almost Nineteen hundred yards it it's amazing average per day one twenty three they're only gaining one Thirteen again for themselves and average per game as far as what a totally yards three twenty eight given up to two Ninety seven these aren't good stats\nI mean really and truly therefore no one it's hard to believe that they are\nWell that often just been so dynamic [laughter] have been on believable offensively and I can't wait to see just scheme wise you know it's Patrick ... has been outstanding I'm not saying it's just the scheme\nRight what Andy Reid has been able to do\nTo schemes certain match ups where they can take advantage I Want to see just magically what Andy Reid comes up with against the jaguars defense because if you're getting pressure consistently and Patrick Murray homes that absolutely it takes a lot of ways from us to play color with Andy Reid\nAnd I want to see just in terms of you know this Jay Lynn Ramsey tier ... I Love the trash talk back and forth with jailing Ramsay thing he's they returned specialists let's get that straight a return special if there is a big game for ...\nBecause if he's quiet and this one a lot of people are going to look at jailing Ramsey and say yeah that's it he just returned guy what when he's not but it's going to be an overreaction of type ... doesn't play well today\nYou know here's the question I mean I don't know how you feel about this but I'm shocked that the Kansas City chiefs have gotten off of the stuff that they have and what touchable homes is done and I often wonder and I haven't seen a lot of reports about this at a good story line would be what\nWould they be as successful if Alex Smith was still on the center would they be because now you have the parts offensively to do well maybe not\nAs well but still it or is it all Patrick my home so I mean it's a lot to know them for sure\nAbsolutely it is they wouldn't be averaging seven points a game\nPatrick my home so I mean it's a lot to do with them for sure\nAbsolutely it is they wouldn't be averaging seven points a game Hugh had Alex Smith he had the highest past rating in football that yes yeah so they would be successful offensively\nBut when you look weak in week out thirty eight points forty two thirty eight twenty seven when I get off week on the road Monday Night football in Denver\nI don't think they'd be scoring to this degree I don't think that Alex Smith would be pushing the ball down the field where he would have fourteen touchdown passes zero interceptions so yeah Patrick my home's numbers I think are a bit healthier than what you would have seen from Alex Smith in the same often but you got a lot of weapons over there but I think it\nIt's not just medically against\nThe forty niners you had a great throw where Patrick ... bought time uses athleticism he rolled out to his right through a touchdown pass those are some of the plays that he's been able to make that are just special look at the left hand to throw against Denver right over the last quarter back in the league doing that\nAnd everybody talks of balance and all that so I mean here's a team that has gained something like twelve hundred yards through the air offensively and only rush for like four hundred and fifty yards I mean where's the balance there so you know all that stuff is all that stuff out the window because I think that you're a coach and you have to do what you have to do with the personnel you have\nI mean I I watch these announces on TV's while you know are there still is today at the twelve plays the ... places ... plays you know it's great balance great balance means nothing if you don't get it done if you look at the job is to slip beginning to John in Kansas City but there's no balance\nRight well yeah\nThere's not a whole lot I mean it's definitely one sided so bright as long as the humming along it's all good but you are going to come to later in the season maybe it's raining sideways maybe it's the bad weather game you know you got to be able to have more tricks in your bag\nTo survive over the long haul and right now you got a great passing game\nHe's got no defense and you've got a decent running game that route enough balance to really be a threat\nTo do some significant damage their day is going to come this is similar to last year they got off the great start five and no and I think you know they're losing six of seven because too many did look older casual setting it up yeah he won't be able to pull up they could lose three of or they could have a similar stretch here not too far from now\nNo doubt about that Brian firmly alive for the guy go Fox Sports radio studios no there's only one reason to visit this place for a good

to Chris Conti will Chris Conti is on IRR ... graves is on IRR so they've got a bang up in a bad defense their defense has gotten shredded steadily\nAnd ... he has a good game at all I've been hearing

sixteen forty eight\nDo you not see something that stands out among all the other game that spike is not normal\nReally no not at all\nSo Mitch ... performance is being rose Lee blown out of ...\nAnd like a little cold water on you for a second if I may may I Do that when he got hit because when you talk like this about you know everything's out of control and you're right you know I'm not\nGoing to argue with that it reminds me of like the uh the Phillies Seventy sixer fan boys remember when they said they were going to win at all in the play offs but the Seventy Sixers are but I had to give

you know without paint on these guys go to those games with the war paint I mean again you see you get upset with the fans that go crazy that are over the top like the trip is the fans they think they should have told her famous and they've said look for the bears right and\nThat's fine I mean that's your prerogative I get crazy when I see watching a game on TV and and the camera pans to a guy understands that we're in like a normal life it\nReally I mean a a guy that's where that's not really I got it's like for Halloween there'll be unbelievable and the stand and I've always wondered when you're driving to a game that they were these costumes in their car driving to the game\nYeah you're not just with that like oil raider fan that were raised noxious outfits I Love that stuff you don't like that\nI cannot imagine driving my car to again getting started going through a stop light turning to my right or to my left and seeing the guy in the car next to me one of the Batman outfit\nI just don't understand I couldn't I couldn't picture that really I just could not\nAll right I'm just saying you know what I haven't dressed up for a game but I don't look down upon it I like it that's other people's deal at school with me I have a much less of a problem with people doing that\nThan I Do like they're crazy opinion and you weren't like Lima insert team here therefore\nThey're going to win at all and it's it's just ridiculous man I Know that that's why you and I are so well versed because you know we kind of like rubbed shoulders and there's some sort of a\nWay you know I might the same paper to you I mean how many are sent paper I Know I Am in a sense um rough around the edges\nYeah oh that's good man that's because not all of them\nAll right I'm going to talk about this team they got to win\nAnd they could have had a second when they want to unwind this the browser lost an overtime game to Oakland\nForty five forty two last week I had to make things even worse I don't know why they do with this the NFL's said there was a bad whistle which costs the browser fumble recovery you know and\nWhy why would you pour salt on an open wound you lost the freaking game\nThe coaches they're probably knew it was a bad call but the least got a confirmed it like on Wednesday or Thursday to say oh my goodness what a punch in the gut if you remember the places I some six minutes and thirty nine seconds left the regulation Derek car the quarterback of the raiders lost control of the ball if the miles Garrett and you're not a very of the brown hit him in Oakland does look on the thirty eight yard line\nGarret recovered began running towards the end zone the referee Walter and this instead of whistle blowing before the bubble because cars Ford pass as a stopped the progress I understood role to play a sock and the rate is punted on the fourth down that was the end of it and the NFL in ... in a review said it was a fumble\nWhy they do that yeah it well I think a lot of it is due to gambling now how the rules have been relaxed significantly\nI understand it Andy with you it's like well you can't do anything about it now so what really that really do it's all about hey hey it's we're on the up and up we just missed something\nNo conspiracy going on here we're not doctoring the outcome of games and that's all it is and it's been ramped up now that gambling is more prevalent so you're going to have more of these situations and I think a lot of people they'll look at that would be like the browns got hosts it actually\nDidn't end up hosing the browns because the raiders punted the brown scored a touchdown and actually shoot up a good minute and a half\nAs it turns out that could have helped the raiders out so you have to look at what happened next when there was a bad\nCall it clearly was the ... should have been ruled the fumble but as things turned out the brown scored a touchdown anyway on the ensuing drives though it's a complete wash it's just you know that's why they come out and be like oh hey everything's cool but yeah it's the more Smith mister\nWeek he was pointing a finger at the NFL which I mean almost never happens Andy and he was like I don't know that they've done enough in terms of all of these gambling situations where you have some owners that have a vested interest in\nWhether it be like a fantasy sports and he's like how how is that exactly going to work and\nWe haven't done a great job of making sure the game as pure and I was like how exactly can you do that you know what do you how do you do it how do you ... you can't the only thing that you can do is if there was a brutal call and people start calling for a conspiracy is to say no no we miss that are bad\nBut we're not doctoring games here we're not in the business of going to federal prison if by thing of Baker Mayfield can win his first start or not you know it's crazy you\nKnow I I kind of opened my eyes a little bit now I understand why the NFL is doing that is the gambling situation you're right I mean and\nIf a person like myself was not a gambler per se and I don't know what I'm saying that you are but a few more averse to it that than I Am because you someone invite you dabbling in a little bit and I don't really do much so I ...\nYeah either that it's not that it really isn't about this ravens team I mean\nThere are a surprise team there there are three and one is getting not much respect for that day I said in the beginning of the segment that speed kills and the ravens habits they've got to revamp line of they really do Michael Crabtree and wide receiver John Brown this guy could run that speech to release need this team right now is a is a\nRemake could really is and it's given new life\nTo the quarterbacking situation and Joe Flaco he's having a heck of a year and it's because of those guys\nYeah and you know you look at all the three in one teams in football right now\nOutside of the saints and jaguars say almost all of these teams are getting a lot of attention and you don't want to buy in your reluctant because right\nOf riffing lack of success dolphins ravens were just talking about in this game bangles bears titans hit\nAll of those teams are getting overlooked and it's not because of this year it's because of what's happened in the past\nBut I see your point Andy with the ravens and what they're doing that only offensive Lee and Joe Flaco has been playing better than he has before and the weapons are better there in terms of\nVery much overlooked because of a J grain it's similar to\nIf you look at Calvin Ridley the rookie he's not going to get a ton of props because you're playing with William Jones you know [laughter] so really I was going to get all the attention and all the conversation with Tyler Boyd is a very very good number two receiver he's solid\nHe's a consistent\nSo yeah there's bangles seem as they can bring together some winds here there should be a win this will be a very bangles laws if they've found a way to kick this scale way\nTo say right now if they lose today in Cincinnati all the air goes out of the bubble I was going to be a will always me and it's going to be as a fan saying same old bangles yeah especially if they kick it away the same old bangles you know and that's the way it definitely fans are but you know really a truly you have to understand they used to that in Cincinnati there really are\nWhat was the big three weeks stretch for them because the bangles there at home against the dolphins today they're at home against the Steelers next week and then there at Kansas City so that this should be a waiting for the bangles and when you've got a Steelers and Casey coming up it needs to be a win today for the bangles\nAnd I hate to say this as as a bagels than I Want to see them do well they could in fact lose two of the next three\nWell yeah I mean they could easily drop a game to the Steelers into the chiefs then right outside the realm of possibility that the dolphins beat the bangles today it's not like the bangles or a jog or not or anything like that\nBut yeah I think that there's probably a man is there a better chance that the bangles go to a new one or one into over these next three cars assuming I win today do you give him a win against the Steelers are Casey who say they drop both of those\nAnd you know what I hate to say this because I don't want to be on the fence I don't have that kind of a person but I really would rather stay at all of that ad okay\nI Would say they sue the go one or two but I'll tell you why say that I I really would rather see how that Roethlisberger plays today ... is is he under down swing or is he just had a couple of bad games that's\nWhat I Want to see in Pittsburgh I I just you know it's like you say you know people say they they they go on past results well he didn't want although the Steelers right now are hurting I still look at them as what they have done\nAnd the bangles at three in one I think most people look at what they have done that is why you're not buying it with the\nBengals as three in one eye you're not going to buy that this deal is there a failure yes\n... ... is that true well that's the way that yeah you make a lot of sense I'd love to go again I Do I'll go against your bottom barrel betting\nYeah ... ... is the truth\nWell that's the way it is yeah you make a lot of sense I'd love to go again I Do I'll go against your bottom barrel betting but there's a better chance that they go one into\n'em but you know it's one of those teams the bangles or one of those teams until they do what you can't quite by in there the reverse patriots you should be late to the party\nOf saying the bangles are going to do something significant you should just wait until they do you know you should be late to the party of saying the patriots the demise is here just too late for that to happen before you said because you've been proven wrong season after season after season and this might be the latest installment in his eating a bagel\nWent to the over your dolphins I just want to hear it yes louder and louder and louder as\nAs much as you can get Andy as as much as you're going to get over here you know but I Will tag it out with this just to kind of truce it up a little\nBit yeah\nThere's still pride over your Andy ferment but noted yeah would push comes to shove I Would say bangles with this one\nAll right Brian ... from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios are vicious to gain that as everyone talking
