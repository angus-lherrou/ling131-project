shop in the district and that takes a while to have you got route [laughter] so yeah there's just there's no substitute for talking to people\nComing from the background and agriculture and I just know this from a kid growing\nAh I have some cousins name at a sale barn and on Tuesdays the sale barn was everybody was so a lot of people that you know in your district come from the same background and you've liked the known them for decades and so it and you do see them and a lot of related industry of acts to\nYeah you see 'em all over there you go to a farm sale or you go to the stock sale you know and you see a lot of the same folks and and like you say uh I first started hitting us route ... in the early sixties and\nAnd uh there's a lot of good folks out there you have a lot of things in common and that's always good to touch base again what\nDo you get in reaction from people you know because we've had such incredible growth I mean even in Fairfield you can see it you know you get off the highway my home and drive down route twenty and there's just been this huge buildup how what sort of reaction to people have\nI mean I Know that people are they know there's some positives but I'm I'm sure there is a little anxiety with it too\nIn terms of girls that were getting I think generally positive um there's always folks that have come here and liked it this way at like that here and don't really want it to change in the short we're seeing that some of that [noise]\nThe lie I Would say overall are the folks that have been around them well a\nCouple of generations are more if you will you know they say generally see see growth as a positive thing and there's more opportunities and potentially again in the smaller communities um\nThem are shrunk those populations have been reduced and that really goes back into businesses and and restrooms and service stations and as those things go away then that local lifestyle changes so when we see this growth command quite a bit of\nA lot of retirement homes for example I not been there for Fairfield area and over the hill you know a lot recreational homes with all like to come up in their two beautiful area [noise]\nOne of the things that we could promote and a lot of this area's is just that lifestyle lot quality of life um I've always offered a counter argument when businesses look at these areas and I say well you know where do we get the people that work\nAnd and uh the fact of the matter is if you offer a good job in those areas people fight to be there because they just love to live there they'd like to have some way that they could make a good living they'd be there in a heartbeat\n[noise] we we got about two minutes before the next break 'em and we've got about half an hour in talk after that a very quickly we've got a couple of propositions on the ballot will maybe get to both of them in this segment or what's your take on proposition was\nWell it's about gambling and slot machines [laughter]\nYou after all the dust clears a and the proposition that basically says that a slot machines aren't slot machines and we're going to say that and in Idaho statutes ... pretty much as they are ... pop machines and\nJames aren't slot machines and we're going to say that and in Idaho statutes ... pretty much as they are ... pop machines and that's gambling so if it passes on it I think would happen at the age he's made it pretty clear who's going to wind up in a court case and they're going to decide what a slot machine is\nBy definition a some buddies who's trained in law will have to figure out what this electronic devices and kind of some sort of rolling\nYeah it'll be fun to watch I guess the same\nYou know we'll do it on the part of mutual betting and and that's legal in Idaho\nAnd so the origin of this machine was and that's it and related horse race\nSo that first generation had a screenwriter up here trying to a high on and these you place you're you know what the the race was going to be placed your bed and then do you watch the race\nAnd the little horses would run across the screen and that the winter and you could win or lose whatever the situation was one of the next generation that screen ... smaller and go lower and got a little more bills and flash and then\nLast generation the strings down at the bottom of the dilemma shows what the last three seconds or something as a race and and that's an awful lot like a slot machine so when this came before the the legislature\nOr was it last year the year before I don't remember any way I went up there and I I played the machines and and I watched other people playing machines and if you've ever been to say yes then you watch people play slot machines and it's that look that style that field\nOne of the advantages we had a we haven't taken action and a lot of the other states have so we can go back and look and some of those other areas of the programs\nThat

Miller from district twenty six say it's a a forty two and weren't fifty on magic valley this morning\nA bill collie with you I news radio Thirteen ... news radio Thirteen tend to ... we were talking in the break because we we just before we went to a commercial break or you are talking about looking at what other states have experienced when it comes to this a Medicaid expansion and um\nThere are a number of states thirty four I guess that have done it so far but you you can some do it differently matter and not all thirty four did at the same way or at the same time so if you're trying to do is see what successes there have been\nAnd try to measure against what failures happened and how they happened before you come to because if it gets passed you got to deal with it no matter what your position has come January exactly\nAnd that's that's the thing that I spend more time thinking about really you know if this does bass\nAnd how are we going to deal with it because the way I read the bill list is going to be pretty open to the legislature will be able to formulate this and put it together and I think it gives us quite a bit of flexibility\nSo then how are we going to do it what did we learn from what we did last year in a way that that was put together and more importantly foot new things has become available from President Trump's actions and from congressional elections in terms of what we can do within Medicaid that either\nWhat we can do within Medicaid that even understand I haven't had time to do research in that I understand there's been some changes there and also in the way we can formulate insurance because in my mind these things go together um\n\nAny any time that we can watch someone else and learn from their mistakes then that puts us in a better place uh\nI did the insurance exchange a few years ago uh we had a what three years of experience than watching other states build their exchanges and failing their exchanges\nAre we learn from their mistakes and then we did at the Idaho way we were very conservative than the way we did it wanted very specific outcomes and we have the best exchange in the nation is the cheapest exchange in the nation 'cause what 'cause we were just smart about the way we get\nWe could get to a point obviously where this whole program if we can see the Obamacare program go away and the next I think probably twelve months and then everybody states and federal government to come up with something brand new or or do nothing at all but there's gotta be some approach because\nA survey say the healthcare still a huge issue to most people\nYou've got it is and I'll be fun to walk to actually you know because all of these states that have bought into this and got entangled in it\nAre going to have to Annan tango and and you talk about some tough politics and again here we are in Idaho you know taken a smart little slow approach and find try and figure out how to do it the Idaho way so uh and that's another one of the reasons\nA good reason really to to be really careful with this vote and be very thoughtful about this vote because I think you're right I think we're a\nAnd that's that's my hope and my heart if you will that that Obamacare will disappear and then we're going to be back in the business of restructuring healthcare and much of that going to pattern back to the way it was pre Obama Care [noise]\nBut in other things that they'll let the plays into this is the cost of health care you know we spend all this time talking about how we're going to pay for that really what we should be talking about is how we're going to reduce the cost of the things that we can do with health care in Idaho to reduce that cost\nA lot about the relationships between the insurance companies hospitals a lot about a situation where a a single insurance company in a single hospital get together and if you go that hospital if you don't have that insurance\nYou're out in the cold I think we need to be looking at some of those kinds of situations to uh to make sure that that when somebody in Idaho buys insurance that that they know for sure where they can use that and not be limited so much that way um\n...\n... these are hard things to deal with a medical care is big business and uh they're not going to easily give up some of these alternative [laughter] one of the things we looked at the I ... I think it was named replacement I Can't remember for sure\nThat it came out last winter when you're talking about it and they compared to the cost of that particular surgery from treasure valley\nTo Salt Lake while it was as much as fifty percent less depending where are you went to get that particular operation\nSo part of this needs to be a revealing the papal giving people the opportunity to look at a different procedures differ operations different kind of care see what the costs are Steve where they can get it make it a little more open market competitive that way [noise]\nYou know you mentioned another treasure valley of that area has grown by leaps and bounds there's a there's a big challenge and the state because uh Steve Millington is shared with me he was going to be here today but he got\nBy leaps and bounds there's a there's a big challenge in this day because I'm Steve Millington is shared with me he was going to be here today but he got tied up on another of at um [noise] but he he uh he was sharing with me that within a few years the population growth there is going to be so great\nUh and then when we read through the redistricting and things like that\nKind of a lot of that when you see some power shifts or just a couple of smaller areas in the state geographically but how are we going to balance the needs of that agricultural community because I Know that people uh suburban and urban people to some degree do understand\nBut I don't think that they they they they they they fully comprehend\nWhat it is that happens when they drive by and they see pivots or they see a combine our\nTractors or even an open field they don't necessarily I don't think they always can quite understand that and that's going to mean a lot of head budding a legislative Lee in the next decade\nWell it'll be interesting to watch [laughter]\nWe've seen the same situation like that and the ... area where there is a there would be a dairy go in and then pretty soon somebody wanted to have a subdivision just down the road and then with pretty soon people built there and then pretty soon there was a big conflict\nOr with with agriculture so egg has to be smart in terms of allowing people to understand\nA a planning and zoning and long range planning has got to be smart in terms of where they allow these things to happen and going back into egg areas you know existing egg areas [noise]\nUm you know there's part of me that would like to uh to see some of that treasure valley expand out into the desert rather than back into that egg ground and that we\nAs a whole week just be a little bit smarter about how we use our resources you know there's a whole lot of desert out there that you could build a whole bunch of stuff on and all you do is run a couple of rabbits off\nYeah that's what they've done in parts of Nevada I mean it in and they've done it ... and the spectacular fashion and some places because well they probably didn't have a lot more choice because it was more desert but still there's a tremendous amount of that space I think going west out of Boise in Napa in that area in southwest that there's very little growth it's gone\nYeah so do some of these things I'm not sure how they get to do just that as we become more cell phone as these communities to look at alternatives\nYou're struggling with your mortgage payments\nWhat to do\nYou

it's confidential and it's free\nThe crisis center hope health healing [noise]\n\nGot to share with you a quick story sound just at the website of KGB TV and family [noise] the news room had been getting calls at the TV station [noise] about a series of professionals that have been airing [noise]\nAnd a loser about marijuana usage and the commercials are being run by a group that would like to maintain that the status quo and that is keeping it out of the hands of recreational users at least on a legal basis we all know that they're going to be recreational users\nThe law doesn't mean anything to some people but some people have printed viewers got confused who are watching the television station because there's a website refers to keep Idaho in the office of transparency which sounds almost like a state government department but their contracts looks more like a political campaign or back\nWhere he'd get marijuana laws and changing in Idaho\nSo Katy did he decided to go take a look into this\nBecause gift is there is a very she is an office than and I hope it does deal with government transparency so there was some confusion that was going on here\nYou know that authors likely wouldn't be involved in it in an anti marijuana campaign drug free Idaho executive director Rob Stevenson says any confusion is an honest mistake he spoke with a TV station and he says didn't even know that there was an office to be honest with you it's just marketing but just a vehicle to deliver that message to be transparent\nAnd he said the goal is to show people the other side of the fence what the narrative is is that it brings in all kinds of taxes and there was absolutely no problem with it and it's just not the case and and so they do\nThat position the opposition they immediately they they shifted discussion to the cannabinoids oil well those are two different matters\nThe one I think would be would be you know if they've they've had helps people who are sick I think it's fine I have a friend who has cancer or he's stage four I used to work with him at a radio station a few years ago and\nUh he he made a comment on Facebook about some of these things last night that leads me to believe that you know he may be looking at it as a way to relieve pain that he has\nA it was given six months to live he's now coming up on eight so he's he's happy about that and I'm I'm I'm not saying I Want to deny a pain relief to some of these people and if you are told you got terminal cancer a\nAnd this is going to at least help you or through the last few months of it again I'm a I'm not opposed to that\nBut when it comes to recreational use we're seeing a lot of scientific evidence just recently because you know nobody really spend a lot of times the what the long term effects of this war because\nIt was always sort of on the back burner because it wasn't legal but as I pointed out you'd have to go read a lot of papers in England to actually get some of the details on this because\nPapers in this country aren't covering this study is one of those was just released the other day and came from the University of Alberta which had looked into this because Canada just legalize recreational marijuana nationwide\nAnd the University of Alberta and you got it probably figure that a lot of people who teach in that academic setting are liberals themselves and likely would favor legalization but their results were that this stuff isn't good for you\nAnd that there are long term health consequences one said last week said that can be long term health consequences even if you only smoke a little of it University of Alberta is that if you're smoking at twenty four hours later it's still has a when they're trying to teach you in a classroom\nYou you still have problems remembering anything in fact the effects could last for three days and the people are using it recreationally aren't just smoking it once every\nThree days that are often doing it every day there's the old Steve Martin job Steve Martin was doing a show back in the seventies it's hard to believe but he used to fill arenas basketball\nArenas and the like ... not many comedians do that they usually do smaller venues but he did this guy here to talk about how people magazine had revealed that when Martin was a young man in the sixties and smoke marijuana and Martin goes on to talk about it and he he admits that he did and he says it has to you know occasionally\nI'd smoked just before bed\nAll once in a while sometimes or just after\nDinner the occasionally just there for dinner sometimes just after lunch or some days it was just before lunch\nSometimes it was just after breakfast but never at dusk never at dusk but that's the point people who the recreational users it's not just one of those things and say wow yeah on the twenty fifth day of the month I guess we'll all sit around and get high\nBut don't allow more often than that but what what next to the people out there who who who look at it as a sacrament and you've got some libertarians as well as the liberals who who feel that way about it\nThey go right ahead and and they continue to do it and they get angry when anybody talks about you know what this could be really bad for you or it could make you not only incredibly stupid but it could eventually kill you now we don't know anybody who's lately die from it but it if you are already finding long term health effects from it\nIf it sharpens your life\nThen it's no different than a lot of other things that you

minutes with state representative or the moon this morning we're having a conversation about ah let me so let us out detailing\nLife and final years of large immigrant boost\nThe only person who was a who was killed a during the during I call the standoff media calls it an occupation of her wildlife refuge is probably not either one of those um you could say it was likely a group of people who are out camping in the middle of winter and very cold place and\nIt was not what you would call 'em there's not like if you go to San Francisco or Oakland and the old occupy demonstrators are antifa are blocking streets and smashing windows are these people in Oregon let's be honest weren't bothering anyone other than the fact that the ...\nLiberals in mainstream media and so that you had people in mainstream media saying the government should go in to the refuge guns blazing to get these people out but they wouldn't recommend the same thing when it comes to answer for or occupy\nDemonstrators in big cities a representative moon I was going to say\nIt it it shows you at least among I think that the folks in the media and we were just talking about media coverage of the conference you were at and watches it shows you how are they took a position and\nThey took the position and um they're trying to anybody who doesn't agree with him as being somehow a terrorist\n... you're right and you know there were there were quite a few the guardian was their them as the other one was there and they're normally not\nI'm conservative writers than with those papers but I noticed them a zoo and uh uh they they uh rained it in a little bit when they released their article the next day the guardian was and it was still a it was still calling us anti government folks which again was an interesting term\nOf it but it is too bad because ah [noise] the if it if they had stayed for the entire talk which they did not they they were moving in and out of the room but had they stayed for the entire talk and especially listen to mark her\nTo explain how it's so easy to ruin people's lives with words and and it shouldn't be that way but because of the media you know takes that runs with ... to\nA left wing media your your ... how do you fight it how do you find it you know or you can just keep going around in sharing the truth and\nThis is what Jeanette fan of commands doing she's sharing the truth her husband was not armed and that was revealed in the trial that they had in Oregon so um you know it's there's a lot of a false narrative and people have got to do their research\nI have people come up to me and say how can you support these folks are how can you do this I said then you don't know the story\nYou you can't know this story these folks are people who had their backs against the wall and and the federal overreach was just unbelievable you can't have snipers pointing at your home five days before this round up on these cattle it you know at least in the situation the Bundy standoff\nUm ... it's just atrocious and like you said\nAnti ... and all of these ah groups these mob groups can go out and hurt people hurt property nothing happens it and and then you have like you said a situation in Mali are and what we have we have a good man who was shot down and that was the intent that they needed someone to make an example of and he was that\nI had seen the owner had you know video because of course the um the Saudis\nWere were tracking his truck through the Carolinas was going down the highway and uh and I am aware that he said he was not going to eat he was not going to spend the rest of his life in prison because he'd been outdoors most of his life and\nUm I Know people still argue about this but it seems to me he did lowers arms and that's when the shooting started and um the unfortunate part of it as we don't know what was going through his mind at the time but but number two\nYou ... you look at the second I Know just as you look at this and you see how the jury's ... degrees the human or animal to go free and and uh and and that happened\nThat ... percent part is he might still be with us today uh it's just a few of them moved in that particular situation\nI I don't the only you know I don't know I I I think it was it was meant to happen that that road block was meant to stop I mean you know I think he got out to protect there was a young girl on the car at Eighteen year old I Believe she was Eighteen\nI thing or a Christian singer and they were heading to the sheriff's department that's where they were headed and that road block was set up and and um that they I I Believe that's just my own opinion but I I Believe they knew what was going to happen that day\nUm at least but the law enforcement and and that's it's too bad it is too bad because our government should be here to help us not to\nFight us every step of the way or impose regulations or road blocks to folks lives and and that's what happens I and I said a lot in my rural communities and um you know we just have to say no no no you know we we want to live here we want to work here we want to raise our families here\nAnd um you know we just have to say no no no you know we we want to live here we want to work here we want to raise our families here um and and just don't you know keep imposing these regulations\nThe other part I think that became difficult for me though in the aftermath was a you know what I'm trying to be as objective about this as possible but there you had a federal agent who initially said that he said I didn't use my firearm I mean I ... and then it turned out obviously he had\nAnd um\nThe science of the matter is we go all the way back to um you know I think back to what happened at ruby ridge and\nYou had people must behaving badly from the government side then and also then turning around and trying to to to cover it up because people want to keep their jobs and their pensions obviously but that that that revelation and whether or not he his shots actually hit anybody that revelation seems to have probably\nHeard the government's case I think more than anything else I hurt\nWell and right and just a similar to the Bundy trials I was at the third trial and this is right before all of the the Bundy family was released\nAnd it was because of ethics gulp it tore evidence was withheld but the most damning information was on a Monday we're sitting in the courtroom on with my husband and that it's kept in a special agent said yes we lied and and what the jurors asked a question at the end of\nAh the testimony because the jurors are allowed I guess in federal court to do that I'd never seen it and they said that the federal government a lie to the American public to read you know to reach certain objective and the answer was yes\nAnd it's like oh my gosh you know it was just like what you said the fact that they do that that there was lying going on here to the citizens of United States", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Top Story", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "23"}
