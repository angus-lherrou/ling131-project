actually hurting ourselves\nUm you talk about our God really kind of being identity now used blame that ad\nThink ultimately be kind of as a nation moved ourselves into factions and what I don't want is Christians to be a faction in a world of factions [noise]\nUm I think that's the part of the problem but but I think you know people identify themselves as you know I'm I'm this or that I've got a social media community and and then that faction sort of becomes identity becomes a faction the faction becomes an echo chamber\nAnd then ultimately are we the volume just goes up up up up in the egg or just goes up up up up and and we can't survive I think as a nation\nFactional ... at this level eventually you'll Balkan eyes to use the term but history will kind of break apart and so I think the ultimate thing is I I Can't you know I kept solve all the political things you're you've got much bigger platform talk about politics than I Do\nI'm just trying to help Christians to say All right how do we react\nTo how do we respond and the answer is is not to take our identity from anything other than king Jesus and and and again I Know that's overtly spiritual but we're talking here and this\nIs this focus I mean so it's to take out any parking Jesus Jesus is not coming back on air force one he's not riding a donkey or an elephant when he does and to acknowledge that I'm only all in as a Christian in following Christ and everything else is shaped around that my identity is more\nThe so called Christians of the Westboro Baptist church\nYou know they they hold up signs you know God hates this Scott hates that blah blah blah they're just despicable\nYou don't win by by holding up signs no God hates view and shouting things back you win by listening by understanding by him racing them as a civil or a brother and sister not to do what they're doing\nStanding up but people have been changes one woman in particular that actually left her own family in the Westboro Baptist church that's right because somebody spoke to her with civil who is civility and said let's just reason here for a minute\nYeah that's okay I I on my desk actually right every air front of me\nA name plates because they actually protested at my church we went out and serve them coffee and doughnuts and they called me and the national news I Can't use one of the words probably on the radio but I'll lying the false prophet and so it's actually one of my staff made it into a name played it says it says lined Blanco false prophet\nWestboro Baptist church which by the way it's either wrap does he does either Baptist church\nBut but in doing so I mean the question is how do we respond well somebody reached out I actually interviewed one of members of the family as well a Christian Today so somebody reached out\nAnd I will tell you I think that's what we can do right now with people who deeply disagree with us in\nThe book is filled with examples of Christians who actually build relationships with people who radically disagreed\nAnd in the process we're able to come to maybe a better understanding of what examples for example is a is the president by all university which is a Christian university in California\nUh met with the kind of the leader of the uh the party and say legislature there in California\nThat was trying to change the laws that would make it illegal for ... to live their Christian beliefs about marriage sexuality and more all ended up getting to understand each other better the will of the bill was ultimately not moved forward was dropped and and and now we're at a very different place now\nI'm not saying you can always do that but I Am saying that Christians need to try to do that and I do think that in doing so will act a lot more like Jesus or even this how about a lot more like Christians\nHistorically because of the moment we're in is not time for us to join in ratcheting up the outrage and\nAnd as you said earlier to your caller I'm calling people to arms yet that's not I mean Glenn that's not an uncommon view I don't know some of the some of the worst things I see on social media I I click on a lake and I find go to the bio and it's the first thing to listen to the thing is Christian and I'm like that's not what it's supposed to look like\nAnd I think that's what we need is a change in a lot of hearts\nI Will tell you this the ones who can teach us this right now or the the victims of ISIS and the ones who were were literally chained or as slaves or\nYou know story after story after story of these Christians who I mean I Know one family that actually wrote to ISIS after they said you're all dead were coming Saturday to kill you\nI'm a I think it was on I think it was on Sunday we're gonna come on Sunday and kill you or if you don't submit\nAnd we're gonna crucify you the family sat down kids at all and wrote a letter and said we understand we forgive you for that we're not we're not going to leave we'll be here you can come at three o'clock\nWe only ask that you do not crucify us it it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death\nAnd they lived because they stood up with pie is unbelievable what's happening\nAnd we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was emperor fascinating ever called Julian the apostate I write about this in the book and he he actually he's called the apostate 'cause you know victors right the history and the Christians eventually became more prominent and and here's what he writes because he's so and\nAnd he he actually he's called the ... the victors right the history of the Christian did actually became more prominent\nThat's how big this company is wow they're going to be a the largest clothing retailer by twenty twenty or they're already sell more votes

few months ago [noise]\nSo that's that's an article I Want to get into your head it talks about why he feels that way he talks about what's going on in the economy the leading economic indicators that drives the market and what's going on there\nAnd so again she is actually saying get to safety get out of the market is going to hit is going to hit hard it's going to hit soon so I'm just I'm just relating information this is this is not what I'm saying this is what a\nThis is what Newsmax are saying uh through billionaire a Donald Trump so there's a number of things that I Want to get into your hands to get you updated with what's going on in the economy now here's one that I just got a\nYesterday and this is talking about\nHow the NASDAQ has hit a new all time high\nFor the first time in Fifteen Years\nSo NASDAQ hit an all time high for the first time in Fifteen Years now that sounds really good doesn't it well yeah it does and then as they can an all time high there's a problem it means that the NASDAQ over a Fifteen year history\nSo if the market's up and you tell me that you sell when the market's up are you selling are is that what you're thinking about doing or is that what you're considering doing so Celeste asked this question at a different way if you were to call your broker\nAnd ask your broker when is a good time to sell I\nKind of get an idea that you're brokers and not going to talk about you selling cars the market is up and of course as brokers say\nYou don't sell when the market's going up because you'll miss out on those future games here's what the broker will say if the market's going down or on its way down and you call your broker and you say John or Brian or Dave or Merrill or ed or even down\nThe markets on the way down should I sell most brokers and I really doesn't make a difference to me what their name as most brokers are going to say this why would you sell if the markets on the way down 'cause when the market's going down you're going to capture your losses\nSo if the broker is saying you don't sell when the market's going up and you don't sell when the market's going down\nWhen do you sell because isn't the market always going up or down I mean we might have days where it ends up kind of flat from where it started we might even have weeks where it ends up kind of flat\nWhere it started but the reality is the market if you look at the history of the market over the last year five years over the last ten Fifteen twenty or even one hundred years in the market it looks like a rollercoaster ride\nThat's truly what the market does and and nobody nobody denies that that's that's true the market goes up the market goes down it always has it always will so if that's the case and we all agree that the market goes up and the market goes down then when do you sell\nWell according to the philosophy of almost every broker and I've asked clients that came into my office what is your broker sell it say about selling they always kind of pretty much say the same thing [noise]\nWell I called my broker the market was doing well and I call my broker and he said stay where you're at is a good strategy okay and then when the market was going down back in two thousand one back in two thousand and seven and I call my broker he said stay where you're at it's a good strategy except that strategy\nLast forty to sixty percent in two thousand one and two two thousand seven and eight does sound like a very good strategy to me\nSo let's get back to the question when do you sell I have a friend of mine who was a broker back when I was working for a major a brokerage company a way back one of the day and his name was John let's just call his name John\nAnd I went to John and I said John when do you sell and he goes what this is John when do you sell in the market he goes oh I'm not really sure why you're asking me that question are say come on John pianist you've got a number of clients that are in the in mutual funds and stocks bonds and mutual funds so when do you advise\nYour clients to sell and he's still was looking at me with this look on his face like\nBe wilderness he just he couldn't figure out why in the world am I asking that question and so I said John when your clients call you and the market was on its way down\nWhen I was having this conversation with him and had just started this downturn [noise]\nAnd I said John if your client list to call you and say John the markets on the way down I think now is a good time to get out what would your response be\nI mean of course his response was what I just mentioned a few minutes ago his response was why would you get out of the market when the markets on the way down and you'll capture your losses and I said OK Okay John that's I get it [noise] so let's say that the markets on the way up and your client calls and says John\nThe market's doing real well it has done real well I've done\nI've recovered I made a lot of money I think now is a good time to get out I just don't trust what's going on in the economy has nothing to do with you John nice guy great guy but it really is about me getting my money safe and I I really think it's a good time to sell 'cause the market's up what would you say John [noise]\nI Would tell me this is what John said he said I Would tell my client why would you sell the markets on the way up you'll miss out on those future games so I looked at John and I said John\nWe all know that the markets always going up and the markets are we going down and he goes yeah so according to that philosophy\nYou're advising your clients not to sell when the market's up or going up 'cause there's always going up or down and you advise your clients not to sell when the market's down or going down because the markets are always going up or down as I said John according to that philosophy your clients\nNever sell nearly Seventy bingo it's exactly what he said I'm like what\nHe goes yeah I Would never advise my clients to sell that brings me to my point I Would love it if you are listening to the show today would give your client to call on Monday just just just for the sake of seeing what your broker and doesn't matter what his name is\nMerrill or Dave or at or Brian or even Dan\nCalling your broker on Monday and say hey Mr broker insert name I think the market's done really well and I'm\nFeeling like it's a good time to sell what do you think the answer you're going to get is is going to be one of those two answers why would you sell the markets on the way up or have I done something wrong and they're going to take it personally\nListen folks this is about you it's not about them the last thing that they want you to do is to get me a call and ask\nFor my free save money

market get your savings\nProtected and safe give me a call eight five five for one to seven to three three [noise]\nWe'll Doug now that we're back let's talk about what can be done so let's start with sprinkler systems and and I guess that includes the back flow and all of that but what needs to be done to render those systems safe and offer bowl next spring when people start to go out to start them up\nMostly just to put ... get the water out of the system we called him a blowout we acquire compressors up to them or we blow the water a system of course we turn the water off first we have a meeting drainage we shut the main water up to the straight ... open to drain and low\nLow water between the ... the main drained drain now we'll put air to the sprinkler system and we'd go through each of the stations either through the ... the\nControl clock to make sure we have all of the ... blown out all the lines were blowing out and a athlete that does lead to leave him in the opposition and come back in the spring and start up foreign\nSo does somebody have to be like take for example your company to somebody have to be an existing clients have you guys can provide the service or can somebody call you and and have you come provide justice service\nI have quite a few that are just the sprinkler blow out so they take care of their own yard they ... and then all I Do is a district or blow out in the winter for an all\nNow down there in the ... valley where you're at what is that the depths that the soil will freeze on a typical winter or you know your best estimate\nOf my best estimate the again it depends on the seas in itself a last year it wasn't too bad\nI only got my memory storage Ike we only had like an Eighteen or twenty inch a ... a year before with all this going everything we had a good for us I think it got down somewhere around the dirty inch mark but again um I I don't watch that real close to my ...\nMy ... Gulf we're safe from other people are telling me but yeah probably about a twenty four inches probably an average would be my guest\nAnd so with with most yard sprinkler systems those pipes are going to be buried to a depth of what\nBeauty somewhere between eight and ten inches\nSo they're even in them\nBe a within that zone of frozen soil yes and there's just no way around it this needs to be done or living living in a climate like we have here in Idaho and in eastern Oregon\nYes very much so it you know it just service it a lot of us will provide foreign and we do recommend it you know it it's a whole lot easier to pay for the service to get blown out than to have to worry about coming up with the expense of repairing it in the spring\nNow is this something if folks have like an air compressor in the garage or something like that they can do themselves or they need the type of compressor that that you'll tell around from clients a client\nThey didn't do it their own home on the coup pressures takes a little longer you know usually your competitors that are at home run up to the hundred CSI and you\nGet the whole thing and it starts all over again she let a charge back up and then you don't fear into it two or three times for zone or until you're seeing air coming out more than water but the owner ... will do the job that just takes longer\nAnd so is there a minimum PSI that people would need to make sure they have if they're going to try and do this on her own\nMost of the sprinkler systems are said at the normal um house pressure she'll about forty PSI and that street and we used a bigger compressors is it's not off the pressure itself is off the ball you know okay\nYou know the home compressors they usually run a mine at home is like a hundred cs and hurt\nAs Seventy ... fan and then I really know a one eighty five for my my sprinkler systems so I'm putting a hundred and eighty here than just throw that compared to the ... which is designed for bumping up your bicycle tire your car tires mhm maybe running in ... once in a while or something like that\nAnd that's that's one of the things I wanted to ask about if if people are going to try and do this at home on their own if they make a mistake and they don't have a the different areas opened up for the air to come out but they're putting pressure to the system can they damage their system by trying to blow it out\nTo a certain extent yes uh you'd put too much pressure on your biology that crack your vows with just the air pressure or sometimes you have a you got a wheat clamp or a weak spot in the ... you can actually blow up a whole and apply for a separate a plant and in some cases you'd never know until you fired it off the next spring with laughter\nAnd so once people start seeing or maybe hearing the air coming out with just little kind of spirits of water or small particles is that about the time where they can feel assured they've got enough out to protect the system\nYes if you see it and this being what we call it as ... but basically this law water particles or something that usually means that you have enough obviously most of the springtime the lines are the only buy it for the ... and there is a little bit of flexibility in those and if you have a little bit of water is the water\nGets larger is it freezes as long as you have ... the water to expand and contract\nAnd you're usually pretty safe\nLet's take another break and then when we come back I Want to kind of talk about the way these systems are designed and and what people should be looking for if they tried to themselves\nAnd getting pro great tools that primo prices at being raised a wall do fail October Seventeen through the twenty eighth save up to two hundred dollars on select two flights a flexible brush was premium hammer drill and impact driver in top it all off with Syria savings on the rest of the line\nUp here fall and make filling up here to shed easier than ever have to do oh do fail October Seventeen through the twenty eighth totally atrophied Britney and beef supply\nYou work hard you play hard and you wear burn terrible clothing that fits the bill no matter what you're up to available at your favorite T.
