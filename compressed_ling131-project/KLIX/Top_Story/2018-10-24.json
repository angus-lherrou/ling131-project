that if we have this Medicaid expansion that will eventually crowd out the things that we really need like education spending road repairs uh because of the cost overruns associated with it\nHandle each in that there was the uh uh healthcare a specialist after he got done with his regular or an address and it was very well done and he had lots of slides and end up but it's not the first time he

can't get to the turned around so they're having to figure out how to pay for it\nAnd at one of the things he said was they are having to take money from other\nStrategic areas of the state budget and he said in Idaho I Would suggest the following this thing this this Medicaid expansion\nA number one you have no way of controlling the costs that's just it's not in the formula at all so you're going to have a runaway um cos\nTherefore you've got to figure out how you're going to pay for him\nAnd he said you have a balanced budget requirement in Idaho and and uh so you have two choices you're going to raise taxes or you're going to take money from other areas of your state budget\nOkay this gets us to a point that was made during this conference the Idaho likely could use more education

medicine into and fall it's coming up with a forty four worth thirty seven on magic valley this morning a collie handling the telephones on better health with trip down the medicine and the color of Europe next year on year around ...\nYes a only a aspirin daily aspirin or a short and article that so if you're a little heavier large role in large person that you need to take more than they used to milligrams per day or you could comment on that\nYeah that's a good question and and you know it really depends on depends on where you are taking it um the recommendation you know based on based on the research that's been done no more than a hundred milligrams of aspirin\nIs is considered a low low dose therapies self it's more than that and you're it's usually affecting you in different ways so\nLike the three hundred and twenty five milligram aspirin for instance that's taken for the pain benefit it it's not\nDoing your you're getting more than you need or sexually hundred milligrams is probably the most that you need even if let's say you weigh a little bit more you're still getting the same anti platelet benefit I'm just to that\nPoint and I think that's a great question you know I have a lot\nThere was such a medication is that appropriate and the truth is everyone metabolize his medications differently depending on what your body has as far as there's specific\nAh basically factors called side of crumbs that your your liver makes that metabolize medicine and some people are hyper metabolize theirs and they could be people that are smaller so they may require a higher dose of medicine medicine to get the same benefit um\nSomeone that was maybe a little bit larger weighed more than them did just because of the way that they metabolize and so it's it isn't always dependent on wait we do does medication and children based on weight but in adults that that's not something that we really consider all of that that is a great question\nYeah thank you for the call or are we willing to point out to the numbers to zero eight seven three six zero three hundred to zero eight seven three six zero three hundred I don't think I mean I've been out of high school since Nineteen eighty it's been a while a from a ... century\nBut I can remember hearing stories in the school and we were talking sometimes health class and maybe even heard it around the home about people overdosing on aspirin I haven't heard of anybody overdosing on aspirin and many many years but I Would I Would still think that people are concerned about doses you got to be careful you don't want to take too many\nYeah and you know typically if you're getting to the point where it's an overdose of aspirin you're ... it's probably purposeful um when I worked in the emergency room in El Paso we saw people come in but overdosed on aspirin on a regular basis and I mean there's treatment for that we use a\nMedication called and said oh Fifteen and I actually helps to help to reduce the risk that is associated with overdoses with aspirin therapy but in terms of um\nIn terms of it being a scary thing uh it is I mean you can have ... of the stomach really quickly I mean you can you can bleed all over I mean not just the stomach because it is a ... inhibitor it it can it can cause some problems\nSo so do I remember hearing when I was younger that you know once you got to be like a teenager if you are taking it is a pain reliever for instance don't take more than two uh two it'd be like a maximum and you would you if you can get by with just one take one right\n[noise] yeah so in terms of in terms of taking a\nYou know more than one yeah it just depends on the person but she was a max that I'd recommend and it's gonna be no more than every\nSix to eight hours when you're taking that dose of medicine so you have to be really careful [noise] so do I I for most people I say if you're taking if you're taking ... or you feel like you need to take more sometimes you have to alternate with things like a\nTylenol which you know as soon as I said it sounded wrong but the energy to sustain its for Tylenol overdose so\nAnyway well I'll take quick question limited to jump ship and and and and move things on the other direction but we heard that message from out department about the the flu shots are you seeing cases right now [noise]\nWe've seen a couple of cases of the flu I'm really not much yet so I mean we're we're recommending flu shots and we're we're definitely giving a lot of flu shots um but this year I haven't seen a whole lot yet\nBut my guess is that you know that this is not one of those things that gradually builds all of a sudden you go from a couple a week and then boom it hits and then you've got a bunch right\nThat ... that is the typical flow I Would say a lot of times it's just like the floodgates open up and everyone gets the fluid at once and just you know kind of in that vein I I think the important thing with with the flu is if we're going to treat it with antiviral medications which which they're available\nYou know I think the important thing with the flu is if we're going to treat it with antiviral medications which which they're available and we will treat with antiviral medications and it has to be treated within the first forty eight hours of symptoms starting\nIn other words or you can't you know pulled it off after you know you you've picked it up\nRight right so if if you are wanting to get treatment for the flu it's best to come in and the first forty eight hours\nNow you know talking about that your your health insurance is going to help people out because you're you're sure likes the fact that you you have some prevention because that saves money in the long run\nCall how black

men fail I extra news radio Thirteen than dot com or at forty\nI we were having a conversation unfair [noise] uh [noise] you obviously because of your position and you've been in the community a long time [noise] uh had been a frequent a letter writer for the local newspaper\nAnd often on this program when you chime in uh it comes down to invest shoot issues involving environmentalism and energy and we were just talking few minutes ago about a mile as they call it climate change since they drove the phrase global warming of the ditch a but do you have been apparently banned from writing letters about\nGlobal warming to local newspapers\nWhile all of a sudden I've written a letters and included the United nations and a Twenty one about the global warming hoax I Am a plant scientist and a without a carbon dioxide\nOr in them green plants are along with water that produces food and oxygen and I think most was like they were like the breed on a regular basis and so ... ... right

they're both eyes but during the medieval warm period it warmed up enough that they were able to get\nA people that come in there and for about two hundred years it warmed up\nWe only got about two and a half minutes to go out newspapers I read today a comment from somebody said uh they have become part of the resistance as they call themselves so so working in league with the Democratic party and the Democrat Party as you were pointing out the break is not just simply ... party\nAbsolutely they demonize anybody that opposes to them and they lie and cheat steal whatever and they caught try
