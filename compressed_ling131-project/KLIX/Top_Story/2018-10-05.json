I Believe it was shot and I believe he was shot and killed\nI think and what it was was there some people off the side of the road somewhere and they were out shooting at targets or whatever they were ... whatever they're doing and they use they didn't have it good backstop they used a grove of trees\nFor a backstop and one of the that's obviously not a good backstop so one of the bullets went through the targeted they hit ... you know the price of the trees went into the car and hit and killed this this this young man and that's that's that they weren't obeying the safety rules beat you need to be aware of your target and what is beyond\nI Want to thank the caller and ah it it brings up a point where we still don't know there was the stories\nSome months ago about the doctor in Jerome county where the drum ... he was hit the ... you know he he survived up and and no one really knows where the shots came from yet and it could well be the people are actually shooting are still on aware of what happened that day that they were actually responsible for\nI mean they're very well could be I mean I've I've been out there before there's a it can be people shooting everywhere and people are\nWriting dirt bikes and hiking everywhere too so\nI mean it it could've came from anywhere but we've got to be this is what makes shooters look bad this is one gets areas you know shooting areas taken down this is what gets are guns taken away and more strict gun control but honest as ... people don't think you need to pay attention to what you're doing obey the basic safety rules\nOkay and there was another story up in Boise where a guy was well it is said is said and the story was so interesting they send them a story a guy I you know shot and killed his wife\nOff but if you read the story and says why the guy was re assembling his fire arm the gun went off and shot and killed his wife so\nAny out there's something going on there I don't know what but you know even if it was an accent there was obvious some safety rules that weren't followed the gun was pointed in an unsafe direction so one of the safety rules as you never want to point your gun at anything you're not willing to kill or destroy\n'em depending on how the gun went off typically get his and go off unless the trigger is depressed and at the triggers depressed as pointed in a in an unsafe direction than a bad things can happen see everyone to treat every firearm like it is loaded even if you notice unloaded there's numerous\nOver the last three weeks has been the least two or three stories come out with people broke gun safety rules and they ended up\nIn the news I er I was shopping for a firearm and when I was doing this as I was like getting a\nFeel for everything I was simply pointing them off at the floor right because I don't want to point them in the shop at anybody I you know ... that's the first thing I Would do is I sort of get a grip on it but then I Would point it's about two feet three feet ahead of me at the floor right because again that notion treat them all as if they're loaded\nAnd ... and typically um if you're looking at again a lot of people one big thing on guns to fill the trigger he want to feel how that sugar is so typically if you ask for a gun and force can I'm back me up on us I'm sure tell me what goes on his store\nUm if you asked to look at a firearm they'll hand it to you they're going to make sure there's no magazine that they're going to clear it they're going to hand it to you as soon as you get it you should go ahead and check it and clear yourself even if the slide lock back wrapped us like two or three times to do it or you know visual check stick your finger down there may feel around make sure there's\nThere's nothing in there and if you want to try that trigger I guarantee you\nThat if you ask the store owner or if you asked forced a historic and say hey look I Want to fill the trigger on this he's probably going to tell you the safe\nPlace to him that gun and to dry fire that thing but you know ask permission ask for a safe place a desk where he would like you to do that and\nAnd make sure it's okay because there are some twenty two handguns if you drive from it or break the firing pin right to hey guys generally have a pretty but any center fire handgun you can generally diet Dr ... guns hundreds of thousands of times but\nWhat you should do is when someone hands you again like I tell my boys if somebody hand you've got the first thing you do is remove the magazine\nRack to slide check it bold action rival rifle you if the magazines removal will you remove or if you don't you open the slide are open to ... check it and make sure it's empty and then you can feel comfortable never assumed because someone hand you a gun\nAnd says unloaded never assume that it's unloaded I Can't tell you the number of times in the shop I've had people walk through the door and me gun that they want to sell or pawn\nAnd say it's a loaded and I've wrecked a slide there's been a bulletin oh yeah I'm\nSo always make sure for yourself [laughter] and then even when people hand me again back even though I've been standing watch I'm holding the hand back to me I opened a boat and check it again\nBecause there have been instances where people have\nLoad taken the guy looked at it and loaded around um and and done that so one day on his Facebook nonsense that we should know is because we use this for charitable we want to keep this up and go on and it our page will be a backup and thirty days but if you guys\nOn

one that we honor in the United states\nSo that sounds very familiar when I was in college that's what they said about people who are accused of being communist yes as a matter of the yard and the guilty if somebody is accused me of being a communist\nAnd you angry responded and said you're not saying hey you don't have the temperament to have the job and it's just a job interview going fired for being a professor after forty years and what's the difference when we were innocent or guilty somebody and said you're a communist state schools all the way back to the inquisition\nWhen they would call you in first and make you testify and then they present\nThe evidence look once you're accused the most heinous crime imaginable\nIt turns into a trial when you have due process where the burden of proof is on the other side where the evidence has to be clear and convincing in America we don't allow people to destroy other people's reputations and careers based on it for instance guilt the way the ACLU NASA it's easier to use as we shouldn't presume guilt\nYeah mad amazing nine twenty six were forty two on kale I ex color you're up next year on year\nCould Rory ... garner is wonderful going at All right so I was wondering what are the odds for that flake or the other lady are going to cave and not vote for gambling on so it won't get a nominated\nThere apparently in um the the fifty one forty nine votes projects that they're on board at this point at least the initial vote\nOkay I appreciate that way and I've got a side retrograde won't make it so [laughter] Republicans but thank you\nHey thank you much for the cell phone call a and so if he gets on board and and then we see a hike camp is going to lose so that will give Republicans have picked up in that seat a they're likely still the pullout Tennessee are holding on to the seat that was a that Bob Corker is retiring from and they're likely they could pick up the Indiana and\nIf they pull up Missouri as well they'll come into January with their fifty four to forty six majority which means that if roof bought her a mind off if she suddenly decides she's going to throw in the towel but she's added and forty six years old is you know if she throws in the towel or that means the next nominee is going\nAnd they decided she's going to throw in the towel but she's honored and forty six years old is you know if she throws in the towel or that means the next nominee is going to have a much bigger cushion\nAnd or the or the the voice there was a name that keeps coming up as Amy Coney Barrett who is even much more conservative unconstitutional is than Brett Kavanaugh at least according to writing that I've seen and or was that\nTrump will nominate Coney Barrett for that particular seat and remember a couple of things the Senate does not need to have a hearing there is nothing in your constitution\nA United States constitution about or the Senate Judiciary committee there's\nDoesn't mention committees so it's not necessary to have a hearing so if if the Florida forty six you can simply take a vote for Coney Barrett to the floor and then suddenly you would have a six to three conservative majority\nAnd you'll likely I brought this up earlier you likely have that for the next twenty five years so I think about that every time\nLiberals who've been able to legislate from the bench\nTo get what they want over the last fifty years in this country they'd be stunned me now you know why they were so vicious when it came to a cabin up but there will be fewer of them in the Senate come January\nFewer liberals in the Senate which means there'll be even greater strength and if Donald Trump as a second term he could end up with even ... another appointment beyond Coney Barrett so all of a sudden you're going to have\nA majority that could be a seven to two\nBy the time he leaves office if he gets two terms that could be a two one\nOh this is an opportunity to remake the entire court for a generation thinking about that but it's been a long time since there's been such an opportunity in this country coming up on nine thirty ...\nAnd just a moment you're listening to do a collie this morning until ... am on magic belly this morning a news radio Thirteen ... news radio Thirteen ten dot com one Democrat has been forced to eat crow all share that with you and just a few minutes stick around\nAbout alternative energy I happen to see this this morning [noise] um well I've never been a big fan of wind power now you've got some liberals who are on board saying it's a bad idea to Buddhist monk it there but you know a lot yet at the alternative energy yards\nDating granola wearing a heck of a part of our dog by\n[noise]\n\nBroad review it wants to try keys Dickey

simple\nWe see the liberty bell so I could review when he ... says what's that I Believe it or he sent me do what they say\nPiece in something called the Harvard does that Bush I guess is just a paper published by Harvard University\nI happen to see this and the last twenty four hours and thought oh sis reminds me of a conversation I had a couple of years ago with Scott Becky how the only time I ever met him and we were having a conversation and he was telling me about his opposition to wind power\nWell I don't think he minds if you brought up a million or smell or when a lot that\nThese giant turbines that are dotting southern Idaho oh my goodness and I am literally I was were out for a drive one day a couple of summers ago and I pulled up next to one of these wind farms roll down the windows turned off the car and listen to that ...\n... ... first of all if you live here that the sound of drive you crazy after a while just the repetitive mess of it but we've already had stories about how they they kill off locks of migratory birds are they kill off bats are bad\nStudied all of the nasty insects out there\nAnd the liberals have been telling us well you know there's gotta be some collateral damage\nBut after all we need to save the planet so a killing the birds and the bats as long as we're liberals during that it's okay now if you're conservative\nTo do it then that's a bad thing\nHarvard gives that says the downside to wind power when it comes to energy production there is no such thing as a free lunch unfortunate late into papers published today in the journal environmental research letters and jewel Harvard University researchers find\nThat the transition to wind or solar power in the U.S would require five to twenty times\nMore inland than previously thought\nTo be on\nAnd there's such a large scale wind farms were built would warm average surface temperatures over the continental us by a quarter of a degree Celsius\nThe coal by any environmental measure but that doesn't mean that it impacts or that its impact as negative a negligible said David Keith Gordon McCabe professor of applied physics at Harvard\nAnd then the writers want to say one of the first steps to understanding the environmental impact of renewable technologies is to understand how much land would be required to be future us energy demands I was reading a couple of weeks ago a scientist\nSays we could turn this arid desert back into a green space but you'd have to have wrecked in order to do it solar panels across the Sahara Desert and others to heroin is growing in size but she says if you put up these massive\nSolar farms and this is just theoretical but if you put a massive\nSolar farms across the Sahara Desert\nThat the solar panels themselves will so changed the atmosphere above let it will cause more rainfall over the Sahara then causing more green and the hair or at least in the parts that aren't covered by the solar panels but she admits that the solar farm won't have to be the size of perhaps\nSeveral us states in North Africa so you probably wouldn't grow anything underneath them because the sun would get too far beneath them but in the surrounding area you could still have a green green grass\nGrowing and maybe some crops and you can feed the hungry on that continent\nBut it would have to to again be a very large array\nThe writer at Harvard or says in previous research a case and coauthors model they're generating capacity of the large scale wind farms and concluded that real world wind power generation had been over estimated because they neglected to accurately account\nFor the interactions between turbines in the atmosphere\nAnd David Keith one of the researcher says the direct climate impacts that wind power are instant while the benefits of reducing emissions accumulates slowly in research from five years ago he described how each wind turbine creates a wind shadow behind it where air has been slowed down by the turbine blades\nNow because you have to build a fireman today they're trying to space them apart a bit more but you still have to have to build so many of them that this would be in such a large geographic\nArea you're going to start changing the atmosphere\nOf the area and when that they say the country would become warmer and warmer and Warren research suggests that not only will wind farms require more land to hit proposed renewable energy targets but also at such a large scale would become an active\nPlayer in the climate system well that's not good what are your granola chopping law driving liberals going to come up with next to replace it or do you have any idea is now I Will say I have long been a proponent of solar power um\nAnd and look I I I Know that some people out there argue against it but over time the cost of solar power just gets lower and lower and lower\nAnd the writers do say that solar power right now is a much better alternative energy and wind power is but I've been making that argument on this show for how long nine forty six were at forty two I news radio Thirteen ten K.
