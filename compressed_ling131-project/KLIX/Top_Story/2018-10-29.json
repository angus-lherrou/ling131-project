uh you know trying to stay to some great big private game preserve this goes a little too far doesn't it\nWell it's really it's really disappointing uh\nYou know it's one thing to debate the issues and and it's healthy to disagree on stuff you know at the end of the day uh when you talk facts facts wrong you wind up with better legislation with better ideas you know and\nAnd it helps you know

dot com they'll call you a magic valley this morning\nA Twenty one and we're at forty six and um we should note that even on that address passing a law [noise]\nUltimately still comes down to a [noise] to court or even you know in that situation and make a decision on whether you were in violation or not it's not as if somebody throwing you in jail and throwing away the key a representative you wanted to make another comment in fact a about\nA ... all of these attacks come to you are trying to do a term they claimed to sell off all the public lands\nYeah yeah I think there's a couple of things that people really no need to understand them and read a little phrase that she taught trespass is\nAny person who enters the real property of another without permission commit civil trust us so that's the old law the new law that's the the two words or remains that says any person who enters or remains\nUnreal property commit civil trust but that's the essence of the change in the law\nIt is just absolutely not true if it's not clear that that's probably the land and the person isn't as trespassing there's a there's a known a sudden the landowner to mark land whether it's a fence line\nWhether it's a no trespassing signs these things to do that a reasonable person would understand I think that's the real key that died like people to remember about that this isn't a gotcha deal\nThis is a method of trying to come up with something does that as more easily recognizable and easier to understand by both the landowner and someone and turning next to that land\nIs another area that they're attacking you on a here over the last few years there's been a change goes on in this country and that somehow\nThe father's set aside healthcare is a right obviously they didn't but um they're not claiming that that you're trying to take away health coverage of the working more in the state of Idaho and uh\nAnd I think they did the one mailings said Steve Miller doesn't care about working Idaho and like us I I did mention you unfair I said that opens up with is the difference between me and Representative Steve Miller the grammar is atrocious by\nThe uh the ... I guess this might be dealing with proposition to\nWell it has to do with a I think what the root of this comes from is the legislation that we had last session on Medicaid expansion and the two associated waivers\nUm there were two things that happened a bill that came on the floor once and they sat there for a while\nAnd leadership and the chairman of the committee wanted to bring back the committee so when that happens then the floor votes to move that bill back to the committee and I thought there might be some further action taken on it at that time\nSo that toward this uh that's the only basis of fact\nIn this ad that talks about Steve Miller kill the bill that would have given thousands of Idaho and access to health care\nWhile later on in the committee brought that to the floor again for consideration and are there just weren't the votes to get it off the floor to vote for it\nAnd a leadership decided rather than killing that on the floor which should be really a lot harder to do with anything in the future that it would be smarter to take it back to committee again and the committee chair requested that bill coming back to committee\nAnd I actually uh I voted for it to stay on the floor because I thought it would have been better better for Idaho and and better for all of the discussion about health care to actually vote on it\nAnd bring it to a head so you had two different ways of looking at having how to handle that situation\nBut uh you know ... I Wish I had the power to to kill a bill like at all by myself\nA this is just another situation where it's blown clear out of proportion the fact of the matter is we [noise] excuse me where we're just trying to come up with the best solution would be good for the situation will have to work with\nA couple of minutes left how do you think you got to the point where things do twisted words and legislative action\nOn all these attacks have been successful\nIn other areas\nSeen what's happened in DC and over the last few years I never dreamed that would get to Idaho this is very disappointing to me that it has that uh the liberals have decided that Idaho is a is a target state and within that\nAnd there's four races like mine where they're very closely divided and uh they've targeted a lot of money um my opponent raised over Seventy thousand dollars by the first dog over\nThese packs of probably I think there are six rounds of cards you gotta figure they\nProbably put up Fifteen to twenty thousand dollars that's a lot of money in one house race in a state the size of Idaho and and that's just the way they've decided they're going to attack a conservatives and Republicans\nWas gonna say Seventy thousand dollars even in an urban district you need a county would be considered a lot of money to spend on a political race\nThey're uh they're really coming after me\nWe are um and I guess this is not just one of these races like this around the state and I know that they have so little power in Boise a I guess they use it or anything goes in a particular situation like this and then I\nDon't know how does your opponent or hold her head up in public if she's part of this\nReal part of the deal is that to win a pack there's a political ad they can't talk to the candidates are supporting and uh and so there is no discussion\nBetween the political candidate and the people that are spending the money they come up with their own ads they run them [noise] um\nSo there there's been this separation\nAnd and I actually asked my opponent if she wanted to uh to come at a news negative ads you know the\nNose to untruth and uh she declined to do so so I you know I guess I've ruined come in and to put up for what they believe that means that uh that was disappointing to me\nAnd they get ... high ability by saying it's not me it's the pack and then they can stay silent\nAnd then they get a free ride for all the negative ads\nRepresentative I Wish you luck I thank you for taking some time out with us today to to to walk people through all of this and we hope that it will

Bernie Sanders according to Washington Examiner encourage voters Saturday to get off the couch and vote in the mid term elections\nAnd the way our interfering with people's attention to politics or

for democracy for\n... years ago something there's traditional is a baseball or Sanders want you to walk away from it so you can hear more of his grades I Know that you were probably all sit around thinking yeah you know I'm Glad Bernie was there to uh to divert you say go living in\nSo many that are watching baseball was bad in comparison to adopting this political views we're very much crossroads this election coming up in a\nA week because depending on who you know maybe we take for granted in a place like Idaho because of the so overwhelmingly Republican but this is not what the rest of the nation is dealing with and\nThe result next Tuesday could bring a halt to everything that we've we've witnessed over the last well call it um sixteen Eighteen months\nThe wall Street Journal points out today that if we continue this growth the economic growth or the GDP Growth that we're seeing this will be the best year for the economy is nearly a decade and a half\nThat's a long time and it you know we we were we were told this was never going to happen again but if you have\nAn they listed a number of threats that they could see happening and one of those that says a policy led Congress could harm any further growth that we see ahead\nSo that's something important to see but you got to understand the guy like Bernie Sanders he doesn't care he'd like to destroy what we currently have he's an enemy\nOf capitalism over at the Washington Post the economist Robert\nSamuelson is reviewing a new book\nAnd a and it has fear is that capitalism is not going to well make it to the end of this century and could be gone long before that he is reviewing a book that was written by Alan Greenspan you may remember him from his time at the Federal Reserve and a fellow named Adrian ... an editor at the economist\nAnd they went back and they looked at the history of capitalism\nIn the states a lot of people think that capitalism works in spurts\nAnd then there's a long during that period networks in spurts again\nBut he says if you if you read the book you did a pretty good indication that capitalism is continually coming up with new ideas that benefit people across the world especially those in countries that practice it\nIt gives you an example he says between Seventeen Ninety after the revolution and Eighteen sixty with a civil war people generally believe that not a lot happened oh we move westward a few more trees got cut down\nYou know if you were ... were were dragged across the country and there was some more planting\nBought in Seventeen Ninety three he lie Whitney invented the cotton gin\nAnd that helped the southern economy now we have to admit it probably for a long slavery too as well but it made the cotton industry just take off which hadn't been a very profitable industry which that cotton industry then help the United states with its balance of trade with Europe and really made Europe dependent on the United states\nAnd then along came in Eighteen twenty five the writer says the Erie Canal\nAnd then the canal building boom came about and that went on through Eighteen fifty and by that time we had thirty seven hundred miles of canals in this country moving goods back and forth goods and services before had those goods and services would have been very difficult to move around\nAnd Eighteen eighty four Samuel Morse came up with a telegraph\nAnd and rolled rich it's more important than the later introduction of the telephone which they say mainly just stimulated socializing by contrast the telegraph quickly expanded the reach of business railroads were big users because they needed to coordinate trained movements\nBut the writer says the truth is capitalism is a joint venture between the private sector and public policies that regulations taxes government spending and monetary policy laissez faire no longer exists seats that have died a long time ago but the interaction of so many pressures frustrates our\nAbility to control the outcome other words we may still be dealing with far too many regulations and if we could just step back\nFrom the U.S the other day I read a great piece and I showed it on my Facebook\nPage and that was about a study that was done they went back into the early Nineteen eighties they the researchers during this paper and they examined the laws that were written and they determined the writers that are that the United states was an oligarchy and uh\nAnd that you know that we basically have a country that's set up for the few and not for the Matty and\nI was reading through that and I thought well wait a minute every time I read one of these doom and gloom type of things to make a few comparisons first of all the government's as a professor of mine once told me I founded by special interests the United states was no different\nAnd if you'd like to go back and look at who the founding fathers were\nThey were the ... you know as they were ... we have this notion that they were a bunch of guys who picked up must be it and then you know they fought off the British and defeated them at Yorktown\nAnd then they said hey we've got this great idea for a Republican form of government but the people who are actually sitting in those conventions they were the most well heeled people in America\nAnd they certainly were going to look out for their interests now they set up a system of government that works extremely well when you don't interfere with it but still you know they they were a special interest group just like there are many special interest groups all over the planet so to sit here and say that things are different today\nReally isn't true that if you look back at the industrial age when the robber barons us they recalled first got control of this country it was far worse than it is today people like J. P. Morgan at Rockefeller it so all of this as it is nothing\nNew to any of us to sit here and say that all of these laws and favor just a few and all of these changes or whether it be in finance and the like the favorite just a few I look back and I actually wrote opposed for our website about this which is up today\nAnd I look back at what could because they started that the studies in the early Nineteen eighties I look back at what my life was like in the Nineteen seventies and you know getting all this not for the faint of heart\nBut sometimes getting all allows you to look back over time and make some comparisons because in about Nineteen Seventy eight or Seventy nine my family got this contraption called a microwave oven\nLions seen ... you'd be watching\nThe TV game show and they'd give away a prize called and I'm at a radar range which was a microwave oven\nAnd they were hugely expensive through the Nineteen sixties and the good part of the Nineteen seventies but then suddenly the Nineteen seventies they became cheaper and cheaper and cheaper video games that only been around for just a few short years and they were the ... it's like looking at modern writing verses hieroglyphics", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Top Story", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "29"}
