getting to that time of year where they forty three\nSo things are getting to that time of year where it eight forty three and it's forty one and magic value this morning are joining us in Studio a lieutenant Dan brown and sergeant can mental or from the twin towers county sheriff's department bill collie as well on news radio thirteenth entail I ex news radio Thirteen tend to a a comment or question\nOr two zero eight seven three six zero three hundred\nSo you've got people out of nowhere hunting this time of year and I think that before he left Celts and it said that they always reminds people you've got to be in shape first of all when you get out there\nBut a lot of times people get out there and you can become disoriented fast so we've got some people missing in the state right now in various places because they apparently got separated from groups they happen to be with a I was in the south hills uh two or three weeks ago and\nI just do a little trail walking but you realize after a while a lot of the trails look exactly alike if you're not familiar with where you're at right\nThis time of year you're going to have people who sometimes they don't make it back to camp [noise]\nYeah you know in the again one of the biggest things that we we preach about that as be prepared for where you're going and where you're going to do you know have the right clothing have\nThe right foot where um if you have a GPS again make sure your batteries for it um and also understand that that you know bringing up the the beans she in shape is a fan you know that's absolutely you're hiking in a higher\nElevation and it's very um stress on the muscles will say but a search and rescue gets called out about every year for a an overdue are missing hunter or a hiker and a lot of times it's you know they got tired\nThey um we've had people that have suffered heart attacks\nUh and we have to go look for them um but you know you go the other direction and you talked about the trails look the same the throng blanket flight up there in the mountains and everything looks totally different so if you thought you knew where you were\nAnd now you changed the color of his\nYou know people that won't get people disoriented they think they know where they're at but they really don't there someplace totally opposite you know they're off half a mile from where they think they are\nBeing up in the air and you sometimes see us place that you know you're familiar with when you see it from up there and use it wait a second I didn't realize it changes your whole perspective on everything that has a little bit like that\nYeah you know the ... a blanket of snow cover up landmarks you know something that you can see from the ground and and now instead of having\nLandmark you just see a blanket applied so it it really changes the perspective of it\nI've been out and the other problem I discovered to as it doesn't take too long in some parts of the state to be completely out of contact\nI was up in the sun valley and I went out past the lodge and I just decided one day to keep driving and drove and drove for about twenty twenty five minutes and I thought on that take some pictures in text them to some people I Know and suddenly realized protects wasn't working a it was because I was already out of range and how quickly of arise and has a map\nIf you put it up and they show you where they've got coverage one of the few places in the country with a lot of big gaps happens to be Idaho [noise] that's right because I Do as mountains here and\nYou see that as you're headed up the ... south hills that once you get up past on as your head of that now thirty hundred is do you get past political road you make a couple of those few cars all of the ... and you have no phone service no matter who your carrier is\nLeaving struggle sometimes with a radio frequencies being able to connect with our dispatch center so we have to go to the one frequency that we know that law always worked for us up there in the south hills\nContact at that point you're really only left with a two way radio to speak with other members in your party they're close proximity or a satellite phone because everything else basically doesn't work up there\nIt may be costly but you know you could have maybe a GPS unit or something but if you're gonna do these things you shouldn't do them on the cheap if you're going to be up there especially this time of year\nNow and I think for the most park you'll find that people that are spent a lot of time in the back country and recreating under serious record readers don't go cheap simply because they've either learn from experience or it's you know the next new toy that comes out like a\nYou know they've they've got something called a spot which is you know it's a low cater that you can send messages on his ... no matter where you're at in a world um and you can send a message saying I'm find or I Need help or nine one one you know something of that and that shows where you're at\nYou can show your locations on Google Earth I Believe but people that\nYou know recreate and do a lot of back country hunting and snowmobile ing and cross country skiing they don't go cheap and there's a reason for that\nBecause they want the equipment to work when they needed so I I think for you know for the most part people that are there all the time are prepared for the ones that go up occasionally those are the those are the best the crew that you know they'll they're going to get what will make do and go have fun\nI think that people sometimes on a lark some friends say oh let's go up there and then all of a sudden they let's take a walk up the trail and and the other part of that too is if you're not familiar with that you put your foot in the wrong place you you twist your ankle or any number of things like that can happen\nIf if you're out there and I think the thing you've got to do is not panic because if you'd maybe try to keep your head clear\nYou might survive until someone comes and gets you\nA lot of there's so many other different types of scenarios as well\nYou know equipment break down and get a snowmobile that breaks down twenty miles off where you\nWhere are you loaded and again you get disoriented and pretty soon as you know if you're by yourself or you know you get some really deep powder and your sled get stuck a ... and then you're kind of you know\nOn your own to try and figure out how to get out from there as just a matter of really making sure that you're prepared and you know your surroundings and you have the necessary tools and the Clements to get you by until you can get that help her get out\nOf hazardous as if for European look go in and look for someone who might be out in the middle of nowhere like that\nWell there's always the inherent danger of you know the same thing of either rolling over snowmobile or I'm hitting rock or you know the I mean that that inherent dangers always there when we go out so and we don't go out by ourselves on a search\nUm we go in teams so we try to make it as safe as we can only go look for someone else the object is you know obviously not for us to have to go out and rescue one of our own when we're trying to rescue somebody else so [noise] um there is a danger there but but not\nGoal

L. I. X. and a news radio Thirteen tend to\nUh uh we had a conversation just brings me off air a couple of days ago I sent the two of you are linked to happen to see a there's a website called uh they're resurgent or the ... and I think they use both names but all the ...\nAll the people who write for it or\nThey're from the P. C. A. that's Presbyterian Church in America and so they they they write about current events but they also write about them a lot from a a faith perspective and one of the writers was talking about how you got there is this fellow was written a book about this called the\nBenedict option and that's where you just pull yourself out of\nIt as a Christian amount of daily life and try to avoid all the the worst parts of it and the temptations and those people that might lead you astray but this writer was saying he thinks that we've got to be engaged and he says that that they've Christ himself was telling us we have to be engaged while we're here on this er\n[noise] yeah I think there is a Christian certainly has to to be real careful about how he wants to navigate himself through especially like a political season where elections are on\nAnd and of course public discourse in debate is in place at the workplace that whole or in the neighborhood to talking about\nWho they're going to allow a vote for who signed gets put out in their in their yard or what have you I think a Christian has to really be careful about how he's going to navigate himself through such a date and pulling out and digging a hole in sticking our heads in the ground is I I Would argue is no option\nA for a Christian in this American culture where we have the opportunity to be engaged in the process um if if we just barrier barrier heads in the sand\nThere we have the opportunity to be engaged in the process um if if we just barrier barrier heads in the sand and pretend like well there's nothing really going on and then we're not being a beneficial to the culture at large and that's there's a lot of opinion tied into this uh and that's my opinion [laughter]\n\n\n\nMe three Thirteen palm\nHarbor you build your\nDream windfall for anyone to my appreciation of him during the day when they pull for failing hearing therapy a commercial ...

privilege of posturing that that's going to church\nTo forming avenue northeast corner of getting and may um\nWe wake up early birds nine o'clock in is when we start service posted on this\nEarly birds size you know that impression I drive to work really early and I'm always shocked by how many people are already out also headed to worked out during those hours and I I Am sure that on weekends each who aren't getting a lot of sleep\nI Know [laughter]\nEvery student a hospital visits and services or do you want to point out again telephone number two zero eight seven three six zero three hundred out of me to throw a complete curve ball here but we've got another thing that has been\nOn my mind the last few days and you know in the summertime when I walked into Walmart one day and it was I think beginning of August and the Halloween candy was out I realize okay that'll that's just the foreshadowing what's coming up next and now\nYou can even walk into a home improvement store in the first thing you see standing there was a Christmas tree [noise] um we're getting that time of year where I think for\nChristians there's a real challenge between trying to maintain the nature of that faith\nVersus the commercialism of what's coming up and this was always that every year at this time it's supposed to become a real struggle and and I don't mean to I I realize they have to sell things in retail but still almost depresses me when I see\nAll of these decorations up sometimes as early as September\n[laughter] they do seem to come earlier every year and then there's there are stories that are devoted to seasonal holidays because there are the cash cow of the of the economy and um you know what\nI think for the Christian who just has to always be navigating himself of how do I I don't match this cultural tradition that is enjoyable and pleasant and fun and a lot of family connected to a lot of memories connected to them\nHow do I navigate through that while at the same time not letting that overshadow the reality especially with Christmas of\nAh of the focus of on the birth of our game or a Jesus Christ and so it was just walking carefully and that is always important\nYeah I think you don't take it you know God says that he had to have any other guys before him and so at the Christian he's he's navigating life with a desire to honor Christ and and um you know the Horning heart is evil claimed to what is good um but yet you know having similar celebration and things like that\nAnd the main focus has to be Christ in his kingdom and has gotten us in his word\nAnd so I think his family she got it and navigate that in the courtroom to that truth desiring um some people just totally ignore all those which is fine uh for them um\nYou know but how do we deal with similar things or if there's one thing in my family um my wife left hallmark and it's only twenty four seven and uh so we don't get a lot of that stuff that they're promoting um what holiday as Mr do when we go to stores things getting an ad that boggles me\nYeah I was actually just about to speak to Thanksgiving because really all in all reality these ... these these big holidays that are just around the corner really are at the core more spiritual than they are commercial uh\nHalloween we've not had much of a discussion even Baron I Halloween is certainly a spiritual moment even though culturally it's a lot about candy and kids and such but\nThere is this one holiday that is interwoven into our civil culture called Thanksgiving that is an ordained a\nHoliday by our government to call the people of the nation to look to God and get answers to give thanks to him for the bounty for the harvest for the piece for the joy that we have it's an amazing holiday yes it is my favorite yes right I agree with you I\nAm I going to bring that up because I I we're not giving thanks to the president's daughter our congressmen\nI'm thankful for the job that allows me to buy the feast but I\nIn my household that was the most important holiday family holiday to deal with extended family and it was an honor to be the house that year 'cause we would rotate homes how's that year that would host it and I have a friend in England who told me one time he said\nI said that we should I one thing you said I if I'm Jealous about anything and he said is that we don't pass\nThe Thanksgiving holiday because the U.S and Canada have that and and he said that nobody in England has ever really managed to get this established\nAnd and and so we are so unique in this part of the world yeah or just these two countries ... at a few some countries probably have it around the world as well that of adopted it but really English speaking North America is primarily the only place where it has become such an ingrained part of the culture\nYeah cause and other stinking holiday right we're going to look around us and look at what we're thankful for and what we've been blessed with in one Portland when it comes to God's Supreme overall that and so there is one thing evil about Thanksgiving and it's called cranberry sauce\n[laughter] hot [laughter]\nAt least some of my\nI watched a video yesterday about the Irish trying some of our Thanksgiving foods and when the ... and they it's a mixed reviews about what some and gave them cornbread they couldn't stop eating the stuff they republic plates away from other [laughter]\nMaking the green backing supporting your family or is it turn\nAll questions at stake there is a battle that we're living in right now and I really believe it's a battle between good and evil and I am so thankful for the show because it it opened up to me that there's something greater than ourselves let\nYou run on that that's a great way

providers are able to explain the science of how we hear how hearing loss affects sales and why choosing to address a possible hearing loss as important as they look forward\nTo meeting you call to zero eight three one two zero nine five seven to schedule your free initial consultation today a caller just before the break brought up a point about how especially as you get older you start to um people\nWho are realizing their mortality I think especially begin to take off their faith a little bit more seriously and what's the meaning is and\nThen he hears point when he was saying that all of these other things around us is shifting fans really\nUh don't matter a whole lot when you look at the grand scheme of your ...\nSounds like there's a book written about that called queasy asked the worst sour Solomon left the life and said you know when all is vanity I was like a paper we're hearing on she always tells us\nAnd you're right what what means the most in seeking a got an enhanced truth is is paramount out as as far as the Christian and I rejoice what the caller that he's he's getting into scriptures last week of course talking about spiritual discernment\nAnd the scriptures are alive\nAnd they they ... their God breed and so it's one of those things where\nUh sometimes people think churches boring and dad I mean we're in the middle of the study of Daniel and it's just electrifying to see what God is dealing aspires right now and prophecy stage of all that and it's just a very dynamic this now that we have a sovereign gathers of control of all things and yet this was written how long ago\nRight right the caller really expressed a a real authentic and genuine awe\nObservation of what he's doing is looking at himself looking at who God is in an even express the the reality of the great difference between holy God and wretched man and the act of love of what Christ did for us in doing what\nWe could not do ever for our own selves to come in to pay the payment that is required for my sins Christ is the only one who could do that what a blessing joy that is and so I rejoice with the caller in in the search that that uh he's in and\nI Would encourage him and and all others in myself even to continue searching the scriptures like like I\nLike like like a gold mine or puts a lamp on his on his head with the land of scripture illuminate the path\nOf your life and find the treasures of God right here\nMy I was going to say for a lot of people out there and and my guess is and you know I I don't know the caller personally but my guess there's a lot of people like him and he mentioned his mother they had a strong\nPresence in their life and it probably regular church attendance when they were young and while that may not necessarily be in their lives anymore it keeps calling to you or I don't know if that's a good way to put that or not but something is calling a and and and as he pointed out he was just his\nIs turned around in many ways\nYeah you know the scripture says that you know when he's proclaimed its its its return is without void other words it has evidence in Seoul and um and so sometimes you know I think the world will ... you know people out of\nPrice them out of a bank Christ and and yet they hear that still small voice on back and they reflect relies especially when they taste or go after like he said the green back and how fleeting at is um it's just ah this this this world is not fulfilling and a\nChrist is the only satisfy thing that that that is going to complete everything that that you're searching for in a sense that got as it is you're creator he's your salvation Hoosier lord is going to be your ... he's going to establish the kingdom that that he sits on and so everything that we desires found in Christ\nDrinking remember of course we talked earlier about this mad Christmas rush where people are they ... they buy a lot of things and\nI if you'd impair you referenced the fact of false God's um do you have to be careful that you don't fall into that trap and forget what really is important when I was a younger guy and I was working at a TV station and the I guess mid to late Nineteen Ninety\nTwo co workers of mine one he was raised nominally Muslim his family wasn't very religious but that's what his parents had been but he told me he said he said I Love Christmas I said why is that is it because it's so beautiful and he's talking about when he walked through the Maltese saw the lights and the trees and those types of things\nI'm at it and you know but but that was his own experience with it was seeing what you saw at the mall and then another coworker\nShe was Jewish and I have a conversation with her one day and she'd gone for many years not realizing that Easter is\nThat these stories are top holiday and\nChristmas because the commercialization of Christmas that Governor the impression and all the TV shows in the movies uh the Christmas was the big day\nAnd I had to tell her about something one of my school teachers my ... one of my school teachers went to Greece when I was in sixth grade and she came back from a trip there that she said that the comment she had from a lot of grief she met was Americans because they've so commercialized Christmas or don't realize that without Easter it's just the birth\nOf another baby I saw all of these things come together and we're dealing with all of this in a in a culture and I and again I realized people have to make money but um\nYou know people who come from outside Christianity and looking at us from thinking that's what it's all about that it's it's a couple of reindeer and sort of trees and some nice tinsel\n[laughter] right you know when when God he brings us this truth he does the miraculous thing and you look at at Christmas\nAt the thought of a of a baby born of a version a star Bethlehem the angels calming the significance of ... of Christ coming in and eat and then you
