I Can't believe that there's I mean it's like libertarians don't want to win\nYes it really is yet again you can remember as third party in general the system is act\nAgainst you and some of the day was telling me they said you know only someone who has like a marine mentality could do this because every day I'm up against failure but the marine corps taught me take the hill the cap and shot\nTake the hill the machine guns broken\nTake the hill radios don't work take the hell are stopped giving excuses take the hell I get it and that's what I Do I take the hill as a matter I get I literally deal with failure everyday this woman every day and when I say that\nThat's not an exaggeration that every single day as I mentioned earlier there's going to be a debate coming up here tomorrow WCBS and they're only going to include the Democrat Republican even though I'm On the ballot even those thirty one thousand New Yorkers signed a petition to get me on that ballot WCBS they got him in him shelling is his name\nHe there's decided nope lottery shop doesn't this will be on there he's decided that the establishment is all that matters this is what I'm up against it's not going to stop me I'm Still taking the hill but it's yet another obstacle to get over\nSo if you're a libertarian or you're hearing something that um that to you think should be heard than you should probably uh maybe tweet\nStorm what's his name again at CBS size WCBS radio eight eighty radio uh it's I think that was ... so this is a radio debate yes again and they're just deciding no we don't want them to tell me wrong there are three other people should be made should also be the Green Party and also the same party they should all be there\nBut this is the norm and we put up against this group against is constantly\nAnd here's the the worst part with all of this we're still growing and they're still going down that's that's the sad part they don't they don't they don't realize that when a sinking ship mhm or maybe they don't care\nIf people want to donate hopefully doing Larry shop dot com slash donate and to be clear if some of you want to get forty five thousand dollars you can't the maximum forty four thousand [laughter]\nBy New York state law so if you I Know well sometimes I I Want to get like forty five thousand dollars sorry you can't do it forty four you only can get forty four thousand that's all you can get a okay\nSharp a dot com this with an e at the end of sharp um I Want I Want to talk to you about some of the issues are\nForty four thousand is all you can get well okay you Larry sharp a dot com that's with an e at the end of sharp um I Would I Want to talk to you about some of the issues are of the day and and how we solve some of the things like for instance healthcare yes how to use all health care will do that coming up in a just a second\nIt yes it's so bad it is so bad that the Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and said thank you Cuomo because older retirees we have\nAre going to Florida and their pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and these pensions now aren't being spent in New York state they being spent in Florida we're lily we're literally writing checks to Florida every single month horrible that's how bad it is yes\nSo let's take pensions though sure pensions are ... it's a ticking time bomb yes there's no way to pay for it yeah you've you're going to break all of the promises ... who worked their whole life and were promised ally\nYup what do you do you see it here in Texas was your belief or oh yeah you see it right here in Dallas Dallas you ate already already happening I may have all the time in New York state we are the most unionized state in the entire nation ... show painted a critical right now Penn is er about Fifteen or sixteen percent of our budget\nAnd a budget as a hundred and Seventy billion dollars it's double Florida and Florida has more people than us wow yes for about eighty five billion and the more people than us\nA hundred and Seventy billion dollars it's double Florida and Florida has more people than us wow yes for about eighty five billion and they have more people than us and we have a hundred and Seventy billion dollar budget how about just massive and it's getting bigger and a bunch of getting bigger and so are the percentages of the other pensions but on top of that a\nNew York state has about a three hundred million dollar debt and about a four to five they now deficit so it's a bad\nBad and then you add the people I was telling me about Lowry the pension fund is good their right to fund itself is relatively well some of the opposite opinion doing very well some of the city wants or disaster but overall I mean well they don't realize it's being also funded by our tax base a budget that keeps putting money into it the problem is in the front right now that's great\nThe problem is the actual budget at one point it gets so big that we simply can't pay me more as you're seeing in Dallas\nAnd my response to tell me about Larry's in the constitution yeah and I get that asked Detroit right asking what do we go right ask\nVenezuela and it was all legal for them to one there's no money it doesn't get funded when it doesn't get funded that eventually will collapse\nIf that collapses if our pension fund collapsed near state we become Somalia overnight I don't want to become a Somali overnight I Want to stop that I'm the only guy talking about negotiating our pensions and to the right which is some type of four one K. fall through it'd be something like that\nAnd I'm going to go with every single union that will take forever I Know\nThat's why I say it's a four year plan is for you plan to make us or what New York state is paying either a flat fee and or a flat percentage that sustainable because the issue we have is a a lot of people are pensions who no longer paying it any more mhm somebody has to have to keep paying them until they do need pennies anymore so we have to do that also\nUsed to be like ten firefighters supporting one now it's one supporting\nTo direct I think she was supporting for ... I think that's right I'm not sure but I was making them I think it's something I think it was twenty three or four or so yeah it's bad so now we have to make that change and the funny thing is people are attacking me saying lie wants to get rid of our pensions I'm like I'm the only guy trying to keep them on the other one's talking about reality I'm Talking I was actually happening\nIf you have a ... if you're ready for a pension now it's ten or Fifteen Years from now it's probably not going to be there for you\nBut why deal with that I mean it's human nature why deal with that if the two on the other side GOP and the Democrats are saying oh he's an extremist he's he's trying to spook you your pensions are fine it's human nature to follow them\nAgreed but I have a problem Glenn I care I have a problem I'm human I have a problem I Want people to stay in my state I Want people to stay in my state because if they don't my state's gonna collapse and I have\nTo move and I want to move I'm born and raised in New York state my family and friends are in New York state I Love my state ... ... people love New York they hate me off government New York state is very special it has the largest city in the entire nation it has an amazing\nWaterfall and I go falls it as mountains as cool as Colorado and has farmland all as yes I'm going to you I mean you know ... I Know farmland as cool as the mid west\nIt as amazing rivers and lakes and every you can imagine in New York is there is a beautiful diverse states and with destroying it because wedding one city run the entire state most of my my ideas about happiness to the other part is decentralization\nIt's about letting counties ... counties in regions be regions in towns be towns right people upstate tend to get upset with people in New York City saying well they're running it and they are bad and cut them off if you ran your own county you wouldn't care and that's what I Want to let people in New York City be New York city isn't right under the rug Rochester\nIsn't that what we're we're debating now over the electoral college the only reason why we're debating the electoral college is because it's the original debate I\nSo tell me in the middle of the country how to live my life yes your lead San Francisco bay San Francisco and ... the group on the streets that's fine yes but we're different here\nYes and maybe you want to visit them once in a while right then ... look at the poop refine what right everything is\nAnd they should be allowed to do to their city their county but they want to do a hundred\nPercent true and it's not happening and the issue as we're getting more and more centralized control it happens in any large organization as I told you I'm a business guy right and\nI'm the guy who I Will come in sometimes and try to help businesses to fix that make things better\nAnd the last thing I say as iron fist it's the last thing I say I hear all the time I go to a business owner and he goes my my leaders aren't doing what they want what they should do I take it to innovate ... to take that you're taking your all your things and the last thing I say it's iron\nFist I say give them actually more freedom here's what I Know it's it's literally an equation personal freedom plus transparency plus accountability\nEquals innovation that happens all the time you give the people more freedom let the leaders take charge someone make mistakes but ... as long as you're transparent you learn from them you become humbled by them which is fine we don't make mistakes\nBut then what you don't want to simply want to make a mistake blame someone else now you see that these elite as you don't need which are the ones who will not make any mistakes there doing nothing those elite as you don't need you need the ones to get up\nTry do well hit a couple of home runs strike out sometimes get better become humble become better leaders in the long run that's how you make it better organization we don't have that now\nLeary is going to join me for a a pod cast deal here uh about Ninety minutes uninterrupted a and we'll put that out on Saturday um Larry sharp is his name and ah you you need to be a need to listen to him I I have a feeling\nIf he doesn't win New York we're going to be seeing him a again a perhaps the elsewhere but he is he's worth your time to listen to and if you're in New York\nConsidered voting for can't imagine I Can't imagine what would stop you because it's not working as it is but that's just me Larry sharp as a S.

again how that\nIn the safe money accounts that I write you can get market upside potential with no downside bark at risk and you're thinking well how is that possible\nAnd I know that some of your probably even called your broker\nAnd your broker has said listen that's not possible you can't get market returns without risk it's not possible there's nothing out there like that what you're hearing on that radio program is not true so let me ask you this [noise]\nYou think that may be your broker either doesn't know about it or ... motivated by his own\nGain and is telling you something

information kit and my save money book read it for yourself this information will enlighten you\nOn how you can get stock market returns without risk yes it is possible my clients have been doing just that for over sixteen years not only is it possible\nBut you want to be able to enjoy those returns like many of my clients have\nAll without any downside market risk yes it is possible that's why you need to call me and ask for your free save money information get\nAt my free save money ... give me a call today eight five five for one two safe that's eight five five for one to seven to three three my\nSo let's talk today about the color of money now that's an\nInteresting analogy someone's you've seen the movie the color of money you've seen different commercials that talk about different colors of money I Wanna talk mainly about red money and green money today but I Want to start out talking about a couple of TV commercials I saw a recently\nOn one of the big nighttime game shows and um I watch this every night many of you listening probably know what show I'm Talking about but a couple of ... TV commercials that have\nRecently caught my attention is one of these starts out with a couple a\nThat are talking to one another and he mentions going out and spending money and she says well no you can't do that that's that money is our\nOrange money and he looks at her with this puzzled look and it's like orange money was orange money and she says well that's the money that we've designated\nFor our retirement fund and what's interesting is when I first saw this commercial I had the same question orange money what is that well come to find out it's really up a marketing ploy by that company ... it turns out that\nTheir logo along with the name of of their company is orange and so they're uh they're wanting you to invest\nYour money with them your retirement dollars your retirement money with them and they're going to call it orange money and um so I thought well okay I get it it's it's a marketing thing you want people to invest a your their money with you I\nI was also watching 'em on another night and there was a big celebrity that came on and he asked this question how much money do you have in your pocket right now\nAnd of course the you know the person on the commercial the the consumer says oh I got you know I got twenty bucks I got fifty bucks I got a hundred bucks and the the announcer goes on to say or the celebrity goes on to say if you want to take that money and invest it over time say twenty to Thirty years\nNow we're talking a big pile of money and in the background they had these big what looks like big giant boxes or that or the shape of a book and they're all stacked up and the announcer or the celebrity pushes the small one end to the next one up\nAnd then the next one that goes into the to the next larger one and there's like five of them in a row and by the time it it they they fall like dominoes the last one next to this big crash you know and that's that's your ah\nThe whole concept is that your retirement money growing\nAnd one small thing leads to another big thing and that leads to the next biggest thing and and so on and so forth and the whole point of that commercial is they want you to invest long term and and look at your retirement money as a long term investment say over twenty or Thirty years\nAnd and then one more one more commercial and and that is this company that um is a very large investment company and they have this big giant green role looks like a giant fruit roll up if you've ever seen one of those\nUm and they they begin to roll it out and so you then have this green a line that the consumer is walking on and as the green line turns with its its angles and turns and thanks you follow it and by the time you get to the end\nYou're supposed to have this again this pile of money or a\nThis retirement asset and again they want you to look at your money in long term and\nAnd I get all that here's the problem I have with these ah these commercials the first one it's all about them because they want you to invest in what they have now called orange money\nAnd doesn't really matter what color it is but that's that's because it's the color of their logo 'em\nAnd their their company name and so it's orange and so you know they want so it's all about that um the second one is they want you to invest and think of your investment as long term why why twenty to Thirty years because their target audience is that\nInvestor who they want not to panic when the stock market starts to take a died because if you call your broker right now and you say look I I think the market's gonna\nGonna tank we we we've seen some all time highest here I'm concerned about what's going to happen\nIn the future I'm concerned about the economy I really think it's time to get out and they're always talking about well now wait a minute this is long term we're not in this for the short term we're not in this for the end today out tomorrow this is your retirement savings and you need to look at it that\nI understand that too but\nIt again when that thing happens when the market takes a dive not if but when it becomes all about them\nAnd not about you and that's what's different about what I Do at save money I Want you to wrap\nYour mind around the idea of keeping your money safe and there's really only um\nWell I called to colors of money and that's red money and green money and that's what I Want to talk about uh today is the red money versus green money and what the difference is why are we calling it you know why why are all these companies coming up with these\nYou know different colors of money with all that about and I want you to look at your money as red money and green money and\nThat's why I Want you to give me a call when it gets them information into your hands it's my safe money information kid and my save money book it's free of charge\nYou just have to call and ask for it and um I Will I Will contact you and and get it to you on a local a lot of people don't know that right here in the Boise area so I Love an opportunity to get this information into your hands are\nFor my local listeners here in the Boise area as well as a twin falls in the surrounding areas are here as well as as a twin falls so here's the number eight five five for one two safe\nThat's eight five five for one to seven to three three ask for your free save money information kit and book I Want to get this information into your hands so he was\nSeven to three three ask for your free safe money information kit and book I Want to get this information into your hands so here's a here's a question I like to ask you how much of your money is currently in the market all of it fifty percent eighty percent [noise] did you make that\nDecision yourself\nOr did you have somebody make that decision for you to expose your retirement dollars to market risk\nDid it just kinda happened and that just happens to be where your money is that right now because along with talking about the color of money I Want to also talk about the safe side of your retirement portfolio and everybody should have a safe side\nThe difference between sides is is red and green safe and risk\nAnd want to talk a little bit more about that so green money is really money that you have earmarked or planned for retirement income and the future\nThat's really what it's about as I've said before the markets go up the markets go down how much of your life savings is exposed to the market risk is a very important consideration\nThis is a big deal folks that's why I strongly encourage everyone to think of your money in terms of red money and green money\nThose terms may sound a little funny um\nBut I Believe that it it it will help you understand a very important concept red money is money that we are willing to expose to market risk in hopes of a higher return [noise] we we accept the possibility of losses even significant losses\nIn hopes of a greater return or a greater game so red money is exposed to the upside and the downside of market risk and you have to be okay with that\nOkay let's talk about green money green money is about safe and security\nThe way that you're in when he grows with green money we are not willing to accept the risk of losses so we are willing to accept a little bit lower return in exchange for safety green money does not\nHave any downside there's no downside to green money so red money is exposed to upside and downside market risk\nThat's the risque side and green money only has upside market potential which one is better well that's probably not the right question to ask because neither one is inherently good or bad it really all depends it really all depends on where you're at\nIn your retirement plan\nAnd so just because I ... you know when I say retirement plan I don't mean in retirement and now now it could be but you really should start looking ahead\nTo the future in your retirement and really decide right now if you have a safe side of your retirement portfolio and you have the risque side if you have a a risk side being read money and the safe side bean green money and I\nTo I Want to show you how green money works and that's a very important question that we need to ask ourselves what percentage of my money should be read money and what percentage of my money should be green money should be safe\nKnow what everybody listening wants to know and that that is what is our winters where they're going to be like so we'll have Jay speak to south western Idaho Well Mark speak to eastern Oregon and and we'll go from there and and talk about some forecasts a little bit and and uh we'll dive into this discussion alright\nCancer treatment perfect and car hard make clear to get you anything so DMV

to keep your property looking neat and clean get hordes of ground clear vegetation killer today [noise]\nRight well Marc let's start with you this time so everybody wants to know what's in store for us what the winter is going to be like and no one's going to hold you responsible but uh\nForecasts are what are patterns what to look like we're going to be expecting in that eastern Oregon you know Pendleton down to ... grand area this this winter\nSure well you know it's always tricky 'cause we always say day to day weather can fluctuate ... quite a bit so you can go from a nice nice days like I think the last couple of weeks have been fantastic in our\nArea anyway I Can't say for Jay but you know we're looking at\nOr maybe going into kind of a weak El Nino and you know we throw these terms around like El Nino all I mean it's all tied to the water temperature in the equatorial\nPacific region and I actually can have some weight in terms of what we experience across different parts of the country and so uh what typically mean for the northwest anyway is a slightly drier\nSlightly milder winter on average\nThat doesn't mean we're not going to get any snow I hate to break the bad news for those people that might not want any but it does mean that you may expect a little bit less intimate tend to be just slightly warmer that average\nAnd how about here in South western Idaho\nMan it's a similar scenario here for a south western Idaho including eastern Oregon all the way over in and make her city um it looks him with El Nino that favors\nA warmer than normal average to read the whole winter I'm also going to break the little bit of actually will be good news for eastern Oregon because they're in moderate to severe drought\nSaid that he can he can actually use some snow assume that hopefully it will snow but the odds\nFever warmer and dryer slightly drier than normal conditions for this part of the country so that wouldn't be a good thing I Know I definitely have ongoing drought\nSo officially a the the trends make it look like a ... bomber and dryer winter in in both locations are from all the way from Pendleton down through the magic valley twin falls that's correct need even over in twin falls it looks like the same pattern now I've got a follow up question on that\nAnd I'm being selfish I'm going to be asking her questions specific for the treasure valley here but if it's drier and warmer 'cause I'm an indication of longer and more severe and versions\nWhen it's a good question typically when you have an inversion you have a rich of high pressure sitting over the years ... and um\nThat tends to favor an inversion sitting at MIT in favor initially clear sky\n... but then as they get shorter as she hit into a window on the surface will cool down to its cold you're near the surface ... than it is they lost it tends to be a very dry\nPattern the mountains you're warmer than normal said the forests continue to try and we don't get much snow in the valleys get stuck in nasty inversion cold and foggy in Boise that happens I I think over in your area to march\nI don't think there's pretty notorious for getting socked with clouds and fog and eyes and the tornadoes in laws and the teens you know just as the weather you know and that has to be really bad for like freezing drizzle and you know just get a pretty nasty yeah definitely\nLooks with no significant stipulation is you know try\nTo get the the cold and the grey without the snow okay well that's never fun I don't like the end versions I don't know are there any fans have been versions out there\n... years like inversions areas in his snowed in the mountains that or if you if you like to ski a it is beautiful in the mountains out here in Virginia it's usually warmer than normal and that the guy who will be will do and you come over the hill on highway fifty five\nFeet from Boise and you look down in the valley is just you know it's like an ocean there they're filled with clouds sale\nYou know I'm no skier but then versions turned me into one I Will go up to bogus basin to ski and get into the sunshine if we've had a you know three or four where the conversion or something like that for sure at the same thing over and the blue mountains to bloom ... over near me Kimball\nAnd get into the sunshine if you've had a you know three or four waking version or something like that for sure\nAt the same thing over and the blue mountains to blue meal you know when you're ... the inversion and gosh\nI haven't experienced that yet but I kind of look forward to it I get a chance to get up in the mountains and look out of that fear clouds and get some sun this winter\nWill falls is taken out of the commercial break and when we come back I Want to talk about these specific different areas where we've got listeners who are wanting to know kind of how the climate works where they're\nGetting pro great tools that primo prices at the end be used a

I don't know the technical term I'm sure you'll you'll teach me for example I went to a class put on by the national weather service\nBut in the old down in the magic valley so down near twin falls about a year ago and it was so I could become a weather spotter and so I can take photographs I could call in when I saw something that I could be the weather sponsors and while I was down there and the instructor said that\nFor South western Idaho Falls county was one of the most active\nWeather patterns that we have and so for me that meant a lot because I like exciting weather and so you can find more of a down there so obviously there's a little bit there's different climate dynamics and whether dynamic stay in the ... valley as opposed to the treasure valley as opposed to a\nBigger city in La Grande in Pendleton ah what are the those differences between those for reasons if if you can kind of give us just a general idea\nBut I just kind of start off\nBy saying that the weather in the west is actually very fascinating because ever varied terrain ... it was a little bit about that with the inversion ... can be really different than the valleys and so you know you start over in in ... theory in in Pendleton imagine a storm coming in\nFrom the west ... it's not going to be the same everywhere and it was really different the rise of the terrain that see that's the first principle if a forecasting in western United states and ... your dream mhm\nYeah and I would just add to that you know because it's relatively dry certainly coming from Tampa it's much much drier air temperatures can vary so much from location location so are we getting these you know really bad fire weather patterns\nEspecially when it's coming off the mountain as can be really bad idea get more heating it dries or shields out and get really strong line with us and a major changes from the valley is like you know we have the tri city area in our\nArea which gets out of out of Oregon I get up and to Washington but from there even to Pendleton and then into the mountains there's just so much variability there rainfall temperature in the winter\nIn the summer of ... just you name it they're so much so much change across such a short short us that's\nNow when it comes to that statement there was said to me when I took that class and people that went falls county as one of the most active weather areas is it to ponder feed that's impacting that in making that one of the most active weather areas here in South west\nPlay a role although in the summertime one of our waste your sources for this part of the world is the monsoon ... months scene which originate tumor northern Mexico trust\nIn moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific ocean and occasionally similar that moisture will come north and make it all the way up in Idaho every once in a while it'll go as far west as Oregon but the twin falls theory you usually is a little closer to that moisture than we are in Boise\nOr on here you make your city uh you know the further west you use the less likely you are to tap into that leap very moist monsoon moisture that originate to record the desert southwest\nWill tell you what let's take another break and when we come back I Want to talk about education a little bit and where people can learn more and and what you all do in terms of education and things like
