I say that anyway that you think uh they play tonight you think they're going to make it through tonight\nFor a minute by minute very vague score and Boston and the cold weather so they're definitely a better anyway [noise] took um a year and I take what they call I got that for fourth world series when I was running on a\nSchedule of I don't know I I don't even know what do you want to know what's your question\nArtist want to be able to pay the cowboys are a lot of people say it was a bad move for the cowboys legitimacy marrying him\nVery much a factor of draft anyway and I think it's going to take some of that pressure off of LA because I mean there there's a lot of the box replies Dallas yeah there's more of a box and I mean how big it was a good trade myself and I just want to hear all depending on\nYeah I mean I Love it and we appreciate the phone call it uh I I think it's a it's a little more than I wanted them to to trade in terms of a number one pick instead of a first round pick but when you've got\nReports of the eagles tossed around the idea of making that trade the Colts were thinking about doing it thinking about adding Murray Cooper and burying him with Andrew Luck which makes sense I think about the jets jets or reportedly kicking around this idea so\nI'm sort of the cowboys especially if you look in the division I much rather have a memory Cooper with that cowboys team then to see him with Philadelphia and have to go see him twice a year so yeah I liked the move Andy and look at that age deep wide receiver drafted and you've gotten\nThe services but Mari Cooper from this point throughout the rest of the season and I think that he's certainly a first round talent had you you know ... thought about it in let in the context of next year's draft where\nInstead of going with the keel Harry or whoever you're going within the first round you're going with Marie Cooper you certainly can make the argument that you're getting better value with Marie Cooper you know what you make\nBruce when he was a commentator for ESPN was hailing the move that they've Oakland Raiders guys I'm already Cooper so I was kinda like shot that he would just unload the guy that that's what kind of made me crazy I mean you you love the guy when you already SPN talking about it now you're as coach\nYou got rid of him so I don't understand that and maybe they seek help us and our number three ... and maybe he knows a little bit more about\nThis trade but if I may\nI'd like to go to go back to Thursday night because you a fish felt that it sets forty ... why do we gotta go here quite good well you keep talking about a mark Cooper\nOr not kidding I'm kidding about this show and watching five touchdowns Texas now won five straight they play a Denver next and it's thirty four touchdown passes the ... I had a damn Marino at thirty two for the second most and in the history of the Fifteen games that to me to show watch has not getting the accolades that he deserves you don't even hear about the guy\nYou know more about you rarely you don't\nWhen he got a lot of props after that went against the dolphins the dolphins defense I don't know what happened to them they were just decrepit that night\nAnd you know just showed Watson loses will fall or who is the wide receiver the speed ... out of Notre Dame he tore his ACL against the dolphins that's going to hurt him going forward but the reason he didn't hear a whole lot about the Sean watching this year Andy is\nHeading into that game he had ten touchdown seven picks\nYou know that's nothing to be like wow this guy's killing it 'cause that's like a lot better right now after eight five touchdown performance against the lowly dolphins at least defensively right you know Fifteen and seven looks a whole lot better than ten and seven but if you're not going to shower him with praise\nAfter getting the best of the dolphins well that's why you weren't before then [laughter] 'cause he was headed seven right\nYou're exactly right I won't I won't hurt you anymore would your dolphins because they start out like a house on fire and they kind of hit it but you know Ryan tannahill certain ion yeah and that but we're\nGoing on right now but think about every audience also think about this real quickly is if you look at Patrick my home's he's been amazing so far this year right right\nAnd some of the numbers that he's put up are comparable to what they're showing Watson was doing in a small sample size last year with those six starts so imagine if Patrick ... homes\nGot hurt and practice didn't play another game this year right now for this but just a hypothetical here and he starts out next season with ten touchdowns in seven interceptions he think anybody's you're showering him with brace no\nNo way the way it goes that's yeah that was in a love fest what the Shaun White and he's still trying to get back to form coming back from that torn ACL any showing signs you still incredibly talented but his numbers have taken a dip so far this year\nYou know and speaking of quarterback says talk about this game about three hours in London the eagles three and four at the jags three and four in London and the quarterback for the jazz obviously he is a problem Blake borders was benched\nAh you ... if you go back into the hot tub time machine remember when they made this new extra point rule and there were a lot of people there were like how much difference does it really going to make I mean really come on\nIt's made a big difference last week would be a huge indication of how big of a difference it made you\nKnow I I tell you what I'm not really a big advocate\nOf change because you know why I'm a staff\nGuy and like when you look at the record books it doesn't really mean anything because now you extra points at the thirty three yard line as opposed to what it used to be like was seven to ten yards out which is ridiculous so you can't do any comparisons right there but yes it does change the game the Pittsburgh Steelers and their situation they go to a lot more than they go for one\nThat's what they do right now because I'll admit now you know I mean if if you talk to my Tom I mean he will tell you that as it went into he'll go for the two I think that there was a lot more so more so than any other team in the league\nBut it's a better product it's more exciting I liked that it isn't a sure thing it is in a way up in the NFL having to do longer extra point it leads to some crazy outcomes\nThe game I Would have loved to sing overtime last week but the way it ended with Justin Dr missing an extra point that was exciting it was interesting it was a huge talking point you know so I imagine after a touchdown you don't just run to the fridge and like All right this is\nIt's already a done deal you've got to sit there and watch it like ... there's a lot of pressure on this kick is he going to make it and just you talked to one of the ... field goal kicker is ever misses the extra point and it just shows you it's anything but a lay up now I think\nThat a guy in a matter for field goals if if the odds are more automatic medics in any capacity really it was shocking to see him is that it had really\nWas it really what I tell you what though there's another situation that they really got to clean up the Baltimore and that's wide receiver Michael Crabtree I I don't believe how many\nPasses he's dropped and I'm looking for stats on teens I don't think they keep drops do they have you seen that that I don't see jobs that one of the ...\nPasses he's dropped and I'm looking for stats on teams I don't think they keep drops do they have you seen that that I don't see\nThat one of the common ones you know ... it's not one of the comedy categories you can find it but you got to do some ... you know you had to go in the back alley website and\nFind it on page nine instead of the front page you know what I mean right you got to really dig deep for that one but yeah I think that drops should be one of your main stats\nAre you involved when you're looking at wide receivers I I don't know what happened to crab trees hands I Know you remember him at Texas Tech Andy statute cut everything you hit it raising hands in college what happened to him in the NFL\nHe was even decent in San Francisco coming to Baltimore I don't know what happened here I really don't bug\nMe well it's been happening for the last couple of years I don't know if it's just the lack of concentration it's the lack of confidence that something's going on there maybe it's ... [laughter]\nYou don't say I'm just saying you know it's funny though you know when the Audrey Hopkins makes that insane catch that didn't count against the Miami Dolphins\nAnd people take way too much credit away and they're like well he's gloves I mean goodness these clubs you just stick your hand out there ... it doesn't work like that the entree Hopkins that catch was amazing the hotel back him junior catch against the cowboys couple of years ago was amazing it's not just the byproduct of really\nSticky modern gloves Michael Crabtree would be a great example of that the dude wears gloves and he's dropping passes left and right\nHe may be better off not wearing gloves really is not working with the gloves I say that right now we'll see what happens today and I got a pin you down over here was like I Do like they're able to this game and a close one who do you like in this one\n[noise] gosh I [noise]\nI'm gonna go with Carolina because they held the eagles to fifty eight yards rushing

X. and it wasn't like games one into there wasn't anything that was huge you know\nIt wasn't a huge story line where I got to weigh in on this it was one of these where okay\nWhy didn't they start their left handed guys why was there no Jack Peterson there was no ... next month the who hit to walk off Homer in game three right there was no Cody Ballenger like that's\nThat's not a huge topic at all so it didn't have a whole lot of legs it didn't have a whole lot of traction now these last couple of games with ... what happened with Dave Roberts last night the marathon Eighteen inning game there are some layers with that that can be carried around\nFor sure yeah and it was funny because the Eighteen again I'm not so certain how many people even stay up to three I Am eastern time to watch it\nBut you make a great point is a great talking point because people will call the office of the next day and say did you watch it and it's a conversation piece did\nYou see that you know what happens things like that so yeah I I just think right now that baseball is just sort of a\nFlux if you will as a downhill spiral and I don't know what they're going to do it I don't want to talk about it because I Want to talk about college football and what happened yesterday and I ask you right now let's give the first four teams right now and and the AP rankings perhaps this week I'm going to go to Alabama clumps in for one too\nRight number three I gotta go with the undefeated Irish and then another throwing the Ohio State even though they lost lives while\nYa oh LSU what are you going to put in their\nOhio State Ohio state's eleven NBA people right now you got to know what got him in the way it's going to it's going to jump around I just don't do rushed by brand new and ... do ... lost by ten points at but what do you\nKnow agreeing conference by conference I mean you look at Oklahoma they've got a week's schedule they really do do a pack twelve I'm not going to go anybody that ... twelve Washington state who do they do they play so what do you do\nMandy you've got three teams ease Alabama ... name well ahead of Ohio State right here right now you'd have to go with LSU clicking with LSU done they smacked around number two at the time Georgia\nThey smacked around they went on the road and beat Auburn and I know Auburn isn't ranked anymore but written statement when you beat a team that's highly ranked\nYou can't circle back and be like wow I mean look at their the ranking now where they're really low you're you're right about that time\nIt's like it better it's hard to remain highly ranked if you'll lose the game or a couple of them you know it's impossible almost at Michigan certainly is more worthy than Ohio State at this point\nAt their only losses at number three at the time\n... Michigan ... more worthy than Ohio State at this point at their only losses at number three at the time being right now Notre Dame you compare that to Ohio State losing on the road to Purdue it's apples and oranges\nThat was a terrible loss trials there but you know what though is could have been really interesting and ah it'll play out because the end of November Michigan will play Ohio State we'll see what happens there with the Big Ten and who's going to win that so it's kind of wide open but you still have some dominance teams and like the three dominant teams in my heart of hearts are\nAlabama Clemson I got to throw Notre Dame and there I really do their their dominant right now there are ...\nYeah I mean when you do not put it on the team in there\nThey would be in right now I just can't go with dominant when you're struggling and barely beat Ball State Vanderbilt hits you know these teams playing tough and\nThat is the second game of the year for Ball State that's\nThey're Super Bowl you know right and and then they've got and roll but I think that only goes so far if you're truly a dominant theme even though these lesser teams get up to play you you still should win comfortably and they have it so I Can't go with them as dominant but yeah they would be one of the playoff teams right here right now there's no doubt about it\nAll right well we move on but is known to leave that to rest I'm over to the national football league the jets the bears the jet stream for the bears the three three my line Chicago given up seven and a half seven and a half points to the jazz today what do you got eight\n[noise] why do we mean handy to see why I don't guys every week it's called the Internet it was it was it the minus nine and a half that's two points unacceptable\nCut the cyber guy I think you should be careful while navigating the menu because there are also options to delete your contacts frequent addresses or mapping\nThe directions can also be found on line at Kurtz website cyber guy dot com\nGoogle's website says they collect three types of data things you do like searches and websites you visit thinks you create such an e mails contacts you out at pictures you upload things that make you you name email address gender birthday among the few others with box on tax on an alley apple is Fox News\nMagazines with with Janice\nA ten year old from Virginia and make the dean's list after she saved her newborn cousin's life relatives say\nChloe carry on with home alone with her Twenty one year old and the family now knows that close ads had been hiding her pregnancy she went into the bathroom with stomach pains having no idea she was in labor Kobe that rushed into the bathroom where her aunt had just given birth\n... says she remembered watching several Youtube videos about taking care of baby dolls and she decided to put those skills to work with the real thing\nHer mom is so proud\nMother and baby are doing very well well done Chloe you are a hero and maybe even a doctor someday Jana theme\nShow by throwing jumped up there\nAnd let your school colors fly\nBall [noise]\nPlays Joan when you buy bold predictions for college football this year and all the action that may green\nBeans are covered right here box storage or Sunday\nWith ... and ... joins civil bought last novel opinion makers as they provide unique perspective and expert analysis we actually go to Jay and eleven am eastern on Fox Fox Sports [noise]\n\nWe'll take a peek at just about twenty minutes the hours are just ... I may be permitted by the way we're probably brought you buy I go to\nGreat news is a quick way you could save money switch to a guy go get it I go to accommodate the DVDs you could say fifty percent or more on your car insurance no Mr do I got the updated line okay I really do\nHope so I said before okay let's do this with the sea hawks that the lion's ... three three shield laws to the ... it was a good deed thirty three thirty one lion speak you adopt history to thirty one and as far as to draw the line I'm looking at right now [noise] to choice you know three\nYeah wow ... do you what do you mean what do you correct I'm Glad that the school\nSchemes put a little shed a little too on the games I've done that at times okay but the people who lives in a week old than the public service of giving them the line on these games at all the someone informed on what's going on yet I had no idea that these lines would move so much from last night until this morning oh\nI don't want to Andy it's a good game day of course they didn't move a ton\nYeah I I was like yeah this is going to any of his ... what do you see going down in this game because you look at too good running attacks surprisingly\nWith the sea hawks who couldn't hardly at all now all of a sudden they've cranked up that running game was Chris Carson and you look you carry an Johnson that young rookie for the lion's who's had a really strong season you get to good running games\nYou've got kj right coming back for Seattle which is big you get tied in at Dixon back as well so that helps\nYou get Seattle coming off of a by week but Seattle and play good pass the fence and you don't have a real Thomas back there so it's a toss up and this is just a literally Vegas has it as typically the home team gets three points that's exactly where the line is there like hey that you call it when he\nSaid oh no I I Would say that is the CEO of probably run the football more than any team in the league and they could have a big big against that ... we both agree on that however I Would say there's the lions have more of a balanced office I think the Seattle does and they can out of school or Seattle's attack\nAnd I think that Seattle could create turnovers but I don't see it happening I don't see I like the lions to win this game I really do not by much but I like the lions two maybe three or four\nYeah well you get snacks Harrison over their Damon Harrison coming over from the giants in a trade that should help out the lions horrible rush defense\nAnd they've been giving up an NFL high five point three yards per carry this season thinking about that Andy finds the three yards per carry that's crazy and I'll tell you this that\nThis is a spot for the lion's because they've got a much better shot in their division than the Seahawks do when there's with the Rand looking up the rams that's completely out of sight but right now look at the rest of the NFC North\nFrom the lions point of view if you put together a good performance and beat a Seattle team which isn't close to what they once were and they're totally be double if you win this game\nAll of a sudden you're foreign three he's got a winning record and you're at least neck and neck with other teams in the division the Packers could easily lose the day at the rams\nThe Vikings could lose at home on Sunday nights at the same you know you can be right there in the thick of things if you win a home game against Seattle and it worries me because it would be a complete lions thing\nTo do which just had not show up and lose this game at home after a nice performance last week against the dolphins\nRight and Seattle's got it on the football that's basically all they do because why they run the football because I think they're passing attack of some of the week I really believe that Saddam is one dimensional law sense and if they could run and I think they can\nRun against alliance and gain some ground heat up some ... run the clocks they got a shot I don't see it happening even though the Detroit Lions are susceptible to giving up a lot of yards I don't see it happening on the Detroit was this game [noise]\nYeah I [laughter] it's\nRough man I Would go the other way it's not a strong disagreement by me Andy because I liked the lions it's just one of these it's a classic spots of the lions to poll alliance you know yeah ad at NYU and you don't have a great rush defense in Seattle can be multi dimensional offensively I I don't love their past\nOh yeah and at NYU and you don't have a great rush defense in Seattle can be multi dimensional offensively I don't love they're passing game nearly as much as the lions\nBut I Do love Russell Wilson I think he's dynamic he's completely capable of at least passing for a decent amount of yard it's making some big plays you know it's not like Dr Prescott before he got I'm Ari Cooper in that passing off and it's better than that\nAnd I just look for the lions did they shoot themselves in the foot somehow some way\nDo they do that today and I think there's a decent chance after\nChance and speaking of people shooting themselves in the foot I mean look at the Cincinnati Bengals I talk about them for a second because I keep on going back to what I was more of a toilet several weeks ago don't fall in love with this team they're hosting the Tampa Bay bucks Tampa Bay is three and three bagels or foreign three but more than that\nThey've lost two straight and everybody was talking in Cincinnati Super Bowl Super Bowl that foreign three right now where they really\nAll that crazy to me that they want to fail over there but they they just want to go to the playoffs the hell of a ...\nBut the point is just so hungry for a winner and a team started oh so good and now they drop to this is one of those watershed games because it's going to be if they lose this game the players are going to be a rough road to hoe if they ... today\nAnd they're expected to win but these teams ... themselves in the mirror and they almost the same tremendous off that just on both teams and what happened last week I don't know what happened to the Bengals office but they've got demolished in Kansas City forty five to ten\nThe bug speak to browsing overtime so that was kind of a you know lock the state of twenty six twenty three but to me the gym is Winston\nLed the bugs and rushing last week and I see I'm running roughshod over the Bengals the fence today\nI yeah you've got a lot of injuries on both sides defensively where you look at Tempe and they lost their middle linebacker Kwame Alexander who is a good player might not\nHave Gerald McCoy today which is a big setback their secondary the Tampa Bay secondaries incredibly banged up so I think since he's going to get back on track offensively today\nI think you're going to have a big game from the bangles\nAnd yeah could Tampa score a lot of points to make it a close game\nBeing contention to win it yeah absolutely because the bangles or banged up defensively as well but I just the Cincinnati rebounding at home I just don't trust Tampa at all and what their rash of injuries I'm just going with the home team on this one if you think about the home team typically getting three points\nIf their favorite by four you're basically saying since the they one point favorite at home if you look at it that way I'm guilty and also in the as a one point favorite at home against has ... I Do\nI Do too and and I you know in my line has a big thing was given a three and a half to Tampa\nBay today the I've got it at four but again pointing to have no biggie there'll be All right\nThank you thank you very much animals the Tampa Bay defense is is close to the bottom of the league so I think the bagels can roll with their\nYeah yeah but the Redskins are playing at the giants washed is giving up a point in that game given up a point and I'll tell you what I'm going to make the case for my giants but as the giants won six Redskins of foreign to giants loves to Atlanta last week by three twenty three twenty Redskins beat Dallas by three twenty Seventeen and although the giant steak I I was\nBorn and bred a giants fan as a kid you look at their schedule that bad but all their games except\nThey gave me just a New Orleans saints and\nThat game was ugly they lost thirty three Eighteen they've been pretty darn close I'm taking the giants to beat the Redskins today and again in New Jersey I like the giants today although I'm Still thinking it's time to move on from Eli Manning but the point is this who do you move to that's the question\nRight yeah you just don't have that\nThat are up and coming quarterback that but I ... you know fourth round pick\nHe hasn't been an act he has been active [laughter] for a lot of gave this year or so yeah it's going to be ... by process of elimination\nBut you might be right on this pick adding that man that just reeks that just seems like such a sucker line doesn't it or Vegas it's like when Vegas puts their arm around you and they're like hey buddy hey would you like some spending cashier\nHow about the Redskins huh only a point and a half favorite against the giants you know how bad the giants have better they ask you about Iran holster as soon as they start trying to do you a favor with the line that's where I'm like whoa whoa whoa whoa I Know Vegas doesn't do favors\nAnd with a line this low for the Redskins who are clearly the better team I got big time questions here\nUm with the right there and say well you look at the reds 'cause you don't know what team of shows up first of all the pretty darn good at home and this was in a way game but you lose it the Indianapolis early in the season and then you'd be Green Bay the following week you just don't know what team shows up that's the problem with this Redskins team\nYeah and they haven't scored a touchdown in the third quarter for eleven straight games isn't that amazing a lesson straight we know that the third quarter is typically the lowest scoring quarter\nBut eleven straight games not one touchdown think about all the drive all the flu key things that could happen a special team scores\nEleven straight games not one touchdown think about all the drive all the ... the things that could happen in a special team scored nothing no touchdowns it's amazing to me\nBut they are going to have to figure it out\nAnd be consistent on a week to week basis because they've had a couple of nice performances\nThey held Christian McCaffrey ... Elliott too I combined fifty four yards rushing the last two weeks is really good so they should be tough against ache one ... and if you make them one dimensional and Eli Manning is under Senate you've got a great chance\nBut it does seem like a sucker back I wouldn't bet it's but if I had to choose I Would still go with Washington to win the game and I ... I guarantee you one thing I bet you\nThat this game will not be included and you'll be three on those picks I Know it just reeks it just reeks of a truck or bad and I can't I cannot in good faith go with the G ... I just can't do it can't be one of my three picks I could go with the note that much better I didn't think it would be\nA different way of life with a guy go thought sports radio studios but there's never a line on this game but it's the best of the day to find a barrel betting just break it next [noise]\n\nThe red Sox do one game away from another championship time to panic Dodger fans so who you're going to blame this one I Andrew Freedman analytics when it comes to the world series we've got a chart on Fox Sports radio\nWife make all the different rats when the Michelin Man is on your side helping you see veterans Dr Saper Michelin premium ... designed with exclusive ...\nMichelin relates to the curb\nGiving you unparalleled street free long lasting only\nSo when the going\nIs a difference you can see\nAlways Amazon and other find retailers know two wars commercial for\nThe real life catering my recipe for success heaping helping of commercial I Do in business concerns grandparents may have Web app customized insurance delusion that keeps my business cooking a\nOf wordplay was most unpleasant whereas commercial business insurance for progressive is anything but most of the progress of commercial book called the court today insurance for about ...\nOptics move crazy amounts of data at even crazier speeds and fighters by rising as the one hundred percent fiber optic network\nWith pilots getting a bit connection you'll get the fastest Internet available download speeds up to nine hundred and forty ...\nTV phone and it to your price guarantee offer Seventy nine Ninety nine per month with a two year agreement\nGet two hundred dollars shorter range of Google and that's smart um devices and a one hundred dollar visa prepaid card when you order online\nHurry opera and October thirty first go to get ... dot com and switched to the one hundred percent fiber optic network\nOne hundred percent phenomenal\nWith twenty five percent off on the NFL Seventy percent are previously refreshing you really need a better reason the party we don't think about how her new court punish are clear and talked with more than nine thousand square feet of new and previously in these furniture and acorn for your home and not so far from one Ninety nine Ninety nine bedrooms out some real Ninety nine Ninety nine\nDining room to Ninety nine Ninety nine animal I presented prizes and find all weekend long at are canceling court furniture clearance are wondering nine point lead Jackson memorial highway weren't online at ... dot com\nChoosing an energy company wages quest consolation for all of\nInterview with the Fisher Site for like a leash America's enjoy her more constellation dot com slash centers\n[noise] the dean's list with Janice Dean\nA ten year old from Virginia and make the dean's list after she saved her newborn cousin's life relatives say Chloe\nCarry on was home alone with her Twenty one year old and the family now knows that close ads had been hiding her pregnancy she went into the bathroom with stomach pains having no idea she was in labor Chloe then rushed into the bathroom where her aunt had just given birth\nClearly says she remembered watching several Youtube videos about taking care of baby dolls and she decided to put those skills to work with the real thing\nHer mom is so proud I Am very\nMother and baby are doing very well well done Chloe you are a hero and maybe even a doctor someday Janice team\n[noise] and now you can get verified on Instagram the photo sharing app owned by Facebook is introducing new tools to help rid the service of phony accounts popular accounts will soon get an option for users to get detailed information with verification\nAnd regular account users can go through a few steps to apply to be verified but it should be noted so far ... agents saying what qualifies as a popular account it will be easy to request verification do simply go into your settings and tap on request verification\nYou'll need to provide your full legal or business name and a copy of your identification like a driver's license that information will not be shared in public\nApplying is also not a guarantee you'll get verified\nThe verification will likely come with a coveted blue verified badge that we've already seen on Twitter and Facebook accounts while you're in your settings also tap on security and take a moment to enable two factor authentication to keep your account safer from hackers with box on tech ...
