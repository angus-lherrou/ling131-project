a Republican or ... or rooting for conservatives to have a chance here to pass anything I'm obviously the both to really have a good chance of passing anything and as we've seen over the past\nThe past couple of years even that is no guarantee you have to get anything done um but uh what you're seeing now is really good polling or for the GOP in the Senate a lot of these races that were close have moved to geo peas direction um to get to fifty\nIs which is what the need of course to have control with my pets as the deciding vote you need to have a a there is about ten races there um and they've knocked out most of it's not just the ones that lean in their category get them get them to fifty there's an additional seven tossup races where they could get all the way up to fifty seven if they were to switch those\nUm you know maybe even outside shot at something dramatic maybe even getting to fifty eight\nMost likely you're probably in an area of fifty three fifty four right now which is an improvement over the current situation in the Senate but if they lose the house that doesn't mean that yeah\nGain seats right that's the way we usually typically look at these things and then there's the control angle as well who will control the house pull even notice you haven't heard a lot of talk about whether Republicans will will gain any seats\nPlugs because it looks like it's not even possible at this point in fact um the the polling models that they have working right now uh five thirty eight has one which they have\nUm the ... the chance of Republicans maintain their current amount of seats at less than zero point one percent than you might say oh well they've gotten you know that there was issues with they didn't get Trump right which is the thing every time I talk about polls are like oh well they didn't get Trump right well first of all the national polls are almost exactly dead on for Donald Trump or it just didn't get the\nAh electoral college right but that also wasn't what they were pulling and right and some of the states were were obviously wrong but for example uh five thirty I Believe had\nAbout thirty percent chance that they thought Donald Trump would when they're saying there is a point to one percent less than a point one percent chance that the Republicans will maintain the same amount of houses of seats in the house in fact they're saying the equal chance\nThat Republicans maintain the same amount of seats as\nDemocrats gaining eighty three seats\nNow both of those are quick stream outliers right like I don't think either one of those is going to happen right but the chances of of of the of the Democrats just controlling the houses are about eighty percent\nThat they had a a a law and order march ... showed up for the law and order

guess the the just the idea of look this is wrong but we want to make it any worse he's trying\nTo make it sound as if um the police this is his angle for the mainstream our police can do no right but

what did you were not a big ... when you say for public consumption that is exactly what he's doing yes his knees opinion is oh jeez where we're damned if we do damned if we don't but in reality what he wants is a is much more on this side but yeah the ...\nMore on the outside and you can back that up with how he reacted to the FBI\nThe FBI building in Portland is ... is under siege for ... I mean think of the balls and these guys they take the FBI building and block it off so FBI agents are are now trapped inside the building\nThey call for police police say ah we've got a call the mayor\nWhy\nI'm calling view dispatch police we have to call the mayor the mayor goes on and says if the FBI thinks that this city is going to back them up there in the wrong city\n... excuse me what what ...\nSo the FBI had to get federal officers to come in and get everybody out of that building and into safety\nSounded nothing Portland did nothing to these guys that I mean whoa what is this\nIs a I mean it's it's close to an arcade price is certainly the way that that you think it would come if it does it say you know the idea that you the FBI can't depend on police officer forget the FBI just these are people are these are actual real individuals who are in danger or and\nThat was a woman who has the food carts across the street from the FBI\nUm she was a a threatened with an inch of her life that I think they've had to move out of the city or in your family um they took her stuff destroyed it\nOr threaten the neighbors who are coming down trying to you know stick up for I mean they're just that they've become animals they become animals and their claim these are they're streets no they're not\nThey're not punk have you paid for them because I think a lot of the people who are trying to make it to work are the ones who actually paid for it your streets sense when blacks read enough history usually people\nAre who are um you know national socialists or Marxist radicals of some sort they're in power and they let this they let this stuff and go until the people have had enough and then they do what they want\nAnd they you know use those people as cover to seize even more power that's the way it works on a national scale I have no idea what this Portland mayor is doing\nBut it's insane\nMeanwhile Alex ...

valley with their resources and expertise nationwide let's get started with your free consultation\nI started doing things out of my comfort zone like presenting and the truth is it had been a while since I had been having fun is started I started to worry about ticket sales for my tours\nWhat the critics said what the perception of bite me might be I felt like I was living with this over my face and near ... and the reality I was seeing was all blurred by it\nI decided I never wanted to read my name and print again never read a review and I never have I decided I'd never use social media again and I never have but the diagnosis made me realize how stupid I had been to worry about all of these unimportant things I was embarrassed by my ego\n[noise] I was embarrassed that has allowed this in security\nI realize that for many years I couldn't believe I was on the same stage as my heroes I couldn't believe I was looking cross somebody like Paul McCartney and saying things like it's hard to get here but my God it's harder to stay here than I woke up and sought after ten years of trying to get here in five years of being scared that it would go away\nI think I can enjoy it after his son's illness he says I just don't have the stomach for it anymore the celebrity narcissism it started I started to crumble but then I started to wonder why I wanted to do it in the first place I had forgotten that it was all about souls connecting\nBecause I become so anxious there were people in my business life saying if you hadn't done this or that if you've written a better song tickets might be selling quicker I started to take all of that on board\nAnd no one wanted to take any responsibility is just so much easier for people to pass the buck to me because I was since insecure enough already\nI Would digested and say it's my fulltime rubbish it affected me and I started to think it's all going to go I'm going to lose everything\nIt is fascinating to read these things from him\nBecause what I've always felt about Mike who play was she was just having fun he was just living a dream and I wondered and I never spotted in him I just wondered\nIf it was ever going to get old to him because what makes him I think the best performer I've ever seen on stage is that joy\nJoy of performance and it is a it is so infectious yeah he loves it I mean you could tell when you see 'em live you can tell he just absolutely loves\nDoing it or at least it at one point um but they're starting to talk about I mean there's conflicting reports that he's actually thinking about stopping it\nCompletely he says I was learning with passion that I was afraid I'd become a mere pour photo copy of my heroes\nBut when I come back from this terrible time I realized I'm not a mere photocopy I've learned everything I can from them taking it found my own soul my own voice my own style and now no credit can take that away\nIt needed clarifying now I've just seen the music I Love maybe when you let go that's when it comes back to you it's a lot like love he is um he he I think he's joking about he's because he says\nI miss the guys in my band so when my wife had to go back to Argentina I said to the guys come on over to the house let's have a drink orders a pizza place in video games and jam\nThey came over and we partied and I said let's play some music and I thought wow this is fun\nIt was then that I realized I missed making music I didn't even know I missed it that was about a year ago\nSo why would he possibly be saying that he is now it seems like it might be one of those situations where the Internet has taken a somewhat a sarcastic comment and turn it into reality has his spokespeople are coming out saying saying that\nHe's not actually going to retire because he's in the middle of a two hour and a book or their album released and all that other stuff so here's what he here's what he says exactly to the reporter\nHe pauses there are three reasons I wanted to do this album one because I felt a debt of gratitude to deeper than I can explain to the millions of people all over the world who prayed for us and showed us compassion\nThat gave me faith in humanity to because I Love music and I feel I can continue the legacy of my idols and three because of the world was ending not just my own personal hell but watching the political turmoil in America and watching Europe breakup\nThere's never a better time for music than he suddenly stops quote this is my last interview he says quite solidly\nI'm retiring from the business of made the perfect record and now I can leave it at the very top end quote somehow though the writer says I don't think he really means it\nIt's unbelievable because you know that it was put all over the media as if he was retiring will it he said it was his last interview he got other interviews scheduled or at like he's had a whole\nPress tour for this album is just silly and most important thing though is is looking at that and saying that is really the type of thing that ... that changes your perspective completely right you go through something like that and you stop and you examine all the nonsensical idiocy that you you participate in every day uh\nYou can re prioritize you don't want to\nHave to go through that to do it but sometimes it's the only thing that makes you kind of re prioritize the things you're doing in your life or and and he seems to have I mean he he is making thirty five million dollars a year if he's out there a touring and stuff and he's able to walk away from that\nUm because he just wants to spend time with us on how many times do we hear excuses I'm quitting over that time with my family that was completely real guy yeah it's nice to see somebody who actually you know a size\nTo see that he he got through it and has made it into a good thing you know I I have I have ... probably more respect for Michael do play than any other professional that I've ever met in the entertainment industry\nBecause he has found a way to keep his feet on the ground\nThey have ever met in the entertainment industry\nBecause he has found a way to keep his feet on the ground and he was afraid\nI mean when everybody when everyone it was very popular to hate me she didn't mean to copyright you I Know but he but he and he was never taking a stand for me he just wouldn't\nHe just didn't understand and he's like oh look I'm I'm not in politics I'm Canadian I don't care\nIf they get out of it and then he got to fight a logging about yeah he said the guy turned around and said okay I Believe you look back and he's like I'm Canadian I don't vote what do you what does it matter what does it matter to you and the guy's real posh and he said I drew punches back\nAnd he's got to do it I got into a hockey fight [laughter] you got to do a hockey fight [laughter]\nI Am so happy to hear that his ah family is um\nIs doing better and his son has made this miraculous turn and ah\nMichael will play you've given enough if you want to give more we will certainly take it but uh it was right for you do what's right for you and for your family and\nYour real fans will be

just have to uh to click on it and it'll pull up you know the NASDAQ and the Dow in the S. and P. and so forth and so on of course you can put in there what you want to see what what the indicators you want whether it's Starbucks or Nike\nOh a varieties and a bitcoin I mean there's different stuff that that you can have or putting your phone so it'll pull it all up so you know it it'll just what's interesting it'll show you the green bean positive red being negative and so sometimes you'll see abroad mix and so I asked a question of one of my clients uh\nThis last week I said so let's talk about the market if the S. and P. and the Dow and the NASDAQ are all down\nDo you think your mutual fund account you think it four one K. retirement savings do you think those are down if the three big ones are now\nAnd of course has entered was oh yeah no question no question there they're down if the U.S and being the Dow the NASDAQ are down yeah the my mutual funds yeah negative I said okay so let's let's look at the other side of that coin so let's look at the U.S impede the Dow the NASDAQ and let's say that they're all\nDoes that mean all the mutual funds inside of your four one K. your fourth freebie whatever you have\nNow many of you say well gee that makes sense but so many of you are in a position where you have a majority of your assets sitting in the market and of course as we know the market can and will lose money that's just the nature of the market nobody denies that\nThe question is is it money that you can afford to part with and and I had a client in my office a couple of weeks ago and I simply asked this question if you can go down to last\nPart with and and I had a client in my office a couple of weeks ago and I simply asked this question\nIf you can go down to Las Vegas and roll the dice with your retirement savings lose it and walk away with a smile on your face saying wow that was great a lot of fun and we'll have to do that again some time\nThan great be in the market with your retirement savings but if that's not you and for many of you listening to the show today most if you were going to say no I I really would never think of going down to Las Vegas or Jack Potter wherever people go and risk my retirement savings on a game of chance\nAnd yet that's exactly what you're doing in the market so again don't have any money in the market you cannot afford\nTo lose number three if you don't understand it don't do it and this is kind of an interesting quandary I think for many people let me ask you this the last time you met with your broker financial plan or whoever it is that that managers your portfolio or your\nInvestments your you know mutual funds and stocks whatever you've got the last time you met with him [noise]\nDid you leave his presence did you leave the office or did he leave your home and you are thinking in your mind while I don't get it I don't I don't know I don't really understand all the stuff he talked about but [laughter] I'm just going to let him do what he does because he's the expert\nOr did he leave and you thought wow I understand everything completely I'm confident about where I Am I'm comfortable with with what I'm doing and I know exactly what that is and what it means\nMost of the time people people agree with that first one when they leave their financial planner their their investment guy they leave justice confused not knowing what they really should know\nAs they did the last time in at the guy Walden why even with a guy I mean to me that doesn't make sense again if you don't understand it don't do it\nNumber five the person that created the problem may not be the one who knows how to fix it\nAnd that's something that you're going to have to you know kind of come to terms with\nYour financial guy if he created an issue where you've lost money in the past well you know it's probably not the best place to be as just my opinion but again the person who created the problem may not be the one who knows how to fix it or he wouldn't have created the problem in the first place [noise]\nNever say the older you get the more conservative you should be up to me that ain't rocket science folks I think that's just the way it should be we need to be conservative the more the or the closer we get to retirement I think that's just common sense not losing money\nMay be more important than how much you make can let me put that in another way\nIt doesn't matter how much you make what matters is how much you get to keep of what you've made so if you've done real well you've doubled in the last four or five years and the market has so hopefully you have to if you're not well you might be in the wrong investments [noise]\nSo if you doubled in the last four to five years\nThe question is do you get to keep all of that and of course right now you're thinking well yeah 'cause you know a a I've you know I I guess in my account\nWell ask your broker Des Moines a market loses that last only on paper or is it an actual loss because most brokers will say that the law says only on paper than you have to play the same game and say well then again is only on paper\nSo you know you can't you can't play that game only when the market's down\nSo again the question is the last market downturn in two thousand eight and the one before that in two thousand one and two did you get to keep everything you earned in prior years or did you ride that thing down\nThe real question is the next time the market tanks the next time the bubble burst the next time the roller coasters on the way down and I'm right in that thing down to the bottom do I get to keep everything I made at at the high point is there a high watermark but I never have to worry about being below\nNinety nine point nine nine nine percent of the people listening to the show today are going to say well no I mean that's the nature of the market market goes up market goes down it always has it always well nobody denies that [noise]\nSo the question is how is there a way\nTo get market returns without market losses market returns upside market potential no downside market risk\nWell that's why you need to call me and I want to show you I Want to get this information into your hand as my free save money information cats and my three hundred and Thirteen page safe money

information into your hands now I Want to give you an example of some of the things I'm Talking about today about some of these investment philosophies\nSee investments are like golf clubs and if you're a golfer you're going to appreciate this analogy in your repertoire you have a\nOf golf clubs there is no bad clubs you just have to use the right club for what it's designed for for example if if I'm teen off and it's a four hundred and fifty yard a\nWhole I've got to get that ball as far as I can down the fair way on the first hit so I'm going to pull out my best Potter to drive that ball two hundred and fifty to three hundred yards down a fair way of course you're if you're if you're a golfer you're going to lead\nDrive that ball two hundred and fifty to three hundred yards down a fair way because you if you're if you're a golfer you're going what\nAre you idiot why would you do you use a pot or as a driver I mean that's insane why would you do that that's goofy that's completely the wrong club\nTo do what you're trying to do to accomplish your goal of getting that ball just as far as you can but the reality is there's so many of us use improper investments to accomplish that goal that investment was never designed for\nJust like those investments you have to use the right investment and use it for what it's designed for because if you used the wrong club it's not going to get you where you need to go [noise]\nThat's what I'm Talking about some of these philosophies what we do is to help you get where you need to go so we're going to talk to you about what your goals were you trying to go and we're going to help you choose the right investment to make sure that you get to that goal none of the investments are bad\nIt's just are you using the right

five five for one two safe that's eight five five for one to seven to three three [noise]\nAnd I want to ask you about the behavior of the dogs and you were talking about your dog going and taking care of the neighbor sheep so these dogs that do this is it innate in them to guard flocks of of small livestock and they just want to do it just naturally\nInnate it well first of all their costs dogs have a way they are guarding instinct mhm\nDefense an instant you know to protect their turf to protect their resources means breed have been selected to that that sort of censor the guardianship were protection it has been enhanced um but on top of that\nUm the other traits that you find in in ... dogs is that they generally look at livestock not as soon but as part of their\nTheir family their church and their property and that only comes about when people get involved and you know shape those behaviors and reinforce those meters mhm so the instinct to guard is is definitely\nInnate it's natural the instinct not to hunt and not to be predatory is not as an actual drinkers are definitely edible kind of\nRight and they look at it for chicken cause because they do sheep dogs will also guard poetry\nAnd all kinds of things so it's a matter of raising the dogs in an environment where they understand under the humans direction that a\nNice little animals are these big animals whatever they are are part of the property that they live on and part of the personal you know the Guardian's that we're we're the ones who are directing them and saying okay this is now part of your home\nIn part of of your family\nAnd that it's it's not extension of family and what belongs to them that makes them guardian as opposed to creditors\nSo want photos instilled in them and they're looking up the the ... for the the goats are which are convenient or or whatever it may be as their property to they're going to guard and protect livestock wants to move around the property and they want to browse\nOr grays are forging different areas the livestock production dog just naturally follow them and the and stick with them as they move from place to place\nThey they normally do we call it bonding that they've bonded to leave animals so they are in the world and they're generally but usually the best guardian start off as puppies and very young dog\nAnd live in ... so they just naturally become attached to them so yeah so that's why they're they're wonderful for areas where there's you know huge plots of land where for animals\nWill be grazing and they'll be constantly moving and the dogs were with them and plus they automatically because it's the end it didn't your nature that's not something we can teach them in nature\nEric story and move around and basically me vigilant about what's out there that I can see like the livestock that has to be any that kind of recognizing a senator\nAll right well let's take another break when we come back I Want to I Want to talk about the predators that we face out here in the west in and find out you know what we can and cannot use livestock production dogs protect our animals against\nOkay car hard makes clear to get

Seventeen through the twenty eight only after favorite me in a bar [noise]\nWell ... we're back let's talk about predator so ah our listening audience\nEspecially on the radio side is a based in eastern Oregon and then all through south western Idaho and so our listening audience we're going to have people who are facing predation from from ... from bears from\nCougars coyotes Fox bobcats and probably other things that I'm not thinking of including domestic dogs are in areas where they could attack or goats Hershey and things like that how much protection kennel livestock production dogs offer us against I guess each one of these predators are or\nIs there something on that list that they cannot helpless\nActually they can help with all those the list is ah let's face it grizzlies or a lot bigger than dogs and cougars are pretty powerful animals\nCan be any my initial fast dogs and I call it best in the sense of a dog that knows the job and also knows how to survive in the face of a an overwhelming predator the best dog will know\nExactly how close you get to and we went to retreat when\nThey're dealing with trying to drive off they a grizzly NASA grizzly ends up in the middle of the flock somehow and it's you know just having a field day in their most of the dogs are smart enough to just barking bark and harassed try to harass\nTo there or even say a cougar and go away you know in the case where they have backup you know they're the bark and of course if there's more than one dog and usually there are because you know it's usually there are a large swath of there's several dogs working together and they do work as a pack and they will harass\nWhatever you know animal it's either ... approaching their flock or in this law they have been known to you in law and killed by bears and cougars mhm and occasionally will yet there are there are\nProtests anything in many injuries and its job very high risk job in that she in certain places pact or anything or record really dangerous or whether it's a coyote coyote pack up sometimes it depends on\nThe kind a coyote in their hybrid or whatever it is highly variable and they they certainly can be affected the gate all of those editors but again you know if they suddenly come upon him greatly and they don't have\nA chance to you know try to get the grizzly to move on or\nEven a blackberry whatever they could end up in trouble if they get too close so it's not it's not something you can keep the dog\nTo understand when they're ... and in how far to push and there are some breeding dogs that are more aggressive against predators sound that are less aggressive and and they will back off and they'll just bark a lot of posture to try to make nice try to move along\nYou know like I mentioned before we have goats that we do mould our species grazing with our cattle with them so they keep the pastor really nice and eat a lot of the stuff in the past or the cattle eat and so we like it for that reason but a couple of years back\nI had our votes on a piece of property and it's not as close to the house has other parks and was a little bit shielded by a row of trees in a creek so they weren't very miserable to me and we lost four goats one morning and I think it was coyotes that could have been domestic dogs but I have a reason to believe it was coyotes and so I started\nLooking into production animals and what we can do and there's three things are always come up when you look this up and there is of course dogs and then people talk about llamas and people talk about donkeys what do you see as the the benefit of using dogs as opposed to those other protection animals when it comes to this type of thing\nWell I Would want to know what kinds of predators are in the area through these words you know deciding on what kind of protection to the choir for the animals donkey generally are are good again rather predators like ... ... ... and again\nWhen you're looking at ... or ... or ... you can't just pick up any little donkey in any Obama you need to come from a reputable breeder of somebody who knows that the nature of goes animals and some of them will just turn tail and run if they see something scary others meal like you know donkey quite often dislike dogs\nSo it it's a lion tradition pressure with where they mostly stray dogs a donkey might maybe just that you need for it gets all their flock which is already fenced in particular that would be important to\nAllow the neighbor that I was mentioning to head to the services as my dog she started out with llamas but he found out that he had two or three llamas and when the predators came along the street llamas packed together all by themselves and not and did nothing for the cheap at all man\nIt was maybe just one line that you would stay with sheep and it would have had the life later or less serious creditors or that through the stock to be really useful and effective and again each situation is just a little different than went to Penn\nSo certain other break and when we come back I Want to talk about care shelter and training and things like that for life start protection dog look up okay\nThey work hard
