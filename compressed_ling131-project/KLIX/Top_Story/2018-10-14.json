Washington Penn State all going down your number five Notre Dame is skate\nJust by the city ... hairs with a ... a yesterday so basically it was a you know I look at the schedule you say it it shouldn't have played out that way but it\nTurned out to be a tremendous day and in college football perhaps maybe the best game of the day was the seventeenth right Dorgan topping Washington thirty twenty seven and no tea and it's a huge rivalry between Washington Oregon and marry a crystal ball has got the ducks running this year they really do\nTake a listed is\nThat you have it every day a lot [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nShe always had a series of being up yet but we did that they needed a risk field goal attempt at the end the regulation to stay alive but the U.S will take it they won the game I mean that's yeah it is there is five and one to one now and the pack\nAnd Washington goes down five and two and three and one overall and basically they're finished Washington's finished for the year maybe some minor little bowl game that there'll be playing in this year\n[noise] [noise] yeah um [noise] I mean it's a redemption for CJ for Dell he's the running back ooh fumbled at the end of regulation against Stanford when they were trying to basically run the clock out\nAnd that led to stand for beating the ducks just a few weeks ago in the same field and DJ for Dell is the young running back who scored the winning touchdown and overtime as you just heard right there\nAgainst Washington monster when for Mario crystal ball and you mentioned it Andy in this that physicality Oregon's known for all their bubbles screen you and it's just basketball on grass\nAnd their prancing around and having a really nice time but they get after you meant you got Mario ... former offensive lineman at Miami and before the game\nHe was leading these pre game warm ups it's all on the line he's just preaching physicality and you could see it on Saturday against Washington\nThen back I mean the dumpster Baghdad kind of a couple of years where they were I got to the pitcher but they're right back in and\nRight now and it's all about the huskies I mean honestly bury their head I mean they were done yesterday afternoon to liberate lost that hurt them basically as well so they're finished and now the ducks now you hope they don't go you know hit a\nWall now Bush this week they play Washington state which I Believe was off yesterday so they're somewhat rested so there'll be psyched\nOf Oregon could continue what they fall on their face again we'll see what happens you know what's he was real or not but this time right All right now just\nTell you that you it's a packed twelve is dead and the attorneys are getting a playoff team because Oregon non conference schedule is essentially use the apps schedule [laughter] how it breaks down and you have Oregon playing Bowling Green Portland State San jose state\nYou're not going to get into the playoffs unless all of these other teams and other major conferences just lose multiple games which good luck with that happening so that's the downside of playing this\nSharman soft non conference schedule if you have a lot like Oregon does in the packed well you're done in terms of the playoff race\nRight and you know what the honestly the pack twelve I'm sure they wanted to get a major conference in that\nBowl championship series and if you run the Congress maybe there's a chance Washington last year but now it's certainly opens the door for the independent your independent Notre Dame\nVisit the

I like you could look at this the way I look at it\nYou're right he is all about himself\nHe is the I said he's like the beginning of the song crazy train from ... you know that song where it's like I I I I don't like you and your he's all about himself it was amazing that interview he did with Joe Siena Anderson from ESPN every word out of his miles every other sentence was I\nWas like I I've worked too hard I feel like I put it in the work I I just said the ball is just I I I Me me me he is that guy and I think that it's too late for the behavior to be changed because\nHe didn't like this not just as easy either like this for years and for its not be addressed it's literally like a kid who's ...\nYeah and like this not just as easy either like this for years and for its not be addressed it's literally like a kid\nWhose parents doesn't say no no no can't do that and follows through with the punishment if they misbehave it is far too late for OPEC um junior to turn it around and act right because the bad behavior is going unpunished for far too long\nOn punish he gets his way Ninety five million dollar contract what are you kidding me I mean come on I mean it's crazy but you know what the teens want to do that\nGod Bless you it's not my money it's your money they go oh you said early on the eagles would make the playoffs they make it by default but they're sat divisions they're playing the so bad now that went against the giants Thursday night maybe fool's gold with the when the three and three of their Carolina next week so look\nThey may make the playoffs I remember last week you and I was more of as without a little bit Alex said that you were wrong you know I respect you for your opinion and and look they're not the same thing they were a year ago but it just look who they're playing with in that division the giants the Redskins come on they're tearing these things are bad Dallas that they're not consistent winners these teams\nYou know what\nThere was a fork in the road this morning and you shows Alex ... says over your guy me home known writers ... measures that have the way that the Alex ... dark side how dare you Andy from it I Do understand one thing I get as I understand it but I still look at the eagles team and\nIt's just hilarious to me because\nThey beat the horrible one in five now New York giants\nAnd that's all it took for people to be like\nHey goes or back look at what they did two oh one in five team who cares it's going to take a lot more than that to not only when the division but gets the playoffs so I still think it's very very possible that they lose\nYou give up twenty six at home to the ravens and they could add a lot more\nSo I I they haven't played great defense and last week they did so I don't know which defense shows up day against the bangles if it's a good defense I Would certainly expect to often to put up enough points to when I just don't know if that good defense of the Steelers it's going to show up\nI have a surprise few I live out his game sports ... well angles are going on and a half\nMile Andy you are you're making strides man you are made strides you got it right out of the game you know my heart is\nI live a little bit here and then what do I got it all I got over and under a plus fifty and a half and I got the angles on this one and a half so I mean you know I'm I'm doing you've taught me well I gotta I gotta I gotta give the right the rise\nAnd amazing thing it's just outstanding yes\nI just learned how to turn it on I just got one really just kind of computer really she just got an Internet over there right [laughter] yeah maybe\nYeah just depends I mean it depends different you know books and different lines but right around there I've got to minus one for the bangles it's moved you can see the Steelers money trickle in throughout the week and the total fifty one what would you take on that Andy would you go over on that\nI Would go over and you don't want them I I honestly I I I'm not a whole murder but I think the fact that the planes at home with the U.S have a little bit of Obama's momentum going on their side but the injury factor\nI don't know I look at a close game right now like thirty one twenty seven thirty one twenty eight Bengals but I got to hear what you have to say about it I like I think like a have a tough\nLand because I'm torn I never want to take the result of the previous week and apply it too much like over the top with the next week you know race and so watching the bangles they weren't getting dominated by the dolphins they were getting shot out by the dolphins\nAnd tannahill but it's one of the worst throwaways I've ever seen before throws at just the mass of humanity it gets knocked around picked off interception for a touchdown another defensive score\nSo the bangles the way they want good like seeing that repeat you know so I'm trying not to overreact to that result last week because the Bengals are completely capable playing a lot better today against the Steelers defense that's up and down I expected to be a shootout\nAnd I expected to come down to a fourth quarter game and I can't sit here and say I would bet my bottom dollar on the bangles making the play when it comes time for it I Would bet on the Steelers until proven otherwise\nI'll tell you what I'm with you and I think the weather is a factor because uh they predict rain at least in the second half of the ... in this afternoon which will make a real sloppy and I don't know where the passing situation will happen with the rain is so\nI I just I I think that the Steelers joined the Bengals head I know it sounds really stupid but I Know it's a mental game I just think that when there's bangles team sees that black and gold something happens that they've got a real type but as something will happen\nThe mental game I just think that when there's bangles team she used a black and gold something happens that they've got a real tight but as something that will happen at the end of the gay and I miss a field goal of is a special team era today may may cause that game so we'll see what you get\n... perfect back you know and of course the shades of the unnecessary roughness penalty on Antonio Brown and the playoff games like oh gosh yeah I I Do wonder how much of the recent history\nFactors into the bangles mindset today in the thick of a guy like Joe mixed in just off the top of my head or John Ross one of these young guys that has it been there for a long time to experience the Steelers\nTypically getting the better of the bangles at least of recent memory you know one sixth straight games so I don't know that enters in their mind set\n... monetary a house can during their mind when when Marvin Louis used a ... speech and tell us when we're not gonna take it anymore and these guys and the John was is that what are you talking about and then they'll find out that the only straight so basically they are cultures\nThat put it into their mind that's what they do they really do Bryant no aid the former live from that guy go five splits radio studios it's

I was a big jump so I I don't know if that could happen but twelve major things have happened\nYeah and you look at it I mean gosh if you compare schedules if you compare LSU to UCS for instance people\nI bang on UCF because you know you should be banned gone they just don't have a good body of work is that as of ... they played that has a winning record this year was yesterday beating Memphis\nIs it one by one thirty one thirty right that this is what you got so should LSU be ranked ahead of UCF abs\nSo Lou ... no doubt about it and then you look at these other teams that have lost when you talk about um\nLet's see here West Virginia went down Washington goes down Penn State goes that do go six seven eight are down so essentially LSU would have to they're not going to fall over Michigan where parents are going to do that they could they could with Michigan beats down Wisconsin that could see that\nThere are certainly going to jump Oklahoma who was off they should you were talking to LSU they should jump Oklahoma they should jump UCF I should jump Texas they she survived that home against Baylor at LSU as a better better body of work right now than Texas does\nYeah and I tell you what I I think it also goes now with the most recent gay but how you're trending and you look at Penn State that was right they they look to straighten pillows two straight like giving up I choking up in the fourth quarter\nRecent gay but how you're trending and you look at Penn State that was right they they look to straighten pillows two straight like giving it up I choking up in the fourth quarter and I think that they're going to be I\nWas writing short threats to the ... they are on the inside of heat this week\nYeah it probably I I'll say or I'll give the ... the lions seventeenth to make it interesting Hugo Eighteen Seventeen\nHow much she wants to have and then he's going in Oregon was this week Oregon probably most to like fourteenth maybe\nAlright if they go higher than that I think they seeking to uh I think they're above the teens how's that I think that gets released whilst\nHe don't want it it's getting very interesting the pictures getting a little clearer right now Michigan I think Michigan lose it to the top ten without ...\nLay with everybody else I'm sure yeah\nSo I'm ... I'm happy for Michigan right there at Michigan State or a big win\nOver Penn State I mean I I didn't expect that in Texas over pay a little bit they struggled to beat Baylor so you know there's so many things going on a lot of these I hate to use the term moving parts but there are split it all works out at the end that all it all comes together but I tell you the biggest shock us they had to be a LSU\nI mean LSU beating Georgia the way they did and Georgia made everybody was looking at Georgia now we know they're not for real you know it's it's not the same team that was there last year go for the national title their their their forties their fates stiff frauds stats are they are supplying those fries\n... they lost to a tough team on the road Baton Rouge Death Valley it's tough place to play and no I didn't think that they would lose by twenty points but you can't say that they're complete frauds that's a team that legitimately made it to the national championship game\nAnd was a whisker away from winning it so I don't think that they're complete fool's gold or anything like that\nI think that they have a really really tough road ahead of them and I don't expect them to run the table from here on out that's what it's going to take to get them into the play off I don't see them beating Florida at Kentucky Auburn\nS.

C. championship game mostly are most likely against Alabama just don't see them running that able to get to the college football playoff\nWell I'm Still behind my national defending national champion UCS because they would suggest that even at the opposite say got a flag you did that for all egg or you just try to get a rise out of it I was not one dollar Ralph are but at the bottom of the hour they give you a little jab as well a little ... little ... full of a of of of this so called\nPaper champs UCF and they're terrible conference and their worst non conference schedule I I just have no love no love for it's not personal with UCF it's any team who trumpet themselves who pat themselves on the back\nAnd you're playing no one like that\nYou're playing South Carolina state that's an F. C. S. school away there's a winters when no way to it and it it just ... yeah that's all I Know you I don't know what is this what is like\nIf you're telling me that LSU taking down the number two ranked team in the country at home is the same thing is UCF what taking down in Memphis it's knives and\nIt's the same garbage we had two years ago a western Michigan there wasn't it the same thing with\nThe Iraqi yeah they ran a table and now he's like no one ... per minute Ralph\nExactly right we move on and let's talk a little NFL right now but as I said that this team likes to dramatic I'm Talking about the Cleveland Browns they loved her dramatic they went into overtime for the third time in five weeks they beat the ravens our shock with that twelve nine I didn't watch the game and thank goodness I didn't ... that had to be asleep at twelve to nine are you kidding great Joe civil to thirty seven years\nNow too and wants to take a may feel took over a quarter back there five games have been decided by a total of Thirteen points to today they hosted charges in Cleveland charges three and two they beat Oakland last week and miles Garrett of the browser defensive and his averages a soccer game and I'll tell you what\nI like the browns today I liked the problems today they're coming of age I really believe that I don't [laughter]\nI'm going to go the other way on this one Andy I liked the chargers you look at the chargers first off we're out of September so that's good\nFor them because they invent ways to lose games in September and you look at the teams that they've lost two they've lost the cheese and the rams that as soon as charges the last two\nEvery diploma more rewarding\nThat's how every stray student I mean the same day flight has its peace and values is all

Y. UCF has to play who's in their conference my guess is every college program except Alabama would take McKenzie Milton as their quarterback thinks Scott Ross knows that UCF hung forty five ... ...\nA decent amount of players that could play major college football\nSo I I don't agree with that but I'm not going to great on a curve I hate this logic of hey FYE UCF has to play within their conference but if they play in a bad conference I'm not going to act as if it's a good one okay but you can't give a team a free pass\nFor playing in a week conference\nWill they did lately I have to know a time out the ... conference that's a bad\nThing American athletic conference bad\nNo no I didn't know that hey this is their economics but they've got they've got a break they did get a break and UCF didn't get the break last year really top to bottom the patch twelve stunk last year\nSo what about conferences okay right in\nBig deal who cares what we're obviously hair conference\nThe voters kit with any team in the past well we'll get a break over any team of the a C female without a\nPlayoff last year ... Washington was in the in the playoffs during the past twelve\nAnd they had a better body of work than anything that you're seeing from UCF right now right now I don't understand the point like\nI don't know why is that you're talking conferences okay and I'm Glad that you could you could have a team and and I've been a big name conference a one or two losses that will get a break head and shoulders over the place\nThat value that he was a play yeah that kind of well delve of course is about the resume that you have if your resume say the two teams of Georgia and Alabama who made it from the SEC last year\nThey had respectable resumes they had a better body of work\nThan it seemed like UCF largely because UCF plays in a bad conference so don't give me this hey\nHey they play who's in their conference so they have to do that yeah great and I'm going to take that into account if I'm a value waiting which team deserves to be in the college football playoff in which team doesn't I think the other day and that right and they want to give a hand out in a free pass to someone who plays in a week conference\nThere's no doubt but I Would say this I think the conference situation a is a misnomer it should be who you play\nAnd that's a conference here in because you can play schools outside of your ... your schedule and it seems like you know like look at the Washington schedule the path towards they go out of the comments or play crap they do like garbage okay they played a ...\nYear that's a good is a big way way better than anything UCF does non conference wise\nThere's no doubt about that way that you see if could if they wanted to go out of Congress to play two or three schools to bolster their conference so they had a resume right of course this couch do was Alabama will still place chattanooga's southern out of their conference they couldn't afford to do that because they play in the U.S conference of the country\nAbsolutely that was the thing about McKenzie Milton in terms of what these other point my guess is every college programs except Alabama would take McKenzie Milton as their quarterback I disagree with that but\nTake a guy like we'll Greer\nWith West Virginia he's fantastic did you see him yesterday through for a hundred yards at Iowa State so to think that just because you have a good quarterback is like whoa whoa UC ... no no no it doesn't work like that okay and it in terms of evaluating what one team does against the common opponent\nVersus another team yeah UCF they crushed to pet Notre Dame struggled against it yesterday\nThat all of a sudden means that Notre Dame wouldn't want to play UCF in a bowl game are you crazy right they would and I went to the mighty UCF nights who get fat\nOff of these week teams currency\nBeer because of the UCF mighty unites the giants the mistake that the the Twitter\nAuthor made a treaty to you about this you talk to any one of those players and they may have a chip on their shoulder and they play a higher level football than they should because they do it that ship on their shoulder because they were overlooked by the schools that they really wanted to go\nTo ... they didn't want to go to U. C. F. they weren't there the other schools like UCLA USC Texas Oklahoma those are the schools that they wanted to go to and they were over look so when you hear these announces saying well he's probably what a chip on his shoulder why because he was over to the end up how do you see that's why\nWell yeah and it applies to the bowl win over Auburn Auburn loses the S. E. C. championship game to Georgia and their consolation prize is facing UCS [laughter]\nOkay it's a completely different mindset and it's a completely different motivational factor\nThere for Auburn versus UCF like you're talking about they were overlooked for the big schools there in the sugar bowl they're playing ... let's go let's go time maybe that's what you see evidence thinking Auburn like damn\nWell we had a chance for the national championship we had a chance to be in the college football playoff and we blew it\nBy losing the Georgian the FCC championship game you know you got this game against UCF it's totally different so to highlight that and said oh ask all birds look at what they did you're taking everything\nThat shouldn't be into account and you're not applying it to what factors into that game and the mindset of both teams heading into it that matters if you're trying to trumpet UCF as taking down anybody in the country right now when it comes to the college football playoff it's crazy\nWhy are they lower for anybody who say well UCF should be higher why don't you say that about South Florida why don't you say that about NC State who's undefeated but at the University of themes that our University of ...\nThat is undefeated five and oh right right so it was leading hearts those schools who are undefeated\nRight what's the argument there because they don't play anybody either and they shouldn't be ranked higher the truth is UCF should be ranked lower like in in the state like South Florida like in Cincinnati if you play someone in beat someone of note then you should be a top ten team\nI couldn't agree more and I I think it's almost a waste of breath to discuss why a team on that level should be ... I just put on the same level as of Alabama or LSU it just just put it this way but UCF\nOr a South Florida and the SEC I put a complete schedule your schedule there if they want to games will be a lot\nWill be a lot of gas has also right do you agree no way there is no way they would be in contention for a playoff berth if they had it as though that flipper Georgia's schedule Andy imagine\nI mean you just like I I'm the one that's kind of grazing the flight for UCF look I think that's a joke I I make fun of it the fact that the athletic director they got a flag and they say that the guy shy of his ... good for him because you have to do what they are actually this\nIs what they are anti UCF is a poor man's version of Boise State is what they are member of and Boise State yeah had cranked up and they were added a couple of ... undefeated season a couple of one ... the ... program at the level that they're playing it was a here's the thing here's the thing\nBoise State played in a week conference at the time the wackos week\nProbably better than the a C honestly but three conference but what they did they went out of conference and they lead played a big time team they played someone who is ranked they play they power five team when they got lucky with that Oklahoma aren't able\nTo use this half dozen too that they are a weak version of Boise State when that program was
