is just going to be swept under the rug\nAnd uh we kind of agreed to yeah I'd probably where he's going to be it's going to get swept under the rug or not that it should be but it probably will be well here's another one there was a story out just last week and it came out\nFrom a worldwide and I write down where I got this [noise]\nEvidently it was somewhere 'cause I've got four pages worth stuffed [laughter]\nA Senate Democrats\n\nUsed one of his staffers to leak information to the quote probe on the Trump Russia collusion issue\nAnd now we discover that um gee whiz a guy named George Soros funded\nThis quiet project where this guy [noise] I'm\nAn ... that's put it this way an unidentified US Senator contacted a guy named Daniel Jones who walk or race or group called democracy integrity project\nThat's enough to make your question the whole thing anyway Jones's project is heavily funded by George Soros\n\nAnd George Soros um\nFunded this thing and said okay we are going to uh\nMake available all this\nQuiet information about a Trump and the Russia probe and make it available for the Democrats to throw rocks at Trump now this Daniel Jones guy hang onto your hats\nWas working for California Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein when she was chairman of the intelligence panel\nAnd had just formed this non profit group that kills me non profit group calls democracy

one of her employees worked with George Soros in this democracy integrity project\nI should be enough to make your question the whole thing right off the top and then they they found all of this bad information and tried to leak it into the press end of the media into the public view to slam Trump well I I don't think that's\nJust happenstance that this kind of information is coming out to this is the same kinds of stuff that who leaked professor for ... letter\nSays it wasn't me no I didn't I Would I wouldn't think of doing that but somebody did so how do we find out who these things are well that Chuck Ross who wrote this particular article said we need to pull the edges fill the carpet back a little bit and\nLook at this stuff a little more carefully because our enemies are everywhere and they have got well funded well funded organizations who can look at these things pull them out\nAnd destroy or leak information that will destroy innocent people or\nBlatantly change the dynamic that the individuals involved get creamed through no fault of their own they had nothing to do with it they they leak information\nThat I Would use the word ... been rejected I don't like

are\nThey're they're not going to be a they're not going to change their not going to back off so you know we need to look at and it's just like some of these really well funded a political action committees um\nWhere's the money coming from who who's supporting it and and what is their objective when whenever I look at a news source I said to myself okay is this news source typically conservative in nature\nOr are they a liberal in nature the original moderate anymore that's gone away so you either on this side of the fence or that side of the fence which we use it I look at some

need to do to stay healthy and we're we're all flu shots in and voted infection and in fact I should absolutely [laughter] okay so the only question I have a flu shots as you want to get that old them before the end of October that is the hope\nIf I wait until sometime in November to do it do it anyway in fact even clear up till next April but the chances of getting sick our highest between about October in December so [noise]\nUm [noise] the flu continues until the warm weather hits and it's still around but it's just not as prevalent was so the advocacy period on the flu vaccine is about three or four months window ... well the the vaccine itself will last for a whole year but\nWith the major time to get the flu is going to be October through about December January and so if you want to avoid five days or seven days out of work and in bed\nThan probably ought to get it sooner or later you know if you're traveling you're very likely to catch colds a you know on a plane on a bus whatever you're doing because you're in close proximity re circulated air\nAnd so you know I personally am going to be traveling this weekend and I am looking for a flu vaccine but my office doesn't have today all\nThat you love it by they'll probably end up by the time I get back after going this way and I was always good to wash your hands like you said that's yeah and when we let it let me talk about how to catch her not catch this okay washing your hands but especially\nJust before you eat anything because more a lot of what we catch we put in our own mouth\nOr I hate to say it you know when we pick or on those ... so you don't wash your hands before you pick your nose instead of just after right isn't that a terrible thing for a doctor to say [laughter]\nReality it's something we do like you said yeah I mean you know I heard I saw comic one time that showed a some a church ladies sitting next to you know God apparently just passed the gates and they were the only ones there and the responses when you're the only one who never picture now so\nWe we all do it you know [laughter] so\nOkay let me yet so the way you catch the flu mostly has to do with what are called respiratory droplets somebody coughs and sneezes it in the air and by the way coughing isn't always due to illness it's a lot of a natural a protective mechanism of our airway but if you have the flu you are shutting it like crazy every time you cough\nAnd so some of the rules we need to learn to do if we don't have a handkerchief as the cough into your elbow especially if you're a long sleeve shirt it will filter a lot of that coughing in your hand essentially allows you to put your hand on the next handler door knob or whatever and whoever grabs a darn of and then touches their own face\nThat administers you know a whole new dose of flu to themselves so\n... your shirt sleeves a great move\nOr to help protect others but you know if you think of a people that have infants around under six months of age they can't get an immunization so you have to form kind of a protective circle Leno circle the wagons around that infant that can't be immunized by getting him you know\nYou need to be able to pinch around your nose and fit relatively tightly because they don't have if you had a year if you're on chemotherapy and had really low immune system or somebody that had HIV and was it end stage aids\nThey would need to have a lot of our construction guys know and that is called an in Ninety five mass gets a high density particulate mask and that one's a little harder to breathe through but boy does it filter well but just your general mask if it fits your face will help you avoid a lot of stuff and I see people\nAgain like traveling on airplanes or otherwise they'll aware that if they have a decreased immune system and the truth is in some of our uh\nUh Asian countries is very common for people that aren't ill or a immune suppressed to wear those out in public because they know other people are out there with illness and they don't want to get sick you know it's not our culture but you know or if you have any worries maybe make it your culture\nOkay or even to just not touching your face is is a good step or it is it's a\nGreat step if you start putting your hands toward your face or\nYou think twice wash your hands go ahead and touch your face okay sounds good to stay home right if you got a yeah I'm and\nI'm not a proponent of of being a hermit you know in hiding out where social people and but if you take common precautions you can avoid a lot of trouble a lot of illness and what I Would call comment is\nThe hand washing I'm being careful you know who you're around with coughing and getting immunized you know it is and then by the way the egg allergy to ah to the flu virus is no longer a country indication or if you had\nStopped breathing and that was your reaction I Would say okay will not do that but if you got a little bit of a rash or a sore arm and you say hey it's because I'm allergic to eggs there is so little AIG a\nComponent to these vaccinations and it's not in all of them that you will are unlikely have any kind of trouble and if you do make sure you get that immunization at your doctor's office because you know we've got stuff right there to slow it down a little bit of ... and if we need to some epinephrine\nAnd uh but the reality is is a little rash for a day versus a being truly knocked\nOut in the threat of death I'd I'd ... rash\nYeah that was an easy decision so omitted skill that it's not going to be if I didn't mean to spend as much time on the flu but his the season is right is if you had one other item that you wanted to talk about and that's a some changes that the ah this this could take the whole rest of the show OK well level or as I went off [laughter]\nBecause we'll have to come back and talk about all the other uh uh types of illness going from a local the systemic if we can get through this but this is important and I was telling our hosts that\nI usually don't bring anything political to my discussion about better health but this is about your health and the Centers for Medicare is called see him as\n[noise] if I don't have a great answer is saying is absolutely should be one way or another that sounds like I'm being a politician but I really am on the

I've gone to Haiti lot andme\nFind it on ... dot com or created a lot of added something better\nIn Studio now we have with us this morning or just pilot Jordan and we're just getting\nBut this this morning or just pilot Jordan and we're just getting started with a\nConversation with her about\nOne of the things we want to talk about is ah education you you\nIn your opening remarks you indicated that this has got to be a primary concern\nFor older people or state of Idaho [noise] what would you do differently how would you uh [noise]\nPresent your view of education as compared to what we are currently seeing\nWell you're definitely not going to get any politics for me and you're going to get direct responses actual solutions and that's what I find that is going to be only fresh and innovative a bear bowl because people are tired of seeing the\nUh you know the basically the double\nDouble speak the way that things have been going on for me I again from relied aware hit\nVery directly and well we have schools opening without teachers in those classrooms as a very hard hit for our kids I'm a mom of two sons and Everytime I go uh being having been impacted by the rural school district Everytime I go to school with my sons\nAnd saying that they have less and less resources to get by\nIt's frustrating as a parent because you want to see our kids have everything that they need resource wise you want to see them have\nThat you know good teachers stay here in Idaho ah have in again access to everything when it comes to stem\nWhen it comes to math and science is a language arts all the good things that your ... your children need to compete with the broader world so it's a it's unfortunate but they're going to see me as governor of taking bold actions to ensure that we have all the teachers which is why one of my first steps is to bring in between five hundred to a thousand new teachers\nAnd then increasing teacher pay we have to incentivize more of our people to stay here in Idaho\nAnd broaden out to the rural school districts and the Trump funding because we have defined it education every year we keep either cutting funding programs that the ... the fact that we do need to get into\nA resources and I know this is a tough conversation for some but they have to realize that focusing on investing in our children will be investing in our economy it'll be investing in the jobs are\nSo if we're going to increase is investing in our children as an investment in education I salute Lee would that require a tax increase\nTo how they are ... are actually doing tax cuts if you don't listen to the lives in the room and the rhetoric things or how do we\n... what are we going to do to balance this\nStop paying corporations welfare the subsidies and all these tax incentive how about we stop a limit our reproducing the waste of taxpayer resources is what we need to get back to [noise]\nSo for me I'm about smart investments are but for the first of all if we get back to criminal justice reform people see where all the money is going it's going into our prison system\nEvery time we talk about how much we pay person it versus per inmate we pay over twenty two thousand per inmate who pay a year per year yes\nAnd the fact that we have an older growing prison population half of those people and more than half are now there because of\nLow level offenses and drug crimes many that most of those folks there because of cannabis use we needed to criminalize tracked candidates who would actually save in fact over twenty three million dollars just for arrest alone and then you look at how much we would save\nBy reducing our prison population [laughter] this is why Congress is warm it's going to be necessary not only to save taxpayer money but to ensure that we are able to cut back taxes for are hard working poor\nThough in your criminal justice reform would extend beyond just ... your obvious uh uh I did identification of of a cannabis marijuana type issues\nThat particular a scope or what have you got that far yet\nWhen you come down to ... you know the first step is to decriminalize candidate is the second step you as a people have been very well aware that I'm very much in favor of legalization a Medicinal Cannabis I Want to see it as an alternative medicine it could be not only taxing regulated but it would be another revenue base that we can apply towards education and infrastructure in our state\nOkay because our time is short um what about health care and you said a portable health care for 'em [noise] um what is your I think we know what your position is on ah the proposition to um how do you see that moving forward as governor\nI'm always about fiscal responsibility and conservatism when it comes down to our taxpayer resources I Want to make sure that people understand that voting yes on prop too will be critical to saving our state money\nKnowing that the CIA is not a perfect system this is why I'm going to address the fact that we need to ... make it better for every single citizen in Idaho but right now to take that positive first step we should vote yes on prop to ensure that we have\nExpanded access to Medicaid so that everyone especially those who are caught in the gap because they make just over the poverty level but still are too poor to be able to apply for Medicaid that sucks need to have health insurance that's what that's doing is allowing them to have health insurance\nAnd let them pay for it let them have access to primary care and the doctor and then that would actually reduce costs for a local county says specially when it comes down to an indigent care\nSo let's cut back on taxes people should not have to pay more in tax for health care\nThat we did is we have a phone call if you'd like to take a phone call easily civil you do you're on the line with a public Jordan for morning welcome to show\nYes Richard and I just go back to the marijuana thing I don't disagree with legalize it you're at Idaho [noise] but uh you're talking\nAbout the prison system would you like that retroactive as far as looking into cases where that's the reason why people were put into prison was because of marijuana and or allow those people uh should be taken out\nOf prison I'll take my answer off the air thank you very much\nOkay and so I guess the question is great I appreciate your um your response there is there", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Top Story", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "10"}
