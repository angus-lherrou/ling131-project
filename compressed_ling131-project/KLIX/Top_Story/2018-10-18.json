break a propositions wanted to I voted early so I've already had when I say on these things and uh I I Know though that there's a lot of a discussion going on media wise with number one number two\nMight be the bigger one would it actually comes to overall impact on most Idaho and are you pro or con on on Medicaid expansion\nWell um my wife and I certainly I give you a little background my wife my daughter and I living in Idaho we pay over eleven hundred and sixty five dollars a month out of pocket for our insurance and for me being a Scott's men were frugal are not cheap [laughter]\nIt kills me it just kills me to pay that I think it's outrageous for something that you if you're not using you still got to pay for a ... I Would love to have it reduced like everyone else I think it's outrageous I look at 'em\nI look at hospitals that claim nonprofit that charge twenty dollars for an aspirin for instance and I have friends that had to go in last month I'm for emergency surgery and in a just devastate the family the costs just devastate\nAnd I would like to see something done about it but the heavy hand of the government always worries me is um when somebody says don't worry the government's here to help\nHaving worked for them on projects multiple projects over my thirty three year career I can tell you\nIt doesn't always help so I Would be all for it if you can figure out a way we can do word doesn't put more burden on the working class it's just throw in one more brick on her back every time they come up with a new idea\nThey throw in another brick on her back in and really we need to come up with a way to do this maybe managing where the money is going um I imagine there's a tremendous amount of waste and unneeded stuff that's taken place\nI found that in every entity I've worked for so I wouldn't say I'm not going to be for as long as they're going to put more burden on the tax payers they can figure out a way to finance it and make it happen without burdening everybody I'd be for a number\nOf probably one of which is on the historic horse racing uh that's the one that's gonna I think most of the media attention but I think it's probably impacts fewer people in the state of Idaho or what your gut feeling on that you like it or or you're against it\nI Am not for that in any form whatsoever I looked into it in depth because I'm running for office now it's my job to look into this stuff and I see where the money's going and once again I fall back on that Scottish heritage you know be frugal\nAnd they they made promises while the schools are going to make money off this and they pull up the heartstrings and and if you look into it and you'll find out that just bogus\nIn a small amount of money that goes to the schools is just to make them feel better\nI'm it's gambling it's it's a way to expand the machine gambling and that's all it is I Love horses we have horses on her ranch or my daughter writes horses every single day um I I think that'd be wonderful if we can do that without bringing in the gambling industry\nUh in other words maybe find somebody maybe it was clean her hands to read it oh yeah [laughter]\nI wanted to point out too as well as the fat in our studio with us telephone number two zero eight seven three six zero three hundred we've got about two minutes before the next break um\nIn a studio with us telephone number two zero eight seven three six zero three hundred we've got about two minutes before the next break um question that doesn't I think it off often asked us if you know day one what do you do when you walk into that legislative chamber what is your number one priority\nMy number one priority is school safety having a daughter go in there and working at the school volunteering at the school they're all like my kids most of them are at my house most of the time they literally are bussing busloads of kids to my shop\nAnd I do field trips there and science and technology I'm so school safety is number one I've had the pleasure of working with our sheriff Dave Sanders\nAnd developing new systems to be used in the schools\nIn the event of an active shooter and we've worked out and I say we Dave is done most of the foot work on this amazing sharp individual\nReally technical guy and and I think he's come up with a winning combination that will probably be used at schools around our our state\nThere was a a company I Do in Maryland a few years ago that literally built the door a classroom door that you could not put a bullet through a\nWell you might you might some of the bottom alone can carry a caliber that big around the school and get very far but this thing is designed and also the shells that a teacher can simply push up against the door to in that situation is all sorts of things technology out there we haven't even considered yet\nThere really is and that's one of the worry is working at the school I can tell you that it's an old facility um there's nothing at our school that would stop a bullet I mean the laws that most schools are built very style but you know regular conventional bullets will find a new path\nWhen everyone gets nervous and I trained a U.S Marine Corps how to shoot and the one thing that everyone has in common is they miss a few rounds short the minute you arm teachers the minute they step out in that hall and they start shooting\nI don't think that's a problem\nWe got more coming up with a with my dad and uh it's coming up on a forty and we also want to

folks pro and con on proposition one are likely paying the light bill the with the radio station with all the advertising that's going on\nAh in favor and against a war we call historic horse racing which the name itself um doesn't really give a lot of detail what it is is there is a library or sixty thousand past\nHorse races that have been videotapes and they pop up at random on a machine and people who go to a horse tracking when there is not an actual live horse race going on or they can bet on these things and uh the proponents say well this will help keep a Idaho horse racing going in this data up\nSubsidize that uh but the opponents I'll say that they don't feel that people who are behind it are necessarily being up to speed on all of us so I guess the question we have for pastors and I know most of you probably don't recommend gambling in the pope it\nIs where do we all stand on this\nI guess the question we have for pastors and I know most of you probably don't recommend gambling in the pulpit is where do we all stand on this uh I don't know who's going to be the first to dive into this one [laughter] all pointed to pilot who said yeah go ahead and that's usually\nThe

[laughter]\nOh\nThat's just terrible this morning on his radio searching ... news radio searching ...\nTo find out that joining us in Studio ... Thompson pastor barrel Martin and ah I mean it all the way from Paul today and dodging all that traffic or\nAnd construction and the like\nThe best to John downs uh when I realized when you do this and of course the last time John was here they still have construction going out of the local streets are things a little bit better there are you going to follow up a little bit on what the other shoe pastors were pointing out to us about a\nGambling and where are you know you're an addiction and and what to do to you in the long run I mean it in the in the community\nAnd in and they made some good points and just following up with that and we're gun headed God has his direction on our lives and what do you watch for us and he wants us to London to serve him and\nYou know it's the idea of gambling gambling it's it's it's it's one of those\nAre things that draws like they're talking to entice as you it pulls you went to want to continue to do it like they they need to feed off these people to make a living doing it and that's what it does is it promotes a false hope for that person and they they keep thinking that\nAnd God and becomes becomes an idle issue in our life and it becomes something that we need to be very aware of and so you know and just passed really thinking through that for myself and how I'd want to teach even ... congregation or what that looks like is you know is is gambling\nOr if say like I've gamble before in the past um it is that same counted against me well no I mean you're forgiven every stands and Christ Jesus\nAnd like Paul says if in if crisis out of the picture and you're replacing it with with gambling and you're not asking for forgiveness and you're putting your hope in and making a big money then then there is a problem I was going to say\nIt it's a little bit like or what we're dealing with right now and anybody who's traveled through twin falls this morning and and come to the editor section a dad is an avenue and Washington street is a giant billboard they're telling people you've when nine hundred million dollars if you buy a ticket and you could uh you got a better chance of getting hit by lightning and are\nProbably a far better chance and and so we actually are seeing these enticements come from a\nI don't even think the government's when they said some of these up ever expected that we'd see such a I declared a an obscenity singled him out that that high posted on that billboard this morning um but it it really I think it's got to bring into question or our priorities are because then I got to be people who are going to be spending the rent money trying to win that nine\nHundred million dollars in the next few days and I don't know how any of you feel about that and probably nobody in government consulted you in the beginning [laughter]\nWell yeah it's kinda like walking in Walmart right when you see that at Twinkie or that hostess cupcake and you're there for when the white told you to get milk and bread and and you're thinking that I think we can we can afford this unreality something's gotta give right something's got to give and when I was like I'm thinking now there is electric bill\n[laughter]\nRight you you know when when we see the the the ... the the heavy promotion of taking such a a an enormous risk is this a ... a a reasonable think are really has to realize there there has to be something behind why there's such an an enormous amount of of hype around it\nI'm there and and so we just have to really guard ourselves you know in the book is um shopper sixteen were instructed us that we're better to have a little with righteousness than to have great income or great money with injustice\nSo for the fall or the Lord Jesus Christ our greatest aim is not in the temporal world but it's it's rooted in the righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ and that that is the pinnacle there is nothing better than living in the righteousness of God and so any enticement into the temper world is a distraction\nAway from the glory of God and we have to be careful guard ourselves now\nAnd and I was noticing today that when we talk about all these things that just occurred to me whether it be the historic horse racing or whether it be a lottery all of these have some government\nInvolvement and we're getting to a point where maybe we've we've jumped the shark culturally and that that we've got government it seems to be I Want to say it's preying on people but in order to tell people wouldn't give you more but\nWe'll do this instead and us governments going to try to bring in revenue any longer but it's going to hurt the people that claims to serve\nAnd I was just thinking about scriptures in an excess chapter twenty as a pastor I it's tough for me to even get past the first commandment to think about you should have no other guys but for me in that that process to mine in evaluation of everything that I Do uh I\nDon't want competition with with my guy the guy he was\nThe deans said me and so ... to think that that these other things that life gives us and I get a little squeamish when somebody says you're not just gambling it's just it's just entertainment is just something that we do and I'm thinking man it's a slippery slope slippery slope\nJohn Ascher is in [noise] I'm reminded of scripture to an hour\nAnd ... thirty and these things at this uh\n... it's the words of a ... Senate Jacob and something that I keep it in my own in the back of my own\nMind is I think of how I Am living and he says two things they ask us he's praying to God deny them not to me before I die removed far from me faltered in line give me neither poverty no riches feed me was food that is need for for me last I'd be full of you and a nine\nSay who is the lord or less that'd be porn steel and profane the name of God there there is a level of satisfaction\nWhere we are to be satisfied\nWith God and him alone\nAnd don't give me two little there so that I have to scrounge and fight that I may still or perhaps that I Would\nAsk gamble and don't give me too much either that I Would become comfortable and then forget all that you've done for me there's a level there were to be fully satisfied and everything that God has given us and you know within this level of of being satisfied we we find that the main idea of contentment\nOn poor people yesterday to short break and there were massive thanks yeah tune as well uh twenty minutes wait until the clock in both trying to squeeze in a telephone call or two as well and the next I go to the program\nAre joining us in Studio ... or John ...

this morning we're having a conversation by the way about gambling because of course proposition one is on the ballot in Idaho and we have a nine hundred million dollar jackpot\nAnd one lottery game in fact as I understand looking at the sign this morning [noise] ah one of the other the Powerball jackpot is nearly half a million dollars as well and what does it mean where are we going and I'm a one of the dangers to you or\nIf you fall prey and ah you bet the farm and all of these things we have a caller with us in color Europe next you're on the air on pastors roundtable lost nine nine forty three\nThank you um I Want to echo what the factors have said so far about this the issue um\nAnd as a Christian and I also agree that we can't dictate to people what what they can do but we can decide what we can do and it ... issue and so this voting issue is not a matter of a dictator someone else what they do but simply what we believe and you think about\nHow dry hot people right from wrong he gave him very clear commandments and then showed them how to live to be happy and the best way to combat these things is that you're the best that we can and if people don't participate in gambling programs\nThan the gambling program will eventually disappear or\nIf we show the example of how\nMuch happier you can be without that that in my mind is the best tool to combat things like that\nOne of the color a response is\nYes I was just getting quickly citizen not a moral issue for say this is the question is about obedience desiring to follow the lord and picking up the cross denying yourself and and and being a light and the community and\nAnd that transforms every area of our life we we're picking one little aspect of others the ballot and things but its were sold out for Christ and so we want to honor the king this\nAnd uh and so we're in a march by his orders because he knows what is good and what is right on his holy and what if we desires of us and so\nI'm just going to make a quick comment about the caller before Venus being an agent uh in that arena he's ... no doubt as seems thing he's a very valuable a piece of information to to see things behind the scenes and I thought that was a pretty good insight from him\nAnd slowly and just just coming off of that is in this is an opportunity for us as Christians to speak truth to this matter and to share the gospel with the people are\nAbout what what is taking place in what perhaps is taking place it would become even closer to us in the state of Idaho very conservative state and where something like this would want to feed off the week and the poor\nWhere we have an opportunity to be able to speak the truth only to legislation into you know government officials but also to those who are affected by gambling and people who are\nUh perhaps wanting to gamble themselves but\nFor us we can we can speak the truth into that and when Jesus Says he wants us to see first his righteousness and something that we like the last caller has said we need to be doing is to be be living out of the good ... a good example but also to be\nSeeking first God's kingdom as Christians so that we are then speaking the truth to these kinds of issues and that's why poll I think really want to address this issue\nYeah [noise] yeah and you know when when you start looking at this proposition and compare this in a way everything and against scripture which I think is the Christians duty wait we can't just a act on on a political party's position or a historic position where parents stood on in a certain situation\nWe got to be disciplined enough to think biblical eight and a time like this the scripture teaches us in and saw him chapter Seventeen that says this that that that one with a twisted mind will not succeed and one with a deceitful speech will fall into ruin\nSo we stop and think why why is the language around such a proposition intended to deceive fully make us think it's about horse racing\nOn in all reality may all you got to do is read the proposition has nothing to do with actual\nHorse racing it has to do with the machine that one inserts money and bets on historic horses that they don't even know what Horst they're betting on or what race are betting on it's it's it's a calculated mechanism and so it's it's designed around deceitful speech and the scriptures teach us\nThat when something is is introduced in a deceitful manner the end of it is ruined and so for me for the believer I think\nI don't want to participate in anything that's intentions on the front in er deceitful in that matter\nI was just going to add to what that John you brought up Matthew six thirty three the first the kingdom I Would just add this and the righteousness right or is the whole idea of living righteously this is not ... kingdom living as an honoring the king and and how we live righteously oh God just damage that in the scriptures and so that that's our pursued that's our focus\nI was a ... a couple of things I'll bring them up on the air or during the break a with a pastor's uh one was a clip I played earlier in the show from up Tucker Carlson is a program on the Fox news channel last night where he spoke about Canada legalizing\nMarijuana or an end point out is is you know it's a good way for the government to control the population if they're sitting around because he said this drug or tends to make people lethargic in you know that and takes their mind away from maybe demanding that the government be more accountable and then\nYou throw that in there and then you have governments that are are sponsoring a various\nGambling or whether it be lotteries or casinos and maybe not sponsoring the casino but they they they they they allow the casino they allow a this historic gambling as it's called all of these things and and then I thought about a comment made to me just quietly offhand\nA couple of days ago by the twin falls county prosecuting attorney who went to California and decided to drive\nAnd he said by the time he got two wells and he said you're passing the Broncos and you're passing casinos and then you get to California and he said literally there's somebody has put out of San Francisco map\nWhere the ... percent shades of brown and it tells you that there are certain neighborhoods ... brown means you won't have to step
