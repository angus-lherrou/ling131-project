sometimes make about yeah we don't think about that too oh we'd we'd rather say hey hey ha ha ... we have a problem I'm\nGuilty of that I can raised my hand so our our caller before the break shed\nUm what the heck are we doing\nI'm One of the things that got killed one of the losers that nobody wants to talk about is what I called the rule of law the presumption of innocence in this country you are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty in a court of law\nAnd that means that you have to have\nA witnesses you have to have solid evidence obtained through proper investigative procedures presented to the court\nAnd and you have a a prosecutor and an offender and a a jury of your peers and they determine your guilt or innocence on all of these are allegations\nAnd and even if you're in a a jury trial they'd never refer to the defendant\nAs the uh the guilty person this is the alleged guy\nAnd they never said anything to in for or reflect badly\nUpon the or a person who's on trial because the jury is supposed to consider the facts and then prove beyond a reasonable doubt guilt or innocence so you know what was the FBI doing in this thing\nI haven't got that figure it out but it looks like to me that there's an awful lot of people who would like to destroy the credibility of the FBI they have had the position of being the premier law enforcement agency\nIn the United states and ended\nFor the longest time we all looked at a certain sense of of of reference towards FBI well the last two or three years that has kind of diminished a lot\nUm there were some of the allegations over to this ... and who's ... who and who's secretly recording home and\nAnd the finger all points back to the FBI and then we have the\nBackground searches on on Kavanaugh six of them before the confirmation hearing ever be done and then a seventh one at the request of Jeff Flake and then come back and said we didn't find a thing now we have massive pollution policy\n[noise] who wants to go in and and extract that thing from the ... files and make it public for the whole world to see\nWhy\nAll the United states senators were were free to go down and review that document and make their own decision they kept it secret for\nA variety of reasons probably it's a good idea [laughter] I don't think you want something like that to go viral especially considering all the heat that it created short collars correct why don't law enforcement just do their job\nIf there wasn't a crime committed thirty five years ago file a report with the state of Maryland I think it was and they could investigate it and and interview witnesses and determined the timeline and the the facts\nAnd circumstances of the alleged incident and then make a determination of whether or not they have anything with which they can file a charge and take it to court and if they can sit down and shut up the FBI doesn't need to be involved unless there was a situation where\nThe alleged victim was taken from Maryland to an adjoining state of West Virginia Delaware of Virginia wherever across the state boundary borderline\nThan the FBI gets involved because you have jurisdiction only shoes and they can step in and override each of their respective states well nobody ever did any of that stuff\nThere there was you know what's the FBI doing in the middle of it um most of us have a kind of a bad taste in her mouth about the FBI anyway because they haven't been exposed to exemplary raid the last three or four years two years at least\n\nAnd so we question their motives and that's not how we're supposed to view the FBI that's not what we want them to be that's not where we want them to be we want them to be a little bit more\nAbove the fray\nSo that we could look at him and say hey the FBI check this out therefore has got to be a good deal now we said the FBI check this out and we say yeah who's lying to them and that that sends a or a\n... bad cloud over the the uh law enforcement humidity we don't want that to happen to those kind of guys simply because they were supposed to be the example of good law enforcement procedure so our caller made a good point for the FBI do\nOne

you guys doing good\nThank you um I didn't get to the very beginning of your program but I Do some basic I have some during last I'm past nights game a\nFunding to this but anyway um is there a connection between um the food we eat\nAnd does that affect fury on days my hearing is a terrific and other days it's like well what I hear your shoe a ringing and lawyers and I'm I'm all in your piece this morning so I'll take the answer on the radio if you don't mind it perfectly\nFine\nLeap first of all he said hauling those beat but yes you're absolutely right what we eat what we take into our bodies does affect our ears and\nOur inner ears very very sensitive to any kind of changes in your blood supply and that's why kidneys to me health effects your hand and so you can actually tell a lotta times how how well you're doing by how you're hearing is you're right\nOkay so what kind of food yeah foods would have a negative view of the key 'cause\nThe first one is having you know if you are say your pre diabetic and you're having too many carbs and your blood sugars running high that will affect your hearing okay that's a huge one that people really kind of play down but\nKeeping those blood sugars on an even keel is so so important is your diabetic if you're diabetic and a lot of people are pre diabetic and don't realize it but\nFor anything ... okay I was gonna say the same thing happens if we're in this pre diabetic stage it's\nIt's it it's all about your blood sugar if your blood sugars running high than evil likely ... you can tell that you're not feeling good you'll feel sluggish your ears might bring you might feel like you're not you're just tired that day and that's a that's definitely your body telling you that something's wrong\nOkay and this and so that's a good indicator to see a doctor and actually get diagnosed with diabetes\nYes for sure yes and that's something that we are trying to advocate is letting primary care doctors now that if you have someone that's been diagnosed with diabetes they need to just like you get your ice chapter you get your feet checked as a diabetic and need to get your hearing checked\nInto a sort of a little bit

after they're born so every baby born in Idaho should have the hearing screened and is that screening says there might be something wrong they call it a refer now to fail but if they refer on their hearing test than they are\nReferred to an audiologist um and so our office is really excited to be able to provide those services for these little kids they it's not just to a screening when they come to our office it's a diagnostic hearing test\nWe're checking their ear canals were checking their ear gems were checking how the brain and that you're working together and we can actually

the high frequencies and generally you still hear the based tons okay\nAnd and when that's the case but you still need to devices ... hearing regular things and\n... there are shooting clubs they are\nAn amplifier but generally they're not really great at treating hearing last part and when you have the candidates are the ringing in your ears it would be best served by I'm treating hearing

uh\nYou know get my years check just just as precautionary uh um measure um I've had a few times where I've had and I shoot shot guns without hearing protection or I've one time I had a phone speaker go off in my ear unexpectedly and it was that was painful and\nAnyways yeah that was what are you minutes left in the show has had a few more minutes says\n... a couple more things there there is a a a\nOngoing never ending\nDiscussion about a convention of the states are\nNow this is in conjunction with an article five of the constitution which says that we can convene a no ... for five I said that wrong or\nWe can convene a at a convention of all of the quote several states to make amendments\nTo our constitution now there are two ways to approach this one is through the the legislative branch 'em and we just saw a week of how well that would go those guys can't figure it out who's supposed to go get coffee\n[laughter] that's important for a lot of people\nAnd then most of their staffers don't know where to go to find a way I felt that takes care of that so we can have the the legislative branch proposed constitutional amendments and then they are uh put to the stage for ratification\nAnd we'd have to have two thirds majority of the states ratify a proposed constitutional amendment and at the other the other ... a process by which we can make a amendments changes to the constitution is a quote convention of the states now\nThis particular thing um that I'm looking at this morning was published by the an outfit called hottest blog ...\nBy the name of Pete ...\nHis real name is Peter Coors he is the chairman and chief consumer relations officer of Molson Hoover's ruined company was going to say is from Golden Colorado\nHe is an engineering graduate from Cornell University and a business graduate from the University of Denver or he ran for the United States Senate from the state of Colorado\nUm and and that's when he came to the conclusion that a Washington DC could never fix itself and that's the reason why he has joined with several other people to push for this convention of the states\nTo go through and make adjustments changes to our constitution though they don't have specific agenda items in this article they just you know\nHe has joined with them and and we're trying to get they the the the process is trying to get the ah you have to have the the two thirds majority\nTo even call the convention of the states and then you have to have two thirds majority of prove the results of that convention to the states so I think if if I remember right they have like thirty five or thirty four states\nThat have already approved this convention\nConcept so they're trying to get across this last hurdle to get the last five ... I think it requires thirty eight people is the two thirds majority um do we have a caller ... let's talk to our governor good morning thanks recalling\nGood morning guys this this subject is a very very sticky subject ah\nYou said a couple of things one the legislature is is matched up yes we ... people messed it up\nI don't care what they're doing in office if we allow them to do it by ... voting I'm In we are the problem\nAnd we need to fix it and we need to get rid of these guys you open up a convention of states you are opening up ... box and\nAll hell breaks loose because once you open it up according to the ocean there is no holds barred anything can happen\nAnd anything will happen because I guarantee you there's a few states in there that are hoping that it will happen is when it does good by Second Amendment by\nA lot of stuff and it will be history I I Am firmly against this\nAnd I think we need to educate the people and get the pie that our legislatures that are in office that are not represented us properly out that's my [noise] my sense\nFrom a very good point that you ... we took your call before I got finished my personal opinion is that I Am very very suspect of this convention of the state's nobody has been able to tell me how they are going to select delegates", "show_name": "Top Story", "year": "2018", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "08"}
