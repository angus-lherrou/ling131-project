[noise]\nThat I remember living in a town where we had a big state prison and what happened was over the years a lot of these are prisoners family's moved into the neighborhoods ringing the prison so they could be close to visit some of the probably the neighborhoods went down in a friend's daughter she was sixteen or Seventeen maybe years old and she and other friend\nWere driving through one of these neighborhoods and they saw these guys that are paid to be heard lumps just kinda hanging around on the street and as they were driving up to a stop light they lock the doors and these guys came out a set of pounding on the car when they heard a lot though 'cause they're thinking hey frightened little girls\nNow there's nobody else around they're not on I mean they're sixteen Seventeen year old girls high school girls these guys could a reason why you know they decided to set up a bat\nAnd smash out the windows these girls were going to be in serious trouble what do you do in that situation\nIt's I look at it as you know ... if you're in your vehicle like that and you don't have a farm so I'm just I'm thinking what I'm going to tell my daughter to do something like that happen\nStay locked doors that's a good thing to stay in your vehicle keep going don't slow down ... if someone is going to jump out in front of your vehicle and try to beat on it with a baseball bat or jumping in front of you while you're moving there something seriously wrong there\nThat person's he'd meaning to do you harm\n... I'm not saying a informed but keep keep going you track\nKeep going down the road if you stop and they're gonna have a chance to break the windows if if you're going and they swing a bat and they break your window and you're still moving you're still going to be out of their your best bet is just to stay in the vehicle use it as a weapon use it as your your your your getaway car I gather skate power skate pot and just keep going at ... that's what you know you\nDon't be like just watch every horror movie you've ever seen and do the opposite of what those guys to exit had to get out and go into a scary abandoned building this deep drive and get away from the scene if they pursue you you to call the police the police will be there and they'll they'll handle it you know he's got to\nBut the the worst thing you can do at that point is stick around and let them figure out a way to to get into your car disable you're a goal and says so get out of there\nAnd that might be a you know it it sounds crazy but with the way that things are going there that might be a discussion that you have with your with your daughter who can drive or your son who can drive because my daughter just thought that I Want to hurt anybody and so human reaction is to someone gets in front of your car what's a human reaction is to stop\nMaybe not get out but to stop and even you know we need to explain to him to have this person's probably needs to do the harm to come up you just need to go I mean you're you're sixteen years old that person's out there in the middle of the road in front of your car trying he stopped just go just go the evidence points to something up with that person NATO you're just trying to get away at that point\nYeah I you know the the other part of this there's a lot of the bigger cities we don't necessarily see it here but you get these people you'd call slow walkers you come up short in their section\nAnd they start crossing the street but they're walking really slow so you have to you have to slow yourself or stop that\nGuy is generally there's other people who are watching you and they're trying to size you up and many of those cases so you know the the slow walking guys you got to be aware of your surroundings and the situations because somebody could then come up to the side of your your vehicle and\nA ... this has become common and a lot of bigger cities we all have that issue here\nYou know you're not driving through the city a twin falls and you don't see that I don't think you have it in Boise but I Would bet if you're going to Salt Lake city you're going to find it in some places see again got to be aware of where you are and what these people might be up\nTo write and I want to add to that I'm most newer vehicles will do this on his own on on a cell and you know but lock your doors if you're in your car and you just hadn't across town and your doors don't walk lock your doors so if you're sitting\nThose will do this on its own on on its own you know but lock your doors if you're in your car and you just hadn't across town and your doors don't lock lock your doors so if you're sitting there desktop biter someone does it stop you if you're driving down the road your doors are locked and someone can just run up and and open your door and and get in the vehicle with your tried to pull you out or whatever it might be just\nThat you get your vehicle that she gets your little a boat keep those doors locked and stay safe\nAnd and another thing we talk about life goes on and talking about the car do the same thing

some\nSome two by fours to buy six is I've seen where they just cut the exterior wall out of the house and tipped the gun safe and the wall\nInto the back of a pick up I mean there's pictures of homes with this big huge shape poll cut out of the wall and they've just tip the gun safe out so don't put her on the exterior wall tried to put it in a basement tried to put it somewhere where\nIt's not

your garage shut the garage door work on your safe and work on your safe so dip it in the back of the truck is security systems now I mean you can get monitoring as low as like ten dollars a month

safe and they won't have time\nTo steal your valuable guns because\nThe police response will be there you know because these companies call you if you don't answer then they call the police you can

and there's a story from one of the women she's in rural Wisconsin or Michigan as she points out she said they lived on a back road I mean about a mile from the main road and one day she noticed a couple of guys in a van\nCame driving up to the house so she went to the front door and said I've got a gun they left then she discovered a few minutes later they were out back\nSo she repeated I've got a gun then they left for good just the mention I've got a gun probably said a property or her from what might have happened in that situation was enough to turn these guys are way but that's pretty important I think for\nA a great many people out there to know that uh women in this day and age have to start thinking about how they take care of themselves\nAnd they they are they I mean I see more and more women taking my classes I mean I set up over the summer I set up a you know women's only classes and I've been trying to do that for years and I could never get that many people sign up or fall apart at the end I had\nPeople I mean I filled out like four or five classes to just with nothing but the women I teach you might have had it you know drawn shoot and all kinds of stuff\nUm and they they just ate it up and you know they tell their friends and I see more and more women actually showing up to my classes wanting to shoot\nGoing out on their own even if their husbands are interested in it going out on their own researching asking questions buying a firearm and then taking classes to learn how to shoot it I mean women are becoming more aware that they're going to need

random been fabulous we've sold a couple and the customers have been very happy with them um\nHowever I think there's better choices less complicated firearms to carry in that ah whenever you've got a\nA grip safety got some safety you got all those things going on with a concealed Gary again I'm\nIt's just other steps that you have to overcome to defend yourself not only do you have to draw now
