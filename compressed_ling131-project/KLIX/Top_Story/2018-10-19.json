got something I Want to share with you guys there was a U.S senator baked in Missouri last night\nAnd ah there's a woman but I never Claire McCaskill she's the Democrat and\nUh she was telling the crowd apparently in Missouri ah\nThis this actually is a selling point but to take a listen to this\nI support universal background checks have voted for it we came very close to ... I\nWas working as hard as it possibly could stop universal background check I support the bump stock that to you would think after last August that would be so easy for after they ban that now there are way too many people including most of the Republicans that are afraid at me and All right\nI Know some of the things she's talking about obviously probably aren't as controversial as some of the others the bump stock thing must be honest I mean it's again as a as a serious problem that probably other than we were told once but even the story of the Las Vegas was still so confusing\nDifficult to tell what really happened there are ... but I'm going to guess that uh she's in a very tight race\nAnd she's probably thinking that if she can turn out a few people in her university towns uh that'll make the difference uh\nI mean I don't know I don't know what it's I Love how they say like the an array is like three people they treat it like it's three people pushing they're\nPushing their views on the rest of the country unfortunately for them the ... prize to millions of member so rest of the country and\nAnd [laughter] people that aren't even members of the n._r._a. who agree with their stance right a lot of issues they enter a as a as a unique ability of getting that information out to people letting them know the true facts which which keeps people educated and it's a\nPlace where people go and there's other organizations as well but people who want to keep their gun rights sport in are the n._r._a. that's kind of their lobbying voice in Washington because as an individual we don't have a voice in Washington right what turns the wheels what Greece's the wheels what what your response in Washington\nMoney and he got to have a lobbyist to get in anybody's ears are you and that's what the in areas for for again people they have it for the environmental is they have it for every other special interest split this the second amendment is not a special interest it's a part of our constitution\nOnce they also tend to forget is the an array is much more though than just lobbying uh legislators I mean it you know if it's involved with training and this and you know there's so many other states have such a large organization that I that that's just the tip of the spirit when we're talking\nAbout it well let's let's let's talk about is universal background check okay so I go get a gun and I haven't I haven't checked on a force you could buy a gun you have a check then or law abiding citizens the bad guys the bad guys that go as they go on these shootings breeze and\nThat there are people that they typically aren't going to go to the store and pay money to buy a gun they aren't supposed to have firearms anyhow so they're going to buy 'em on the black market they are going to steal them they're not going to go through a background check that's not harming anyone but the ...\nIn citizen who wants to protect themselves it's not going to stop the bad guys at all they they don't go by their guns over the counter from someone else deal\nAnd the other thought is is you know one there are some ways to get around it you know private sales or the state I don't like it used to own a yard sale you can sell do whatever you want however\nIt should be noted that legally as long as you take collar precautions you there can't be repercussions if that person then goes new uses in robberies to kill someone because you said well they looked like they were Eighteen or Twenty one years old and\nYou'll see solar however in a civil lawsuit you can lose your everything right\nThey can sue you civil Lee and and you can lose everything you've got so just just a thought when you sell a gun make sure that you get a copy of their driver's license or only sell privately without a background check to people who have a concealed weapons permit 'cause you know they've already passed federal background check right\nThen you can go a step further like you could come down to the pawn shop\nAnd for Fifteen bucks we'll do the background check on the transfer for you to make sure the person getting your gun is a legal gun owner you know can legally own a gun and that\nAdds another level of protection and peace of mind and you can say look we did a background check on this person I got a copy their driver's license you know so six months later they went crazy and and did something bad with that gun you're going to be protected because you took you went above and beyond the\nStandard of just like yeah he looked like he was okay\nSo it's all about being responsible when it comes to fire finger responsible how you use it how you\nHow you buy and sell it be responsible okay and as soon as we are not responsible than that look what happened is they they are going to require you to come down to require you to be responsible by doing these these background checks we maintain a little bit of our freedoms to be responsible\nBe wise in your choices and then they won't feel like they have to come in and put their thumb on us and require us to\nAnswer to all these forms and do all this stuff\nWas going to take a short break we'll come back in a in a couple of minutes and when we return I guess is a good way to put that or on the other side of the break I have all these things are going to try to remember [laughter] so I don't

more common a\nCo worker who's turning sixty five and a few months and suggest ah she's going to continue to work and uh and then uh I have a friend of mine who I was working where that another radio station and three years ago he plans to retire at sixty three and then decided\nHe didn't see what he's going to do otherwise so he's sixty six now he's still on the job and\nA service is becoming the norm ethic his wife is still running a business too and uh she's got to be Seventy so this is the norm for a lot of people any longer\nMhm really is one of the things that we see is the trend that this today we had more working seniors and we had since Nineteen sixty five or ... said there is a huge issue\nSee how Medicare works or once you're sixty five you're eligible do I still keep my commercial insurance 'cause I'm Still working but what if I retire and my husband doesn't what's about his insurance what's he going to have so those are huge issues that we need to as a country get

speaking Tanya and the office on aging the um assistance for seniors Medicaid programs Medicare helping us understand Medicare Advantage supplements the cost to retire how about healthy in the whole thing we're going to have people teaching us about safety is our body\nGets a little more frail maybe we should be paying attention so we'll have that\nHad to stay active what is volunteerism and why is that healthy for us as we age so lots of different topics what it costs to retire tax hits lots of good news\nThen of course it doesn't cost them nothing no cost it all just come and share it and there's no age limit to by the way I always need to add that because some people ask well how old do I have to be before I can come because preparing to turn sixty five\nWe at fifty year olds forty year olds come in with their parents I mean a lot of people need to understand what to prepare for\nAn mom and dad can make it somebody else ...\nWe're all ages all their grandchildren coming for the grandparents definitely and it's great information for the younger generation to help their grandparents\nYou know a ... ... we want to point out too as well but uh uh this type of program takes place in like in November third because there are certain sometimes time limits among the things you're dealing with a gun\nAnd I don't you talk about it right now I'm yeah open enrollment is happening for Medicare um beneficiary so from\nOctober Fifteen through December seventh they can look to see if there's a different part D your prescription plan or if they're on a Medicare Advantage plan um if there's a new or more coverage or better option for them for their Medicare Advantage plan\nAnd and so that's good to know to the people I guess most people are aware of\nOf my experience always has been once people get to that age they're really a diligent about uh keeping track of all of these things there's a reason they vote in such large numbers from the very same reason\nAttention right they they pay attention and and uh and that's a block of course that we we joked earlier certain people should know how to ignore\nThe image segments of huge before election day or a nine twenty seven and it's thirty nine and the telephone number to reach us is to zero eight seven three six zero three hundred to zero eight seven three six zero three hundred a common questions you make it from people because I'm sure that every once in awhile to there's a a\nSomeone who comes in and they just have a question you know you haven't thought of it but it's a good question anything on you for like\nThe I'll do that recall in my part and then she does a lot of tiny does a lot of face to face and one of the things that I get because I teach the Medicare one on one session I teach the alphabet soup Medicare ABCD and nobody knows what they are so that's probably are we talking healthcare after forty years in healthcare\nI Know the alphabet soup but patients don't and so we have to be careful as health care professionals in providers that we don't talk like you would understand me I have to explain what party is what part B is and I get asked that a lot of\nPeople just don't understand the basics of Medicare that there isn't just a Medicare program there are multiple pieces under Medicare that's what I get asked\nAnd unless you know you referenced that every program and every\nThere are multiple pieces under Medicare that's what I get asked\nAnd others in this you know you referenced that every every program in every business or profession has its own jargon and you know you've got some time to explain it to people who weren't necessarily immersed in that\nThat is why to boot camp we have to teach the words aren't you you're the one that does a lot of face to face\nOh about a minute but we could talk after ... after the break you don't get through all of it\nOver again I really think I think my number one question concern that I'm here with is do I need to have pardon me if I'm Still working and then about the penalties if you do not sign up and how they will affect them\nAnd this was the other thing we've got to realize you can opt out a lot of these programs is the\nCorrect yes you can well it depends if you're if you're working or not yeah you can always opt out just be aware that you want to opt in there might be some penalties\nOkay but there are certain age you have to make a choice that I thought it was mandatory\nYes yes so sixty five\nAnd you have to make a choice to sign up with Medicare if you're continuing to work I always encourage everyone to sign up with eight it's free why not and be can be postponed until you retire well you have credible haven't\n... or the other team turn dot com joining us in Studio ... and Tanya person

we do want to find out if you got a comment or a ... or ... something you need to know\nEdge to zero eight seven three six zero three hundred were nine forty three and it's forty on a magic valley this morning [noise]\nTV emailed me a bill that collie a town square media to conduct bill that collie at a Time Square media dot com as are joining us in Studio ... and a ton of your Hudson and a ... a little bit of course about this November's or program at the College of southern\nIdaho but I had some talks to a while we were the break and I was sharing this with them getting ready for work this morning had the TV on at the background and there was a discussion with a financial planner\nYou have the background and there was a discussion with a financial planner visiting with the TV news anchor about\nOr this or this lottery jackpot lottery jackpot tonight of of course they they mentioned the odds are you know next to this is talk infinity so most people I worried about that necessarily but the woman who was up offering the financial plans set a lot of times when these big shots are hit by a large group of people play this group\nAnd so they're getting a a a nice piece of money a and it looks huge and a lot of them say well I'm going to leave my job now and I'm gonna quit a but the problem is that the vet huge amount looks great on the one day that you decided to quit\nBut then afterwards five years down the road are you not\nCost so much especially if you're a younger person but\nThat is true mhm you're also going to have to be thinking about well if you're really retiring again and it was as a broken record what kind of insurance you can have ...\nThey the benefits that they are getting with an employer match is significant right now the data that just came out said that in our our premiums for a commercial coverage that the employer is paying about fifty ... percent of that premium and the pay the employees paying the other fifty\nWhen you drop an employer and you're all on your own\nYou and you have to find a way to get medical insurance for you and your family so whenever we think about the bonanza there's this little hidden thing about medical insurance and you go I\nDon't need that were healthy anybody who thinks they're bullet proof needs to talk to their friends who discovered so they have got to plan for medical cost in addition to quitting work they will lose their employers insurance\nWe have a caller with us in color you're up next year on the air until I actually go ahead\nI Will try and try to call her you're on the air on K A lawyer or a nine forty five go ahead\nAnd build ladies oh Mike ... is our ah I've already got my Medicare God I got about six months ago so still a rookie a I'm a veteran so when I use ah my Medicare card or do you recommend for like a follow up in church to back\nWhat I Need to do as far as because I use you know like say through the VA what would this plan to be to go on something like that for like a supplementary in church\nWell as a veteran you have some choices obviously you can use the services that are maybe a clinic and you can get your prescription their um their additional ... you can sign up for\nMedicare full ... and then let the get either a Medicare Advantage plan or a part D plan um if you want it to not use your on\nThe benefits and see a provider within your own town\nYeah Medicare is going to be primary to the to your vet benefit unless you have a service related illness or long term care that you're getting Medicare is going to be a primary mhm\nOkay yeah so I I'm just saying like if something did come up I Am fortunately enough I had to use any real medical even through the VA because I don't understand yet I how much actually that VA would cover it will be the extra cost might be out for what the best to have like a supplementary insurance she'll follow up with the Medicare\nYou know the people that you should talk to not just your VA folks but it should probably visit with the person who sells the supplemental plans because one thing that which is interesting when I was just sharing that I was back\nIn Missouri yesterday doing some education the VA was there and I'm like thank you for teaching me this and it's actually it was a v prepared as a veteran that you will allow the pocket there is no V. a secondary coverage for Medicare\nIt was a v prepared as a veteran that you will allow the pocket there is no V. a secondary coverage for Medicare\nThe only way we have coverage like if you go to your to be a clinic that if you end up at let's say St lukes at the hospital the VA coverage is not there because that isn't a service related injury or illness you're being treated for let's say you just got pneumonia you're broken leg\nSo you really do need to talk to it an agent in the area who can help you understand that and give you some options for your um supplemental coverage\nO. J. thank you very much\nNo I you know I was listening to that and I have a friend a retired from the military and he was telling me this is coverage is ... ... does that change anything and all of this or\nHow does that work and try and carry insurances and different than those who may be in the ones you ate VA\nCoverage um tried care um and their Medicare and will cost him very minimal as a whole different ball of wax when you retired I'm from the military\nOkay and his family coverage campus VA and there's I mean there's multiple coverage is under the quote VA program\nAnd it does take a little bit to figure it out but actually the VA coverage just for the vet that some of the other coverages or for their family so we can have to be careful because they changed all that multiple years ago and for those of us in the industry it isn't exactly easy for us either\nTo figure out which one of these VA packages are you under which one is your family under which one you oh you're retired now okay so that is difficult for the vet is difficult for the health care provider to\nNow ... when we talk about ah well well I'll let I'll do is I'll get back to the phones and wanted to add something just a topic we were on earlier a call to Europe next though a news radio Thirteen to entail I ex were nine forty nine\n[laughter] yeah I'm also a retired navy a twenty four years and I know that when I got my such surety a card that it did become my primary", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Top Story", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "19"}
