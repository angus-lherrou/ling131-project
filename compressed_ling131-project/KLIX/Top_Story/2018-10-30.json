would be the result and in this particular case it that the what was what if only men voted what if only women voted heart if only white people voted\nAnd and so it's about to six or eight pages long and very fascinating outcomes\nAnd and and the thing that struck me was in places like Idaho and Wyoming if only been voted we'd be a red state if only women voted we'd be ready to say it will be a red state and in fact over much of middle America that nothing really changes in that so\nThis notion that men and women are two very diverse voting bloc simply isn't true because apparently Idaho was

well Steve is the chairman of the twin falls county Republican Party\nSo we have a lot of talk about what's going to happen or come one week from today on the national level and of course every two years I hear this is the most important election of our lifetime I don't necessarily believe that I Lived through several of them already in the world hasn't come to an end\nYeah me too and and I read an article in the Idaho State journalist had an opinion piece in their guest columnist and and he was making that this could be the most pivotal election of ever saw that and and I I thought to myself holy smokes you are really\n... and no doubt it is critical to I mean I look at it and a lot of ways and I said to myself uh I don't want this to happen like that\nI Do not want the Democrats to regain control of the house of representatives in Congress and why 'cause nothing will get done and and I I don't mean by that\nThat we would have Democrats in the house and Republicans in the Senate and they would never get any meaningful stuffed to know what I mean is if the Democrats took over the house of representatives most of the preliminary investigative committee type work\nIs controlled out of the house of representatives\nNot the Senate\nThe Senate is there to advise and consent to give advice and consent to presidential actions and we have overlooked at if you look in the constitution\nIt basically says that very same day there was an interesting book written back in the late Nineteen fifties early sixties ed called advice and consent and I don't remember who wrote a book I remember reading it because I took a political science class in college and that was required\nReading so I Do remember reading the book\nAnd and basically it says we have lost our way because we were only ... the ... the Senate was only supposed to be that as a group of body a deliberative body\nThat would give advice to and consent to presidential actions but we've lost that so most of his stuff occurs in the house of representatives if the Democrats regain control of the house of representatives they will go ballistic they will just they will open every possible can of worms they can get their hands\nOn to try to destroy anything they can do to destroy Donald Trump\nI Would come to a screeching halt exactly with uh with ... in control of the house but number two it gives Donald Trump a foil to campaign against for the next two years and Donald Trump can say things would be better if not for that ... may turn it back around and twenty twenty\nRemember the first two years I was president and we had Republicans in the house and the Senate and we were able to do this and this and this and this and everything's going quite well and now we've got these Democrats in there and they are destroying everything we've worked for\nThat said not a bad a campaign strategy not at all\nThe other part of it is and that is kind of a a a a a negative um we're going to have a ... a a a recession we're going to have a little speed bumps in our economy Emma get real it's been ten years since two thousand eight when we had the um recession\nBut they called the great recession right what they called the great recession\nMarketwatch says it will be worse than two thousand eight but most people say and would be ... by historical comparisons buddy is going to happen between now and a twenty twenty elections and so uh that's what killed um George W. Bush was had a recession and and everybody blamed him for it and so they voted for\nClinton but let's take a look at it what are the national elections looking like a ... just before the break we mentioned that uh we're probably looking at somewhere in the neighborhood of fifty five two fifty eight total\nA Republicans in the United States Senate and and if we get some of these places turned to the Republican favor it's going to push the fifty eight number but the the fifty five number is\nProbably real close right today are we still have a Florida there were ... Rick Scott is in a battle down there for that but that's now a toss up that's too close to call\n'em the Montana the guy running against John tester he was behind by ten percentage points now he's down to a test or only has a to point advantage on him with this last week to go and Trump is going to hit there again later this week I think friday or Saturday\nUm and so that that would make a big difference up there again so we get some of that to happen the Senate should be pretty comfortable what about the house of representatives well\nReal clear politics had their ... and I don't know how often they updated it seems to me I've seen the same numbers there now for a week or more and and so you know give me the new numbers\nBut they are saying that the Democrats have two hundred and five the Republicans have two hundred and they have approximately thirty seats that are\nIn play I think is a word they use in play well if you look at the thirty seats that are in play most of them were in a legislative ... none of congressional districts\nThat Donald Trump won two years ago or they are in fact in areas where the a Republican is in office at the ...\nThe trouble there is that a lot of these people didn't follow the blueprint as he laid down and in those districts and if they had because you know he he comes across even though ten billion dollar wealth as a matter of the people and they often the people who are running in those districts as Republicans don't\nAnd and and that's the disconnect between the local level and much of the the national level it is surprising to me that\nAn end to when he gets out to these crowds he packs him in I mean it down to el ... holy smokes shut down the whole cock eyed town while he paraded around down there and they said that the al

liberals and they've been saying that on TV shows and the like for the last six months that they hope for some sort of economic calamity because it would rid us of President Trump [noise] just because they know they\nCan't feed him right now on economic issues and so they've been hoping that you have\nThat you lose your job that you maybe lose your house that you can't afford certain things in life maybe even a doctor visit in order to get what they want and that is a socialist back in the White House\nTells you what they think of you realistically when you when you break it down it tells you what they really think of the average working American and a man and woman\nI bring this up because there's been a lot of hand wringing the last couple of days over what's going on on the New York stock exchange him in as that we've been told anyway a correction was coming soon\nApps and grown so quickly and so fast\nThat there had to be ... again they call it a correction and then we'll find some area where I find to the floor and then we start to build a gas I saw a pundit say on the TV show not too long ago and he was not hostile to Donald Trump\nBut he said if we did have a recession and it was even if it was rather mild if it happens\nJust before election day twenty twenty Trump will be out of this president\nOn the other hand if we have it come earlier and it doesn't last long and we recover and the market picks back up on the market is not necessarily directly tied to the economy\nBut then that will help President Trump get reelected and the pundit thought he would get reelected as long as the economy was coming on election day in two years so just some things\nTo think about if you look at this broader picture of what's going on but as expected by most pundits the Democrats\nWill take the house of representatives next week and the result will be you'll have people trying to destroy Trump's deregulation of the economy which means GDP Growth could slow and and and they would be happy\nTo do that to the American people again so that they could seize power\nCome twenty twenty and then go back to uh to the days of one point eight percent GDP Growth\nThere's a

that all of the off reference increase in affluent says Ben artificially inflated by the fed since the great recession which is ultimately bad news for the economy and the stock market here's how Jesse Colombo analyst that clarity financial explains it\nAnd the fellow said the U.S household wealth boom since the recession is a sham a farce and it's again a climate is tricking everyone into believing that happy days are here again given those are the engines that are driving at our bubbles that are going to burst and causes a crisis that will be even worse than the two thousand eight crash\nNow this guy who was predicting this apparently predicted two thousand eight and he was a college student at the time\nWhen he made the production of college students don't often have that type of wherewithal but he was knee deep and studies on the economy\nSo yes ... well yeah we do have some ... tomorrow somebody could leave over on the desk and at the wrong button and shoot off a nuclear missile and destroy a major city probably not going to happen but it could happen tomorrow\nThe weather can take a set new turn and we could suddenly end up with six feet of snow on the ground probably though not going to happen\nSo a lot of people out there make their living off these warnings despite the fact\nThat I don't think there's a whole heck of a lot of evidence right now other than a few bubbles but to say it would be worse than two thousand eight the only thing is if it was as bad or worse than two thousand eight\nThe government simply doesn't have the wherewithal and the major banks no longer have the wherewithal to do what they did following two thousand eight and that is print up a bunch of money\nInjected into the economy and hope that things would improve\nBecause that sentence deeper and deeper into debt you can only go so far and did that before you can you can any longer do those things and we talked about some of the debt issues on\nThe program the other

attempts among Republicans to try to get this engine roaring again and hope that we can start paying down that just simply by having a roaring autonomy bringing in more receipts to the government\nSo

because they they make a good point that\nWell and you just made a good point there with the Republicans having a little bit of power but I I thought about it and I figured if I did change that would be disingenuous in a sense a to those people who do support me ah just because they supported me being part of this Constitution Party and uh\nI I kind of enjoy the having that third party being outside of it I'm even to the point where our party just we are just unattached ourselves from our national party just recently\nSo we're our own entity we can make our own policy and decisions were not tied down or restricted in really in any way and we can choose those things that are are really the best for Idaho so that's that those are some reasons I stick with the Constitution Party\nA for

candidate and you're listening to news radio searching ... news radio Thirteen ten dot com and magic value this morning with Bill Cali yeah we're going to call a thirty five and nine twenty three\nSo I Do want to find out the answer the as he pointed out earlier or shares a lot of views with the Republican and the race liver ride Harkin and there's a third candidate in the race as\nWell and that's the Democrat Deborah similar\nAh so this is one of the few really competitive races at this point ah in this part of Idaho when it comes to state legislature this year because a lot of folks when they got by the primaries had nothing but a really no opposition ahead of them going into November\nOf ... we were just talking a little bit about the quality of life around here and there's a couple of issues these propositions that are on the ballot this year yeah anybody getting elected to the legislature this year is going to deal with the fallout one way or another from all of these um proposition ... what's your sense\nSo I\n... and this one's kind of a little bit mixed because it's the you know it's the idea that we're we're in a sense you know getting more freedoms in the state of Idaho\nBut the problem I see what that is that it's it's freedoms for a special interest it's just for people who have a horse reckon I mean I don't ... you don't ... I assume you don't want to strike down there\nAnd you know many people don't annoy her strength much work for me ... exactly and I I don't like horses I tried raising them when I was kid not my thing but if I wanted to start some form of gambling in the state of Idaho I wouldn't have that opportunity even ...\nUh what's your thought on that a ... same on that one I I'm I'm going to vote no on proposition too as well and I hear a lot of the argument that we need to get our our federal tax dollars back\nAt and to you know all that money ways we give to the federal government and it's usually the argument comes from people who don't realize how indebted the Idaho really is to the federal government how we don't\nGive nearly as much as they get back to us but beyond that point I Can't see obligate ing folks from your old neck of the woods and in New York\nObligated to them to pay for the health care of an Idaho and ah you know unless it's a veteran of course and I don't really care about that we need to take care of those folks but uh\nYou know if if people really want this kind of initiative it needs to be an Idaho based initiative and I'm may or may not get on board with it how it would look but because I I'm not a\nFan of a government sponsored type of healthcare um being in the military for several years I'm not a big fan of government sponsored much because I've seen a lot of the stuff that comes out you know the greatest food and\nGreatest everything else but I I feel that it you know if we are going to try something that needs to be an Idaho based initiative not getting our hands into that federal stuff\nAnd then the philosophical\nArgument on this one is says that maybe the government shouldn't be involved at all and number two says gosh it would be compassionate to do at least something for the this group that falls in the middle or is there a simpler solution then expanding the big government program right now the gotten it'd be very expensive leviathan\nOh and and I mean unfortunately if you if you talk to some folks in the medical community to try and find that a\nBetter solution you know they're they're so excited about the Medicaid expansion that\nThat you really can't come up with that and and the reason I say that is because the solution we need to be more engaged with those in that medical community\nAh because they they're on the frontlines of it they know what's going on and part of it too is I I think in Idaho we need to be open to more what more ideas of what healthcare possibly is\nUm unfortunately with the Affordable CARE Act the Affordable CARE Act defines health care and we're all restricted inside of those boundaries so we I think we need to remove some of those restrictions and be more open to well not necessarily be more open I don't want to be open to\nSome forms of health care I'm not going to go start smoking marijuana or anything crazy like that but ah\nAs a state be open allows people to have more of these opportunities for different types of healthcare um things that they may they see that works for them because something that works for me is likely not going to work for you or\nThe person down the street a different health care up or different a health issues and different activities that we we do\nI guess it's it's like the government saying that you know the young men even under Obamacare have to carry coverage for birth or some of the things related to that now and there's ... ... ... you know you sit back and you say okay this is completely illogical\nAt well I Am getting into the Affordable CARE Act I mean that's the only way that they could get that stupid thing figure it out is to mandate those those people so they could pay it so they could do the whole communist\nYet that stupid thing figured out is to mandate those those people so they could pay it so they do the whole communist thing and\nYou know right off the backs the hardworking I guess or

winning public office in a place so deeply red as Idaho then joined the house even at the house doesn't always in agreement with you\nAnd you can talk to voters of all stripes before election day so tomorrow Aaron Swisher who's the Democrat\nRunning against Mike Simpson and now going up against Simpson\nAt this stage of the game when he's been in office so long as a little bit like a David and Goliath approach but Aaron Swisher I was in a toddler missed is going to be joining us tomorrow morning just out of the nine o'clock news on this program and then on Thursday I Kristin column\nWho is a Democrat running for lieutenant governor in Idaho was I Believe going to be with us but I don't have time yet set up on that so I I just wanted to share that so you'll have some alternative views from candidates outside the usual conservative orbit on this program\nAnd I don't have a problem with listening to them hey the dialogue is good and maybe if some of you are in the next couple of days would like to talk to those candidates\nPerhaps it wouldn't be a bad thing for ah for the candidates to hear from some of these people to listen to conservative talk radio\nOr just a thought out their benefits both of you I Would suppose or thirty six to nine forty five on magic valley this morning they'll collie a news radio thirteenth and kale I exit news radio Thirteen ten dot com and I do have an email a from an organization\nThat lost to talk about proposition too and I posted something about it on our website last week and somehow they came across it\nThis is the national organization and we're going to try to get them on the air if not a friday perhaps on Monday even though a lot of people have already voted with early voting is still a lot of people will go to the polls next Tuesday on election day itself and\nA prop to might be the biggest issue\nIn a long long time on the ballot in Idaho so big things big news coming up and the one week to go before election day got mentioned a couple of things if I could quickly this one is a little on the lighter note but it also it plays a huge part\nIn office culture all over the United states now I Know people out there\nWho don't drink caffeine or some people don't do it for religious reasons the president of the United states doesn't do it because he doesn't like to take anything uh\nThat isn't natural for instance he doesn't you'd ever use tobacco is never drank caffeine and uh and he has never to my knowledge had an alcoholic beverage so you know God Bless him are we talking about the president people always say wow you know morally but at least when it comes to what he puts into his mouth a\nWay to what he drinks he is lead a pretty clean life but if you work in any office setting you do know that there's always a handful of people who just say they have a coffee addiction would be to put it mildly\nI read the other day we're Tucker Carlson will drink eight cups of coffee a day and that's why he's always so wired on his TV program uh this morning I started out with a\nWell to mugs which I guess the ... on a on a pot at home it says six cup line\nBut I don't I don't trust that anyway to me a ... a month and that six cut blind us to box inside two of those then I came into the office and I had one more mug while I was sitting at my desk so I had three mugs which I guess probably translate also too about eight cops that's pretty much my average\nUnless weekends when I'm Around the house on weekends I just tend to drink coffee more wall and partnering around the kitchen and doing some chores ah during the course of a long Saturday morning and uh\nOther than just water or do you know it's got a little flavor to it I Know people say coffee flavor are you kidding me it does you just have to say it's an acquired taste but there are people that work when it comes to coffee\nNext to a job it's the most important thing in the office was the way it should be I suppose but sometimes the coffee drinking actually rivals everything\nAbout their job there's a story in the wall Street Journal I wanted to get to this a few weeks ago came out of a few weeks back\nAnd it's been sitting on my desk and I I wanted to talk about this headline this eleventh scoops are twelve coffee wars come to the office now there's a serious part of this too\nIf you give someone something and you tell us something they've never had before and you gave it to them long enough eventually they decided so right\nIt's a little bit like entitlements if you give people something it's it's why Americans do they think that health care is a right because in so many cases the government is given so many people something along the lines of at least a mental health care that they've come to believe that this is what they deserve\nWell when it comes to coffee at work and works a lot the same way why because a lot of officers decided a long time ago that the coffee that they serve the employees\nShould be free I worked at a radio station wants to many many years ago where we had a coffee club you pay two dollars a week to be in a club and that way you got to drink coffee at work but it was still cheaper than let's say going down the street and buying it as a local dire\nOr at a convenience store so most people chimed in with the two bucks and then lo and behold a new do general manager came
