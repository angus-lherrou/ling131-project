[laughter] or they don't like sour grapes nah nah my big thing ... already about that oh that's it's not for everybody I as a kid I had sauerkraut I Love it now [noise] and maybe as soon as I learned to acquired taste yeah it is you got right there\nYou know we get to looking at all clear that the legislature is only two months three months away I'm In a good by quick or the ... a month away yeah\nExactly actually it's four weeks from yesterday and you know five weeks from yesterday yeah I'm holy cow [laughter] I Know times ... it'll be Christmas in a way but let's not pushing faster\nA first things first [noise] stays however um we're already you know one of the things that happened everybody would like to think that um [noise] the legislature shows up on the tenth of January and they begin the legislative cycle process\nUm non not so much what we really do and really work on is that\nUm we want people\nTo tell us in advance\nThose items that we need to be working on the legislature there is an organization called the legislative service organization and and that they are ... begin to accumulate all of the bills and resolutions and all this other stuff that the legislature or\nWill be considering when they meet beginning in January so many of the items that will be considered in next year's legislative process is already being presented to legislative services now what does that mean well\nYeah the government's speak for we got to get things done but what what they do is they draft\nA bill write it up in in in draft\nForm at so that as a legislator they can send that out to me I can look at it and say okay here's the bill ... what does it mean that sponsors of these various things can attach their comments and say here here's what it really means it here's how it's gonna or\nOr if they've got a individuals who are requesting it then they could call the individual and say look I'm looking at your\nRequest for a a a bill for the legislature\n... and then you could explain what we want to you know move Christmas till the twenty ninth of June [laughter]\nWell you know that's a bad idea because it's a great idea because and and and so all of these things are considered and and and put together\nA many of our legislate tours of the currently seated ones um and and that they are members of the various committees that are meeting and considering a potential or he likely legislation for the next session\nNow in the case of some individuals who are retiring from the legislature\nThey may still be on committee assignments\nBecause they're still see did but I'm at their replacement or those who are running to replace them are can attend these meetings as an observer\nNot as a participant but as an observer so that they don't get behind on on what is it that these are various committees within the legislature are considering doing uh that's why we see so much of\nA bit with regards to the Transportation Department lots of meetings lots of discussion about uh what about transportation well it's a huge huge budget yeah\nAnd and so they do and that they require a long term horizon\nOr you don't just say we're going to build a new bridge gushing Kenya this afternoon and round up three hundred million dollars to go to work yeah you have to put it in place in planet for and it takes a few years that's an extreme example but even things as as\nWe would think that maybe it's just casual changing speed limits oh in in various locations\nThey will have hearings on changing speed limits and what's the impact that why do you want to change that speed limit has there been some extenuating circumstances like an increase it accidents\nOr no accidents and she'll maybe we can raise the limit by five or ten miles an hour\nOr ... and most of these things are being considered and and and pastured right now so that what the legislature beach in January they don't start from zero they've already got most of the preliminary stuff\nOut of the way and they can begin moving through that process one of the reasons why we can get our legislative work completed in about Ninety Days every year is on the preparation work that occurs prior to that and uh we say that it's a part time legislature but they do the full time staff\nAnd the staff puts all this stuff\nTogether for the ... when they get there they have\nOccur and that happens as we do we have a break it to me it was just a little break coming up from a one minute a nose happening not always [laughter]\nSorry to say today do give me a I

vaccinations I had a shingles vaccination about eight or nine years ago and ah it was fortunate because last year I did contract the case of shingles but it was a a lot more severe I Am told that it could have been what\nWould be the recommendation to take a the newest vaccine\nSo they're saying even if you've had this not serve X. sit still go get that newer one called the ...\nI mean still have some protection without soft of act and I'm as he mentioned it it doesn't protect you a hundred percent from the singles by it often makes that must've ear on than an outbreak would have been without a vaccination and kind of the same concept to with flu and then ammonia vaccines that we have\nSoldiers shingles is this something should consider on an annual schedule or buy a new\nRight now they say when you did that ... your updated until maybe they come up with the I don't know what else they might call the next when they might develop that\nTraining are good for an extended pretty young yet ... video pneumonia thing is kind of been the same category\nAnd so the pneumonia is a little bit more complicated so well yeah I Do want to do so there are actually um to pneumonia vaccines out there um one called the pneumococcal and one called the partner\nAnd on that one um is one that is kind of dependent on if you have a lot of ... suffer diabetic I mean we know compromise they're going to recommend to start a pneumonia vaccine theories\nWhen you're young I'm older than Eighteen um it started a little bit younger but if you're kind of generally healthy person on the recommend starting vaccinations that sixty five and older\nFor millennia and on and then there's two shots so you have to space them out a little bit to keep track of that one\nAs a but but the pneumonia things you'd better plan on maybe every couple of years or every year\nAnd a lot more about the story though and that is why I mean I Would definitely consult with your provider about 'cause it's very dependent on your medical history am if I got you got a younger before sixty five you do need to update it\nUm after sixty five you need the two shot series and then you're generally good on that one\nCan skip the thing's scheduled [laughter] she wanted to talk about some things you know yeah and it's good that you're still should see the dark I mean generally good health but I should make it a point to see my doctor regularly because\nYes so um one thing that I see a lot of as we have patients coming in on because they have insurance they need to fill out um ... maybe gives them an deductible on their premium 'em and they're coming in thinking I'm young and healthy I feel fine\nUm I never getting their idols and we find out that they have really high blood pressure and they had no idea because routinely or not checking our our blood pressure and not checking her eight or oxygen on and sometimes those things can show up and and be something that we're able to help\nThey're not checking or hurt rate or oxygen um and sometimes those things can show up in and be something that we're able to help you modify and reduce that chance of having long term health problems so in

have lost a lot of weight you haven't changed anything that you're doing and and then we need to be a concern for some more serious issues like things like cancer\nRapid weight loss shows them a ... it's probably much more concerning than an increase in weight because weight loss is the indicator that something else might be wrong\nAnd waking can also to um things like that right disorders can

and everybody should get their running shoes on and get\nOut the door and down the road there at work you just get your work and you didn't work out [noise] there's a couple of issues that we can we buy the day without talking about the confirmation to Moscow on\nKevin there was an article that showed up in a\nNational Review was authored by a guy named\nUh uh Ramesh palm new uh\nAnd he writes for the national review and it was a publisher we published I should say in Bloomberg he says the Republicans don't have any choice they've got to confirm a Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd he said there are two or three issues that we can't a scape as we look at this entire process\nAnd then so he's taking a little bit more uh [noise] uh oversight view ...\nAnd he says her five good reasons we need to consider\nTo avoid injustices\nClaims that Kavanaugh\nAgainst Kavanaugh cannot be taken seriously or if this was a legal trial none of these witnesses would be considered credible and they would not be permitted to ... to a a testify\nAdditionally there's not enough evidence to bring it to trial in a court of law\nEven his existing judge ships would be insecure if it was ... ever brought to trial\nSo not only are we at challenging his uh\nAdmission to the Supreme Court now we are challenging his position on the DC circuit court of appeals [noise] uh and and that's a gross injustice\nThe second reason that we need to continue to to push for Kavanaugh is to discourage future ... various campaigns against nominees and this has been one of the things that I have told many people as they have talks with me and that is\nUm if if this is let stand\nAnd and all these unfounded or on provable allegations\nAre are substantiated than when will we ever find someone who will be willing to step forward to accept these kind of nominations ever again they simply won't you don't have to believe her allegations are entirely or that they are true\nOr nor do you have to believe that they are all politically motivated to just think about the ideological and purchasing opposition's that is shown a conservative judicial nominee\nNumber three a lot of conservative voters might see the demise of Kavanaugh's nomination as a betrayal a sign of weakness\nAnd and therefore they would sit out the midterms in disgust and I think that's another\nOf Rush Limbaugh said a couple of weeks ago if the Republicans don't confirm\nKavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nThey will lose the election so badly that they will not figured out what happened number for the Republicans might not get another\nNominee confirmed if they abandon Kavanaugh if they lose control of the Senate in this upcoming election they're really not going to be able to find another nominee that they can confirm\nI can see that the Democrats would be delighted to deny any Republican and any other\nSupreme Court confirmation than his fifth claim is those claims that are having a will taint rulings that he makes are deeply overstated if Susan Collins believes that the evidence strongly points in Kavanaugh's favor\nAs it does she should not nor the conclusion to did defer to the sensibilities of people who don't care about evidence and and so we have five these are just I'm more ... political\nUh reasoning ... uh but they all make sense\nRemember we talked earlier about well wait a minute what's the big deal about having a conservative justice on the Supreme Court or the big deal is we are making a tremendous shift in\nAnd therefore the deep decisions from the Supreme Court we have another phone call her with us this morning or good morning welcome to the show\nThat morning gentlemen you know I I strongly believe that this is a shame but you know [noise] I think we need to figure out\nHow to push the issue\nOf accusing someone and and the information the character and charging these people with this thing you know and and there's a couple of times today that you mentioned conservative justices\nWhat we need on the Supreme Court is someone that is going to uphold the constitution and I do\nHave to be a conservative they just have to believe in all the things that our forefathers put forward for us and live by it now if we do that\nEverything will be fine but I Hope and I pray that nobody sits out this election because it is a very\nImportant almost as important as it two thousand sixteen election and we need to get this they taking care of and wrapped up and not allow the Democrats the brand is eleventh hour stuff that we're seeing more and more and more and and\nWe need to prosecute them when they accuse somebody of something that they didn't do and then we can put an end to it thank you thank\nYou and you know how is it that uh um I think in in the ... criminal courts the coldest slander and and if if I did this to just a and an individual or that would be ... slanderous\nAnd and they could file suits against me why in the world do we allow this kind of stuff to take place\nAnd people have no recourse against any of the people making these accusations um we have another phone call her this morning the morning you're on the air\nIt more than ... years the

States Senate how much damage as just done\nTo their stature as as being an ... and people who should be a\nConstitution should they're supposed to give\nAdvice and consent for the president\nHave

... seconds wanting Missouri\nLast caller things is this whole Kavanaugh\nWas eight Ford was a set of ... it was all a free range and and then\nPredetermined um and and it goes back to the ideas we talk to my way early this morning we were talking about and why is it is so critical why is it and consider to be so critical\nThat some Democrats who do not want any conservatives justice of any kind of a springboard um number one a seminar I think is about fifty years of age ... plus or minus\n... years or so in all likelihood he's got Thirty years of of a judicial decision making associated with\nHis term on the Supreme Court um that's Thirty years of of most likely conservative a decisions are and and you know\nWe we kind of conservative just is what we're really after is people who will that here to be a basic elements\nOf the constitution United States we don't want a active\nJudges who are rewriting everything to fit their own personal narrative\nAnd and that's nobody wants to talk about that side of of the judicial process or we want things to be in according to what the constitution and according swift the rule of law and\nThere's too many people think that we just put the right judge in there\nAnd he can overturn all of that stuff and come up with it come up with his own set of criteria the problem with the Supreme Court and ... a lesser extent the circuit courts or if they don't get appealed to the Supreme Court\nI'm the same thing holds true circuit court if they make a determination on a particular point is that a particular a\nLawsuit is not challenged further to the Supreme Court it becomes the the a standard for that particular circuit from now on um we have another caller they telling me here so good morning welcome to the show\nThat Republican Party show on TV Hiroshima and Nagasaki after they were ...\nA little bit off of where we were going but it it points out that that we are we really do have a double standard that if you are saying what I Want you to say it's okay if you were not saying what I Want to hear you're not okay\nAnd and and so our our caller makes an interesting point why do we want to ... absolutely destroy a man like uh rent Kavanaugh\nOn unfounded ... ah not provable allegations\nWhen in fact all we have to do is look around and see the kinds of things that have happened that we cannot change that we cannot control that will have long term huge consequences to our country I'm selling that ... that a a\nNuclear\nUh materials into to a Russian company of it we didn't sell them directly directly to Russia we permitted a Russian based corporation to buy a a a mining firm that had significant\nUranium deposits so that Russian company can can ah mine that product\nAnd ship it back to Russia without us ever having any control of any kind over\nWho does it or where it goes or how it is used\nAnd and that you know there are a few strategic items that we have in this country that somebody needs to look up and say wait a minute we're not going to let that happen this is a national security concern it should not happen but Hillary Clinton just gave him a free pass\nAnd they got whatever they want it by the way I think if I'm not mistaken\nBill Clinton got a five hundred thousand dollar speaking fee to a December of Russian\nOf dignitaries shortly before or shortly after that particular is a transaction occurred [noise] um you know that would a short help you're a long term a retirement\nPlanning program for somebody to give you a five hundred thousand dollar check that's pretty good for just speaking yeah\nFor you know speaking tour that that that's not too shabby\nSo have we uh you know one of the things that distresses me is have we reached the point where it that we no longer value those things that have substance and meaning and importance in in in our a day to day life\nAnd and uh I don't want to get to church you on anybody here [laughter]\nBut I Want to do one thing or the you know I I was sitting in a church meeting this past week\nAnd a one of the things that that the a lesson was uh talking about or some some messages that a guy named eyes is a ah\n[noise]\nIs
