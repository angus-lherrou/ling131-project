I'll back across the southeast into the end of the ocean waters and the devastation\nFrom the air when you can see what's going on down below is just incredible to ah to see it and it just some areas look like they're completely denuded of plant life after after what's happened\nLooks like some of those you may remember those old films that were taken where they would show with a nuclear blast

about that either a couple of other quick notes there's been a big earthquake well maybe not the biggest ever but near Anchorage, Alaska happen\nJust in the last oh within the hour and a initial report is it's a four point nine still a good sized quake is nowhere a big as big as the quite that are destroyed much of Anchorage what\nFifty four years ago uh that swept through their out an Easter weekend uh and and just completely devastated the city at the time but for point nine you would feel that if you happen to be anywhere near it also wanted to mention that Elizabeth Warren\nIf you've not yet heard claims they're taking a DNA test\nThe conversation she had with a left wing college professor who says oh indeed do you have some indigenous ancestry from what I've heard so far they didn't quite say how much and it might not be much at all to me also add\nThat I did one of those DNA tests a little over a year ago and I always knew from family history family\nNames that the bulk of my ancestry was Irish so we got back I got back the results of the test about you know six weeks after I took it\nAnd it it said yes indeed that and I wasn't surprised by this but it said\nThe largest bloc of my ancestry worse Irish says I suspect it but then it showed several other you know answers to resume their German was pretty high Scottish was high and then it says nine to ... percent of my and I don't even know how they get percentages out\nOf this but it's at Nineteen percent of your ancestry and Scandinavian well I knew nobody in my family\nWho came from any Scandinavian country nowhere along the line and then I\nHappen to be reading a few months afterward that a great many people that I was using a particular service they have multiple services that you can you can use and this was one of them I'll just say I sent my sample off to Provo and uh they did the testing there they sent it back\nSo I was reading up on this a few months after the test results came back and it set a great many people were confused because they were getting these high instances a Scandinavian ancestry\nI think one of the heck is that coming from so the story pointed out that these DNA testing gets are still not wholly accurate\nAnd some of them obviously still have some reporting problems about a year past suddenly one day I get an email from a company that did the original testing\nAnd that says well we've compared your DNA\nIs we get bigger and bigger samples coming in we can make some are using curb some of these uh ... it says actually you have no ... you have no Scandinavian ancestry\nBut you're Irish ancestry is a lot larger than we originally thought so they upped my Irish ancestry rise fourteen percentage points and eliminated all of the uh all of the Scandinavian ancestry\nSo when was the best of orange says I\nHave the other side to or I Am indeed a indigenous American\nWell we'll only a little bit more time to look into all of that because I couldn't tell you right now it's not a foolproof system where at thirty five it's eleven minutes away from ten o'clock they'll color you with you on a news radio Thirteen and kale I extra news radio
