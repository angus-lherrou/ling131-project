it comes to kids and a lot of people have questions about how they introduce solid foods and um how how should I go about that and I'm a couple of things is looking at how many teeth they have they're mostly full of gum\nUm you want to make sure whatever solid on you're getting on it as something that can kind of much between your fingers that they're able to chew it pretty easy on the other is that um you wanna make sure it could have had control for it\nIt is a breakfast with\nYeah so you you wanna invest in those pediatric size utensils I mean not only are they a little bit more fun for kids and sometimes can help encourage them to eat some of their more healthy foods that are out there um but it's going to help them kind of the you know how much they be eating\nAt a time um the other thing is kind of going into picky eaters um 'cause that's a pretty common thing and and it's just kind of part of\nPart a childhood they're going to go through some faces or there'll be picky um they did a big study on kids when they found how much they eat during the day can fluctuate as much as thirty percent much it's a pretty good amount [noise] um so overall as long as I'm as fluctuating 'em and they're not going through to a two week period where you feel like they're really not eat in a whole lot\nUm they're probably hitting a pretty normal amount of food and nutrition at that point\nBill so oh you know so for you about a recommendation of first use all the foods below the kids to pick what they walk for most\nYes though I'm given them maybe three healthy options to to choose from um [noise] and that way they can kind of work to explore new foods out and be able to kind of pick what they want 'em and if you find that they are kind of say they start to like um\nCarrots I'm trying to pair carrots with some of these other new vegetables that you're trying to introduce on the other thing that's a little bit on newer\nUm which is a big swing from what they used to say is talking about allergenic foods and introduce the nose so things like um peanuts which can be a common allergy for a lot of kids they used to say it introduced that later in life um they found that there's really not a huge benefit and waiting and it actually um [noise] might do better introducing it a little bit younger\nI'm In life and that might decrease the risk of developing an allergy to that when\nWe saw the books are those who are members could go on two fronts given celebration courses were too much from Robert supposed but most of the food that was served large we were good food you know to some squash\nAnd you'd have a choice to squash movies of potatoes and maybe some bits and more I can remember being honest with you know try all of those uh what else could I just simply didn't want anything to do with those love him to the\nWorld as a kid I'd look through there and look at the stuff into the cameras there's no other option\nYeah so I mean finding options that they like and try not to force 'em for speed things that they don't want to eat so they don't associate with kind of negative\nThings later in life is always a good thing too um because I I Know for some kids Thanksgiving it might be a dramatic day because all of a sudden they have all these foods that they don't normally eat and um parents are families trying to almost forced them to eat against their will and so I sometimes three than to kind of a negative holiday for a while\nFor young when I was little boy amount not dramatize ruined remember we prefer squash I'm a play by play we have a picture of a coach mode and you know whipping as an 'cause he's riding adopt a coach with a team of horses but I don't want to get the squash I'm article or said you all got one of those ... are\nYou talking about car ride and go get that if you don't eat just wash those running to me because I wouldn't be squash\nIs who we met at a good neutral word but still you know you don't really want to tell people represent physical punishment if you don't either particularly signed on your plate\nYeah and so that's a that's a big thing um for kids it's kind of giving them kind of positive idea about that healthy food choices and I'm not\nHaving them go you know grossed out vegetable I'm\nTrying to kind of encourage that and one thing kind of on the flip side of this um after one year

always just enough to the president then fast as bad\nI just I don't necessarily agree with that\nHe was a frequent guest on Hannity's program for years but then wrote a book and mentioned how he does he spent twenty pages talking about how much he dislikes Sean Hannity as I\nSaid hey you know thank you Sean Hannity helped make you a household name among conservatives\nIn the country and this is how you reward that\nBut then sadness thinking why you know high play this right and Donald Trump falters a comes twenty twenty four I Ben Sasse can be the big hero and I'm Sorry to say that I think

this way is a volume of\nMoney the government spends and he had used to be spending about double what it was bringing it and it's gotten a little bit better the tax cut had somewhat of an impact on generating revenue\nBut still we're only about three quarters of the way of balancing it and that's a long distance when you're talking a trillion dollars is not being funded or nearly a trillion dollars and don't expect things to get better anytime soon\nIn order to turn this around you're talking about trying\nTo stop the meta something massive\nHear others from the Washington Examiner little by little ... you know if you can't\nGet it all at once you got to start doing it incrementally this is something I Wish the president would actually go through with no matter what

that if they allow anyone\nTo pass through their country to enter the U.S illegally that America will cease all foreign aid payments to them he specifically mentioned those three countries later you gotta unclear if Mexico had received the same threat\nSo all of these\nCountries you know I don't know I I don't have a list in front of me but that was about two hundred countries around the world and my guess is a only those you know the only maybe a handful of the worst actors aren't getting any money from the U.S\nBut if they have a big earthquake in Iran which they had several years ago you know they got money from us we send earthquake really\nHow did they thank us death to America and we send money to Pakistan we send gobs of money to Pakistan how do they repay I said well they were hiding Osama bin Laden for a decade oh that's right\nWhy do we sent Pakistan gobs of money so they won't fight with India we sent India gobs of bunny so India won't fight Pakistan how does India repay us they just bought a bunch of uh weapons from the Russians\nAnd they're also of course taking all these other jobs away from Americans as an industrialized says there are that's how they repay us but by golly they don't fight the Pakistanis and the Pakistanis don't fight India so we're we essentially bribed them not to do that you bribed them the taxpayer of United States\nAbout Egypt and Israel which were at each other's throats when I was a kid fairly a fairly very common basis [noise] um\nWell okay Egypt and Israel we send each one of the biggest beneficiaries ever married\nGo to war with Israel and Israel is a big beneficiary of American aid so it doesn't go to war with Egypt\nSo again a more taxpayer funded bribery of these countries and then when you think about well you know if we if we don't send money to uh the Central American countries why they were like us and if they don't like us more other people will come here\nNot if we build a wall well a racist no oh it's not racist cannot afford it your bleeding\nMe dry you not understand what the American taxpayer is telling you in government\nWe can't stomach it any longer\nWell you know your Americans already have a a very easy compared to the rest of the world what are you doing you're telling me that I should\nLive like a third world peasant as well that's the message I'm getting from all of you I don't know that I Want to live like a a a third world peasants my parents and my grandparents and and for killing all of my forefathers they\nWork very hard to get us where we're at today why should we give it all up well if you don't uh they're not unlike us and other countries I don't care\n[noise] and that's the message that one Donald Trump the White House and you're still there are Republicans who will not win re election this year to the house of representatives because they still ignore that message\nThey still refuse Hillary Clinton when she was asked you about four days she's you know do all the benefits that we get from that\nRarely you mean like the huge deficits as the national\nDebt in excess of twenty million dollars is that the the benefit so I'm telling you right now the only\nReason is is being done is mainly hush money all over the world and the fact that we have bases large and small in most of those countries around the world at least some form of military presence so that's why we have to send a lot of these people hush money\nAt it and my argument long has this if we weren't involved in every other country it seems around the world we probably wouldn't be in such a pickle over this ... situation\nBecause nobody would be calling out our government and our government wouldn't be rattling the saber and threatening to pull money because we wouldn't be sending money there and the first place\nThere's an old argument and it was after the fall of uh Kuwait and the Japanese\nSaid but we're not going to take part in the liberation of Kuwait and people said well what kind of an ally are you and the Japanese just said well it doesn't really matter who's in charge they've all got to sell the oil or somebody\nNow it may sound cold hearted but it's true isn't it\nAre

L. A. X. the news radio Thirteen ten I'd a top that may not be the biggest jackpot in world history but I certainly believe it's the biggest in American history why are these jackpot\nSuddenly getting so big because they changed the game which you increase the difficulty of wedding but that may for bigger jackpots why did they do that well lotteries had been a feature of American Life going back to the American revolution\nBut only in the last forty to fifty years estate started getting back into lotteries and I believe there's going to be one or two states that don't do lotteries but most states now we're doing lotteries and then we\nForty four million dollars and all the TV stations rushed out here some pictures of people standing in line at a convenience store here's a picture of a lottery machine spending on some tickets this is Joe Smith just myth would like to win the lottery this is what Joe Smith do if he won the lottery or go to Las Vegas and that at all or\nA ... I might give some to my church Joe Smith as if he wins he's going to be very happy man and things here in town will ever be the same again\nAnd so that that's the type of\nStuff that what happened with all that but what they discovered over the years\nPeople get a lottery fatigue and how people can go out and buy tickets after ticket after ticket at the ticket and when you're not winning anything that let's be honest most people never do\nThat after a while they find other places to put their money I had a barber\nYou're anti barber shop I think he might have been running a second business out of there because he said to me one day we were right next door to an old country store where people would rush into by all of the lottery tickets and I was in the barber shop one day and he was saying that he said you know\nHe said I got to be honest with you said I Know a better way that people could get a return on on ... and I said west that he says that football I think he was running numbers out of his his barber shop in fact I had another friend who goes there to sports show with me for a time and he also went to the same barber\nShop but he had been at barbers supply salesman for many many years and he worked in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area where they had a healthy trade in mafia and he was telling me said what they would do is they would keep the betting slips between the towels\nAnd so that way and somebody came as and what's going on and here you could say we're cutting hair but nobody would generally think about\nLooking between towels to find the betting slips so the barber said to me though if if you're looking to throw away your money you'd be better off doing it on the football betting because you've got a better chance at least when something I suppose he was right now the jackpots wouldn't be eight hundred and fifty million dollars but they would you know he said that ... your\nOdds of winning some money would be better than ah than playing the lottery and then way back in like Nineteen Ninety three after he lost a race for president I Want to hear Ross Perot give a speech\nUh when I was in a small group at the theater and borough said\nHe said let me tell you about the lottery that tax on the power and and not long after that I talked\nTo a friend who was illegal book maker I'm not going to say it was a great friend but I talked to him and he told me so that's a tax on the stupid but I'm forty eight we've got a caller with this call to your next year on the air on magic value this morning I'm K.
