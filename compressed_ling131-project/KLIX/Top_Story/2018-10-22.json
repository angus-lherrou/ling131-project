money on it look [laughter] I have a budget\nAnd I try to keep to it but I don't feel I'm getting ahead and at some point you know ... yeah I Love streets paid with gold but we've got to say

D deters the Republicans are difficult for a Democrat ... here in this part of the country but they may be are you so how do you defer from\nI I ... variants I did cover for Steven for five weeks back in two thousand sixteen and at the time he said you know their swearing in this morning that makes you the representative you vote the way you um\nI think you need to follow and then there are a couple of times that I bought it is that I thought it that way and I said well [laughter] I wasn't raised my hand anyway he um\nI'm not a lightning rod and and I think everybody knows that Stevens a little a little more vocal\nIt reminds me of the guy uh that played a Perry White and the old Superman TV series\nA ... of course the jobs ... you know the description and he'd be blunt and you wouldn't he wouldn't sugarcoat anything that he'd be very straightforward in that sense you know you wouldn't have to say what are you thinking you know in advance right\nAh and I imagine that you're not necessarily that would be dancing around any issue either\nUm but it might not be at the same or what's going to miss the decibel level by not be the ...\nRight right and that you know that's just not how I handled thanks I I've handled the campaign different and um\nWe're two different people but obviously we have a lot of the same philosophical background or he wouldn't be married as long as we are and um so I I think that's how I I just I approach things a little different than Steven and um he's done a wonderful job and he's he's\nA had so many people you know that have just that have respected in and told him what a great job is done and so I can only hope that I could do is get a job\nThere has been a lot of discussion in the last few years legislatively about uh you know they're there because since you have so little presents from the other party\nThat the real opposition comes from within the Republican caucus are and you've got the liberty caucus group I have a number of different nicknames and it's grown somewhat over the years but it almost seemed to me last year during the session that a lot of the differences there might have been a few that were still\nThere but that on a lot of the major issues everybody we're still voting gather\n... do you see yourself maybe as being a bridge or with some of these people\nOr you can you can help sell you know I I Hope that my negotiation skills with other people in my ability to talk and and I use my people skills that that might\nBe the case and I and I do think that a lot of a lot of the division maybe maybe some of them realize there was an easier way to get things accomplished you know a\nThan than half one back and forth all the time\nBecause it does seem to have a few basic things I mean you know when it comes to property rights when it comes to gun rights when it comes to spending but there's generally a lot of agreement if it comes up about Cory article you issues come up or there's differences but I suppose that\nIt's going to happen in any legislative process I mean we see it at the national level where a a Jeff Flake or a Bob Corker didn't necessarily agree with the president after so many of these things do happen\nFrom time to time quite\nWell and they do they do happen and at that point I think they they work out it seemed like last year they worked out their differences oh better you know and because they are on that they are the same side\nAs you grab the accent I Believe we've got a caller looking to join us and er during the point out that number two zero eight seven three six zero three hundred to zero eight seven three six zero three hundred and color your on kale I X with Linda right heart in go ahead\n[noise] well I Know your husband and my wife worked with your husband at one point and a C I F was very interested in what you have to say I would just curious you know when you have the millennials who don't seem to research things like you\nLike you do and you say to yourself when you have Ocasio Cortez from New York City or Paula Jordan from Idaho and\nSo it's different environments but you see that that those who work cut out of the same clock I Would just curious you know if people do research and no proof they can't make a logical decision and it scares\nMe so I'm just curious about what you thought about those things I\nI well I agree with you I mean it scares me too and and it it kind of befuddles me sometime I Can't imagine how they can't see what I can see and how they don't read what I read and I've come to the conclusion\nThat some people never read the same things and you're right they they do need to get in and investigate I mean I didn't that is that's the gated Brad little and and Paul that Jordan and so why wouldn't they get in and look at their background\nUp their strengths and weaknesses and see which outweighs the other\nYou know this party was a split for a time during the primary season and some of the ... take a long time to heal at the you know and that was that the level and the governor's race uh but uh when I was talking to a bulletin a governor at the fair and a reference to the fact that probably unlike every other year for governor\nA there is a huge philosophical difference between these two candidates unlike maybe anything Idaho is ever seen before\nSo even though the Republicans still hold eighty five percent of all elective offices in Idaho we're starting to see some of these outside ideas that are really call them invasive species if you will coming in or\nWhat some of the candidates running as Democrats\n[noise] you're you're right yeah and and the big at the lieutenant governor racist is as big as a big race here too and they do tend to um come together at\nThe after the primary and um and work together and I'm sure that will happen um with with ours ... I'm not sure if I'm answering your question exactly right but but you're you're right there's a lot of philosophical differences between", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Top Story", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "22"}
