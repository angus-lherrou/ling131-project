Josh ... [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\nWhen they were\nIn\nThe show was\nHost use your about\nRecall a triple eight eight to five\nTo two Seventy is starting all this on Rochester, Minnesota posh definitely how are you\nAnd thanks for taking my call sure how can I help well my husband and I we are currently I'm doing a good step number two um but we also have an eight month old daughter and so we're not quite to the college saving yet\nWe do have grandparents that instead of buying a Christmas gets their birthday presents would like to put away for college savings and I'm just wondering what's the best way for them to go about that [noise] um\nWould go ahead and open the child and you say an educational setting\nThe hope that they want to put in this\nReally decided a but growing up I was giving savings bonds and they don't really want to do that I could I don't know if they're thinking like a hundred dollars or you know each birthday and H Christmas I'm not sure okay\nAll right well you can open some mutual funds ... two hundred and fifty dollars others five hundred no there was a thousand minimum to get them open okay you're going to open an educational savings account in a mutual fund an e as say\nIt requires because the child is a minor that someone be in charge of the account be the custodian that would be you\nOkay and and your mom and dad can or his mom and dad can add to the child's educational savings account the only limit is you cannot put a total between all of view of more than two thousand dollars a year into that account OK\nYou can and a five twenty nine but more than that but you know we're not talking about that being a problem we're looking at the minimum and you're just got to get some money scrape together to do a lump sum to start\nThe mutual fund you know so maybe two or three people put some money to get maybe you just put it in a savings account to get up to five hundred and then you open the essay\nThat is a lot of help things you\nCan just check in with your smart vest or pro and they can help you get that done well Lisa is with us in Austin, Texas Hi Lisa how are you\nI'm fine thank you I Am having I could pay sure I Am how can I don't\nI'm just starting your program and I'm I'm not sure how to do it when there is no money left she said at the end of the ... at the beginning of the month or any of them [laughter] and I was homeless for about a week and then had to live in a hotel\nYeah so our first of all I'd like to thank you for everything you're doing a since I started listening to actually have a few dollars truck together great\nUm my question is basically about time I read a voluntary retirement scheme that um is in Singapore\nSo I can put up to thirty five seven thirty five thousand seven hundred dollars a year and I would get tax relief on that but at the calendar year ... which translates to about four thousand dollars in taxes mhm now I Want to take half my emergency fund\nAnd put it into that account because I might not reached a thirty six thousand just cash flowing from my salary\nMhm one of the penalties\nFor withdrawing ... shoot I Do that one of the penalties for withdrawing I don't read for which\nAre yeah it's about fifty for ... percent on taxes are but I I really don't need the\nEntire emergency fund I currently have thirty thousand I'm a picky picky and fifty thousand and put into that I can rebuild my retirement my emergency fund in about three months\nIf you don't need it why would you rebuild it\n\nI mean I don't have to have all the thirty thousand I just built it because I feel very comfortable with having that is of course you're\nRight and what is your income a year\nAbout a hundred and sixty\nOkay so what is three to six months of expenses\nIt is about twenty three thousand okay ... that'd be three months or six months that will be fifth month\nOkay All right so you can be within the range of three to six months of expenses at Fifteen thousand and um if you want to use some of that money that's fine and if you want to build it back up to six months later that's fine but it doesn't sound like you need more than twenty five thousand ever in your emergency fund\n\nYes but I'm not a state of sending here I've also not a U.S citizen I'm I work here on my now ex patriot and I just feel more comfortable because if I Need to leave the country I have about sixty days to get all my affairs in order and leave\nMhm\nOkay so you're just going to keep a little extra will show went out and that's why I feel more happens if that at that event occurs a while you're down on cash because you funded this thing\n\nSo it's very unlikely um I just received a new role and at least for the next two years I'm probably very safe at my work life\nMhm okay well the thing is is here here's what's bothering me\nIs the proper amount to have in your emergency someone is thirty thousand dollars and the answer is no don't drain it down because this is not an emergency use emergency funds for emergencies period if the proper amount to have in your emergency fund\nWhich means you should end up there is Fifteen thousand twenty thousand then don't have more than that later so you decide what the proper\nIn an emergency fund is when all the smoke clears but don't tell me you're using your emergency fund to fund this and then you're going to put it back which tells me you don't agree you know you've got it\nI think is what you're saying and so the answer is no don't put the money and retirement don't use your emergency money to do that but if you're willing to reassess your emergency phone and say I've got this thing over funded I'm going to back it down in the twenty range than I might go ahead and do this deal a\nBecause we're not there but but if you think you need to keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies didn't keep thirty thousand dollars around ...\nAnd don't monkey with it as merge and she found this is is foundational before you move on to investing of any comment so you got to decide your definition that's what I was poking around on I'm trying to figure out what you really need slash want and it sounds like emotionally\nGiven the unusual situation that you're in you want to keep thirty grand around and so you should keep thirty grand around if that's it don't mess with that but if not if you're going to permanently lower it then use some of that money to do this then hey I'm just fine with that a\nCage is with us in Salt Lake City Hi cage our you\nHad said how's it going better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nHad thanks for taking my call today I'm\nI'm a college student I'm two semesters away from graduating with my bachelor's degree in finance um but the more that I go through school and the more that I listen to you and makes me want to I'm really make a living being a financial ... many years ago and still here today [noise]\nUm so I was just wondering I wanted to get your advice on whether you think that they'll possible or somebody like me to run the type of ... that that may be your advice on [noise] the basket and his model to maximize ... on the early going up starting\nOkay well the um\nYou know the based financial coaching where you pay someone pays you a fee just to sit down and do one on one coaching which we do some here and we go we we have a program where we sort of our people that do that that comes to our training to do that is it's difficult to make a living exclusively doing that\nUh because it's it's a very much uh the inventory is your hours in the day and you have to sell enough of your hours in the day for enough money to equal a good living and I it can be done but are coming straight out of school difficult to do I'm\nNot saying that can't be done but I'm just saying it's not it's not a slam dunk okay so I'm eighty thousand dollar your job your first two years out it's going to take you a while to build up the thing you could do is you could go into the financial services world like on the brokerage side and work with someone like\nOne of our smart Mr prose as an example and those guys are in the business gals are in the business of selling investments and there's nothing there's there's nothing that preempts you as a matter of fact that it's almost paramount that you do\nCoach people while you're selling them an investment so that they don't get into the wrong investment you're teaching them you're helping them make decisions but in the process of doing that then you know you're making a commission and there's nothing wrong with that it's like when you're selling so I'm On a home near coaching them and this house was gonna you know it's\nGoing to be pretty you know based on your income is is that really\nOut of your ranger coaching someone if you're a realtor and telling them that\nYou're in a censure financial coaching them and so but you get paid a commission when they buy a\nHouse and so uh you know this idea that some people have that everybody gets paid a commission has a conflict of interest and keeps them from doing the right thing by their clients is absolutely absurd there's plenty of people on strike commission with high\nLevels of integrity to do the right thing so you might explore that angle because truthfully you can make more doing that then you can just doing a\nBook billing by the hour and I'm not saying making more as a whole answer but you know as a as a young guy coming straight out of school as often\nProbably don't have to get a little bit of miles on your before people are going to trust you you know I could be I mean there's some people trust you and if you're really good you know you're no you're stuff than you'll you'll get business but ah\nJust saying it's it's a tough road to just do what we did back in the day and it's one of the reasons is not the only reason we quit doing that as our exclusively but we did you know we started doing events we start having\nOr we started doing other stuff to go with it\nUm because it's difficult to make a\nScale up when there's only so many hours in the day you can fill out an hourly rate open phones a triple

I basically work it out for like a twenty hour work week and I multiply that by the hourly rate so IT consulting so I you know I can have worked for three weeks in our own than I can be I have no work for you know months on end\nYeah but you're going to make three hundred K. that's pretty clear correct\nAll that that even if I get twenty or twenty hours a week okay got it on the earth alright\nBut is there some question as to whether or not that's going to be consistent is that a moderate goal or can a conservative goal or an aggressive goal the twenty hours a week ...\nThat that that's pretty moderate um 'cause I I've spoken with some of the other people that work in the position and um and they they say that that's about average um yeah OK yet but they have some months where they they get a paycheck and\nYeah but ... this is a no brainer because you're completely debt free you've already gone all the way through baby steps of and you have no wife and kids I mean you're in great shape to take this opportunity and here's the other thing you've probably planned for it you know what is your uh three to six months emergency fund look like how big is\nThat they think thousand\nYeah I mean juice out a little bit how long would it take you to get that up to thirty or fifty you know a ...\nWith like our position\nOr just in this new position because you're in such good because you're such good shape you you know just taking a new position you can stack up some money and take you know my point is is let's say you get into this new rule which you really want to take and I'm telling you to take it but let's say you're healing that the first three much live on way less\nYou already can anyway so the new job is actually going to allow you to maybe put six months away\nSo you got no risk at all 'cause you can jump back in the cyber security I think it's a no brainer I think you're over thinking it because it's not the forty hour week buddy you did all the hard work to get to the point where you can take a job like this\nOkay you got me yeah\nSo I Do you celebrate tonight\nMy goodness don't oversee this I mean half of half of the always is going to love to be or Cody that right now [laughter] I mean bloody\nThis is the kind of smart risk you know because you put yourself in a great financial situation to be able to go after this there's really hardly any risk at all um man and and here's the deal you're saying that\nYou all you have to do is get twenty hours a week and that would put your three hundred K. if you only do tend you're still going to be making about the same it's not even a little bit more of course you have to make them more so again go go go oh that is fun stuff AAA eight to five five two to five is as a career female on the day Randy show I'm can
