eight to five five two to five random starch this hour in Phoenix, Arizona Hi Brenda\nHow are you better than I deserve but a little confused oh how can I\nWell my wife and I were to for help uh-huh and we've got one and a half year old little boy and we want to own we want to prove college but before she goes to college it was more likely for our food\nI and I know that probably doesn't apply to the ah the college savings plans [noise] mhm\n[noise] we've got a chunk of money right now about seven thousand dollars that were willing to put somewhere but we're trying to decide whether we should put it down on a mortgage with one way or the other will be paid off before he goes yeah by a couple of good ah or she'll leave that to be something um\nTo to build up that the future mission and college fund\nGotcha okay and your debt free except your home correct in addition\nTo the seven thousand dollars do you have an emergency fund a rainy day fund up three to six months of expenses\nWhen do you how much is in that about the good\nOkay well you're out what we call baby step for five and six baby step ones with thousands saved too is that free but tiles three is a fully funded emergency fund\nBaby step for is putting Fifteen Percent of your household income into retirement which you should just start doing that as a part of your savings you're investing plan right now maybe used to have five kids college and beyond that six is pay extra on the house\nAs you can as fast as you can show what I Would do with this money is I Would ever market for school and mission trip\n'cause you guys are obviously LDS right we are you\nOK cool so what what I'm going to do is say out of the seven thousand I'm probably going to drop five thousand of it into a five twenty nine for my one and\nA half year old and do a good growth stock mutual fund that's also college has to be used for college take the other two thousand and just settled in a mutual fund and\nYour name no big deal just a regular mutual fund and your name and you just on the file when you drop the paperwork into a file right mission trip on the file\nBut it's just earmarked for that it's in your name your controlling the money\nAnd if everything goes as planned and he's going to do is to your mission trip and ... then that two thousand will grow into enough to help him do that the other five thousand you add to it periodically throughout his life so that there's enough in there for him to go to college when it comes back from mission trip\nWith us from Springfield, Missouri in order to you to watch them and\nWe just finished a few ah we're on babysat to and for the last five years we have been building our home paycheck to paycheck\nAnd um it's not a hundred percent completed yet we had to borrow money on it or to kind of get things rolling a little bit but um we got an offer to do a care taking position and the guy a guy with\nA four hundred dollars a month to take care of his vacation home I'm In the same town we live um [noise] do we tell our home or do we keep it and continue making payment on it\nIt's not completed well we're at a point it needs a paint and flooring\nAnd you're living in it no no um well we were living in a mobile home\nUm but then we got this offer to live in this house basically for free and he pays a live here and take care of\nOur doctor okay so that's the right so you've never lived in ... known okay somebody will jump to show them the condition which I Am yeah what you can't get financing on it right so you're going to take a weapon or\nWant to take money wise to finish it\nUm\nWhat never had a professional answer on that but probably about eight thousand ten thousand dollar yeah and what is your household income um well my husband he worked forty hours a week ... household income [laughter]\n\nProbably thirty seven thousand a year\nAnd judge for your husband's only one working well we have a business um that doesn't work it out and running and make money\nHis income is about twenty five and Calvin and the business makes about Fifteen thousand nearly okay [noise] and then\nDoing the care taking positions or will be made in about forty eight hundred cash but we get housing for free\nYeah I got up or until you get into if he decides he doesn't want you to take any more and then you don't have a ... for free anymore that's right so I mean you walk into more of our you\nPretty much a change my mind and then you you have a housing issue again right right so um you have any idea what the house you have shorter built would bring ...\nOh well we had a appraisal and if it were completed it would be about a hundred and sixty thousand more completed so\nWell we had a appraisal and if it were completed it would be about a hundred and sixty thousand is not completed so probably a hundred and fifty hundred and twenty five\nNo no not if it's not complete or they won't know um because ... it's a further discount than the cost it takes to complete it it's a lot further discount because basically the typical consumer cannot bothers house okay because they don't have any money\nAnd they're trying to get a mortgage and they can't get a mortgage on this house\nAnd so that limits your invent that limit your selling pool to investors and they're going to discount that a lot deeper than that if you get a hundred out of there should be flying I'm thinking so um [noise] how much will be borrowed against it so far\nUh [noise] the how the south we do thirty thousand that there are some property attached to it so altogether it a hundred thousand\nYou owe a hundred thousand against the house and the property yeah which would bring a hundred and sixty if it were fixed if he sold the property is well\nYes okay All right\nYeah I I Would look at trying to pick up the other ten thousand dollars in an additional loan and get this house finished and let's get it so as soon as possible\nAnd then just\nContinues having money and how we yeah\nYeah we all have you know I should have some equity in your pocket at that point I mean I'm not a ton which are going to get a little money out of it\nSo you know it it just hasn't worked out for you you realize that right yeah\nYou've got way too many hours in this house\nAnd and really didn't get much out of it went all the smoke clears here right you'll get a little bit but it's not\nIt is it's not worked out very good so you know you're going to have to reset that and then the second thing I'm going to tell you as you guys need to look at your income because your household income as you I'm Me very very low income and\nAh so I I Want to think about careers what can we do to get our income up long term and I want to think about some part time jobs in the meantime\nBut um yeah I Would get that house finished up\nSaving scratching and clawing painting and [noise] you know if you borrow three thousand bucks or something that's fine but let's let's try and get his soul as fast as possible now is the land is such that you can sell off a piece of the land without selling the house\nIn order to have the money to finish the house that's what I Would do first celebrated showing acre also corner use that money to finish the house then get the household and that way there's no more debt involved Olivia is with us in Lexington high Olivia how are you\nGoing to hire you better than I deserve what's up [noise] and I\nHad a question and I had an African amount of debt and and I'm wanting to pay that off the air that lake [noise]\nI'm not in our in our culture and induction and and that is going to therapy so [noise]\nAnd I ... ... budget and at a pet therapy at the end like we're not going to get aid and how kind of quick I I'm not really sure way to put it in the budget [noise] wow big of a priority like\nHow long you been clean and they're good for you well then what is it [noise] and actually addiction and\nHow can I alright well no I'm not going to put therapy on hold right now this is something you need you need some account sort of walk with you as you finish this life transformation in that\nWould you agree with that statement [laughter] now what I Would do is is number one it's not a permanent situation um the therapies not permanent it's not going to be there the rest of your life fifty years from now you're not gonna still be going to the therapist okay I Hope I'm\nLost art procedures not perfect but ah I saw some point you'll you'll pull back from that\nAnd the second thing will happen is is that as you continue to address your income and your outgo you're going to find ways to make more income and as you are more emotional healing you're going to feel more energized to make more income\nAnd so if this month you don't pay any extra on the debt ... therapy\nGood if next month the same thing happens okay but by this time next year we ought to be making more money right let's do something let's kick her life in gear and let's start to clean up the mess to but for today Seventy five whole day's you've been clean\n[noise] that's a great start right but it's not like you told me you've been clean for two years by the time you're going for two years we ought to be have different having a different conversation about the money would that make sense to you [noise] so let's get Hugh healed and then let's see oh your money and\nYou and it's not going to be suddenly\nLike a switch flips and you go OK I'm OK Now getting the money no it's not like all or nothing can be gradual it'll be incremental you'll feel better you you know when you're Ninety Days or years two months you ought to feel different than you feel right now and you ought to be able to do more and make more than just save more and more and you know you're you all have more\nFocus on the money 'cause you'll be more healed and have to spend less severe emotional energy just coming through this right now your game on just getting through this is that right [laughter] okay I Want you to finish turning the corner you turn the corner once you're finished turned the corner and let's let's gone\nYou make incremental progress move\nIncome and your increased income\nShop for today we want to\nYou need to be fair\n[noise]\n\n\nOften do you look at your bank account and wonder well\nYour money went how often or you're stressed about bill's afraid your paycheck well last the whole month you shouldn't have to live like that you shouldn't feel powerless\nOver your money and you don't have to you can take control of your money was the financial ... membership you learn to manage your daily finances pay off debts spin and save wisely and invest for your future if you follow the scores and do the stuff we teach\nUm and those are you know that those things but we really thought it was sort of a recovers opening up because we are starting to do things right and really what I see now is that he was preparing a throat was what was about to come which is that we have a we have three boys the youngest is ten months [noise]\nAnd uh our youngest has Down syndrome\nAnd so uh well right now we're actually coordinating the legacy journey class at our church and we're just getting to the part where we are working on oils and so because we have this special needs a issue we we can vulgar attorney and getting our wheels together good and through that conversation we ah you know\nI'm a we've been discussing a special needs ... world I'd have to play in planning for a baby future yeah your animal ...\nSure uh originally a kind of had that chopped up in my mind is that that special needs stress kind of function the same way that the other boys have a college fund in baby steps five\nI'm the kind that we would you know we'd be saving for all three of them but the one would have some some special condition who special rules because of course\nUh you know his his speeches have or it's too early to know what is it will fully what it needs a we've been blessed that he's\nIn healthy developing well you know there's this guy to limit for him just like anyone mhm um and we don't have to uh uh you know it's hard to really didn't know if he ever have any limitations [laughter]\nBut uh but now as we're getting into it and we haven't found anything quite yet but it will come down to the wire why things that I'm uncomfortable with is that you know if I start investigating money are fun to try I I lose control of that to the trustee that we've named and while while I trust the trustee and ugly to go with their wishes that makes me uncomfortable\nNo you don't you don't need a special needs trust unless\nBoth of your die right the special needs trust does not need to be funded part of your death okay so that\nIt it sounded from your wealth or your life insurance until you've got wealth\nOkay\nIt's not ... I wouldn't even have it formed accept upon both deaths both of you dying okay as long as I Want to have you with a live as long as one of us alive demanding\nThey have formed accept upon most deaths both of you dying okay as long as I Want to he was alive as long as one of us alive to manage your ass that's one of the things you're going to do is care for this child that flew out of those assets now they don't win the trust is needed is if both of you die\nIt gives the trustee me the the the the direction on\nHandle the assets and disperse them to take care of this child's needs and\nAnd what that needs to be is a a big hairy term life insurance policy that drug that is the beneficiary of it is that special needs trust or a portion of the policy you know thirty percent or twenty percent of\nThe policy and the beneficiary line goes to the special needs trust in the event that both of you die kind of a thing where the primary beneficiary is your wife okay\nBut then past that the secondary beneficiary is\nSome portion would go while you've got minor children into a family trust to take care of the minor children your oldest two until they get them through college the other portion would go\nInto the special needs trust to perpetually care for this other child throughout life not just through college and so it's a larger amount needed to do that and\nIs let's say we fast forward Twenty years and this child is Twenty years old and you've got a million and a half dollars and mutual funds\nOkay your other children are grown and gone are close Twenty years from now right that's the dream yet the dream that law yeah we're kicking them out so they're going [laughter]\nThat's the legacy baby [laughter] but it's out of that than what we've got is we've got you know some portion of my million and a half dollars and in my example is gonna be parked in the special needs trust in the event both you and your wife or to pass\nThe rest of it would go to your ... more traditional airs directly to her but you know we put a million dollars in a in the the youngest child special needs trust\nAt Twenty years old because he's got an e carrying us eighty dollars a year it'll produce ... that'll take care of him and maybe one of his brothers is the trustee\nBy ban you know\nWhat would you would you go ahead like we're doing right now would you form the trust of the legal age I'm ... now and we've been unfunded or would not let it would have to make it a clause in in the well why do I like I Would just\nMake it a clause in the world will be formed upon both of your deaths okay because you don't need it now you don't need to be filing tax returns for the next twenty five years on this thing you don't need a shorter than all the time you don't need to go all the legal expense to form the trust so let me give you another example okay\n... as I as a special conditional version of just taking care of minor children right then the differences that might be perpetual\nYou know my children grew up\nSome might need for a trust to cover my\nIn a live in a most of our deaths fire\nIt needs that expired\nNothing in this case is not going to be something you're going to need a trust\n\nAsked all the time about what people need to do to improve their families money situation\nAsked all the time about what people need to do to\nImprove their families

something at work it doesn't mess up your four one K. it doesn't mess up your Roth IRA you are controlling your destiny are not waiting on someone else\nThe people you work for it affects your life that's a big deal Johns in Pittsburgh hey Jon welcome today Ramsey show how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nI'm that's great I'm reason I'm calling is here's my question um my wife is sixty five I'm sixty two versions now into getting under the under snowball we have a ... or ... times saved up mhm [noise]\nAnd now we're looking for a new place to live the house was rent right now is just way too big for my wife and I both have bad ... bad backs them up and down the stairs opinion about all the time okay um my question is\nUm the rentals around this area now are skyrocketing because there's new cracker plant going in so people are coming in from out of state sucking all those up [laughter] [noise]\nBut I found a couple of houses that I could purchase and the and I got right now it's eight Seventy five a month or my payment for Trump to about six hundred and thirty dollars come up mhm [noise] um\nThe other part of it is [laughter]\nI when I retired from the post office I rolled Meyer a push savings plan into an IRA good that I can borrow enough for him right now with no penalty just be able to put protein percentile ... on the house so I wouldn't have to pay the PM Iowa's law\nAnd it's just like you know the American idol ... twenty percent no you're you're you're turning your two broke to buy a house hearing day okay you're in debt you get your borrowing against your retirement I mean you're straining every corner to pull this off okay I'm emphasize that you if you're moving from it\nThat you get your borrowing against your retirement I mean you're straining every corner to pull this off okay um and besides that you if you're moving from an eight Seventy five rental to six hundred dollar payment you're moving down in the house substantially\nSo we're going to move down and how substantially moved down to a different rental and let me tell you if the rental market is squeezed because of a plant that has come in the buying market is squeezed as well so what you're telling me is not logical you're using this as a rationalization to buy\nOut of order I if I were you when you call me and I ask what you should do I would rent something else move out of that rental moved to a cheaper rental that'd be fine\nAh for a short period of time that while you clean up your debt your debt free you build your emergency phoned up three to six months of expenses then you have a good down payment and you can do all of that in a few years if you're careful watch what you're doing and then make your purchased but when you buy a\nHouse and you're broke you're asking for trouble I mean a Murphy will move in your spare bedroom bringing his three cousins broke desperate and stupid owning a home when you're broke and be a financial curse rather than a blessing Steven as in Virginia Beach Hi Stephen how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nI Want to know what would be harder to do it right now I have a rock highway and my name and I know you can only put five thousand five hundred into a year yesterday hypothetically\nAt me and my wife only had that amount of mouth that amount of money five thousand five hundred to go toward the investing what it'd be smarter to put all of it into my IRA is\nOr should I open up a lot for my and my wife's name and then split five thousand five hundred and put two thousand seven hundred and fifty in each other and to watch it grow that way\nWhat's your household income a household income and fifty thousand okay Mm\nSo Fifteen Percent of that going in baby steps for into retirement\nIs more like a ten thousand no it would be more like Seventy five hundred okay um [noise]\nOkay so you wouldn't fully fund to but you could put some it it doesn't matter uh which one you do mathematically let's say you chose the exact same mutual fund and you put\nThree thousand in more than three thousand in another okay one in one Roth IRA and your name one with Ira and her name or are you put six thousand in the same mutual fund it's going to grow exactly the same\nSo it doesn't matter uh\nHe'll I even have like a thousand dollars I can I could open up one would have five hundred in my name and five I never heard the the guy that\nIt doesn't it doesn't have you any mathematical advantage whatsoever [noise]\nThe only advantage is just a relational in that if she feels like that you know you're fully funding mirrors and she's not get anything for retirement which is not true because if you ever got divorced or died or anything else she's going to get half that money even if it is and your name\nOkay that's how it is not true but sometimes people just you know like she just wants some and her name that's okay so you can do half and half if you want\nYou need to get to the point you're putting Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement that's baby step forward and that would be after you were out of debt and after you had your emergency fund them ... which may be why you don't have the money right now that's why we put baby step for after getting out of bed\nAfter having emergency if I went to the folks temporarily not to save for retirement until you clear your dad's that way you have the money to put a Fifteen Percent away\nTemporarily not to save for retirement until you clear your debts that way you have the money to put a Fifteen Percent away and a Fifteen Percent is more than one Roth IRA right for you guys but conceptually if you just even if you did Seventy five hundred thirty seven hundred fifty bucks each\nAh that'd be fine or if you did fifty five hundred and two thousand and the other name that's fine if they're in the same mutual fund you're going to get the exact same results whether you split it or not doesn't change a thing and James is with us in Fort Smith Arkansas Hi James how are you\nGood thank you for taking my call sure what's up my wife and I are planning to buy a home next year and have a little trouble deciding or or agreeing on the house would not want to get in a outlining towards getting a fixer upper\nThere'll be a cheaper house with a lower mortgage payment mhm and that gives me the opportunity to learn\nLearn how to do those ... myself mhm and she wants to move on ready house\nMhm occur and it'd be your first home\nThey are second all we've had a house in a while ago and then we moved and we've been rent printing for well over a year now you know\nThe other home that you had was at a fixer upper\nIt was not it was ...\n... ... and um so what is her fear\nIt's just more of we have to cook it you know and so it's kind of a hassle to pick up the house mhm that I didn't want anything major just you know there's some minor cosmetic type stuff\nBut I couldn't you do it for you moved in\nA financial aid I think we'd be able to afford rent and a mortgage\nNo I'm saying oh yeah okay I see what you're saying that you use the fixer upper would take a few months may be and you wouldn't have gotten\nThem to do I got you I'm a part time real estate agent so I live in a house for two years and then turn around and sell it I can sell it tax free\n... or any word got out of my adult show to act for anyway during their rules to show how structurally first residents will be living in two years' tax free\nGrows on that anyone for anybody [noise]\nOr wrong answer to this is just a question of what you guys want to endure\nWas topsy turvy because it's being renovated\nAnd yet the wages of valid\nHers you're not going to make as much money on it to your point and so\nIdentity theft has become an epidemic data breaches or being reported every day and hundreds of millions of people have had their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy the I've seen firsthand when people are stressed\nAnd freaked out when they become an identity theft victim and those who have credit or id monitoring plans to find out really quick how unprotected they are in so many ways that's why ... says Anders id theft plan to our benefit package was such a smart move the Sanders\nYeah but are you healthy yes I Would take it as no survivor getting more and by Fifteen year level term insurance to cover your wife if something happened to you it's a better deal yeah go ahead and get her take all the money you can get out\nOkay I'm currently have a four hundred thousand dollar term policy so\nOkay yeah then that she's probably All right without the survivor benefit because that's going to replace your forty thousand dollars that you wouldn't have the she wouldn't have if your dad okay that that that\nInvested ... percent will be forty grand so that that's pretty good you're in good shape and you can probably do it this way um I Can't jump up and down and say you're in great shape\n\nYour ear in a way above average shape I'm In good shape is is is way above normal because normal just sucks okay you got to weigh rather than most people but\nLiving on forty thousand dollars a year for the rest of your life\nFor the next forty years is going to get old and you don't have any income coming in other than that but there's your investments aren't big enough to create it and so\nWould you know how you can do it you can do it but I think you need to have in the back of your head you may be going back to work at some point\nI'm considered that I've thought about it for health insurance and um [noise] um and I've heard of\nThese mega share programs do you think\nThis is not driving this for me for what's driving it for me it's going to have much money\nRight\nAnd you got the pension but I understand you know think about what what are you know forty thousand dollars is going to buy in forty years when you are Ninety\nNothing yeah nothing\nThe problem was got here so it doesn't have a ...\nNinety nothing nothing\nSpecial problem I've got here so it doesn't have a good long term\nOf you guys just being a liberal uber to how you could live without a million dollars a mutual foreigners just becomes like a no brainer I said you're not like a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand maybe wish grape everything together episode of our properties or you know the farms got value but it's not producing any money so what\nWhat I'm thinking is an ... and again you can do whatever you want to I was talking it through with you OK I'm not saying your your your your\nOr your bad or something but that's my concern of what I'm hearing is and so I probably would think about what we always call an encore career and say what could you do that would be really fun\nThat you could make fifty grand or a hundred grand doing for the next five or six seven years\nAnd you didn't show what you're doing it shorter business you'd have fun doing it and make some bank and bank all of it and health insurance as part of the day I don't care if you're working for somebody else you start a business but just to show them what you're doing out and make your smile anymore so you need to get out of there\n[laughter] you picked up on her and so you know but I but I mean when you're you're young\nYou have a lot of a lot of ... to humanity\nLeft inside of you that you could get paid for ideas concepts things you could do I don't know what it is\nSomething that just I mean I I'm just a little bit older than you I'm fifty seven and do not plan I'll work on his work has only money ... money I got money coming in my ears but uh I'm working because I asked you ought to find something like that\nAnd then you can work in the hunt and fish and worked in hunt and fish environments you know but but you know I'd like to see your bank another five or six hundred grand and the next eight years and have fun doing it that's what I'm saying that's a that's a dollar challenge I've got\nIs I think there's God's got something to Saudi you there's something you can do more than ... a\nLot more by this law you've earned the right to do that and you should get out of the place you're getting outta but what's your encore career you take a bow\nAnd you come back out on the stage for the encore that's what the encore career as a lot of people in like a lot of money on that Richard show is not that money's everything but I I just want you to have a little more pad between you and Murphy\nThen this scenario gives me here\nAnd I think there's some\nMagic left inside of you know we all need still that's what I'm saying and it might be you take a year and you do nothing behind fresh and farm and then usually at the end of that year I'm going to go do ... and that's okay but but Ninety for for the next forty years oh you're a guitar official\n[laughter] you know it's so bottom fishing [laughter] so shoot so funds aren't makes you smile at

body wants to be around not because they want their money\nThan I deserve what's up [noise]\nWell the reason I'm calling today to talk about bankruptcy so my wife and I combined we have about a hundred and thirty four thousand dollar than that I'm\nA hundred thousand is student loans and the balance will be a credit card debt\nWe recently met with a financial adviser and they suggested that we filed for bankruptcy because it would take us a long time to pay off that that they said after that saying that it will be better for us to just start fresh and I just wanted a second opinion\nWhat is your household income sure\nA combined it's about eighty five\nOkay you have any car debt\n... mhm I'm no we don't our cars are paid off okay what are your car's worth um [noise] I Would say about twenty thousand combined\nOkay All right\nWell here's the facts that the quote unquote financial advisor didn't know um\nOr he wouldn't have given you such stupid but advise student loans are not bankrupt double\n\n... we did talk about that during the conversation they never go away but he was thinking entirely because of the amount of credit card that we have\nFive or ability and really have allied I'm at I'm at this more on the suggested your bankrupt with thirty four thousand dollars with a credit card debt with a household income of eighty five thousand\nThat's absurd dude that's what I was thinking that's absurd\n'cause the ... the hundred thousand dollars for a student loan doesn't change anything because it's going to be there regardless it doesn't it's not like reputable so we're dealing with you're going to file bankruptcy I'm thirty four thousand dollars making eighty five no you should pay it off in one year\nAnd a year yeah one year live on safety\nPaid off in one year take six extra jobs shell so much stuff you can't breeze no eating out no vacations and you're a hundred percent debt free in one year\nWhat are your cars worse\nYour car the work recording okay each um her a newer ... older so proud of ours are working on her her's is worth what about Thirteen thousand mine is about seven mhm\nOkay well um\nYou can do what you want to do I if I woke up in your shoes I have to tell you I've worked with families that were in dire straits over the years that were forced into bankruptcy you're not one of those\nYou choose to file bankruptcy cause you to get young lazy to address the situation let's even say yes\nNot one of those\nIf you choose to file bankruptcy just cause you to dad young lazy to address the situation let's even say you did it over two years\nIt's only Seventeen five a year and your debt free other than your student loan which I'm not talking about the student loans will be gone in one year I'm Talking about the credit card debt to be going in one year\nSo how fast in normal people that call the Dave Ramsey show that work out a plan pay off a hundred and thirty four thousand dollars making eighty five about four years probably\n... yeah\nThat's the normal routine for people around here that would be student loans and everything\nAnd uh you know I I Would not move down in car initially out of your wife's car into a into a six thousand dollar five thousand dollar car initially I might end up doing that as we go along we'll see how it goes what do you do for a living sir\nI'm operations manager\nI'm okay and what does she do for a living\nThrough the pastor okay All right\nCool um does she ever do any outside speaking for money\n\nOr you know she knows the letter but after about a\nGun or does she do speaking Miami says she speak on Sunday mornings\nYeah see that's very very difficult to\nOkay All right I mean I Wonder if if you know she might fell do some type of cell ends occasionally for somebody that was ill or on sabbatical or something in that congregation pay or a little bit or maybe she works and evangelists to outrage and they pay or a little bit first baking skills or maybe dot dot dot you do something I don't\nKnow I mean if you had ten Fifteen thousand dollars a year to this equation\nOf income and you guys tightened down your budget to nothing I mean nothing where you have no life because we're going to clean this mess up you know you can clean up the whole thing in four years maybe three\nBut four for sure uh any clerical student loans really really really fast as a part of that equation I'm Sorry though that credit card debt as a part of that equation really really fast but you got to cut them up you've got to quit using them and you've got to stop living the way you've been living goes there's not working agreed\nOn the staff does that make sense\nYeah for like\nYou know the Bible says that no discipline seems pleasant at the time but it yields a harvest of righteousness you guys make good money so I Know you're not stupid people\nYou're not dumb with Iran dump it has been doing some dumb things which makes you just like most of it was added a lot of
