found a class and they were you uh Dave Ramsey dot com or call AAA twenty two piece AAA two two seven three two to three\nOne of my favorite books on working with people changing behaviors is called boundaries by Dr Henry Cloud\nI read it many many years ago and since then and ran I had become really good friends I Love Henry\nI loved that book too\nAnd one of the things I grass from reading that book and other books there's ...\nThere is a difference between forgiveness and reconciliation\nThose of us that are wise and emotional maturity spiritual maturity and those of us that are Christians are called to forgive when you forgive you set yourself free\nFrom the bondage of the fence you're offended and when you forgive\nWhen you're a victim and you forgive you're not setting the victimize or free you're setting you yourself free you can\nForgive someone and not be reconciled to them in what he called a minute ago\nAnd was trying to figure out how should she reconnect with her brother in law she's having trouble reconnecting her brother in law after he had affairs and everything else and he supposedly come clean for the last two years\nHis wife has forgiven Hammond taken him back and been reconciled to him but\nNot the sister in law she didn't want to be around\nIt so here's the question at what point for someone's misdeeds new you forgive them and then at what point are you reconciled to them they're different\nGuy\nSomeone rapes you what a horrible grotesque violent\nUnbelievably violent crime I Can't imagine can't imagine going to say something like that but to not forgive them of initially as you begin to heal from your emotional scars\nNot set yourself free from that\nDifficult to do I'm not saying it's easy but when you when you do forgive them you set them free but you would not be reconciled ever\nTo someone who rapes you mean you wouldn't go on a date with them you know someone steals your wallet\nYou can forgive them but you're not gonna you know leave your wallet with them later your new wallet for them to watch over your money you wouldn't be reconciled with them probably ever in that situation\nWhere in the case of that young woman she was not personally wrong\nHer you know the guy's wife is who was wrong right and\nHer sister in law was wrong\nKnow how it worked in his brother in law but anyway as is\nLoving it I guess her husband's family is well understood it but anyway the the lady that though the wife is who was wrong to she forgave and was reconciled to the husband as he supposedly is putting his life I get it out of my ... but as I got it I don't know the guy\nYou don't know the guy well once you knew that you can always do it well you know people that I haven't done it can always do it you know any one of you listening is capable of adulterous affairs\n\nEveryone's capable of that and if you think you're not capable of it you're just about to have one I mean really that's just ridiculous so at what point do you forgive someone when they've done something wrong at a distance\nLike that\nI can forgive him and you know I Hope he's turned it around and I'm not going to sit around and ring my hands and be mad\nAt him and worry about him\nI Hope he's turned it around I Hope he doesn't hurt her again his wife I'm I can I can do that now at what point am I going to trust this guy again that's what reconciliation is at what point am I going to trust that his conversion his turnaround Israel see we run into this all the time when they're coaching because\nOne spouse lies to the other one about money what we call financial infidelity your husband your wife lied to you and ran up a bunch of credit cards and you didn't even know it it's hard to trust them again after\nThat\nMap you're going to stay married you're pretty well instantaneously gonna have to sit down and go okay I forgive you but I'm not necessarily going to be reconciled to you financially I'm a\nI'm going to watch over your shoulder on everything that's going on all we have a couple of come in and the guy is ... is a you know he he's a been found to be a gambling addict which happens like every week\n\nFootball betting is destroy yeah\nFamily's finance us on be leave a bull\nSo he comes in he discovered she discovered he's a abetting addict an online betting addict the gambling addict and now he's gotten treatment he's in gamblers anonymous and he's saying is pastor and he's seeing a counselor and he's doing everything he supposed to do does that mean she just turns over the checkbook to him and let them go run havoc\nAgain no no it's a matter of fact we recommend\nThat when someone's recovering from an addiction like that\nThat that may not have control and they don't have any access to money for a while until trust us rebuild overtime but ten years later ... should be rebuilt ten months later it shouldn't be better than it is now two years later I should be better than\nIt should per aggressively rebuild trust and so if ten years later you you're still or you know you have\nIt should per aggressively rebuild trust and so if ten years later you you're still or you know you have not bet on a football game again you've not lost any money gambling again or you trustworthy at that point yeah as much as anybody else's and so we're not going to treat you like\nYou have no ability to handle money the rest of your life but for the short term\nWe're taking all access to money away from you too you prove that you can have a little bit absolutely but then gradually trust is rebuilt and overtime is rebuilt if you cannot when someone has\n\nOn something like we're talking about here has ... has not when when someone has demonstrated over an extended period of time that they're not entering into the negative behavior\nAnd you can't forgive them and you can't begin to trust them in that area and then it starts to be on you and two years clean if the guy's clean from his double life adult for survivors or whatever he was doing on addiction whatever it was sound like it was all about\nTwo years is a long time you should be some level of trust rebuilt assuming it's all real now as there's indicators is not\nReal but they're still looks like he's sneaking around if he's still got behaviors that make everybody question whether there's a real then that's different but I'm assuming this guy straight and if he's straight for two years and you know starts to be your problem if you can't begin to trust at that point\nEspecially given that his wife already which she might just being a neighbor she might be\nShe might be co depend on that could be what's going on\nCould be\nThat he's cleaned up is alive and you're just suffered you can't forgive me that's the difference there's a difference in forgiveness and reconciliation they generally\nIn generally forgiveness should come faster than reconciliation\nPet a dog and it provides may\nI got to be reconciled with\nUs as the Ramsey [noise]\n\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt\nIf you're not executing it and no excuses dang dream that one\nPreacher out their way to go and live I'm preaching and a couple of weeks after ... on the

yeah I mean what are you got to say after that it's all about\nVery good to\nGo what was the hardest part so the hardest part for me to do was telling her kids know um you know our kids were in the age range that ten to sixteen and we were doing everything they I mean we had a good income I mean our kids were taken lessons for\nSports we had him doing clarinet lessons and flew lessons and fish and I sat down with our kids right after ... when we bought that home study kid and we told him when we said guys your mom and dad are screwed up\nAnd we made some really bad decisions and because of that\nYou're going to suffer more going to suffer and that's the only way we're going to get out of it and we got to make\nMake that decision and so we made the decision that you know you either got to take the pain of discipline or you've got to take the pain of regret and we had to pay a regret for so many years and we said we're done with that and we want the pain that discipline\nAnd so we had to tell her kids um had to tell my son were not doing basketball training anymore so we've got a hoop out in the backyard lets me and you go back here and all of them will train together

I ... I don't I don't remember what we signed up for like I said it was it says well over a year ago or ... and putting in you know paying their premiums yeah they're pretty am I supposed to have you know like a ten\nYears you know have articles are are you in L. L. C. or are you a general partnership weren't escort escort okay do you have articles of incorporation that defined what happens in the event of death\nUm I'm not sure if I could find out what happened to me than a cat and now I'm not I don't know you need to have a what's called a by cell agreement okay and it's funded by inexpensive term\nLife insurance term okay have you with a turban you certainly there's a whole lifestyle has it ever does whole life is the only one that has a retirement benefit later okay I got that means that as a savings element and that means it's twenty times more expensive for the same amount of insurance\nRight now you got me he's like oh when you're you know when you're sixty this is what are the cash for the cash value will be yeah\nYeah and you it's like the neck number at the end and I'm like okay so here's the thing if you spend want access to the twenty acts to accomplish our business goal of being able to buy out the widow of the one that there's a lot that died right uh that's the business go and you spend one acts of doing that\nYou use the other Nineteen next to invest and you'll have a whole lot more money than you would have had inside this piece of crap policy that he bought and sold you okay that's\nThe problem whole life insurance has a horrible right of return it's loaded with fees\nAnd uh if you die they do not pay you the money that's in savings that you pay the extra create they only pay the face value and so the ... the money that you're playing time for the money that you're paying extra for to create savings is all being done poorly that's the problem here\nI Gotcha okay that makes sense yeah I'm In I'm In New York so I you know six months I've kinda been grinding Mickey at my watch our own baby step to cool I'm now going to want to cash out that whatever it is in the whole like yeah yeah and then you go in terms of all things\nOr you could turn policy in place first case she died while the ball right an issue but once it's in place and you cancel the garbage policy but again you're going to save so much money doing this and you can accomplish the goal and that it's going to help clean up your ass Corp corporate documents by having your attorney and it's not it's a one page thing\nBut it's yeah and then you need to cover that with all the four of you sit down their spouses and go okay if he dies\nI'm going to be getting money to buy you out sister in law okay you're going to be out of the business that's our thing and um and if I die my wife's going to be out of business 'cause my brother's going to buy her out and he's gonna have the money to do that from life insurance\nFrom a guy from this new term policy\nAnd it is stated that that money\nWas that specific bought for the ... yeah\nYeah ... that's the by cell agreement very standard stuff in a situation like you're in\nOkay awesome I really appreciate your up\nThank you brother thanks for calling in Albany owns a AAA eight to five five two to five\nYou jump in we'll talk about your life and your money [noise] John is on Facebook what do you think of group life insurance this is a life insurance today um group life insurance means that you're buying\nLife insurance through your company that's what you would have to I mean by that same type of group life insurance is because you can't buy life insurance on ... you buy a lot of insurance on individuals you could be it can be furnished to you through your company as a benefit and or you could buy it as a part of your group health insurance\nBenefits package or life insurance benefits package um\nI [noise] it's okay to buy that\nIt's usually if you are buying it that much for your employers furnishing it frees free shut\nUp okay but if you're paying for it it's usually not that much cheaper it's maybe a tiny bit cheaper the big problem is it's not portable and what that means in insurance world is you leave the company and you can't take it with you so let's say you had a cancer scare or\nHeart attack and now you're not sure\nYou get diabetes now you're not sure and you leave that company you got in a life insurance she can't take this with you says okay\nThe company but I wouldn't have it all their lives is that I Ramsey show [noise]\nAll big time extraordinary things start from ordinary things that may start from changing the ordinary

getting out of data are\nBut like I said one of the change in mindset um you know I uh\nI always wanted to drive a newer car I never bought a brand new car but I had that mindset that you're always going to have a car payment and so you know you pay for a car for five or six years and they would against it then you should we get another payment and uh so we have not had a car payment for four

deserve what's up in your world\nSo recently this week uh found out that uh my wife had kinda racked up about forty can a credit card debt behind the scenes are so kind of those slap to the face you know I kind of found out this week was last week in\nSub pretty pretty tough to swallow\n... so she was hiding it from you\nYeah um I and I you know I Can't just blame her I mean I I got to take some credit because I never\nOf went and looked and kind of a paid any attention and this is the second time so about two and a half years ago having the same thing and I kind of laid out a budget and then kind of slipped away from that budget and I think it was it just kind of roll back into it I assumed everything was going okay but it just kind of wasn't\nOkay so you gave her a all of the responsibility of handling the money and you weren't involved in the money\nA hundred percent okay yeah yeah it is your fault you know yeah\nUm and it's our fault or but basically she was out of control didn't know what to do and I just bought her way into a mess and neither one of you had your head and the game\nCorrect okay so uh\nAre you already to stop the cycle show you how\nYeah a hundred percent and as a this this week and so there's a lot more\nTo the the problem with that kind of a solution but a on Wednesday this week I got a I've received at twenty nine thousand dollar inheritance check that I haven't put in the bank because I wanted to wait till I\nSpoke with you to see how I or go attack us I don't want to I don't want to do any other dumb things I Want to continue I Want to start from scratch off the debt but I got to do the right way\nOkay let me ask you this then I'm it sounds like you're taking ownership for having kind of a dump this on your wife an abandoned her a issue taking ownership for the shame the fact she was ashamed in so she hid this from you because she didn't know what to do but she knew she was screwing it up\nYeah we we had a couple conversations or a ... for a church and we have some a marriage and Richmond stuff and we got to look into doing some more of that uh\nBed Snickers maker right\nOr it can be big Tom credit card debt it can be one of you is running a business and is rolling up debt down at the business are not telling your spouse because you're trying to live your dream is turning into a nightmare I mean there's got to clarify this for you\nThere is no positive effect to your marriage when you are a lot bigger spouse\n[laughter]\nIs that helpful you don't already know that they do [laughter] well I'm trying to avoid it by ear to ear all you're doing the cooking it up it's going to be a bigger fight once it cooks up [laughter] she was one of a smaller by quickly\nSo ears are doing if you're afraid to discuss with your spouse a purchase or a financial issue that you want to discuss that is not a financial problem that's relationship problem\n\nOf money and my multi millionaires times though\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we get our Oprah parents and it was three different families on Oprah and I was supposed to advise them\nIn their trouble on Oprah and the very first family of course I knew what I was getting into and the families knew what they were getting into a sort of and um the very first couple I'm sitting up there are getting an argument with Oprah\nWhy would I Do that\nBecause Oprah was wrong [laughter] is what happened so here's the deal the wife had run up like Seventy thousand dollars worth of debt and her husband had no idea and uh\nI had told the producers I said was partially his fault because he's not involved in his wife's life enough he's not loving his wife enough to even know what's going on in her life enough that she can run up Seventy eight thousand dollars\nIf unless she's just like a psychopath and her level of deception this guy hadn't got he he doesn't know what's going on under his own roof is freaking clueless and his relationship and so Oprah's reading the script and she's like and if you say that it's partially his fault but he owes or an apology I don't think I agree\nThat and I said well you would be wrong he does or an apology cause he hasn't been walking with his wife to the point she runs up Seventy eight thousand or with a bat and he don't even know what the flips going on under his own roof and she's like well he delegated to her I said oh this is not a business you don't delegate stuff to your spouse\nAnd just dump it on them and even if you're delegated in business you would always inspect what you expect you would never just walk away and hope it happened\nYou wouldn't know what's going on in business and besides that this is marriage is not a joint venture God did not say and now you are a joint venture he said now you are one and these two are not one they're not on the same page and so you know the poor lady sitting there crying because she so ashamed and overwhelmed\nAnd the guys angry 'cause he's finding that he got eighty grand and that that he didn't know he hadn't a man they looked like a Jerry Springer Springer episode or something and um you know and I'm a I'm Stan\nI'm making him apologized to her for not being a good husband because of your wife can run up your husband can run up a hundred thousand dollars in debt and you have no idea what's going on you have chosen to not be involved in your own spouse's life or their psychopathic liar\nOne or two but most of the time it's you just did you just dumping on them and then and then you Cripe 'cause they didn't do it right after you dumped it on them and walked away and close your eyes\nAnd we'll go ... well yeah you thought but you didn't even care enough to get involved\nIn what was going on and so Oprah's all upset with Dave because Oprah was wrong [laughter] didn't work out well the rest of the show when we got through it [laughter] so here's the rule of thumb then\nWe see couples who have a good marriage I've been married ten years or Fifteen Years or Twenty years sit down\nAnd start doing a basic budget together we're every dollar has an assignment every dollar has a mission every dollar as a name before the month begins on paper on purpose every month before the month against a unique budget it takes about\nTen minutes once you've been doing it a while but it takes about three months of doing it to get really on the same page and get a rhythm going\nWe see couples that agree on their spending before the month begins on paper on purpose increase their level of communication\nTenfold increase their level of cooperation\nBut on purpose increase their level of communication\nTenfold increase their level of cooperation\nTenfold and\nIncrease their empathy for each other for the stress the other one's been carrying them they didn't even realize\nThey began to agree on their goals and their productivity with their money goes through the roof you'll feel like you've got to raise when you learn to do this together\nOn permission before the ... of every dollar name that's why we named the world's best budgeting software\nLess fat for your phone every dollar of every dollar\nDid you know there are more than two million real estate agents in this country two million when all you want to do is buy or sell a house you don't have time to sift through ads on line\nOr email twenty different people to find a few agents you want to interview our real estate EL peas have years of experience and are the top agents and their markets in fact
