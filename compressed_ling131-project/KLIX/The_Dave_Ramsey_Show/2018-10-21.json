before we go to the phones a Bob let me ask you the last three years well projecting into next year\nThe Trump Administration is earmarked proximate lead to point to a to point three billion dollars in increased defense spending we had seven hundred and sixty billion a couple of years ago seven hundred and five I think last year in another seven hundred coming up this year\nUh is is that enough I mean a lot of that obviously is going to salaries and so forth but is it enough\nYou know half of it you're right does go to salaries and that's why people often say well gosh you know [noise]\nYou know how can the Russians and the Chinese speech such an adversary and competitive with us while they hide most of what they're spending on their own national security you know the answer is uh we'll see\nUm the concern is here this past week the president came and said we're going to all parts of the U.S government must cut five percent well we went through this quest ration period in which had just crippled our readiness our ability to go out and trained to be ready to fight\nTo replace you know with your new aircraft for these antiques that we're trying to fly around the world the same thing was ships\nYou know it's incredibly expensive\nTo have an armed forces and you know it reminded me of something that Ronald Reagan said you know this was obviously a few years ago and basically says that if you want to be free\nTo Ronald Reagan said you know and this was you know obviously a few years ago and basically says that\nIf you want to be free you have to be willing basically to to pay the price and the price in this case is to have a modern armed forces nobody's going to seek to contest well today we're being contested a seriously on all fronts by\nA both China and Russia especially combined as they're forming a new one alliance\nAnd so if we don't sustain as you know the chiefs of staff and the and the chairman of the joint chiefs General Joe Dunford if we don't sustain the investment in long term capabilities uh then we're going to fall behind were already falling behind in terms of hyper sonics\nIn artificial intelligence or even in investment in our our blue water navy uh uh the last couple of years have been great it's only putting it on our rights glide path if we can sustain it\nLet's say a say hello to the west of the Rockies in Las Vegas Skinny Me good morning Steve welcome to coast to coast am\nThank you very much a Robert you were talking about the uh Chinese tapping our electronics for information well what I'm really concerned about is what if the Chinese have programmed to an end date into all of these electronic chips\nSo that everything shuts down at the same time some time in the future you know it's it sounds a little paranoid but I think it's very feasible and that's really a something major that could happen\nQuick question Steve is that possible Bob\n[noise] well I'm not an electronics are no expert however I Do understand the question and I share that concern\nA and that's something that I think that uh Jim Mattis our\nDefense secretary a is concerned about that things like that could undermine the complexity of our systems and if we get a programmable and reversible inundated electronics aboard our satellites or missiles are aircraft\nOr ships and it's and so forth and we could find that this could be catastrophic so\nI I think there's plenty of caution today a there's a wakeup call across a certainly the U.S military and I think our allies are are joining that understanding that uh this is a very new world that we're facing\nAnd we have to be very careful of of the type of equipment that we do embrace and so this is I don't think it's out of the possibility\nIt reminds me of um winter I'm the U.S spy plane that held in ... was held in China for some time\nUh I think it was maybe a near collision involved and and I'm I'm just wondering if that made it that might be what we're talking about here perhaps it was ... it was ... it landed there because of being hacked into somehow\nKnow well you know that's the sort of thing that we are very concerned about a cyber the battleground has a you know cyber as a woman before that I point out on the lines of evil and go into great detail is two and not only the threat\nOf taking down our own infrastructure a hacking into our elections and doing all sorts of things that uh we hear about every day and this is an existential threat to us and in fact when you look at the president's strategy and he says that there's a there's a possibility that we would respond\nThe sun and in fact when you look at the president's strategy and he says that there's a there's a possibility that we would respond to\nA cyber attack a with a nuclear weapon that's how serious it is today and yet you know there's so much we don't know\nSo you know could somewhat take on an aircraft could take down a satellite takedown of Los Angeles I think all that is possible or if we don't put fire walls and the capabilities to prevent this in place\nWildcard line Don is in Kent, Ohio Don good evening good morning welcome to coast\nBrother Robert happy Sabbath a and lieutenant colonel I I really appreciate your service your patriotism and your wisdom during the meanings that you have do they ever consider the Bible prophecy of Daniel eight where America will attack Iran and destroy it\n[noise]\nYou'd have to remind me of ... and Daniel eight where you're looking at dawn I'm you know I I understand perhaps where you're coming from a [noise] you know I I don't know that ah\nThat's something that we would do unless we perceive that the threat was\nA against you know our key allies and against our interest in those sided it claims that you know the he go from the west will come upon the whole face of the earth of all not touch the ground\nAnd it'll destroy the ram that has the two horns and said the the latter horn is the bigger horn that comes up less than the first one would be Iraq that's already been conquered but the last time that comes up will be destroyed and claimed that no one will help\nIt says that you know a a nation that comes from the west will not touch the ground which means it's going to be unable or an air force\nAttack or Iran is you know a huge country and that and um but it's also states that no one will come to her aid or and I find that kind of interesting since it has you know alliances with were actually North Korea China and uh uh Russia\nAh so you know it's a and this is a dual application prophecy also uh I Know Alexander the great a conquered but he did not use\nOr anything but an infantry a probably a column a hundred and some yards wide they're not covered the whole earth as being a law explained in you know this prophecy so\nAh and actually it also mentions that he goes I'm from the west will have her or has the we have an eagle and those wings will be plugged in to stand up as a man so I didn't know if the joint chiefs are\nConsidered any of those biblical prophecy saying there are a summation of this whole incident over their\nGreat question John Bob Let's say you\nI I understand you know we're done it's coming from the eagles certainly you know we like to think of as the United states and its\nIts use elsewhere even in revelation or the possibility of interpreting and like that you know I I tend to\nYou know of shy away from a eases Jesus and and going more in the direction of extra Jesus in terms of you know what's the context of that particular scripture [noise] I have not studied Daniel aid to the degree that Don or would\nYou know benefit from an analysis of that so I really can't answer the question though I\nWould say that yeah it's not my experience that our chiefs of the armed forces are terribly a biblical illiterate and therefore are in tune with a Bible prophecy I'm not that they shouldn't be but I just don't get the sense that they are and certainly the material\nIn tune with a Bible prophecy I'm not that they shouldn't be but I just don't get the sense that they are and certainly the material I read

expensive\nTo have an armed forces and you know it reminded me of something that Ronald Reagan said you know this was obviously a few years ago and basically says that\nIf you want to be free you have to be willing basically to to pay the price and the price in this case is to have a moderate armed forces nobody's going to see it\nThey're being contested a seriously on all fronts by a both China and Russia especially combined a fear forming a new one alliance\nAnd so if we don't sustain as you know the chiefs of staff and the and the chairman of the joint chiefs General Joe Dunford if we don't sustain the investment in long term capabilities\nUh then we're going to fall behind were already falling behind in terms of hyper sonics\nIn artificial intelligence or even in investment in our our blue water navy uh uh the last couple of years have been great it's only putting it on our rights glide path if we can sustain it\nLet's say a say hello to the west of the Rockies in Las Vegas scheming good morning Steve welcome to coast to coast am\nThank you very much a Robert you were talking about the uh Chinese tapping our electronics for information what I'm really concerned about is what if the Chinese have programmed to an end date into all of these electronic chips\nSo that everything shuts down at the same time some time in the future you know it's it sounds a little paranoid but I think it's very feasible and that's really a something major that could happen\nQuick question Steve is that possible Bob\n[noise] well I'm not an electronics are no expert however I Do understand the question and I share that concern a and that's something that I think that uh Jim Mattis our defense secretary a is concerned about that\nThings like that could undermine the complexity of our systems and if we\nGet a programmable and reversible inundated electronics aboard our satellites or missiles or aircraft\nAre ships and it's and so forth and we could find that this could be catastrophic so\nYou know I I think there's plenty of caution today a there's a wakeup call across or certainly the U.S military and I think our allies are are joining that understanding that uh this is a very new world that we're facing\nAnd we have to be very careful of of the type of equipment that we do embrace and so this is I don't think it's out of the possibility\nIt reminds me of um winter I'm to the U.S spy plane that held in ... was held in China for some time\nUh I think it was maybe a near collision involved in and I'm I'm just wondering if that made it that might be what we're talking about here perhaps it was ... it was ... it landed there because of being hacked into somehow\nKnow well you know that's the sort of thing that we are very concerned about a cyber the battleground of you know cyber is one of the four than I point out an alliance of evil and go into great detail is two and not only the threat\nOf taking down our own infrastructure\nA hacking into our elections and doing all sorts of things that uh we hear about every day and this is an existential threat to us and in fact when you look at the president's strategy and he says that there's a there's a possibility that we would respond to\nA cyber attack a with a nuclear weapon that's how serious it is today a and yet you know there's so much we don't know so you know could somewhat take on an aircraft could take down a satellite takedown of Los Angeles I think all that is possible\nSomewhat take on an aircraft could take down a satellite takedown of Los Angeles I think all that is possible or if we don't put fire walls and the capabilities to prevent this in place\nWildcard line Don is in Kent, Ohio Don good evening good morning welcome to coast\nBrother Robert happy Sabbath a and lieutenant colonel I I really appreciate your service your patriotism and your wisdom during the meanings that you have do they ever consider the Bible prophecy of Daniel eight where America will attack Iran and destroy it\n[noise]\nYou'd have to remind me of ... and Daniel late where you're looking at dawn I'm you know I I understand perhaps where you're coming from a [noise] you know I I don't know that ah\nThat's something that we would do unless we perceive that the threat was\nA against you know our key allies and against our interest in those sided claims that you know the he go from the west will come upon the whole face of the earth and will not touch the ground\nAnd it'll to destroy the ram that has the two wars that said the the ladder horn is the bigger horn that comes up less than the first one would be Iraq that's already been conquered but the last one that comes up will be destroyed and claimed that no one will help\nIt says that you know a a nation that comes from the west will not touched around which means it's going to be unable or an air force\nAttack or Iran is you know a huge country and that and uh but it's also states that no one will come to her aid or and I find that kind of interesting since it has you know alliances with a rational North Korea China and uh uh Russia\nAh so you know it's a and this is a dual application prophecy also uh I Know Alexander the great a conquered but he did not use\nOr anything but an infantry a probably a column a hundred and some yards wide they're not covered the whole earth as you know a explained and you know this prophecy so\nAh and actually it also mentions that he goes I'm from the west will have her or has the wing husband eagle and those wings will be plugged in I have to stand up as a man so uh I didn't know if the joint chiefs are\nConsidered any of those biblical prophecy saying there are a summation of this whole incident over their\nGreat question John Bob Let's say you know\nI I understand you know we're done it's coming from the eagles certainly you know we like to think of as the United states and its\nIts use elsewhere even in revelation or the possibility of interpreting and like that you know I I tend to\nYou know of shy away from a eases cheeses and and going more in the direction of extra Jesus in terms of you know what's the context of that particular scripture [noise] I have not studied Daniel aid to the degree that Don or would\nYou know benefit from an analysis of that so I I really can't answer the question though I Would say that yeah it's not my experience that our chiefs of the armed forces are terribly a biblical illiterate and therefore are in tune with a Bible prophecy\nI'm not that they shouldn't be but I just don't get the sense that they are and certainly the material I read doesn't suggest that they have\nThat Susan is on the wild card lining she's in Springfield, Massachusetts Susan good morning welcome to cause\nA problem where I live on the Internet radio show and picking up the different topic\nAction involving in your lab and other governments and you never talk about it electric something else I'm at I'm just wondering are there to radio shows\nI'm not sure what station you're listening to Susan in what you're hearing but this is coast to coast and for the last well nearly two hours we've been talking with
