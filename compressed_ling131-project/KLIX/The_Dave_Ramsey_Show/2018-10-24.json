[noise]\n[noise]\nRamsey solutions Dave Ramsey that is um casual skiing and love played all on which has taken the place of BMW as the status symbol choice on Dave Ramsey or has thanks for joining us America open phones\nAAA eight to five\nTwo to five that's AAA eight to five five\nBut two to five\nBenjamin is with us in Wichita, Kansas Hi Benjamin how are you\nI'm doing well thank you for taking my call they sure what's up [noise] well I have a question for you I'm I'm now considered unanswerable and my term life insurance will expire next year [noise] um and are you there are some that are considered uninsured rubble\nSo one of my questions is what should we do a better term life insurance and in my case\nI already have accidental deaths insurance\nHi my question is what should we do instead of term life insurance and in my case I already have accidental death insurance in place should I go ahead and canceled or keep it since I'm now can't get insurance\nHow old are you [noise] forty three why are you not in trouble\n[noise] history of diabetes I'm no longer diabetic but I I just got 'em that diagnosis removed but I've had that in the past five years of my history\nOkay have you checked with Zander insurance and see what they can Roger\n[noise] where in the process of having them do that kind of aid to double check\nOkay on dry up or something yeah because you know every day that goes by you're going to be more and more trouble in your situation so that's great news as ... hopefully as a short lived a issue\nOkay because in other words I think I think you're gonna be able to get insurance I just don't know exactly when or what is going to cost that's the other thing you've got to look at it or it could be unreasonable but\nI'm diabetes is a real tough diagnosis for life insurance really tough so\nUm anyway the answer your question overall is if someone's uninsured a boy yes you would keep accidental death at forty something years old you know the probability is accidental there would be your cause a\nExcept that you've had the diabetes issue um but otherwise I mean you statistically that'd be the cause we don't recommend accidental death as you know but it's better than having no insurance right so yeah I Would keep it and it's not that expensive because it's kind of gimmick insurance is what it is a definitely would keep any term\nOr any whole life or anything that's in place as long as you can keep it don't okay you know to the very last moment and if you're a term is expiring see if they have you checked to see if they have a renewal and non medical renewal\nNo I have not I didn't know about those sometimes they do ah sometimes it's very very expensive uh but again you might be worth it or if you've got a non medical renewal it may just jump way up like triple or something what you're paying now kind of thing um so would you have like a ten or twenty or tournaments run out\nFor like two five\nTwo to five\nChelsea is in Los Angeles how Chelsea how are you\nI'm doing good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up in your world\nI had a question for you in regards to um\nHourly paid versus salary my my husband has traditionally get tricked condition where they're going to be giving him a pay raise but with that pay raise their I'm saying that he also has that they're going to be transitioning him into salary pay she usually works between five and twenty hours of overtime each week\nSo I wanted to make sure that when he they haven't given him an optimal offered yet but when they do want it to make sure that how would you how would you recommend to calculate whether\nThe the salary rate is comparable with for example the hours that he was working before and the pay that he would get what overtime\nWhich sounds like it would be simple you've been working Fifteen to twenty hours a week last year extra and you've been paid for that in overtime correct correct answer what was his income last year including the overtime\nWith about forty thousand\nAnd how will that compared to the salary\nThat the guy that we don't know yet\nConservatives salary at the salary is fifty that's arranged if the salary is forty five and the same number of hours or expect to be work it's effectively a pay cut\nRight\nYes and that makes sense it's like\nYeah like as we were I was kind of worried because it was just more of us were in baby number two mhm um I Know that he has the potential to work more hours so because of that I was kind of rare\nBut everybody in the ... time with the question is not just more hours the question is is this a good deal for him apples to apples not a ... and ... and has he got the chance to move up in the company because he moved to salary\nYes he's going to be moving to management because it shows\nNo but I mean further up later oh okay but let's say they offer him fifty five as a salary or sixty is a salary\nWhile we'd be dancing wouldn't we\nYeah okay that 'cause that's like that's like getting paid a lot more and I'm working the same number of hours you know it's like it's almost like he picked up more hours but then after work I'm usually what I'm saying but it but again if they want to give him a salary and act like they did him a favor and it's been and he gets paid forty\nBut he's working in the same number of hours or he's working when he's making forty eight than this\nYeah it's just making sense to you yeah that makes sense\nIf it's even if it's forty eight to forty eight we still like the salary because of the upward potential\nOkay long term it's a long term a good career movies moving into leadership into management and that's where he wants to head towards long term\nBut um you know yes but but again you just compare it to last year's income so\nThe whole thing comes down to how does it compare to forty eight thousand what's the salary do 'cause that's what he was making working the hours that he's going to continue to be working apparently Chris is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Chris how are you\nI'm doing good day thanks taking my call sure what's up [noise] uh well right now I'm a like income about thirty one thousand dollars a year [noise] I got a fourteen hundred dollars in credit card debt a battle eleven thousand a student loan debt\nThat ah that that about six months ago was a lot about Nineteen thousand I've been working working hard and saved my money and and and all that much as I can\nGood or not I'm not a cooks right now I came up with the idea for an invention and I don't know whether to keep you know steam rolling my debt plan and doing all that are just you know kind of jump ship and say hey this is something they could\nYou know be my future and potentially mhm [noise] so [noise]\nI'm In kind of want a young lady of financial advice from you know what to do with the remaining that I have and yeah my aspirations [noise] because I'm In the process I've been paid into a VA home loan now is just about their so\nAny advice you can give me I'd be greatly appreciated\nRight well I'm going to avoid buying a home until I get to the cleared the Russian is then how can we start working on the invention idea and make some money now 'cause we don't need to make a\nBunch of money five years from now we need some money today one of them I'm twenty thousand dollars today show the invention you came up with as a physical product\nYes sir they are older the odor either slash a mold a real small machine that um\nPeople getting on their own okay and you've made one I I just made a very um rudimentary proud of the ... the next the next phase I got is like either dip into my rainy day fund or start coming into my regular cash flow and like mine a computer and get my three D. modeling\nAnd get me a couple of silicon prototype so I can go you know take it to a you know take the next level or what I Want to do\nSo again Dr jump off my my debt plan more do I have a case my invention [laughter]\nOkay um well what you're talking about you could spend anywhere from twenty five dollars to a two hundred and fifty thousand dollars on it there's really no in between I mean you could just go anywhere you want to go with this there's a lot\nOf money to be spent on something like this and if you were a billionaire and you you know what you would do is you would build a couple of 'em and you get them out there and test them and make sure that they work and that there was a market for it before you went into production\n... because you don't go into production on prototypes that our own tested or from an orange standpoint or you don't go into production on something that I've got no market for it and I've been able to sell it because you will let you make a hundred thousand of them and having them in your basement if you had unlimited sums ever be able to show on you know in a crash\nI'd like to trying to ah continue to do with the way you're doing it and that's just piece it together and let's build one and let's find somebody to put one in the in the property and\nAnd let's say let me give you just let's just make up a pretend example okay it will be like your ideal thing you build one or two in your garage and you're convinced these guys look this looks rough we're not looking at the ... the form\nWe're looking at the function of it I just want to show you that the idea works and if the ideal works than what I'm\nGoing to want you to this place in order for ten of them or thirty of them or a hundred of them for for all of your locations okay and you find somebody like that that's got an upside to test it and then if a place that order that just plays a deposit with you large enough to build the order\nMhm and it finds itself\nThat's called organically cash flowing something in other words you prove it to somebody who's going to be a big customer and they place an order with enough of the deposit to fill the manufacturer first order out\nI think I should dial down uh my rather than just an all my extra capital towards paying off my credit card debt and I didn't learn that\nI don't really get much capital on this you've already we're already built one in the garage yeah build another one okay maybe a couple of hundred bucks right\nIs cheaper than that but I I just say I'm going to protect us I Want it to be you know a good look I'm proud of\nThat so now it's probably like they're on Oprah factions [laughter] very very purpose of a prototype despite all the crap that's broken down again it\nPerfect you're going to put it out there in the end the marketplaces going to kick it around and you're going to learn form and function changes and forming function changes in the switch has to be on that side of this which has to be made out of this instead of that and you're only going to learn\nThat if you beat up about a hundred of 'em but let's get two of 'em in somebody's restaurant in there to restaurants and they got a hundred they can put them in later or two of them in somebody's industrial application and they've got um you know they've got forty more they will order if it works because it's the best thing since sliced bread I got\nHave the [noise] um and then they give you enough money\nFrom the initial order for you to do your manufacturing\nOf pocket except your brain power and you're sweating\nThem is they go in a mass production for some reason the marketplace or\nGo easy this is a day Ramsey show\n\n[noise]\n\nFor years and one of the most asked questions I get is day one

Ramsey what's the best way to decide which payment plan I should go with for my student loans just a minimum\nPayments on every thing except your smallest loan and throw every dollar you can possibly throw it when it's gone attack the next one down when it's going to attack the next one down that's called the debt snowball and that\nIs the most efficient way and the most the highest probability way to get out of student loan debt very fast and very hard\nDo not get into income based repayment plans\nDo not get into I'm going to pay the minimum I can pay off by the freaking maximum you can pay 'cause Sallie Mae evicted get that old ugly woman out\nOf your house she is not a good roommate you want her to leave Louis is on Facebook should pull a thousand dollars on I'm all for one day to day baby step one\nYou don't cash out of four one K. except to avoid a bankruptcy or a foreclosure when you take money out of your four one K. they charge you a ten percent penalty plus your tax rate\nNow that means if you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year household income your tax rates twenty five percent plus ten percent but I mean you just got charged thirty five percent interest in fact I mean it's not technically interested penalties in taxes but you never borrow money thirty five percent interest to ponder baby steps one no\nNo no no no no or would you use that to pay off debt thirty five percent hit no no\nWell they told me on hold and twenty percentile that's all they're required to withhold but that's not the calculation of how much the government keeps you in the teeth the government keeps you in the teeth out of ten percent penalty plus you're ... you do not gay shout retirement couch unless it's to avoid bankruptcy or\nForeclosure above save your home yeah or if you're so far in debt it's the only way you keep from bankruptcy yeah you would do that\nBut at that point you're beyond desperate you're in deep bleach you know but definitely not never catch it out to buy a car\nYou know ... kind of stupid stuff the people\nAnd ... that that's not economic there's something else going on I ... a few places in the United states have not recovered after twelve years would you buy it and I read or what\nI I don't understand it either 'cause we live in northern Virginia which is like very close to Washington DC and right now it's worth two hundred and Ninety five K. I bought it at\nUm according to I'm a realtor and we bought the house at three hundred and fifty K.\nA recent comparative market analysis by quality real estate agent says his house is worth three hundred grand\nOkay is that what you're telling me yes so\nYou must have during the ... worst real estate deal\nI I that will likely satellite I we bought the house into that but I think you know what I only got plenty [laughter] I'm Sorry that again you own it um right now we all about sixty chaotic\nOh solid crowd we should do it it's crap orange worst house\nLeaders that they view it sucks [laughter] so you don't think we should wait for a while to suck more to\n[noise] All right do you that that could actually my question because right now we're at dating a baby step number six\nHere's the thing and we're going to do three hundred thousand dollars in cash would you go by the house next door\nKnow why because this sucks\n'cause neighborhood is not appreciating for some reason or another it's the world's worst rate of return meanwhile the root of the nation grew up the way down and his up twenty percent\nI I I agree with you I this is why I'm calling because I'm trying to decide if we should continue to write this out no and wait until okay\nNo it's a bad investment it's a bad neighborhood I don't know what's wrong here but I mean a ... a house you pay three and fifty thousand dollar store in two thousand three kings six before the crash it goes down and it's not even recovered back to three fifty it mean that's a very unusual real estate market unusually bad\nAnd I don't want to invest in it and going forward and so I wouldn't keep it going forward take your take your loss and get out you know really bad place for some reason I don't know what's wrong but that's the worst numbers I've heard and I don't\nKnow when I mean everywhere else just about as recovered Florida went down the Knicks went down freak in Las Vegas crashed\nAnd has recovered you know I mean but there's some you know there's some parts of Detroit that habit but those are economic pockets but it's not an overall national economy thing and so you don't buy in bad economic\nPockets

buy that is very very cheap that you like five thousand dollar car that you pay cash for or you pay it off very very quickly with your other debts\nBut I mean you love this car if you want but I don't know the score it's a stupid car and it's killing you your numbers are horrendous on this um if you have more than half\nOf your income tied up in cars or things with motors in them all total to then you have too much of your life to add up and things that are going down in value and you're always going to struggle it's causing you to be middle class or lower middle class\nSocio economically

it\n'cause nobody owns you now that's it and they're no longer a slave to the lender is right that's a pretty impressive stuff gosh wow very cool so what do you tell people the key to getting out of debt is\nA that's a that's a great question um one thing I can say is you have to be committed a once you agree to do something you have to be committed to do it and and you have to see beyond your current situation you have to see what you want to be more than you see where you are\nThough once you can see beyond that then you can start to dream a and and there was many times where we actually drove through neighborhoods and looked at the nice houses and say you know when we do this right or we can go pick a house where we can do that and you know what we wanted to do it right you know I hadn't thought about\nThat Sharon I used to do that we would go drive the rich neighborhood and then go you know someday we could do that and here's all we've got we've got to do ... and then we can get there and it wasn't like oh we'll never get their roll our eyes or both bigger people rich people more like I'm going to be one of you mhm and you know\nAnd that's what you do when you grow up and they brought them all live here that's it I live in that one you know just as\nThat's a good I forgot and we did that too because it gets it gets down inside of you then doesn't it\nIt does and then you could show stupid that you know and get your whatever your show me the boat and get you on lighter man goes back to live like nobody else later you can live and give like no one else 'cause you're
