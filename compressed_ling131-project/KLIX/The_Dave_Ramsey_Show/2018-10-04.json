an arena Oh hi Shay welcome to the day Ramsey show\nThanks for taking my call today sure what's up on the health insurance question for you and I'm hoping you could give me some insight on it we adopted our two children about three years ago\nAnd the foster care system so we don't get a lot of services but one thing we do get is health insurance\nUntil they're Eighteen and it's provided through our state Medicaid system and every year my husband and I kind of go back and forth on whether or not to keep it or to put them on his plan through his employer and we're getting close to that um [noise]\nTime of year to make that decision\nOkay um what would his employer's plan cover that Medicaid is not covering\nAll they've both been healthy thankfully I guess are um you know the thing we always come back to his unknowns of any kind of health issues that they may have er\nUm any services because even though the Medicaid coverage is crummy you know in a lot of ways a lot of doctors don't take it and it's a basically welfare insurance [noise] um it has covered their needs up to this point because those kids are healthy and they've had you know minimal minimal\nIncidental parade if they had some kind of a major event at Medicaid would not do a good job of covering and that his insurance might\nActually it's more of the opposite I'm not worried about the major stuff because like we've had to go to the ER for you know my you know got scraping a bump and\nPick up the tab for everything it's more the ongoing care there is um you know it's very hard to find providers who take it there's a bit of a steak than we feel a little strange having that kind of coverage given our own financial position you know that our kids are on a\nUm [noise] there's a bit of a stigma that oh don't feel they're having it so it's just it's just kind of a dilemma we face every year and I you know in November we\nCan make a ... or Jew or a you know free food stamps because you are\nAdopted a foster child you know that would feel the same way as what you're saying um it\nWould yeah I mean I I well I don't look at you have any of the red\nLight then that takes care of their you know their their financial needs and [noise] um so I don't know this is not an easy\nNow is a question and as it cost to add them to your husband's policy\nUm I think it would be nothing given the policy Ron has a high deductible age has a plan that we have and there is no cost ...\nJackie how are you don't find the bank you for taking my call sure what's up [noise] [noise] I don't\nIf I coincide a loan for

time\nReally he he he doesn't want to have a job that no country quit his job because he's been trying to get into this job forever because\nWhat I Would have conflict with his job he's only working twenty hours a week\nRight for the call 'em for this job\nTwenty hours a week or the whole week\n... hours a week maybe twenty five ... ... ... ... is a TV station and he he Jeff I'm cooking when they have a football game and then they go to a fix for that but did\nYou what would you be on call for football there is no emergency football\n[laughter] have you been trying to get into the TV station for years I got the\nPart that he's working twenty hours a week and his mother is calling me 'cause she can't pay his dad gum twenty thousand dollar bill I'd like for him to work on the forty hours a week on top of the twenties playing football we're actually she so he can pay is freaking bills so you're not calling me how would that channel that would sound awesome\nI I Try to tell him that when I get 'em ... than a couple of ... and I think it I guess when I have to pay like out\nIn the ... the thirty in the late ... at least thirty the ugly\nYou don't work much there yeah yeah\nThere's a great place to go when you're broke to work so uh what I Would tell him to do is uh get into financial patient virtually and get his young budding gear and start and then you know I I mean if I'm you I'm going to be all up on this kid because he's twenty eight years old and he's a slacker\nAnd his momma is calling me you're single after his mom's a single lady out here when you're fifty what fifty fifty years old and you're having to pay this kid's bills yeah I'm mad\nAt him right now I don't want you to be two and a good loving mama's kind of way\nThe old and you're having to pay this kid's bills yeah I'm mad\nAt him right now I don't want you to be two and a good loving mama's kind of way\nI'm not trying to disown him I just want to knock him out on his little head okay well you know and then you you better plan on paying it if that norm not doesn't get moving\nOkay so you know ball and knock it out and then you know shock it up to that and but dude I'm telling you a word will have some discussions is he married\nOkay I bet she works forty hours yeah yeah\nThere you go [noise] alright\nOpens owns a AAA eight to five five two to five Katherine is with us from Portland Maine Hi Katherine how are you\nKind of thing here I'm here without my budget I Do the every dollar budget among baby step to crank protect my expenses for them on a project what I'm going to be paying for that and then sometimes something\nHappens like last month when my car broke down I had to have it in repaired and it cost almost five hundred dollars [laughter]\nShows them how often that we really don't have ... do you have your your baby steps one with a thousand dollars right I Do now that would be an emergency that you would use that for\nOkay but that's what I was confused about because the way I handled it whereas I simply added a new line item to my budget for that item and then reduce the amount that I pay toward get for that month so I get it wrong that will\nBe okay you cash flow did you just ... but if you can cash flow at that month that's fine I didn't have to come out of the emergency funds so you are paying more than five hundred dollars extra on that each month\nGood answer you reduced it by five hundred for one month 'cause you got kicked in the kneecap with this thing but usually you're not going to have that month in a month out\nNow there's some things if a if there's a recurring unexpected event it no longer is unexpected\nFor ... you know you don't have anything budgeted for car repairs will that will not work because most cars are going to need some repairing over a period of six months you know they don't have\nAnything budgeted for car repairs yeah\nProbably put something in there for that because the ... your budget needs to reflect the real world and the real world is you're going to spend something on that car in a given six month period of time it might be tires that might\nBe maintenance you might be oil change it might be a five hundred dollar to you know but you're going to spend something on a car in unless you're driving really nice brand new cars you're going to spend something on the car during that time so your budget should reflect reality in that regard so probably gonna\nAdd a little bit of a don't have to be a lot fifty or a hundred bucks or something and let that build up as a sinking fun they call it than the every dollar software on them on below but I don't care where you build it up but somewhere you build it up and you ah\nHave the money in cash then for your car repair as it comes up and that's an example of something that is recovering so it's no longer unexpected emergencies should be unexpected things things that are are often enough that we can expect them aren't emergencies anymore but you did good yeah\nYou did fine just to cash flow through that emergency\nYou slow down your debt snowball for that\nAnd then you pick back up next month hopefully won't have another one of those and you can really build it up and go from there so good question and you're doing good keep after Tom is with us in San Francisco Hey Tom welcome to the day Ramsey show\nAppreciate we're doing a great thing I've been an avid fan for three days now can you\nOh Hey Tom welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHere ... we doing a great thing I've been an avid fan for three days now\nCan you\nPlayed together a long time you and I [laughter]\n[noise] so the question to you so my life and I\nWe have about three hundred K. and any student debt another hundred and Fifteen and automobile a line of credit that type of banks I worked into the and we make a pretty good income shoot at about one twenty annually\nI met one eighty three hundred come on the question for you it I wasn't going back to school to get my masters the programs only twenty five okay\nSo that would be a very real our ally on edge but over the last three days are starting to think maybe maybe I shouldn't [laughter] just want to get your take on that\nA masters in what\nIt would be in software engineering\n... ...\nAnd they would increase your income by more than twenty five K.\n[noise] it would probably be hard to say that would be a winning case and will raise as the category of jump into\n... okay you would make a new initiative adventure would make it back in touch over a year then from that point so that's really nice return I think you can put that in the budget and the reason you can put it in the budget as you make so stinking much money\nNow you live in in a very expensive area granted it's crazy extent yeah oh I didn't want to live in a really rough and you're ... yeah but you guys are really you're really ... ... ...\n... and so I mean how quick can we pay off four hundred well we can pay off four hundred and two years if we do it and two hundred a year that may be living on a hundred I'm not sure you can do that after taxes in your area so you probably got a three year get out of\nBut you know vacations you don't need to see the inside of a\nRestaurant and don't you scared me behind anything else about nothing\nAnytime you need to live like people that make a hundred people and make three hundred and get the Staten Island\nThat it's time the rest of this uh\nA common theme around airs teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that\nAnd then go and those credits all transfer and then go to a regular school I mean for your school for two years to finish up or that kind of a thing community college has a lot less expensive and you get your basics out of the way for the first two years\nFor a four year degree if you want to solve the second thing once you've determined what you want to do and how you're going to do it then the second thing you do is\nCollege cost\nIs the number one cause of student loan\nDebt what I mean is that you can buy a Bentley\nOr you can buy a used pickup truck both our transportation but one is several hundred thousand dollars and one is just a few hundred dollars\nBut both of you know the mall and\nAnswer if you if you don't have any money and you're saving up you can't afford a Bentley you can't afford to go to a super expensive college and there's nothing wrong with that by the way I didn't go to ... college so you go to an end state school\nIn Florida you go to University of Florida Gainesville or you go to University of central Florida\nRight there in Orlando a wonderful ... neither one of ... wonderful both of them are in state tuition not that expensive and\nUh that's thing one your college selection as at the least expensive college that will help you get the degree that you need to get is what you need to aim at with rare exceptions and you're not going\nOut of state and you're not going super expensive private the second thing is then you start looking for scholarships and you make scholarship hunting your full time job after\nSchool job that kind of a thing and you start applying for and filling out the scholarship forms and riding the essays and he probably ask for a thousand scholarships and you'll probably get turned down for nine hundred and fifty of them but if you get fifty one thousand dollar scholarship she just went to school for he did that'd be pretty cool not about\nThe third thing is planning on working a lot while you are in school don't borrow money so that you don't have to work work\nAnd get good jobs jobs that pay a lot dog walking cutting grass jobs people don't want to do but they pay a lot to do what I'm Talking about minimum wage crap and if you're gonna live on campus go ahead and being alright be a residential advisor or read that somewhere they call it what is an R. A.\nHow it is it is a resident advisor okay so there you know the the babysitter in the dorm okay and you get free dorm for doing that and sometimes free tuition for doing that and sometimes free tuition free dorm and pay for doing that she'll be in our\nA if you're going to live on campus or work in the cafeteria get free food do you live on campus if you can get a job working for the University of the tuition might be completely free and that\nMight be different to something to look at it so that's the kind of stuff you look at but figure out where you're going what steps are to get their figure out the cheapest way to get their\nFigure out scholarships to somebody pays you to get there and then plan on working your butt off and those things will get you through school completely debt free in this day and time and it can be done Alex is with us in Baltimore hey\nAlex welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nAnd Mr Ramsey how are you a thank you for everything that you do thank you uh just under can be a call at ... I Am debt free I'm On baby step three or five months saved up two months ago are my six months but here's my question and I work full time in a retail establishment\nAnd I have a small a job that I find myself on the side\nI'm at that point in a retail establishment where I think it's time for me to stay out of here and we'll start my focused towards my my own personal business one should I you can't ship would you advise really use my emergency fund\nTo help me through that I was growing pains of being full time with my small ...\nNo it's not an emergency [noise] um\nYou're creating an emergency by leaving the job to shirts I don't blame you from one to leave and we want to do your own thing I Want you to do that too but once you get how you get your side business making more money you're going to work anymore and you may have to just take fewer hours at the a\nRetail thing and back your hours down that may mean you moved to a different retail job I don't know but today you're not making enough money on the side job or you wouldn't have asked that question\nOh that's true how much money you make it on the side\nA ... nearly I'm probably a call now about twice what was your best month ever\nUh about four thousand one was a a car about seven months\nAgo and you do that again [laughter] I doubt I Wish\nYou gotta gotta get there now what do you make it on the retail gig

[noise]\n\n\n\n\nIs the day when the American\nWas ready to do on\nThe show is a region of the shows they will be joined in Studio by selling author\nBoutique per se the rights and perceived to be with\nYou hey this is my favorite that you\nAlways have a really good that we haven't got caught and we're going to be talking about career\nBusiness they are many times one in the same as what Christie and I are dedicated to wear excited take your calls so for this hour you've got a career question you've got a business courses helping you always dreamed of starting\nMaybe just started maybe haven't started yet oh my goodness Christie right can help you out we're gonna have big fun if you get some confusion you're dealing with in your career maybe you're scared you know exactly what you want to do what you're just terrified well there's no shame in that we all face those fears we've got to step into those fears\nAnd maybe you're just stuck you're stuck in a job where it's just sucking the life out of you and you can't wait to get the friday\nAfternoon if that is due to day is your day make the call we're here to help triple eight eight to five\nFive two to five triple eight eight to five five two to five will started off with Katie who's ...\nFive five two to five triple eight eight to five five two to five will started off with Katie who's on the line in Ogden, Utah Katie how can we help\nI think for taking my call Cher I'm well I'm I'm feeling really confused about um life right now I'm a little background about five years ago I stopped going to school and my husband and I found out a pregnant and since then I've worked all kinds of our job to pay for him to finish\nAnd he recently finished she's got a great guy now and we're starting to kick our debt but they ran big help I'm such a difficult but [noise]\nUm to help out I've been applying the creature that I don't really want to work out just because you know we need that money and I don't have not much else going on for me and I'm trying to fix I've got two kids I'd like to stay home um\nBut I you know I Want to work and I want to help out and I and I feel like I've lost myself and I have no idea where to even start to find my interests are my strengths yeah well I\nUnderstand that you feel that way but that is an absolute wiser you have to acknowledge the fact that that's just a lack of confidence there's some self doubt it's creeping because you've been at home for a while and here's another reality\nReality is that right now to Katie in America we have more jobs that are available\nThan there are people who are unemployed it is a fantastic job market even first day at home moms meaning you want to stay home but work from home and so what you have to first do is get very very clear you're in that first stage\nThat's what we're taking a shower come on come on Tripoli eight to five five to too far that's AAA eight to five five two to five and we're going to go to Patricia who's on the line in Tampa, Florida how can we all\nI Do think that they can I call jerks that's certainly felt when reading a book and your food cooked in London has um I'd love to open a\nStudio that function as a wellness center so up or not to say oh God the financial coal to and other things too for physical mental and emotional health\nBut I think about selling my house and saying that he said you were there I Would live up there and down it would be the sensor might concern that that is that um it would there be some sort of liability\nWell or go ahead\nNo on uh somewhere was to get hurt a lot I Know that can apply for a thing and I were to lose so they can go out to the fitness but if I Lived in the building that there are I don't know I'm Wondering if that would be an issue well\nYou've got a couple of things going on here but you're going to want to own a a spend a little bit how each of them first of all um\nThat's probably going to be state specific so you definitely need to look at the laws in your state in any type\nOf regulations I'm you're gonna have liabilities regardless whether it's a stand alone studio or it's where you live so you're you're going to have liabilities of someone gets hurt and you need to know what those are and to protect yourself with insurance um professional insurance products based insurance if your product that type of things you want to look into that\nBut I Do just want to challenge you and one thing for ... I Love your idea I Love the idea of a wellness center I Love the idea that you're helping people but here's what I traditionally encourage people to do because you don't currently have a yoga studio and you don't have any idea validated\nI Want to challenge you to start a little bit smaller in a little sooner so I'll give you an example where is there a wellness center community center yoga studio\n... studio somewhere where you could start your business sublease third base and they're off hours build your brand builder demand you have no risk no overhead no upfront cost and you're able to validate your idea until the business justify\nYou getting your own space be that a duplex that you have about or your own stand on space I'll give an example there are a lot of churches that will operate when they're getting started\nOut of like elementary schools the elementary school right next to her house will they don't have to go on Sundays so they rented out to a church that use it on Sunday\nAnd it's this great deal to win when it's additional revenue for the school the church has a place to go without having to afford a whole building\nSeven days a week when they can't justify it and I've seen a lot of businesses do this so I don't think your ideas a bad idea I Would just talents you just start smaller and sooner on a lower risk level lower cost level and validate your idea\nAnd build those relationships build your brand in your demand get that going and then when you're ready to have your own studio it's the next logical step it doesn't feel like a terrifyingly so he doesn't want to look into laws and regulations for liabilities but also when you think about your space before you make that big commitment [noise]\nPatricia are you a lot of sense\nAre you working full time right now\nRight and that was\nAnd I found with Iran and on I was planning on going back but minus practitioner and that way um I I've been making more money but it will help make up funding like business as well\nYeah I well I ... you can I just wanted to know that in fact be now is this this that piece of information please beautifully knew what you're saying she's going to have to do this on the side anyway she's not in a position to open up anything\nI don't think you were trying to go round open it um I I just want to see maybe do a little bit of yoga for some people maybe two or three months when I see if you can get a small group to pay you\nBecause it's everything you just said but it allows you to tip to into it or the nurse practitioner thing that's going to school to get that will make more money I Love that too is going to allow her to cash flow have more cash piled on when it's time to to operate so I mean you you nailed it there I I just think you know don't rush into\nThe well and the other thing I Want to call out for anyone listening right now that has a service based business and like a yoga studio you have a tendency to think that the studio is the business it's not if you took a UPN go anywhere you can go to people's houses you can go to the park outside their calming and paying for you so don't feel like you have to\nHave a location before you can start your business because you are the business so you can start to ... out of your living room if you want to learn and down the street and by the way you should go ahead totally yeah yeah don't wait for the studio at the studios now come in and re you are the business and white people don't care\nFor him as they enjoy it to come in for use or not counting for the building\nTriple eight eight to five five two to five triple eight to five five two to five ... sitting in for a range of this hour taking your calls about your business your business idea a career career change career question let's go to bill is on the line and Detroit Michigan bill how can we help\nAnd across the aisle to get attacked you good luck on how can we'll\nHope I've been on the chief shelves for about Twenty years and to this point it really hasn't been I haven't progressive farther career as I originally hoped and wished I had\nA long story short is I'm back in January wife and I went through F P view and as we bumped to a baby steps Ron based up to right now\nGoing through some of our stuff to get a garage sale goal and we came in to some old horror movies have a fish from stuff that she got her from her bad um when he had died um and\nAll the things we found you know we have a lot of old age millimeters old VHS law stuff and it's like okay we have a lot of stuff [noise]\nUm I started converting it and I really found a passion for that that I haven't had in a piece for quite a while and I'm thinking okay this sounds like something I could turn into a great business and love doing going forward a slick isn't at this point bill and\nBill let me interrupt what is the bit to get right to what is the business with the military or what is the business\nI'm converting legacy format like ... or VHS ... law that uh could digital content and properly preserve them\nOkay and so what's your question for us then\nI'm not a question I have is just um\nHow to get started um I definitely want to get started and I just want to make sure I'm stepping through a properly and [noise] the um more tell you a bill crush the\n... he's ready to go she can cause we only have a little bit of time here I Want to be able to get to your your solution we want to make sure we might help\nThat is a when you were entering a space where there's already people doing what you want to do it means the ideas prevent so you're not doing something that's never been done before there are actually businesses have similar type services what you didn't know is yes you're solving a problem and if you're solving a problem it's a Bible business idea you just have\nTo find people that have that problem that had the eight millimeters they want to preserve them and you're going to learn how who that person is\nYou're going to go after them and build a business for them so you're at a price for them you're going to create marketing language that speaks to them right where they are to the best part about this bill it\nYou know the idea is valid because it's been done before what you're going to do is you're going to build your business and you're gonna do better and you're going to serve your customers and they're gonna want to come to you because you make a unique space for yourself in that market a bell I Know my book is for women but I'm going to send it to you men read it all the time\nThe business principles are the same and it gives you plan to take that idea to market I Hope it helps more than that you said\nIt you're right and it's right to great plans will follow it and and here's this thing a ... a lot of bills out there he said something that's interesting he finds these old things and you realize way I'm hanging\nOut this and and you were given a missteps the book is going to August ... but I Want to just have when they try it tested all this and all of that last caller here's why some passion should be hobby\nIt changes things when you turn it into a better change that what you made a great point other people are doing this he just got to find people that are willing to pay him to do it and keep paying him into others hey if you need to tell you about bill he's got to start really small but start\nRight away thinking about getting ... just you know in order to just do a triple eight eight to five five and two to five coming up more of your questions about where we're starting a business don't go anywhere\nYou've heard me talk about our deep there for years and how it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I run\nAcross some numbers that even surprised me and shows the real nightmare that people go through when they become a victim of the sixteen million victims of identity the last year yes sixteen million twenty six percent of them have to borrow money from family or friends twenty two percent of them lost even more money by taking time off work and\nSo there are different companies okay I'm going to see at two of them are kind of actually my own project I work on out here in Minnesota the other one is there a company I used to work four years ago that your contract work for perfect they don't have that salary yeah\nThe the reason I'm asking is because when you go out on your own even if it's just getting that first client or two that can be the scariest part to validate can I Do it on my own and can I make the sale and can run\nThis whole thing without having a boss that kinda backs me and you're already doing it and that's why I'm so excited to Haiti because you're just going to do more of what you're already doing a little bit and just like Ken said\nYou've got this light at the end of the tunnel when you're going to start to increase your family household income in other ways to your husband but in the meantime if you want to spend the next two to three months building up the demand the clients the relationship even just taking people to coffee starting together interest of\nIndependent projects you could run on your own that could run through this new\nArchitecture firm that you're going to run as an independent person you're building it up and of course it will be crazy for a season because you're getting more and more demand but then when you decide to leave your full time job it's the next logical step where the business can support you the income is there of course that's only going to help and your husband has income\nSo you're all ready I Would say twenty to thirty percent down the path of doing this you're not starting from scratch or not like I have full time job and I want to do this totally different thing how do I start up you're already doing if you already have clients you're working with I just want you to do more of that\nAnd then the next few months as you build that up\nThat will start to ramp up as her husband's income comes in and it looks like first dear you probably should be able to comfortably leisure leader day job\nYeah and it comes down to a form of the you gotta work days baby steps days babies to fund the dream so when you put enough money aside plus decide businesses there and then that's how you get to that number where you can step aside and to Christie's point does not have to be a ... jump right that should be a nice move and it just takes a little bit of time and patience lays on her way\nThe light at the end of the tunnels and important point can cause so many people still like how can I sustain this well you're not till January when you that light of the total you know this is the first season them to put my head down for a season them and have the rewards it's worth it things are\nAll right let's go to ray real quick in Orlando, Florida re how can we help\n[noise] hey how you doing guys I'm OK though I've been in the field for the past Eighteen years and I love the field the past six years I\nI've been in the field for the past Eighteen years and ah I Love the field the past six years I've been doing the security [noise] um [noise] which I Love even more um I feel I feel though where I'm Nat I'm sort of\nThe next level to go up it'd be manager level and I don't really honestly want to be a manager because I Love doing so much of the technical aspects\nAre owned by the security so I was wondering if it's possible to try to start something on the side are related to the security consulting I'm and I'm just not exactly sure how the guy about that because they would mostly be\nShort businesses and I'm In a conflict with my current job\nWell let me ask you a question is the only reason you're considering starting the IT security consulting business because you want to make more money\n[noise] no not at all\nWell you ... your insecurity right now you love it that was your statement but you said the only way to move up was to be in the ... I think you feel like you're trapped so the consulting business feels like\nOh this is a way to allow me to see a lot or is that right [noise] yeah sense of progress you just want a sense of progress that makes sense it does but again the question here that I\nIs wait a second have you looked at all of your opportunities within IT security it's a big world bigger than I'm even able to understand for you to move up so where are you at now financially where would you like to be [noise]\nUm well I mean\nThe most just answer where what are you making now eighty four and what do you want to make during the little one fifty\nOr in the end so okay I just wanted to read 'cause all the business we can answer that certain but but I I just wonder if if it's the right time re for you to step out and start a business where are you at you have any debt what's your financial situation\nWith a ... yes we are heavily in baby steps to do this alone I'm Guy we're working on paying off or they just uh moved to a new house\nI'm I'm three children my wife also works um as a um [noise] actually has a good job cuts I I just looking at possibly start something under five between if I Would like to take that with all the time\n... I don't I don't think it's a bad idea to test it but here's the thing I Would encourage you said you didn't want to be a manager in your current company he started side business they're managing something still you're managing the business and you're managing you interact with one or two clients makes her done conflict to compete and then you'll get a taste of if you want to do more of that

having you know ... months\n[noise] not any zero month or during the winter in Colorado there's um a month or slower than others where you know making the making the budget would be tight tighter when we're at a\nPartner and I don't I don't I never expand the baby step on emergency fund what I Would do is if your income is truly of all of the one I think yours is not as long as you're acting like it is you might get a hundred grand and your whining about running out of money I mean really\nYou really need to stop and think about what you just said but anyway if you're going to go to zero in December because nobody's buying a house in Colorado Springs in December you don't want to have zero money I'll go along with that part but I don't think that's what's really happening am I going to eight dollars a month average\nSo I'm a five hundred to ten thousand a month or whatever so anyway set some aside but we're not going to call in an emergency fund and we're not going to add to the thousand dollar account we call it an Illinois valley account the Helmand valley is the volatility of your income the hill is when they come as good the valley is when it's bad\nAnd so if you want to set a couple of ground over there in that in addition to the thousand two separate accounts Warner's for emergencies and one is for you if you run\nOf money because you don't make any money in a month but dude I don't think you're really doing that I think you need to go back and actually look at your cash flow analyze your revenue streams for however long you been in the business and go how many times have are really run\nOut of money I mean you can make money and so\nI don't I don't think it's happening if you told me my forty thousand hours and real estate business I can imagine you have in some zero much but you're not you know it's not what you're telling me you're making money\nA year just afraid of the volatility and you know that's reasonable so go back in track your revenues in charge of revenues and if they truly are dipping down below what it takes to exist in your house\nIn giving in certain months over in a long period of time and go back go you know every January and February I'm always screwed this is where we are then\nOkay since some money aside to cover that so that you do that but I don't think it's as bad\nAs your emotions are telling you it is and uh but no we're not changing the emergency fun we might have a hill and valley account if you truly have a volatile income Mark's with us in Seattle Highmark welcome to the day Ramsey show\nThank Dave hey it's a great honor to talk with you know you I had a great impact on changing my life five years ago um I think you are currently uh I I got a great question I'm In baby steps eggs are the only thing right now I'm paying off my I'm dead I got a network of a half million dollars\n[noise] what happened was was five years ago I I left a small company with a Greek a company culture when I hear you talk about your company that the company I was working for a very similar culture\nWas making an average salary for what I did I went to a competitor I much you're making a I was making a eighty thousand dollars a year where you make now I make a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year on your question is what I make my question is I really miss that small company culture\nAnd um I have an opportunity to go back to a smaller company of about a hundred people start up [noise] um I think it would be a really really interesting to get back into that culture um I just kind of lost by passion for my work\nAnd um you know I show up to work every day I get great reviews um I'd\nProbably go back but I Want some equity or I Want some indication that I can on my way back up to what you're actually wars in the marketplace of ideas that\nYou have to make less\nIs not a necessary is not necessarily an assumption I'm going\nMaybe that particular company can't tell you what you find somebody with an Asian culture and how you what's your worst\nThat you know ... when it comes to life insurance or protecting your family that women are more likely to be on insured or under insured than men just doesn't make any sense women\nMake up half the workforce contributes mightily to family incomes and in many cases are the breadwinners and take care of their families twenty four hours a day this is one of the most overlooked areas when it comes to financial planning maybe it's a relic of the past but a loss of income or the need to replace family care is equally important for women\nAnd so ... and it's very simple\nIt's just because I Need to pick up the phone and talk to a human being that\nActually has a little bit of power that can pull stuff off now I don't my CFO does but my controller knows that kind of thing but buddy you know that's what you should want\nYou should be able to walk in and talk to a human and not be treated like a number and you know so I Do not understand why anyone would do business with people like Wells Fargo or bank of America\nIt's beyond me they treat you like crap and they over charging for most of the services\nAnd this day in time\nOfferings of their Web banking systems are not any more sophisticated they're not\nThat good they're not good at anything so I just don't get it so that that's why we endorsed credit unions you hear me in some of your city is endorsing a local credit union or a local small town\nCommunity type bank and I'm just a a huge fan of using that for your ah your banking service needs and it's what I did everything on\nDoors on the show is stuff that that I personally do or what do you know in your situation and that kind of a thing I don't\nHave anything is inconsistent like I'm too big or too good to do that\nI I'm not I don't have a need for some of the things that we tell you to get but you know\n... you know in most cases I'm a customer personally Ted is with us Ted's in York, Pennsylvania Hi Ted how're you\nDoing better than I deserve how're you doing\nJust the same how can I help\nBy ... thank you and your staff writer you're doing it it's a blessing I Do um [noise] I Will be needing a lakeside saving operation about ten to Fifteen Years I don't get hit by a bus\nAnd I want to know if I uh I should continue funding and age I say with my employer contributing a couple of hundred bucks a year or should I just put a that extra money into a ... her four one K.\nWas it just a couple of hundred bucks a year\nThe company I don't know if she\nCan put you come out they're matching a couple of hundred bucks a year in more okay so the the nature of ... what kind of life saving operation if you've got to have in ten years what is it\nFinally deliver ooh I got on the so you know fortunately if you can't live without\nYeah I've heard that you know [laughter] oh [laughter] okay hobby I'd say it's a it's a slow a slow progression then\nYeah it is they they asked me that you know Seventeen years out south okay yeah I got to figure to right around the time I'm ready to retire so I'm trying to yeah retire early you know and I'll see if I can\nYou know I think the thing is the uh what you're going to want is a mix you you you you got to have the cash in your age as they are somewhere else in an investment to cover what's going to come out of your pocket I assume you're talking to health insurance is going to cover a large portion of that is correct\nYeah that's if I'd retire um and I'll be I'm I'm either cold or some other type of insurance policy\nI think I'd be on cobra or or I wouldn't retire because this is I guess this is a multi hundred thousand dollar event isn't it probably\nOh I'm thinking we're going to turn retirement around this a little bit um or ... or cobra one of the two if you want to retire early you're just going to have to pony up for the cupboard with cover only last about two years or something [noise]\nUm I don't know you can keep that indefinitely so I think that's number one I Want to make sure you got health insurance to cover the vast majority of this I don't know one time that poor like a\nBut then how much have you got coming out of pocket a over ten years you could put five thousand dollars a year into that age essay or whatever your big the duck double as Richard adoptable\n[noise] um\n[noise] ...\nYeah ... or ... whatever the ... on the ... year\nOh now the age I say that health insurance I Know of fun [noise] um\nNo the edge essays are health savings account that is attached to a health and ... say health insurance policy that as a ... policy\nIt it depends uh depends on a policy I package either six to nine to five thousand\nDollars is what I'm Talking about you can put up to that amount per year into that savings account\nAnd that would be six thousand half fully fund that yes and I don't touch it until I you know rehire yes\nHere's why how when you're when you need the money out of pocket to cover the whatever comes out of pocket on on the liver surgery a and you keep your health insurance in place and you've got this big juicy health savings account sitting there and and I use mutual funds\nIn it and let it grow over the next ten years be as big as a ... there's no downside of that whatever you don't need\nTransplant or liver trans whatever the processors they're whatever you don't need you can pull\nAnd just pay taxes on the no penalty should\nAdd sixty five and so\nUp and you just not going to see what comes over what you don't use you can use for overtime
