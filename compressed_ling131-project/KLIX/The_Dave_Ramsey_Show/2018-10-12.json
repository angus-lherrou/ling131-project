out Jason is in Burlington North Carolina Hi Jason welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHey Dave thank you for taking my call sure what's up I'm okay I just took a position at a at a new company\nI'm traveling a hundred and ten miles a day roundtrip commuting okay\nI'm I'm averaging about four hundred dollars a month and gas and I'm having a little bit of trouble trying to stomach moving to this new city because of the fact that it's the ... higher up there [noise]\nMy rent right now is only seven hundred dollars a month up there for all and that's on a two bedroom apartment a one bedroom apartment up there started to ride around thousands dollars [laughter]\nSo my question is which I Do about that where your dry out or [noise] um I'm driving to carry North Carolina [noise]\nI think you went shopping and one of the town and there are other town\nKerry Kerry is not that dramatic it's not thirty percent more expensive than Burlington I'm wrong something's wrong with your analysis here\nWell everything that I've done research wise I Can't find anything less than non ... dollars off for a one bedroom apartment [noise] and I've been digging for almost thirty days now okay ah trying to offset the cost of gas and be closer to my job\nYeah again that I don't I'm not I'm just not doing what you're doing but um but I\nDon't have the emotional ability to commute like that some people do but I Can't do it my commute seven minutes or so I Can't relate I'm the I'm\nSure I I just I really think that I mean I ...\nI have never seen anything that indicates that carry North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive than the rest of North Carolina I mean now maybe you need to move twenty miles from there instead of a hundred and ten miles from there to get something cheaper but\nI'm the numbers are giving me just don't work I I just ah truthfully I think you have it looked in the right places I think you're looking in certain neighborhoods or certain types of apartment complexes or whatever I'm\nProbably I mean I'm ... you may need to dial it out pan back a little bit and dial out just a little bit mileage wise from where you're looking to get you may be in the most expensive in the town I mean I can imagine that there is an area of carry this that expensive\nBut overall to carry North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive ranch than Burlington no that's just I just don't believe that um I can be wrong but I\nI've never seen the indicates that the one in ...\nAnd then the other end now you want to compare Manhattan to Abilene, Texas we can talk about this but that's a different issue a\nAnd that's not what you're proposing so I think you're um you're looking at different end of town of Kerry or you move a little bit further out\nOf carry but not a hundred and ten miles out of scary and we'll see where we are at that point um but I don't think you can um what your your numbers just don't work I thanks for the call Sharon is with us in West

something or non bucks or whatever is very inexpensive but you can watch it it's a great deal and we'd have to have you do that in a show be sure and check it out screaming I don't know what came up a sizable cash screaming we're going to get that a\nA a moral is with us from Battle Creek Michigan Hi Mara how are you\nI'm doing fine how can I don't know\nI was calling because I'm a full time job that I have about a year and black and all I'm part time waitress so my income is low and I happen to rack up quite a bit of credit card that over the past five years to turn a horrible spending habits\nAnd um lately I have done to hang out extra student loans to pay down on that\nCredit card debt and no longer a lower in church or school yeah so um altogether right now I got about fifty nine thousand dollars and that I'm forty seven and\nStudent about Seventeen I bet it in a car loan and then on top of the credit card so\nMhm [noise] so you have a question\nYes my question is I'm obviously should I keep going and you have to be okay no usually most of the credit cards\nOkay do you have any advice on my income about sixteen and twenty thousand dollars a per year with my major thing I'm just kind of on manageable right now\nMhm okay well you're first goal is of course to eat and keep the lights on your second goal was finished school when we finished school\nUm I Will be finishing next summer so about ... about Iraq\nIt's on your second goal was finished school when we finished school\n[noise] um I Will be finishing next summer\nSo about ... about a year long okay less than a year good so you can tread water till then an ad no more new debt that's a victory\nOkay and then the second thing would be to pay the actual payments on their credit card just minimum should and will call that a victory uh and then the third thing would be if you can actually start to make some progress paying down on those you don't you're not paying anything on the student loans while you're in school right\nRight when you look ahead of time when you have to pay off credit card now\nHow the U.S and it's a really really dumb idea of how you're making a mess and so have you cut up these credit cards um I Know you haven't caught them all up\n[laughter] yeah I don't use them I switched\nTo I don't care if you use them or not drop 'em up up I'll stop using them you have to stop this stuff radically and then the second thing I'm going to tell you as you probably need to work more or at a different place\nWhile it can't work more because of my school has drawn out of the fact is I'd probably make about kept the area where I'm located okay well\nMoney I another thousand dollars a month to change your life\nUh-huh so that's what I'm looking at is what what can I Do to create that just on the short term you only got about nine months to your income can change hopefully with a new um with a new job at a new career at that point\nUm but hang on until then and stop borrowing on student loans to pay off credit cards Naomi is in Seattle hey Naomi how are you\nHave an editor thank you sure how can I help\nUm so my husband runs a small business from home and it hasn't been bringing in as much as it used to the for the past like the cleaning and uh so I'm Wondering do we used our home to quit to get another job yes um\nWhat's wrong with his nose was dying\nA I'm not sure if you're in the heat we used to make a combined income at Fifteen thousand a month and now both of us with the business is down to five thousand dollar home mortgages large chunk of what we are now okay\nI'm a little bit confused 'cause you modeled everything together so how much of the Fifteen thousand was you\nI'm about [noise] three a month [noise] are you still doing that yeah okay so he was making twelve and now he is making seven yeah\nNo no no no no no I was making nothing by his business has almost disappeared yes you do know what's wrong with it what's wrong with it\nUm [noise] I don't know what I have to talk to and I feel like a chip competition and that he he feels like the market it's a lot of online staff of the market credited with what you think ... um\nSo what what does he do he sells clothes on line okay\nAnd in the last year will want so many people enter the clothing online business that weren't there before and I'm not only are up Ninety percent of his income\nThat's yeah that's it appears to break and ah and you get a job or needs to fix this business\nSelling the home and option 'cause\nNo because there's an fix the problem the homes not the problem the problem is is businesses failing\nOkay\nWe have to either fix that we have to identify the problems with his business and make the changes to fix the business or we have to get a job and close the business why can't I don't care if he starts selling something other than close yeah I'll be\nYou have to get a job and close the business\nWhy don't I don't care if he starts selling something other than closing obviously knew how to sell something on the Internet at one point he was doing very well so I can alert he's making a hundred and fifty a year yeah I think three years yeah that ain't bad so I mean he knows how to do something with marketing on the Internet some kind of digital marketing\nAnd uh it may be that the product line easy and other species in yacht invaded or maybe he's gotten lazy where there's a CEO when he's not handling is is digital marketing properly or I don't\nKnow I Can't tell what's going on but I can tell you this just isn't the hidden right why is it not so I'm going to give up my friend Henry Cloud wrote a book called necessary ending was\nGay and in that chapter in one chapter in that book he says that when you end something a relationship a job of business or whatever it is when you into something it's when it's bad and you have lost hope you have no reasonable logical reason to think it's going to get better\nAnd that's when you end it right may review if you're ... where the guy who's been drinking for Twenty years and he says he's gonna quit there is no logical reason to believe him a unless there's evidence to indicate he actually has quitting this time\nAnd you're you know you're married to a drunk you got to make a decision at that point right in your occasionally with this thing this thing's trending the wrong\nWay you have to give me a logical if I knew you and him when I look at this and say look at yourself in a marriage or is there a logical reasonable good reason says that\nWe can turn this thing around if we turn these three knobs and get this business working [noise]\nAnd then we have to change the business or something entirely different\n[noise] or they get a job this is not\nThanks for

broken down\nUm and I'm just wondering\nMoney has been one of my biggest ... here you have some ... situation again like\nBike lanes are financially stable or baby always struggle\nI'm currently working to restaurant jobs a lot of them just caught by ship or any other one I don't make tips has a server right I'm just wondering I'm twenty three year old ... at this point in life I don't really

and when did you leave your parents from\nBoth have been living a lap and as a an eye on for about a year and a half but I moved to BC and once I got to be see I was in a car accident mhm but my money that I had ... or ... ah my vehicle\nVehicle mhm and then it was great in the middle of summer\nAnd I wasn't able to secure work until shortly April May be on later I was living in a shelter mhm and now recently the shelter I extend my stay like it's been alive mhm but um where is home yeah I I parked by the ocean and I don't know\nWhere where do your parents live\nAh my mom was about three hours away but she has a boyfriend going through town care of me being there it's really a [noise] it's it's very tough\nTough\nLiving in a reason to believe that a ... a health issues right you know living in your car is tough they don't have another bed well I mean you don't pick up much space on your day with him and be like a smaller V.\n\nYou know it's interesting [noise] um and informative to all of us to stop and think about something hope\nCauses you to be able to move the needle causes you to be able to move forward when you think the light at the end of the ... at the end of this\nAble to move the needle causes you to be able to move forward when you think the light at the end of the ... at the end of this one was an oncoming train your paralyzed or stop your overwhelm your frozen you get paralysis or the analysis that hopelessness when you think the light and the tunnel is the way out of your trap\nThen you run to the light but if the train is coming at you and run to that obviously right\nAnd and what's the difference in those two events it both light both a tunnel both the situation on is you believe that if you run about you're going to get out one of you believe you run a lot you're going to get killed right I mean show that's helping hopelessness\nAnd all of us me included face that or have faced that at times in our lives and it's amazing to me the power of our brain and our spirit that God gives us\nTo do things that are way beyond what we thought we could do once we believe that are possible\nThat's called hope\nAnd so when I show you what you you know you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you got thirty thousand dollars in debt you feel stuck but gosh if we did that at a thousand dollars a month you're going to be out of debt and my gosh and a thousand dollars a month out of a hundred thousand is nothing I swam a thousand dollars a year\nYou're going to be out of debt and a little over two years and you suddenly go oh I see it ...\nIt's the same situation you were in but now you can see it you see what I'm Talking about and once you can see it that's called hope I can see my\nWay out one of the things is steals your hope is when you have lost your perspective perspective is of course your point of view the way you're seeing things it's happened to me it's happened to you I remember one time\nOne of my daughters when she was in high school\nCertain boy did not call it a certain time that he was supposed to call and she was a very upset like the world is coming to an\nAnd her mom and I are trying to quit laughing so we can walk in and\nComfort her [laughter] now why are we standing in the hall outside her bedroom laughing and why is she in their hopeless well we've got perspective we see things that she doesn't see because we've been places she hasn't been have experiences that she doesn't have right\nSo ours we bend to our twenty year class reunion we know she'll be glad he didn't call [laughter]\nThat's what we're giggling about standing and All right so we have perspective and so we you know when you don't have ... when you cannot see the other side you're standing in poop up to your knees but you can't see the other side of it\nThen you know it's not fertilizer at that point it's just poop but when you can see the other side of it then it's fertilizer and it it's going to grow some things in your future\nYou know when you're walking through garbage in other words you're going to you ... there's some good is going to come out of the garbage that you're in but but when it gets right down on you and your vision is just the end of your nose and not the end of your life\nWhen you look out ten years you see stuff different than when you look out ten seconds\nThe young man I was just talking to him and folks that have dealt with and homeless situation says one of the problem was the the desperation just to eat and not be cold causes you to have ten second increments of thought instead of ten year increments just thought ... I can stand back from that sitting here warm and with a full belly\nInstead of ten year increments just thought gee I can stand back from that sitting here warm and with a full belly\nIn my studio several thousand miles away and look at him and go to just go work more but he can't see you couldn't see that you don't care that you wouldn't get in it it's like go go go deliver pizzas go bowl leaves go walk dogs go\nShovel something somewhere you know go do something do you know work all the time because you knew that money come from work is where it comes from I Can't get an of our original than work someplace else work more work all the time\nBut but because I've done that kind of stuff and I'm the other side of it and I've seen what it does now when we were going broke two babies in life the houses in foreclosure were that close to almost ourselves\nSo how we get out of it ... off\nAnd well you know you can't work your way out everything that I didn't work my way out are bankrupt but I didn't lose the house\n\nAnd if I had lost the house on a pound someplace living out of work my way into their own apartment and we lived in that well you know and and it's not that I'm Better is not that I'm smarter only\nThing is just perspective as like I didn't grow up rich but had a friend that grew up rich\nAnd because he grew up in a wealthy home he had the perception that everything was going to work out 'cause it it always worked out and I had the perspective that ain't gonna work out [laughter]\nIt's going to be awful and ... because he thought everything was always going to work out you know it all worked out a lot because I didn't think it was going to work out sometimes it didn't work\nOut you say you set yourself in these tracks in these robots with this thing but when you can see the other side of it it's easy to work through it it's when you can't see the other side of\nIt that you don't want to work there because you don't believe it's going to work that's called hopelessness the situation is exactly the same the only difference is your perspective as I'm challenging some of your another think you're stuck you think you're stuck\nIn a career you think you're stuck in this marriage it's bad it's always going to be that way you think you're stuck with whatever behavior you're stuck with you think you're stuck with your money you think you're stuck in that you're not stuck\nYou're not stuck life is not a snapshot it's a film strip you're going to turn the page and something else is going to happen better or worse tomorrow is not going to stay the same you are not stuck\nSo look the other side of it look out there five years look out there three years look out their ten months and say one of I got to do what's got to be true that's not true right now for me to never be here again that's a question he was asking but he was having\nTrouble emotionally buying it and I don't think I helped him I was kinda bother me that's why I Want to talk about a minute I'm not sure he heard me but if I woke up in his shoes tomorrow if you took my wallet away where everything I have been through and I have no identity\nNo I ... you know my driver's license was gone I didn't have a car and you just dumped me on the street I wouldn't be there long because I don't believe that about me and my future\nAnd I know if I Do this this and this that I'll be out and I work my way right out of it I don't I don't know how long it'll take but I Would get there I push my way through it and um and I\nHaven't always been that way there's been times that I was so scared so beat up and so hopeless that I couldn't breathe and I couldn't see what I'm Talking about here is that is is vision site that gives you hope when you lose your\nThe other side of it than than there is no you know the the it's hard to take action it\nIt's hard to fix it and the problem is there's not a magic wand there is a series of things you got to do a series of steps you've got to take to become unstuck wherever it is you are stuck wherever it is I'm stuck\nI think that guy's got to be okay I\nReally do I think he's going to be better off than he thinks he's going to be I think it's going to work out great book to read if you already called pizza tiger the guy that started um dominos pizza Monaghan\nCame out of the army made some bad mistakes and ended up living in a homeless shelter\n\nAnd they ended up owning dominos pizza\nSo it's going to be All right\nIt can be you can choose for it to be All right\nIs not positive thinking and it's not easy\nAnd it's one reason I read biographies of successful people\nAs he lets me know that they went through crap and they made it [noise]\nThat's where I'm you know that's where you are\nTheme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner needing to
