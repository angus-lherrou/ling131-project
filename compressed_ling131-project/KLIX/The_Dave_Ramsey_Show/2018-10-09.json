completely to rewrite now mhm but I I decided to hop on a credit card or a little bit ago about ... million mark ago are going to her [laughter]\nShow we are huge fans\nBelieve we can do something indoor I go home turn into millionaires the original book\nStarted everybody talking about those back in the early Nineteen nineties when I wrote\nMy first book in financial piece came out as a book called the millionaire next door but Dr Tom Stanley changed the way everyone thought about millionaires I got to know about your family a little bit a while he was living and I've gotten into his daughter since then and\nI'm big fans of each of there and we're big fans of course of anyone who's in this millionaire space doing anything\nAnd as you guys know Chris Hogan has a million or a book coming out in January but Sarah so law is with us a\nTom Standage daughter and a ... this was the first time we've ever talked on the airwaves topped off the air and she has a new book coming out of being blown with some of her dad's original research so I said how\nI'm good how are you in for having me on well I'm honored the new book is called the next millionaire next door in during strategies for building wealth and it it's out this week right\nThat's right yeah and um it was a labor was acting out without my father but you know it out in the valley I thought it\nYou know if you guys didn't know her her dad passed in a car wreck or four years ago is now\nYeah it was a dollar Fifteen right now that\nI'm thinking I remembered that are about there and I'm a we had to have him on several times over the years as we discuss this whole subject to millionaires and although some of the mythology litters around millionaires so uh you use some of the research from your dad's in Europe a professional researcher to like he was and\nI put this together tell me about the background on that part of it what does this or did you do and more of it was combined the what he had done\nYet I think that the trade had we had worked together really on the initial fair day for the buck [noise] um you know really started back in two thousand child thinking about the ... anniversary of the nightmare and act like that it came out in the nineties and and work together on kind of what books should include and got\nTo the point when we were just about to send out a survey on she fan or a signing American and who were killed by by a drunk driver\nAnd and so really he wasn't able to either data that came back and compare it to love affair and Nineteen Ninety six and and be on um so that's kind of where I took out a check on the product and and kept going with it\nSure is an industrial psychologist and president of data points that our research and technology company that studies wealth accumulation and build students to help and you guys have to check this out its um data points dot com\nHas all the stuff on her research as well which you can get the new book the next millionaire next door in during strategies for building wealth at any major bookstore so the new data that you guys got as you put this back together on the anniversary and\nThe continued research what was there anything that just shocked to win the findings where you should go out and see that when Germany\n[noise] yet you know we looked a lot at um some of the mistakes organized kind of behaviors that millionaire maker related to investing and I think what was causing as you know just like any of us that are trying to do the right thing um millionaires make mistakes from way too and\nSo a lot of that sort of behavior and then the the the role that they make related to him I think that was the guy thing\nAnd then I think I think the issue is that why hasn't things in terms of the kinds of or that or the amount that they're spending on things like a furniture and clothing and things like that that some of the things that are surprising that were sort of similar time\nYeah I was speaking in a church a couple of days ago and I told them one of the uh\nKeep two inch that I've seen over twenty five years of doing this one of the things you have to do if you want to build wealth as you have to be careful who you hang around with because you become who you are running around with and I see on the back of your book understanding how those around you influence your financial by ... what did you find\nThat yeah absolutely I think that again the it's very clear from the work that we've done but with ... and and the every every day folks like I like that they are um that that that\nSocial and defense that not caring about what other driving and buying and wearing them really key factor in building while you know it's related in that were regardless of how old you are how much you make\n'em and I think you know now with technology it's really hard to ignore by what other people are doing research for media and so forth but it continues to be there are just not hearing about what other people and you know if if it was one of the week though\nYou know I think in my case I was I was a unique because one of the benefits are going broke like I did in my twenties ... violently was I Know at\nPoint I just reached all I wanted to do survive and thrive\nAnd reach a point I just don't care what people think I still don't care what people think and I think that was a big contributor to me a personal you'll be able to to build wealth again\nAfter going bankrupt but I see it with other people as when you don't care what other people think about what you drive where you live what closure where when you've been on vacation you're not trying to keep up with other people's Facebook version of themselves then you've got the ability to win\nAbsolutely and I think like just like he said I think that that on Facebook there's a lot there's a lot different rights and so now that I live two things keep in mind but we definitely see that in the research\nShe'll gaining knowledge and composer to invest and grow well that is a great word composer to grow what do you mean by that\n[noise] but you know when you say that related to making them when it comes to mind is that it really you know you could apply to any kind of major financial decision making and you kind of comic house before making a decision so I Know the example we get sometimes they're\nJust going to rain but not a great time to go out and look for in your car because you're not if you're in an emotional state where\nYou are so excited about the new income level that you have all of a sudden your decision making as well so he can stay home and come as\nA matter what the financial with their hands are then you have a better chance of making the right one\nAnd I often hear ah we've got a one of the rings personality as a career show on you know choosing a career and there's all this I'm a stuff about following your passion out there but you guys have you found yet again in this new set of data\nThe idea that lifestyle related freedom does not equate to less income or less wells that actually which to greater engagement greater will the new\nRelated freedom does not equate to less income or less welded actually which to greater and greater well then you're\nNot you know I think that's right I think that you know understanding that against your accent or or your entrance let's say for your career athlete grounded in reality\nAnd I think that that's something that you know a lot of people don't want to hear but it is true though um if you had an accident or the art and that's really where ... year career to go I'm going to take a reality that I mean certain things are going to be satisfied\nThat kind of again a lot of I don't want to hear but um we can have a happy here and do well\nAnd there's a price to be paid to build wealth and it's worth the price and nobody does that accidentally they'll do it with a plan\nI lately yeah that that's one of the things that we keep hearing over and over again and again we're talking about millionaires on their way to becoming an air that I spent ... and and looking at your goals and monitoring what's going on and you're alive or not\nYou know church in your head and and um that that relate to build him up as a time at it by a court thing I'd do it while\nWe're talking with Dr search Stanley follow all of 'em ... my mother's side correctly\nOr at the la la la la la la la yeah I'd say\n... told me about one on there and a strong mess it up there I'm so sorry\nFor us and a daughter of Dr Tom Stanley a comic work called the millionaire next door a lot of you rented if you ... and you need to reach his new book that she did combined with her dad's research project that they were working on together when he passed away the new book is called the ... million or next door it is now\nOut and you need to read it or\nYou know we've got a book out called a ... called everyday millionaire and let me start if you want to be a millionaire there's not one book you read all of them and you learn from everyone over there is no competition that's where we answer on we've

said look uh\nWhat's your household income Seventy five to do it and you make thirty are you oh thirty I'm sure your thirty oh yeah oh yeah were you a quick you're going to pay it off\nI mean if I put my to some bomb like that and maybe a maybe a\nMore like a year yeah you're single right yeah okay\n...\nThank you for joining us on the Jesus is with us in\nLos Angeles times Jean how are you\nThan I deserve what's\nFall just getting a different background and he showed me [laughter] so um I graduated high school a few years ago and I had to go to community college biology community college um I work I went to a work [laughter]\nUm I did about like thirty hours a week for the community college and it wasn't an issue and now I transferred to a university I mean my first\nSemester right now I'm ... and ... are you um you know it's a little bit harder so my question is if you think I should quit my job and focus more on school for the last two years or do you think I should just I'm just\nTrying hardest and edge to both\nUh-huh what are you studying accounting\nOkay I've got a finance degree and I worked forty to sixty hours a week while I went to school and for years and at the university level so I'm a it's doable 'em me are you know your two and a lot of studying and not a lot of partying for sure um the um how are you paying for school\nUm I go to I get grants and now so I'm just a money for work okay so you're you're not going into debt no yellow okay so if you quit work how would you pay for school\nI had a money saved up a working for the past year I don't mind my ankle\nProbably like call of mhm\nMhm oh you left me a year year and a half no I think I keep working okay\nIf it ... last year if it costs you half a point when your grade point average um yeah I heard about it like cheap yeah yeah I graduated with a tuna and seven\n\nI missed it as a magnetic by I'm just making about three one of his stuff is Thirty years later but [laughter] but you know what I have never had a single caller asked my GPA before they asked my advice [laughter] and I actually I've never gone on a job interview where they asked my GPA in my entire life ever\nIn if you're willing to go to work for one of the top accounting firms in the entire world they might ask your GPA and you might actually be in competition or GPA might actually matter\nOn your very first job but after that it won't um\nAnd it has a whole lot more to do with did you learn how to do accounting than what your GPA is and will you work hard while you're at work and that kind of stuff and so what are you doing for work right now\nUh I work at a bank mhm okay good yeah\nOK poke around in the accounting field and see if you can get on with one of them making about the same kind of money one that might actually be a four year degree\nYeah that's a big into\nKnow it wouldn't hurt anything to ask around and see if you can make a job James and make about the same money and get free tuition or something that'd be very cool on top of it but\nI'm you know you're not working a hundred hours a week working thirty hours a week twenty hours a week you can do this it's very doable uh most people work when they're in school it's not a\nUh when I when I Do and I was in a I was just in San Francisco this week and we're doing event we sit right of course all going to ask the audience or ... or a thousand people there how many of your work when you were in college I mean it's like Ninety percent of the audience raise their hand now maybe the people that didn't work when they're in college and listen to my show I don't know but\nIt appears that most people work when they're in college that's what it looks like and so um I I think if I'm here I'm going to continue that route good question thank you for joining us a ... is with us in Houston Hi Lucia how are you\nHow I Am doing well thank you for asking um I like soccer team and my husband and I were a baby step to getting out of that and now we are and what you call they bring the on them for a down payment on or how much the same mashed and I think that we're looking right now at about\nUm [noise] the first thing about them like how frequent down here in our household income before I'm On the fact is is about one twenty five I'm after about Mrs back then it's about one thirty two and so I'm trying to make sure that everything about like how much how I\nFound that we are understanding the um\n[noise] I I I think you recommend and a fourth of your take home pay exactly a okay perfect and so I wanted to make sure that like right now where I prayed with a million mortgage calculators and right now we're kind of had a funny one from Jerry I'm I'm right in terms of\nUm in terms of like a reasonable comfortable amount and I said I Know that that's a big number yes they're feeling you know it was a big number\nIt's a lot better when you're paying now but if that's what I saw a fourth of your take home pay or less and your debt free with your emergency phone and blows\nYou have the mouth spread to prosper if you continue to budget and stay on track but again that's not what you should do that's the most you should do so you can do less if you want to\n'em or you could put on a shorter term if you want to and you know I'm all by less house at Twenty one hundred and paid off in ten years there's nothing\nIt on five years I don't care I mean you can do a lot of stuff but the most I Would ever tell you to do and I I don't even do that 'cause I don't borrow money at all for anything ever is a Fifteen year fixed rate where the payment is no more than a fourth of your take home pay\n... is one of those in Dallas Hi Luke welcome to the day Ramsey show\n[laughter] Hi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nSo um my wife and I have been listening to you for many years actually it my dad got me listen to you and I was a young kid and um stupidly I did not take her by her and I have student loans and um we are considering taking a cash out refinance house\nTo knock out the high interest you know orange and then start paying the debt off on the house because it that much lower interest rate\nAnd how much they want to do ... do you have [laughter] I'm right at forty eight thousand trying and what's your household into\nActually between takeover forty to sixty so I own my own business so last year we did sixty five this year we're looking at probably doing I'm probably going to bring home closer to forty two\nOkay I I don't know what you've been listening to on the show but in a twenty six years I've never told someone to do a refinance cash to take care of to pay off their debt ever except to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure and you're facing neither ... and so\nOn no I've never told anybody do that\nOkay and the reason is very simple you make enough money to pay this debt\nUm you gotta work like a maniac and you're gonna have to have no life\nBut then you're going to be dead free accept your house and then you can work on paying off your house I'm from there and of course start working on their retirement and the other baby steps that we won't be ready for that you can't borrow your way out of debt\nAnd on and if you pay this off within two years the interest rate on this becomes ... medically irrelevant\nWhich also fast snack or keep them for Thirty years it's a two year thing and and really is not forty eight thousand for two years like twenty thousand for two years because halfway through you're going to be halfway through and and so yeah you guys need to get on a budget really really tight budget\nVery careful or ... cut your lifestyle to nothing do everything you can all your business to increase your income because you need to clean up a student loan debt I agree with you on that part but no I don't I don't tell people to borrow to get out of debt you can't buy your way out of bed and worked to get your way out of a whole\nDigging out of a whole is a an oxymoron statement that we all might wish I'm digging out of how well you're not digging out of hope you dig out the bottom of the hole gets deeper she can't dig out of all you have to fill in the hall I get to climb out of the whole maybe\nBut you don't dig out of a home unless you dig into China to work so no you can't\nYou can't you can't borrow your way out of that and that's the same exact situation so you got to stop that means you have to buy ...\nEver have a fish is that I ... [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just getting rid of it though they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat\nAnd the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally and forever is with time share exit Jane them officers all around the country\nYou know David it's amazing when you go to this class you it's a big support group that I think everybody\nReally needs to be a part of and because we we lived in a very high end area and it was just amazing how much that everybody had and were like wow like for you know this is a big support group and you know this is a great way let's start with the baby steps mhm\nAnd we did that we had a bunch of savings saved up and we used a lot of that just Kickstarter\n... intensity and it really helps how much are we had about ten thousand and so\nThat was hard for a nerd it was it was like a checkout only not necessarily to\n...\nTakes your breath away so Veronica spend or go to class you go to class but then you get in there and there had to be a moment where you go oh\nSure I like this well it wasn't so much that I didn't like it I just I felt like I Need and like I said strategies to help me 'cause I\nI didn't want to be in that either and I just felt like there is just a huge cloud over as all the time and what was your biggest takeaway then where you went aha I see that now everything about it was awesome honestly and I think it was realizing our roles\nAnd I and my pin theme dinner that he is and then me and just coming to my senses and saying you know is is is this material things something that I really need to have\nUsing the ... system really helped me\nBudget and you know this is the amount of money we need to pay for our groceries and says you know this is how much we we can get in the church and this is how much we can give people for gifts and what not and so I just needed to lay out and once we implemented those steps I you know we're just with\nA little bit like Rachel, Rachel gracious little budget is permission to spend\nI Love your daughter permission to spend okay yeah yeah and that's exactly what it is I I there is sometimes when I just felt like we didn't have any money that remind said I had to give myself was okay we don't have money for this but you know it's there and\nWe want it to ... you know and I'm In control their budget\nBut once I started I let it control me I don't know very very good okay so we know uncle was a cheerleader window your brother was a cheerleader and you had the community that you got plugged into richer leaders who else was your biggest cheerleader I think\nAnd uh I mean we're really close to our family and my family\nInto richer leaders who else was your biggest cheerleader I think\nAnd uh I mean we're really close to our family and my family they're all of\nAre very supportive of us when we come from five brothers are but not by birth [laughter] five kids from each family certainty rather than she fit there so we have it come from a big family ... and they were all supportive of us really in our friends and as well so\nVery true so what do you tell people to key to getting out of debt is now that you've done it\nI think the key thing David is being on the same page and you know communication is key and you know we went to the money in marriage last week and we were listening to a lot of the other couples mhm and none of\nGone through the financial peace but I had gone through a lot of seminars mhm and I think if they had gone through a seminar or the financial peace university they would really get on the same page and it would just really explode once they get through that in ... and follow the ... the steps yeah\nAnd just you know writing down our goals is really important for us to do and what we had that you know we were married goal driven and especially being in sales you got to be the guy in ... you know we have that target and we wanted to hit it and said just staying focused and dedicated and discipline\nAnd really really helped us now and\nWhile they're on you guys from very proud of you very well on your show a couple a lesson right joy that marriage money thing or if but virtually stand up comedy goes are both a book about a ... yeah they really are funny and they're both funny on the green room to by the way that I mean it's the same thing so\nWell done well but we

than I deserve what's up\nI'm dating sick and I've been on about twenty thousand dollars on my grandmother and I I was just curious I think I should I put it into an upgrade my house or if I should just\nPut it all down on my mortgage I kind of hit some calculator on line and it's about like I had a ... yeah I Do want to make sure that on a spending a little bit of that money\nWell I just want to watch your home worth about ... what do you do on it I think one of the homes on your street so far on average\nI added [laughter] Hi okay All right so you're right it's a barely at the top edge of the market right hey riots here\nWho yours is yours is not like double the average house on the street but it's one of the nicest ones\nI Want\nTo LA and it's worth two Seventy the average house on your street is two fifty five is the information you gave me is that right yeah that that puts you at a little bit nicer than the average house is that right yeah okay that's all I'm Talking about ... if you're going to spend some more money on how much more money or you're going to spend on the house\nOne hundred percent satisfaction guarantee that means even if you missed measure or you pick the wrong\nRemake your blinds for free or you get free samples free shipping and with the new promos they run every month\nYou'll save even more years to ... to get the best deal and it was in Georgia so tomorrow's we're not on baby steps rebate you know what that means is that they are debt free except their whole lives saved up their emergency fund a three to six months\nNow what that means is that they are dead free except their home life saved up their emergency fund up three to six months of expenses and three beam means beyond that they're saving for the down payment on our house\nWe want to take her two young children to Disney World you should we're currently saving to build our on a new home on property we bought in cash\nAlready we can cash flow the trip by not saving for the house for one month about three thousand dollars I feel guilty for both not taking a family vacation and for not\nSaving money where's the balance you you're guilty a lot aren't you I mean you're stuck 'cause you're just going to be guilty you're guilty if you go to Disney and you're going to be guilty if you don't you know what I Do I'll be happy for that either one going to be guilty either way it's your money it's your choice you're smart either way you're out of debt you have your emergency fund\nAnd you're saving up for expenditures one of the expenditures as you want to build a house for cash that some awesome go second one is you want to spend one month of that money and go to Disney about three thousand bucks a either one is wonderful you should not feel guilty\nEither way but I'll tell you what I Would I'd go to Disney yellow kids you part is perfect age for that\nUm if he is something you obviously do want to do something they want to do um it's not something I Want to do but you but it's fine I mean Rachel cruise loves Disney she just took her little baby down there they had a wonderful time\nNot sure how ready time her husband had but they had a great time and I'm now a but but I mean if it's what you want to do you've saved up the money you're not going into that you're not getting out of debt and going on vacation you're out of that you have your emergency fund this is the point in the baby steps where you enjoy some\nOf the money and I don't suggest consuming all of it and hitting no long term goals but I think if you don't consume some of it and only hit long term goals then you're not\nEnjoying your life you live like no one else so that later you can live and give like no one else during the first three baby steps you're extremely intense you don't do anything except beans and rice rice and beans till you're ... out of that and have\nYour emergency fund in place then you let your foot off the accelerator some to where you can do baby steps for five and six and purchases are in there all at the same time\nMaybe step for Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement meanwhile\nYou start putting some pretty good college and five and six years when you find extra money pay off the house early in that sense what you're working towards the middle of all of that we don't know ten years and never go on vacation that's when you go on vacation and we don't know ten years and never upgrade the couch that as springs sticking out of it that's when you upgrade the couch you just pay cash\nFor this stuff and you realize that every time we consume something in slows down our long term wealth building but the purpose of long term wealth building has to be able to consume\nAnd to be able to give\nMoney piled up just for pollen ... having a pile of money sake is not worth anything is only worth something when it does something for your family or you're able to do something for others that's all it's good for Jay is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Jay welcome to the day Ramsey show\nThey have a ... and you for taking my call first time caller sure I'm about two years ago I began a commercial helicopter training and I highly or received like we're so ...\nUm however I unfortunately I mean uh the by eighty hours or more training as I discovered ... highly regulated by insurance and in order to become a share of NATO or two hundred hours and I'm trying to\nFigure out how to pay for eighty hours and be ready to go in the upcoming season I'm as a commercial up as a\nIt has eighty hours and be ready to go after the upcoming season I'm as a commercial up about\n... is there any way you can do it as a co pilot you know the hours\nYou know I I ... a a a a job opportunity out but at the single pilot\nNot at that moment you just said the wrong thing you should do the job opportunity there's only one person in Florida and you know ... what's wrong\nWell I I didn't tell you another thing or two days I I work at a firefighter so that's my primary um income source there has kind of like a secondary thing that I kinda went off in bed and that's um\nThat's kinda why I'm I'm kinda limited as far as ah the jobs that I can take\nThe helicopter ... pounds not make more than ...\nI Know I Believe it or not firefighters are definitely make life\nOkay so you're not planning on quitting the firefighting degree or a career you're going to continue that and part time helicopter pilot\nYes yes that's that's what I Want to do [noise] okay um\nAnd you show U.S forces you to stay in that particular area and it forces you to work in their regular schedule that you can control and so it does limit the number of jobs available which means that having your helicopter pilots life things has a very limited\nValue yeah kind of\nValue personally it's not that valuable to you because of the way you're going to utilize it so I mean you have to just cash flow this is like a sign of hobby you're getting paid for you're going to make some money but if you're not going to make enough money to even justify the expense you've gone too\nYeah so yeah I just I feel I'm too far into it to just\nSuggesting you quit but there's just no way in the scenario you've laid out here that it makes sense to do anything except just slow down and go I'm just gonna take me a little time because I got a cash flow this and I got to find the time to do the hours\nRight they said they'll rush to get the job done me up and they'll charge not worth that much there at the end of the pay that much either\nThat's what I mean they're not worth that last compared to what you're paying you're not even gonna make back you're eighty hours worth of training in the first year\nNo you're right\nNow so not to mention all the money you've already put on it so um what I Want to do is look for a place\nI mean you've got connections in the fire department or the lifelike guys or something that you can get some hours in the coal policy can get some takeoffs and landings and getting all that counts archery\nForks and those are more complex aircraft and I'm I'm currently find a lot of ... and both have prayer craft gotcha not even turbine yet but um\nI mean I Am even reached out to people that own their own aircraft and and the and offered to pay for fuel and things like that to kinda do get those are ... and unfortunately a lot a lot of those guys are very busy so I can get our air and our there but nothing new Eric Conn as\nTo who you're going to end up paying for these our deserts eighty hours cost\nWell considering some of the hour and a source of a you know on the cheap you can get some at\nFifty or three hundred five hundred it all depends on the aircraft and all that kind of a deal you can get you know so\nBecause you know you might have twenty thirty thousand bucks yeah pretty much already my chair and you don't have that lying around obviously negative negative on just take your time and\nFlow it because you you now have as we continue the conversation you've even narrowed your opportunities down further because you're in an entry level um the simpler versions of helicopters not all of them which is limited
