are not bankrupt the ball and they're going to come find you it's just sitting there are piling up we need to find it but you don't have a single piece of information on those loans\nSo my husband's

five\nOr opening up a couple of lines for that right now Heather is in the lobby of Ramsey solutions from Spokane, Washington where the question I Heather\nHi Dan how are you better than I deserve what's up and I just finished baby step three and now I'm working on baby steps three ... saving for a house got your emergency fund for ... yeah and I wanted to know how long is too long in baby step three being the fly she lives on today to step foot\nWas not a magic cancer of the concept or the other critical thinking skills for the answer is simply this\nIf you stay there so long that you don't save for retirement you screwed up your retirement Mm right yeah or\nIf you don't stay there long enough then you don't have a good solid down payment and you'll end up with other problems on the mortgage so it's a it's the pull between those two things and most people that means you know three years four years something like that um\nBut if you're if you're a fifty nine it might not be that long or you're not fifty nine now how old are you and twenty eight on friday okay cool and so I mean if you stayed out for four years and never started any retirement until thirty two but you had a really juicy down payment on a\nHouse and got ... ... you know how to plan to pay it off in a few years because of that you're you're you're still going to retire multi millionaire you know if you do that at it but if you stayed out for Twenty years been called that baby steps ... S C I kind of how you think through it from a critical thinking skills standpoint so how long were you thinking of\nWell I just started in June and I'm hoping to have it done in two years\nOkay and so the thirty years' old your your game own on retirement taking on a Fifteen year mortgage by forty five the mortgage is paid for if not sooner and you will have saved\nThirty five years at Fifteen Percent of your income which unless you just don't work\nIs going to make you a millionaire multimillionaire usually I'm doing this so you're in a safe zone there but that's how you make the decision more importantly than they Ramsey says never go more than three years that's not how it works it's just you're pulling those two things are pulling at each other\nOr because you're not saving for retirement the longer you go that's all it is hey thanks for stopping by things stay open phones at triple eight eight to five five to to find Julian is in New York City Hi Julian how real\nHigh ... can you hear me okay I can how can I help\nThank you very much for taking my call so I'm In I'm a bit of a unique\nPosition I'm I'm twenty four next year I'm going to medical school and uh I was I'm very very lucky and very appreciative uh I'm not going to have any pets after graduating medical school but rather than the included I had to specialize\nUm and uh what do you get a fellow that up or what\nUm uh yeah I I'm not saying that's what I Want to do yet I Know I'm I'm asking how you did that oh oh um yeah so so if they get from my father and my grandparents um wow I Am very guy who showed up yeah\nGood now yeah you should be that's amazing wonderful so\nUm yeah so when when I was Twenty one uh I was given a essentially control this funny 'cause it under\nWonderful so\nUm yeah so when when I was Twenty one uh I was given a essentially controlled is funny 'cause it's under my name I'm but I'm Sorry I Apologize I'm\nJoe I'm a yeah I was I was getting control this money and uh I've been given a very good financial advice from my father who's helping me a manage it but\nUm because it's under my name and he he's actually in the rain stopped me or I Would like it a second opinion as to what to do with this money I can give it a little bit of\nMoney for a living expenses um and I said that about five thousand dollars from some small side jobs at hospitals but I Want to know how to capitalize on this and how to set myself up as best as I can for after medical school\nWell the thing I Would be most concerned about is that the money is available and enough to get through through medical school\nUm it it definitely is um about one third of it is invested very securely and two thirds of it I have in savings or minutes two thirds we were discussing putting into at AT T bill on three months renewal basis until I needed to take them out that way my tuition and then I Would just reinvest the rest\nUm well I probably would not do that\nAnd the only reason is is that the bills\nBasically or bonds and a bond interest rates are yields a go the bond values writer go down as interest rates go up and we are in an increasing in the interest rate environment so if you put a hundred thousand dollars in T. bills I could turn into Ninety pretty quick\nAs interest rates increase so that's not a very safe investment in the environment that we're in right now um\nBut if you wanted to have some portion of the money invested I probably would go to something like gross\nIncome type funds but I'm okay if there's enough there to do simple division and it doesn't have to really earn anything if you want to keep it all very very safe because that would be okay with me because the most important thing is for you to be able to graduate with zero debt\nAnd if you screw around with his money in some way and it loses value and you're not able to do that\nThen the whole you know is like a\n... we were concentrating on the wrong thing And Julian is the right thing to concentrate on Julian ... debt free graduation\nIs the most important part of this math equation not what this money is paying a it'd be nice to be a little bit sophisticated about it but if you get caught up in some kind of a sophisticated process and you end up losing money trying to trying to just get a little bit more on\nThis lump sum a you've defeated you're on purpose you shot yourself in the foot so to speak so um that's the process you're looking at I'm going to keep it pretty safe uh\nIf you want to go toward something that's fine but I wouldn't use bonds for anything right now a burst possible play Kimberly is in Pensacola Hi Kimberley how are you\nSaying I'm doing great thank you so much for taking my call sure I I just wanted to thank you for all you do and they think temporary Walmart ... it's been seven years inside than I have paid off that I'm following their plans to go for that\nI'm On the day is I'm not in our little concerned about our parents hunting you found that by somehow they could got them\nI'm not there for the north Carolina and they are within a flooded area of hard power in the area and um every time the hurricanes come ... um they they experienced some partying it on their on their property at their home as well as my dad\nAnd Tom their hurricane come through um they they experience so far they can get on the on their property at home\nAs well as my dad is now and we were to monitor and what you are and as far as they should they sell it um they have no doubt that they do have um some savings and my mom has a ticket for one\n... ... often does this property blood\nWell in Ninety nine and it flooded and it was it got like forty entered into health and I think about ten feet in his shop\nAnd then two years ago um it got that job I think about three feet or so and it almost felt like about ... from getting in the house again\nAnd I'm so ... there's only been two major flood but um but they're in their sixties and it\nIt's very emotional for them at any town a form ambitious if it's passed down we actually packed the or I didn't I was able to help them out of eight but I packed up all their belongings and let them\nPut them away and you know because they were afraid that I\nWas living there has become more painful than not living there [noise] but those are the fear of rising water for fear is not founded maybe once in Twenty years is not that bad but bottom line is is\nThat it was developed a phobia for them and they're not\nLiving their service on living there why wouldn't they move right I don't know I mean the actual threat a blood strictly with what you've given me I wouldn't be concerned about what they're absolutely panicking every time the weather person comes also draining just trying to live\nIt's more of an emotional decision to all\nMoving\nYou've heard me talk about our deep there for years and how it's only a matter\nOf time before you become a victim but I run across some numbers that even surprised me and shows the real nightmare of the people go through when they become a victim of the sixteen million victims of identity the last year yes sixteen million twenty six percent of them have to borrow\nI worked for the NFL players for Twenty years off and on\nAnd um I Know this is a a a world class one half of one percent athlete um\nBut they are twenty two guests there and the rest of their life skills are not developed at the level that they're football skills are developed men are the size of a key uh yeah it does that mean that their life skills have developed at the same level and\nYou know so it's it's kind of weird I told somebody during one of these rookie camps as like you're looking at this guy the size of a key but when you look in his eyes you see a Thirteen year old yes um\nBecause he still is football skills are are the best on the planet\nYeah I'm In his physical acumen his physical uh\nIQ the things you can do this body in mid error or it's just circus like it's amazing what those guys can do it but what happens is when you watch that skill level especially if you're just watching on TV you think of that guy as you know a forty year old who's a mature developed a\nAs you know strong marriage has all these other things and these guys are college kids or how they were in college last week yeah you know there's twenty minutes ago and I'm even a player that's been in the league three years yeah they're still young and they're still I'm twenty five years old or either\nAnd so it's a it's an interesting in the same thing happens with music people when they get a success level earlier anything where your spotlight and you get a success level and your skill is world class in that\nThing does not mean you have everything else together yeah yeah and that is true with the you know teenagers in general is one of the things we do this under one or two boxing is they can start to develop some of those skills you know running a business\nYeah they and that's absolutely right you know you say this all the time when in America knows he knows you for saying this but the NFL stands for not\nFor a long and these football players young football players know that like hey I Need to develop something now\nBecause in probably in three years I Would not be in this league mhm um and the most money these kids will make will be within their first three to five years that the league if they make it past and and so I I I told them like ... you have to get focused but\nWhen we look at these twenty two year oh this is why I'm so passionate about that Fifteen you wrote about that Thirteen year old getting you know the ... to ... get into graduate survival guide a book and also taking our financial foundations curriculum is out of a classroom because all of that\nTeaches what these old they're professionals do not know mhm if they can get at Thirteen like these middle school kids day four out here now\nBut these old they're professionals do not know mhm\nAnd they can get it at Thirteen like these\nMiddle school kids day four out here now taking our middle school curriculum you know they are um a head of the game like they were teaching me some stuff earlier today I'm like wow like winning the world and so just to see these young kids are getting it taken our curriculum learning learning how to budget\nLearning how what is the difference between the credit card in a debit card and these kids I mean I'm not financing anything like that just it gets me excited gas with\nHis dolled in a in a life skill yes life skills stuff and you need life skills whether you're Seventeen or fifty seven yeah you know and this this money thing you know the basic stuff of being out of there being on a budget of having your emergency from the stuff we talk about here every day on the air\nIt it really does work for teenagers and the interesting thing is they're not\nYou know that they're not like rusted into place right you know they're they're pretty they're pretty uh\nUh elastic and their spirits in that they can receive this stuff sometimes more than some of us are a little older and we get a little stiffer on our spirit and we don't receive is quite as well they're like okay it's girls go do that right right and they're not like old docked in and going to argue with you about ...\n... it's a it's easier to get through most of the time you know a big argument like they have to have a credit card you have to have strong loan you don't have to have a car payment they don't hear all

diabetes and ... they suffered a stroke or you know where are you close to a stroke and that kind of um\n[noise] I can take on some serious care and um you know in terms of helping them and that kind of like you don't mess with the times that I had to study for for my my my own studies\nAnd it it was wrong and I'm ... who's taking care of the parent now\n[noise] mhm mhm Mm\nWas on the actual real Florida travelers will ranger [noise]\nTravis is in Jacksonville, Florida Travis welcome to favor injuries Hey David how you doing the same thing my shirt I was hoping\nYou could uh settle the debate for my wife and I saw that loophole for future um we have about Seventy five thousand dollars in debt collectors we um we own our home outright uh we had a vehicle that is being chased and Seventy five thousand\nA week or make a decent money and we have an ...\nFather had about two hundred and ... in it for the question on one was decent money\nFive she makes about one twenty and I make about eighty okay\nSo that the question that I that I have faith that we have a um her mother and father passed away last year and uh she was my heritage that inherent and she had a certain amount of distribution every year for tax purposes my idea for the inherited money I'm is to\nTake one lump sum\nOf all of our debt and then ... pay ourselves back off of that to an IRA I'm so that we don't have to worry about including sleep paying the uh interest game if you will or a worry about that is that the um you know she is going to be coming out of course in that for our retirement\nUm my record good at it this year and what are you I'm thirty eight\nWe still have a good amount of time to be putting into our um different hounding account so I guess my my question is should we go ahead and take the distributions help all of our debt that we're no longer paying the uh you know the interest rate or should we go at it is hated that down as we are\nA bit and it will be there for a new one or two and a half years well\nWe've been using for almost Thirty years a decision making\nParadigm a decision making structure that is based on the idea of what is the fastest way to well what is the shortest distance to wells and I'm In the process what was what gives us the greatest returns\nAnd what gives gives us the least risk what what has a level of wisdom to it um and it's not just one sided it's not all investing mind if it's not all that minded is not anything it's just a process of financial planning process\nThat process has now been proven obviously doing it for twenty five years in many many people become millionaires and multi millionaires gradually get rich quick using that process\nUm then the question becomes do you guys were you agree to use that process and if you're just so that the way I Would answer the question obviously me being me is I'm going to tell you use that process and that will answer your question what to do with the money but\nUm but you've got first aside do you want to do that or not I mean that's that's that's the core disagreement here what the process is based on the process is called the baby steps and one is based on is a couple of things number one you're most powerful wealth building tool is your income\nAnd freeing up your income and not having that not only lowers the risk\nNot only increases the peace and the quality of the relationship in the household but it also increases mathematically\nFreeze up all of your income just to make money with instead of giving it to banks and uh and the second part of the things we live in the process is is that personal finance\nIs eighty percent behavior and only twenty percent had knowledge stuff we're talking about smell really rocket science here there's not a lot to the math it's it's about fourth or fifth grade math is really all it is so having said that we say baby step one side of a thousand dollars you guys are obviously done that\nSo it's about fourth or fifth grade math is really all it is so having said that we say baby step one side of a thousand dollars you guys are obviously done that\nToo is to be dead free everything but your house you've not done that three is to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses I didn't hear that you've done that and then for ... for start putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement so how much is in your emergency fund\nCurrently we have about whom fiber in our settings now\nIf the inheritance was not on the table or we would teach you to do is take that down to twenty four throw the or or take twenty four twenty five and throw it at the debt and then clean up this debt very very quickly it is absurd for you to have Seventy five dollars in debt with a two hundred dollar household income it was just right up\nOn your life or a couple of months ago and I'm a went on a on a life in a nice way to earn a on a regular you\nKnow okay it's absurd that you make two hundred thousand dollars a year and you know ...\n... ... ... you know you guys make enough money to have done this the right way you chose not to do it the right way so it's up to you guys but if you're going to do what we teach you know you would use this inheritance immediately to become debt free so that you take all those payments that you don't have\nAny more and you use those to build wealth with\nYou have a paid for home\nCorrectly when I heard it when you're not\nOkay All right and how much is in the inheritance in cash\n[noise] I I'm not quite ... look on my north of ... Seventy five a\nHundred and Seventy five thousand dollars correct okay and why she taking distribution says they're just taking it\nOn ... ... they want her on her and her told her that she had to cut it in a debate to I'm a method called her her tax ah over they each year here at heart over at about ... a good way to make money out of town\nYeah it's a bunch of crap um the uh\nOkay because anytime you start making decisions based on taxes instead of based on economics you make bad decisions so I don't know what this money's invested in but I Want to get control of this money and get it invested shot what would I Do I catch the whole thing out pay some taxes and\nGetting a different financial advisor and uh\nI Would pay off all the debts and invest the rest of it or in something that I can see controlling what it is in good mutual funds or in some paid for real estate or something\nLike that I honestly don't think that's what you all are going to do but that's what I Would do um because I think there's a lot of cooks in this kitchen there's a lot of opinions flying around\nHere and you guys have got to get inside this end to as a couple decide what you're going to do and how you're going to handle money and then you start telling financial advisors what to do is do them telling you what to do and\nUh it's a different different situation so I think she inherited the financial advisor to I don't think he picked him and um and that's really a\nBad medicine as well Ninety percent of the time are you guys need to pick them or you need to re pick him and hiring\nAgain and this time he works for you but I think he's still works for grandpa only with the rebels dead and that's the way their stuff works usually bad bad medicine Travis what I Would do is catch the whole thing out pay off all my dad's and invest the money with what's left that's what I Would there and\nI Would take your wonderful two hundred thousand or income and become multi millionaires with it and that's what we've shown people how to do for almost three decades now\nSend you guys are a couple a copy of the book the total money make over get a walk you through not only what to do but why do it and then you can decide intentionally whether you're going to use our system or someone else's doesn't matter to me [noise] Oscar's whether it's in Chicago Oscar welcome to the Ramsey show\nThey have a it's a blessing to strip to today with Michael certainly coming home\nFrom ocean is a uh begin or continue on value to open on forecasts that nothing just randomly doing everything that we do we get older but I Know if you're a partnership\nUniversity ... because you don't like to I can do it in order but I'm just I'm just pouring through much doing everything you're going to be so the question is what my credit card [laughter] I'm a little ... that are all the credit card company to actually\nMove does that count because you out of my main that we just don't want to remove the temptation abusing if you've got a right way or absolutely\nAbsolutely and if you close the accounts completely not just cut them up and that'll keep them from reporting activity on your credit report and it'll keep someone from accidentally fraudulently\nYou using them or are you from using them there are definitely would close the accounts as soon as I cut up the car\nIt and talk to you Oscar monitor heavy as an English not hold on I'll send you a copy of the book the total money make over now to get your started and give you the the framework from all these different pieces of information that are flying\nThis is that Iran\nPay on Christie right for years I've been a part of Dave Ramsey steam equipping women to make money doing what they left as a certified business coach an entrepreneur I'm all about helping women step into their God given gift overcome the here and make money by living their dream that's exactly why\nI created a business boutique event at this three day event you will walk away with a plan for your business and you'll know exactly what steps to take next you will learn from the best in the business on the topics of marketing sales social media\nIt's time to start living smarter includes three D.

invest that extra money I have to put my house in Middle East now you know that's\nA good question how old are you\nA good question how old are you a fifty four fifty for near single\n[noise] okay and how many years do you think before you buy a house [noise] um I'm thinking oh he's sixteen\nOkay oh cool well as long as you got more than five years I Would use a simple gross stock mutual fund or a series of them\nFor something like that I probably would dress shoes and asking the index fund because it will grow virtually without paying taxes on it until you pull it out I as a what's called a low turnover ratio which means the taxes aren't charge much on the growth until you cash it in\nAnd so I started to\nPerson is in the five hundred fund an index fund and use that to grow for the next five ten years or so until you buy a house as long as you leave it alone as long as you plan to leave it alone at least five years you can survive\nThe gyrations of the stock market and you should be fine and that and that's exactly what I Would do I do a similar things got in and sometimes I've got some extra money and I'm just saving up for my next real estate purchase as an investment and um\nEven if I don't have five years in that case I'll ride the market with it and I 'cause I can afford to go down if I mess up a little bit but yeah that that's the direction I Would go good question Robby is with us in Pittsburgh hey Robbie welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHey Dave how are you better than I deserve once up\nA thank you so much for taking my call yeah I had a quick crafting a so I Am a nurse or by profession and my wife is a nurse and at that as I Am wondering if I should go back to school again next year\nI'm so my question is if they work for me to go to a call now I'm thirty two years old my wife is uh twenty nine we make a combined income right now after a two hundred and a two hundred and twenty thousand\nA year or so if I go to school it's going to cost me three years of not working\nOn that tuition off around Ninety thousand dollars mhm a side uh our gross income after I go to school and be successful ah together that would be close to a three hundred thousand mhm [noise] so uh but it's\nA what do you make a year now\nUh right now on Seventy thousand\nOkay so you're saying this is going to cost you a three hundred grand three years or three years of Seventy thousand missing plus nine out of pocket yeah okay can you cash flow than any out of pocket and can you live on her income or you're doing this\nI can live on her income for sure that's how we did it when she was in school [noise] um but I don't think I can cash anything right now because I\nAnd I also don't have a house or at the moment so I was you know planning on buying a house a or putting at least they're putting a down payment for a house next year before I started school\nSo that then you need to wait until you can pay for school I Would have never\nIn Thirty years or during the show recommended somebody borrow money to go to school\nOkay you got the cash flow to do it it's just a matter when you do it and what you put first what you put second you might plenty of money to come up with ... grand yeah plenty of money and you don't have to have the whole money up front you just got to see in your budget how you can cash flow it\nUm I can see it pretty easily ... to go through the glass again or go\nTo ... it's a three year program\nSo thirty grand a year a thirty grand a year yeah and and she makes what ah she make a hundred and fifty thousand you can't cash flow thirty granted I'm a hundred and fifty [noise] uh\nAnd she makes what\nAh she makes a hundred and fifty thousand you can't cash flow thirty granted I'm a hundred and fifty a law not when I'm not in coal\nNo if you're in school she makes a hundred and fifty thousand dollars and ... thirty thousand over a hundred and fifty to go to school year for three years\nI I'm Sorry fifty dollars it's it's a it's going to be around a sixty thousand a year I thought you said it was Ninety thousand [noise] ah sorry I got that wrong it's it's a sixty thousand a year\nSeems high\nYet it fit into it it is an expensive program yeah go to a less expensive\nProgram okay but cash flow is whenever you're going to pay for it figure out a way to pay for the\nPapers you go you know there's certainly have an all star stacked up ahead of time but you got to see where it's going to come from I Would not recommend you go get student loans because here's the thing everyone starts that program doesn't finish it but every one that takes out student loans just aren't that program has on student\nLoans whether they finish or not and then you've got what's known as a freaking mess and so I'm not suggesting you're dumber\nYou can't pass the test or something like that my life happens do in the last thing you want the only time debt works as if everything works other than that that doesn't work and so we tell you to stay away from it thanks for the call\nOpen phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Joshua ... is in Dallas texas Hi Joshua how are you\nI'm good how are you better than I
