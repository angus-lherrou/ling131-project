[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nShould they Ramsey\nIs getting paid off or you're in the south shore\nRamsey your host and this is your show America\nNumber here's AAA to five\nTo too\nMany years ago I discovered that there are thirty one proper [noise]\nRead the book of wisdom in the Bible written by Solomon there's thirty one of them which makes it fairly easy to read one a day so if you don't do anything else in your spiritual walk or inner search for wisdom you can read one proverb a day and if you do that over and over and over twelve times you want to read that book in one year right\nAnd I'm Thirty years later I have read at a bunch of times and\nI you know ... book wisdom and I you know what if you're actually understand the stuff you will get wiser isn't that\nInteresting you know and here's what happens when you get wiser your life gets better because you know stupid stuff you know I figured out the less stupid stuff I have a better life for her you know it's fairly simple and you kind of get back what's your\nI figured out the less stupid stuff I have a better life I have you know it's fairly simple isn't it you kind of get back what you put out you ... what you do if you plant corn corn grows every plant stupid you grow up broken desperate you know you're gonna get a crop up something in your life what your crop gonna look like right\nFor instance ... as a slack hand causes poverty\nBut the hand of the diligent makes rich translation lazy will make you poor and you work and you'll have money so hard translation is it\nA slack hand causes poverty but the hand of the diligent makes rich interesting diligent why does diligence diligence is excellence overtime\nContinued actual is not one moment of excellence but continued excellence an ordinary things when you do ordinary things with a level of excellence latch called diligence and by the way that makes one rich\nInteresting isn't it the hand of the diligent what's the hand the hand of the diligent makes one rich\nSo here's one of the things I figured out I read this study years ago and now the observed it in all the millionaires we meet with and talk with and and it showed up again in this millionaire study that Chris Hogan and the team just did for the everyday millionaire project and we interviewed ten thousand million or more things we found there and one of the things we found in this study before that that I read years ago was\n[noise]\nLives in San Francisco\nHim how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm forty five and I'm looking to retire at fifty five I'm I have a pension and I'll be getting like Seventy five percent of my pay check in four one K. and stuff like that but um [noise]\nI've been recently started listening to you and I've already paid off some of my dad but I don't know what's left is only about thirty four hundred which I'm sure I'll be able to pay off in Ninety Days um [noise] but my question is I've been looking into refinancing in my house because I have an F ha and so I have\nPM I and I when I Do the math\nLike the six thousand dollars and closing costs versus a hundred and eighty seven\nA month ends up being three years plus my interest rate is going to go up so I'm not sure if that's the smart thing to do\nBecause if you're a star in the home longer than three years that's the only way you're gonna end up getting gravy on that biscuit right\nYeah for sure so um that's how your in laws and um that's\nThat's kinda borderline that's the tipping point is much longer than three years I probably on your break even analysis I probably would not but if you're you know Ninety percent sure you're going to be there longer than three years you're going to pass the break even point are making money even at a higher interest rate is what you're telling me right\nI'm In a while I'll get out of having to pay the hundred and eighty seven yeah but where your interest rates go up and offset that he well he acts three point seven five now and everything I'm getting a quote it is about like for you know so you're not going to make any money\nSo is it better just to stay in it and pay the\nWashington probably gonna be four seven five on a Fifteen year right now uh today and so that's like a one percent spread 'em and so what is your a loan them out\n[noise] this one is a hundred and sixty six thousand okay and so on and the other three years I've already paid off ten thousand about one\nPercent on a hundred and sixty six thousand increase is sixteen hundred dollars a year okay and you're only saving Eighteen hundred or a hundred and eighty dollars a month which is about two thousand dollars a year so no I wouldn't do that so that's the only if that's the numbers\nYeah I'm here bicycle breaking even to refinance and I wouldn't do that I pay the loan off\nAnd then add one other question I just joined ... P U and in my area everybody's already in session but some of them have only done one class that I still go in\nYeah jumping you'll be okay All right yeah the first classes on savings and you're already head of the game on that you're even missing and and go back and watch it on with your own line because you've got a one\nReally on line for a year okay so yeah you go and watch the lesson one and then when you go in Iraq with whoever zone listen to your right in sync okay yeah no troubles are you doing great way to go dawn you killed a ghetto Christine is with us in Boise idaho I Christina how're you\nDoing well thank you Dave I'm so we have a a a great situation for our family but I'm not quite sure how to proceed we I'm told her home in California in walked away with a lot of equity\nAnd had steak with Boise how much but we um okay well that's how much equity about two hundred and forty thousand boom boom love it yeah um so we're here it gets wearing teen while we kind of figure out you know if we want to build or by 'em\nBut I'm not quite sure because we already have our our savings we have our retirement we have all that [laughter] are you out of debt that we do go yeah we don't have any debt good\nUm but do we just go and maybe take cash for a house yeah certainly what we want or do we what we wanted we want where we you know we want something they're going to cost us more than what we have all\nKinds of small mortgage on it and paid off real fast\nOkay the only the only game I mean well I mean what's your household income or about a hundred and fifty\nOkay and what what would you be talking about building or buying what price range\nOh preference between four and six\nOkay and you have to forty and the bank mhm okay so if we should for forty as an example you talked to her does not a morning right All right how about you can pay that off five years\nAnd all that with you know I mean just knock it out how old are you that\nI'm I'm forty five and my husband's fifty\nYou have any money in savings or investments that's not in a retirement account\nNo this is all kinds of it [laughter]\nAll right well my rule of thumb is never take out a mortgage that is on more than a Fifteen year mortgage and the payments more than a fourth of your take home pay you're not even going to approach that right way and then you'll be close to that and so if you take out of two hundred and fifty thousand or more did you have a really fine house in Boise idaho for half a million dollars\nThat's a long house that's wonderful property and landed on\nWhat we're hoping more Korea property then that could make out [laughter]\nIt's a whole different world though obviously from where you're getting from rights and so um I mean you're bang for buck is huge in Boise compared to you know a big City California so um yeah you you're going to\nMake a huge progress here and you know you just about whatever if you take a small mortgage or out in a small relative to your situation in other words I'm\nNot going to yell at you know I don't borrow money so ... we'd be buying a two hundred fifty thousand\nAnd then we'd be saving money and we'd move up later and that's how we would because I mean we don't borrow money for any reason ever\nBut if it's saying only thing I don't yell at you for borrowing on on the show man in your case though just how the different mindset that the mortgage is just more like a car loan and we're just going to knock it out real fast\nI mean like other people's ready to call like five years or something you know let's just put it on there and how fast can we knock this thing in the head and let's get after it\nAnd that's how I Want to think about it it's a really good question thanks for joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Sarah is in California Hi Sarah welcome to the day Ramsey\nShow Hi Dave how are you better than I deserve\nAnd I was wondering if I should tell my car worth about Eighteen Alvin ... pay off my about four thousand dollars worth of debt and my emergency fund like card paid off\nWhat is your household income\nAbout thirty thousand a year\nYou should not have an Eighteen thousand dollar car ... you have too much taught about things going down in value when you're out on your car or things with motors wheels of any kind added up equals more than half your annual income how did you end up with an Eighteenth are paid for car making thirty grand\nAnd I was married and we refinanced our how can they included the car in the mortgage and then he got and\nKnow and then we got a divorce and we sold the house and for the car was paid off got it okay and I got a car and so what is your um\nWhat is your income prospects meaning you're thirty now where will you be in a year where were you being three years\nRight around thirty thirty tail so you don't see a lot of working out you'll see this doubling then no okay why I\nHaven't got to school yet okay\nThe single mother fighter and yeah\nYou you need the money more than you need that car don't you yeah\nYeah I in the cars going down in value quick show yeah Charlotte pay off your dad put your emergency phone in place and get you an inexpensive car that you pay cash for probably in the five thousand dollar range okay maybe seven or something like that there's something reliable and you can get lots our car for five to seven thousand dollars\nRight now in your debt free and you got a good emergency fund and that put you in a much better position\nBut as a rule of thumb cars are the largest thing that we all by the goes down in value anything what wheels or motors for that matter if it's got wheeler motor\nIt's gone down about you and when you have all that stuff out of the gather you don't want too much of your life financially too much of the math\nAnd you get when you have more than half your in your own income tied up and things going\nValue then that makes it real tough to prosper stay in your case you're going to change your income by going to school and so you don't change later but for right\nI'm with you I was shocked that cost missions today Ramsey show\n[noise]\n\nIt's\nTime to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not\nLeaving any money on the table one of the biggest expenses as your mortgage payment I recommend the quick Churchill checkup then just five minutes our friends at Churchill mortgage can tell you if you could save some cash each month it helps to houses upon thousands of my listeners keep more cash in their pockets through the smarter mortgage I Want\nIt takes away most of that spread when you when you you know when you factor interests 'cause we're there is risk when you have mortgage now is\nA lot of risk 'cause you've got the money in the bank today to pay it off by or an investment paid off but there is risk and so are you have to admit that you know one hundred percent the foreclosures are girl home with a mortgage there is rich and so I'm getting rid of that\nWill have found is it's not completely quantifiable I'm In a simple mathematical formula\nBecause when you don't have a mortgage you start making different decisions with your career\nYou start making different purchase decisions you start having different levels of enjoyment with your money your relationship with your spouse talks to have a different depths because there's a a level of security in your overall life that there wasn't before and those things are really hard to put on paper so what I figured out is I'm going to live a hundred percent that free\nAnd I'm going to invest like crazy the rest of the money that I have in cash that comes in and I've ended up with a ton of money doing that because I don't have any risk and I'm just investing real money not borrowed money so all of that to say if I woke up in your shoes I pay off your mortgage today\nAnd if ... if this discussion gets our own you and you think they ran she's crazy a year from now just get you into the market you\nI I I I completely agree I mean I for one thing that race is just a lot of money I'd go you know to go that day and get paid off but my mind sort of his wrestled back and forth\nAnd and I what I'm trying to point out is is that you're the you're got is not intellectually Raul your mind is your minds using an incomplete primitive formula\nGot it\nWhat I'm pointing out is that makes sense completely yeah paid off the you got this thanks for the call open phones at AAA eight to five five\nYeah that's what I'm pointing out that makes sense\nCompletely yeah and also you got this thanks for the call up with as long as a AAA\nEight to five five two to five she your hard choices that you really you got your your heart your heart's where your major risk march telling me about my ... my ... told me I committed millennial this what do you know money which are heads mission some stop its mission risk and um\nIt's kind of a fun thing that I was doing this with a clash of MBAs speaking to them and a cause MBAs or all talk you know masters in business they're all taught strategic thought and I'll talk to borrow money and uh I guess last year a oh stop to borrow money my book finance professor used to teach us to borrow money\nAnd show 'em you know it's been about finance professor at like a shop teacher were missing fingers right people think about this Russian I go there and you're just can't think that way and you have a different way of looking at things show um\nBut as you can really do a very sophisticated mathematical\nApplication of this it would just take a lot of time too much time really on the radio to walk through the whole thing but what happens\nIs is think about this how many of you if you had zero that and you looked over in your four one K. and there's three hundred thousand dollars and you had forty thousand bucks in the bank for your emergency fund\nWould make different career decisions way too many I mean just showed us meaning I Would leave this jerk I work for it and I would go do dot dot dot unless I go in business for yourself necessarily might just have a different\nCareer you might go on a completely different direction\nThat thing you've always wanted to do while you're waiting\nYou know and here's the weird thing is that saying you've always wanted to do is probably where you make the most money you've ever made in your life if you're wise about how you do it this idea that if you're going to liberate Persian you might have the money you make twice the money you make more money when you as somebody you're good at\n'cause you work harder at your creative you think about all the time he can't keep yourself from moving because you love it you don't think I Love what I Do I Can't keep myself from sitting at my laptop writing a blog article I keep myself from doing it I Can't keep myself from coming down here in doing this radio show when I'm In town I\n... and I'm really good at\nIt as a consequence of consequence I get repaid I'll watch a lot of money on a shame middling I'm a capitalist pig baby I love this [noise] I'm\nHere baby that's how I don't want that for you see that's what set you up to be how many of you if you didn't have any payments would tell your boss who's a jerk ... take this job and shut it I mean we would do that yeah there you go that's a man and\nI'm not telling you quit your job today I'm saying there are benefits to being debt free that are beyond the simple mathematics of the fact you don't have to\nBe interesting to start to be set free slavery is more than simple secession\n\nChanges in the ...\n... ...\n\n\n\n\nCourse origins year you ever talk
