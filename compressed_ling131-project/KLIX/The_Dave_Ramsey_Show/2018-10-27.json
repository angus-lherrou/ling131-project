and I just and I had made progress ... it's on ... on my issue is idea of a chronic illness and I still work fulltime I I'm not letting it take over my life\nGood on my question is is how do I I check 'em for like deductible on it and Knoxville recently I recently switched off ... started again I'm also\nThe Koran again unless you're going to hit the duck double every year\nRight um\nIt's a thing God if nothing on the go at it it's not they don't have and it's not life threatening\nAre you going to do it every year well okay ... what what is the nature of this what was the nature of the illness\nI mean I don't want to go into detail that is a it's a nerve pain commission that the auditors are I'm sure I've got one comes from okay um so if it was over there but I Do is I'm sure because it's relatively new gathered I yeah\nFor what I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year\nAnd the more experienced got to help you that you have with is the better your estimates are badly because\nOnce you've ... battle for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months you're kind of guessing what it's going to cost you in a year right right and you just put that in has a budget items so let's just make up a number\nOkay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand noted that double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month\nIf it's three thousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know\nA\nA whatever a line in your budget for medical expands on the wind phonic medical and just call your call chronic or whatever just give it a name and\nMoney set aside for that so that every 'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up and leave a little while now someday hopefully you'll find a cure and you know it's not a lifetime of this or something yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future and so ... for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nI mean my issue is that I'm literally on like penny pinching I don't like the way I can make that happen from what I've been doing is I mean I decided starting next month I'm going to kick out fifty dollars that you really are likely to right now on\nWhat I I'm I'm hoping overtime on the other you know pay out more so why are we ...\nWe had an income problem a debt problem or a spending problem how to\nIdentify with that problem [laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand island that\nI make I don't think a lot on the license social worker and because of my condition actually switched jobs had more flexibility on some of the fee for service division\nAnd they make anywhere from Thirteen hundred construction hundred ... a paycheck on I knew he drops on Monday ...\nEither twice a month okay and you said you're living with a guy gets in I'm living in our late I paying nine Seventy five around each other I think a lot um\nAnd I did that somehow from ... in terms of\nIn a what is the nature of the debt student loan the cat is ugly credit card all also because they can see and I was trying to holistic thing I'm a medical student loan or most of it before I got out of that\nSo I have like a quarter of fixing out\nOkay show for the short term we're going to make sure you take care of the most important things in that food pantry\nNot eating not anything else in your pantry aren't in your life from your lights and water and your rent and your transportation\nSo food shelter clothing and transportation utilities the eighth grade we used to call that a civics lesson lesson necessity necessity is only the debt you've got is not necessities you take care of the debt only after you've taken care of the necessities and then you were just allow end of the dead as you can\nAnd here's the thing you're either going in Paris for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nRight because they are coming you told me that that's why you called yeah yeah yeah\nI mean it's not me declaring it I'm saying like I said I've got ... how to prepare for it you say even cover it so now that's our short term and long term okay we gotta get your income up and you're out go down to knock this debt out long term but that\nHas to do with your medical condition and as news your career and has to do with a lot of different things that you've got to face and so um but that's how I Would you begin to look at it get to take care of the short term make sure you're taking care of you so that\nYou can you know be prepared to take on the long term which is get your income up but\nUh we got to get past some of the medical staff and you've got to really start looking into his career really hard chop up those credit cards is Tom put plastic surgery Tucker is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Tucker how are you [laughter]\nI'm doing well how are you better than I deserve what's up\nFor me and my wife um I go on the baby step here right now I'm In fact we just paid off by that getting credit card today that we are dollar credit card a movie on the line that is good news um [noise]\nBut um so we're worried that too and we're looking at our budget and yesterday and um after church we had a big argument about hiding\nAnd all the way we want to ... percent and um I realized that we were not an imposition media right now we're trying to pay all that we can get later\nOn it but what I think what economists model that I'm kind of a ... law and get your input on it we have our ten percent budget that we want to die because I was thinking about splitting data and given that the church and then having that extra five percent and kind of giving it to\nThe um other charitable organizations that we believe in that are about it one day a ... you know during the crisis mission and so we're trying to get\nThe looking at trying to do what we can to people who need it um but and she's on the other hand ... strike and present a church and then what we do what we can't give you know we're not in the media and she wants to give the chart\nArgument about I mean yesterday\nI was out on the ... the definition of the time\nWas when you look it up in the Hebrew it's an Old Testament term and Jesus refund given the New Testament is tent it literally means chant the word means tamp it doesn't mean that doesn't mean twenty if it means tempt you can decide\nWhether you want to tie they're not you get to decide\n[noise] um but if we're going to walk with Christ and we want to and when I'm an evangelical Christian which means I look for what the scripture tells me to do I'm doing my best to follow what the word ... and so what may wrenches opinion is doesn't matter\nWhat Tucker ... Tucker's opinion is doesn't matter I'm looking for what God says to do and his love letter to me and he says Tucker and Dave\nI'm I'm you're my kid I'm Crazy about you [noise]\nYa and um you can give are not given all still love you the best way to live your life is to to give\nThe Old Testament and Jesus reaffirmed it in the New Testament is a time of the tens of your income\nEvangelicals have taught and believe for Fifteen hundred years at that\nGiving it comes off the top [noise] before you do anything else and he goes to your local church [noise] so if you want to answer your wife Wednesday arguing [noise] most of their last July when argument so she was correct biblical [laughter]\nActually both are probably turn\nOrder to be a successful business owner you have to be prepared for change as an example let's talk about the huge changes in tax reform that actually managed\nTo make something that was already difficult to understand even more confusing it's never been more vital to your business should consult with attacks professional to determine how the new tax law will affect your business employees and quarterly filings I'm\nYes 'cause the cars\nFifty on cars and what's the other fifty five on\nA thirty three thousand on student loans a little bit of the majority of my wife's ah about eight thousand on line\nAnd a twenty two thousand is on other like credit cards and stuff like that got it and what's your household income [noise] um well I got fired from my previous job that was there about five and a half years\nAnd um we're making about one who won all five one twenty ... a year\nWhere did you used them out of the old job\nYeah that that's what I was making before um [noise] yes before okay um what do you make now why\nNow I'm In real estate I'm actually I got my license in March and June ... June was my first day in real estate mhm I've got to choose a house is sold six listings and extending clothing bought into uh the second week of November So\nWhat is your projected income for a vote that's six month period of time\nI'm I'm thinking maybe like twenty five thousand by the end of the year\nAnd does your why didn't make of the one of the\nFront of makes it a she made a fifty one dollars a\nCall ... Sally it sounds like in real estate you're going to make as much a used to make yes okay good good news All right\nI guess right now what she's worried about is that she's bringing in most of the income because of course it's slow when you first start out I'm only selling to houses that between that long span 'em and everything is she wants to keep her car because she's saying she's making money to pay her car [laughter]\n[noise] yeah that's not how it works when we're married that's how it works when your roommates\nYou get to do whatever you want when your roommates but when you're married it's for richer for poor and sickness and health and onto the all my worldly goods I pledge is what the old marriage vows sad\nAnd so it you know if you want to be divorced you get to keep whatever you want to Cape but if you want to be married\nWe are doing this together in other words if she gets cancer you don't look at her and go oh you just you can handle that cancer thing there by yourself and those trips that came out you get to do that by yourself and you're not going to do that to her\nRight no no you would take care of her because we are now one one were married and and it's in sickness and health and right now the house is sick and so we don't get to be a princess and be selfish and that's not an option\nSorry\nYes and and um that's what I was trying to explain to her that we need it my my truck is for sale already have it on the market good home as soon as I as soon as I Do some of these closing the courts will have\nIf I can get what I was asking for what you what it what I oh I'm going to pay the difference to get rid of it completely good um what these clothing and that's what I was trying to tell her to as I'll get a car cash in and she tells her car and then what have at least one car right now\nI Would get her a car and I'm not sure\nYou can make fifty five thousand if you can get these closings and everything you've gotten the pipeline it sounds like you're pipelines pretty good it's just it's been tough from the layoff in or the firing until now but here's the money that you've got ... the the business that you have coming should create the income they used to have\nIf I heard you correctly yeah and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there are any or clothing by then the second week of November everything should be closed do St\nLouis ... three weeks from now I mean so three weeks from now all this goes away so here's what I Would I Would not sell her car today I Would show your trial today and I\nBut I Would I Would say I would tear this this this ridiculous philosophy that she has all the senator I'm not putting up with that crap okay this idea that outlined make money I can keep my car and\nThat's if you're running mates that's just BS okay I'm not going with that show uh but uh but but the idea that I think she should keep her car\nAnd I think the two of you and I think you're going to be making enough money but then the two of you can work through a budget that has not a hundred and five thousand dollars worth of debt making about a little over a hundred but instead has about Seventy five thousand dollars of debt making a little over a hundred if both of you are willing to roll up your sleeves and\nPay off thirty seven thousand dollars for the ... a year for two years we can keep her car\nBut if you're not willing to do that as I household then you don't have a financial trouble your marriage trouble then\nShe's not willing to join armed with you and fight an outside enemy that has come at your house and she goes to her corner with her toys you ever marriage problems\n[noise] so hopefully you guys can get on the same page when you back\nWhen I started selling mama's cars not weigh a good way to get mom\nShow let's try that\nApproaches I think it's reasonable financially to keep her car\nIf your income goes right looks like your income is going to go\nThen you might be looking at a different career and she's going to be looking at us on our\nAnd you get hurricanes guarded drive you drive a car when we get this ...\nThis is

of four hundred thousand between my four one big assets and\nYou're smart with money so I I have a positive net worth right now of four hundred thousand between my four one big assets and I'm ... so I'm not a terrible but I just want to know what\nKind of way gas that's do you have that are not home equity or for one\nI have a hundred thousand in vehicle [noise] we'll toys like larger items worth more than ten Fifteen thousand dollar home\nThat are all going down in value okay yeah that's that's okay and you're Seventy thousand dollars a year\nOnly have five\nFive and the pressure in the lobby of Ramsey solutions just stop by\nCars that were in the neighborhood from Anchorage, Alaska it's really much thanks for coming by guys are you\nFor having a ... absolutely so you guys have a question we do we have a question about um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go then we're going to retire from our jobs and laugh and Alaska\nRelocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp for officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is\nCamp for officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\nThe camp will be a the the operations of the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is ...\nOwn will be rented our own we currently on that property currently on that property and we'll be living on at a\nTime and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry ... journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be or non profit and in the nonprofit you would sit down and talk about what kind of a\nYou know you need to get with the insurance broker\nInsurance is appropriate then for a a a camp setting a\nWill be the main thing I'd be concerned about\nThat if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that who are they going to say well they could sue the landlord or they could sell the time that they could sell the the nonprofit or you\nEither one and so on a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then if the structures on the property or\nThey they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the nonprofit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures mark homeowner's insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure 'em\nThings that they don't own you don't have an insured interest and I\nI really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit uh\nI'll keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not you know you you're not stuck with land in a non\nThat can get real sticky if you want news but let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land\nYou know you got mess on your hands of the land is owned by the nonprofit usually what I'm saying yeah they keep that separates a and so trait that you know the landlord had can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liability associated with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenet for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you and your your stuff that's in that landlords house you see what I'm saying as a treat these things separately and your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the type of insurance people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal and for instance a I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so\nYou don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay they'll sell it or they might but you wouldn't want by there even if it is so huge that you would go to an insurance broker and they shot five different companies that Ruy airplane insurance and then they come back and tell you what how\nLiability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash about what happened in the same thing here they would find five different companies that ride\nCamp insurance for for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means an insurance will they find somebody that a ride your policy or two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing\nAnd it costs so much in this covered company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and it costs as much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of injury\nCause this much of this cover company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and they cause this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner 'cause it's basically a insurance on a farm or insurance on the farm plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can\nYou know the window that low a little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in your shoes as my main thing you want to ... do do hold harmless agreements or carry any weight in any of us um no I ... yeah they carry weight but I'm\nThe in\nThere are no agreements that keep someone from ... you cannot contract away liability\nOkay so let's say that a floor was right and then one of the cabins guy and um that's a liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold on ... you you are liable for that uh you're standing in my building if you slip and fall\nBecause we didn't properly and stole the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had to sign a whole Varmus before you walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called ... those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk but\nHarmless is it what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts occasionally people honest right it's like do you know you are you are walking across that employee fell on your face 'cause you trip you know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement\nAnd you know then you're going to call him out just on his own or you know if he doesn't have any the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he's on this and it helps them when their case to not have to write him a check but you need the backup in case you were to lose that\nAnd it'd be proven that you are liable regardless of the whole harmless but I I I Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and have an attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles use on these two page documents that are often Brenda about how if you die you're not that they're not ... they're still awful [laughter]\n... loose [laughter] so [laughter] I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you hey thanks for the call and your Lucia you're joining U.S Open phones at AAA eight to five five two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your

up\n[noise] um okay I have a Christian and I'm a new American I Apologize if this is something that you've touched on why I'm so I'm new to the ... and I know that number one we have to eat out the dollar and mark and they find them\nMy question is do you ever think gaff saving more than that and and the reason I asked my husband works\nIn oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing to happen mhm um and I stay at home with a kid mhm ...\nStay in getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing to happen mhm um and I stay at home with a kid mhm but I'm just wondering how you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get better baby step three but here's what I Would do okay he's in an honest stable environment where there's job is what you're saying and I agree with you are okay but um that's one level of quote worry\nI'm not going to raise it based on that level of gory but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off how much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off\n[noise] um [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years and it never happened to us we are really lucky we've never been laid off ... haven't been that gets sent home pretty quick I mean within a\nCouple of weeks she'd have a couple of weeks to do something and he's going to\nDo when he comes home if they did get laid off so\nIf he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I was\nMaybe step thing and there's a pile of cash or just generally worried about it you know generally worried about it as we all have and that's why we get out of\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save

is going to talk to you Martin is with us in Los Angeles I Martin welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave how does that\nWell I was a one of your opinion on regards to um to whether I just fell my rental property to pay off my primary residence or and pay off any other dead also that I have\nA much other data got\nJust two cars um I had credit card debt but I paid pretty much about Fifteen thousand in the laugh that will take three or four months\nBecause you're you're dead free but two cars and the two houses right okay how much do you own your cars\nI'm fifty thousand on balls\nEach or total on both total okay wow and what's your household income [noise] ah one thirty okay you gotta lotta car and um so what do you own your primary and what are you on the rental\nMy primary goal to fix the and it's worth about five fifty\nMhm\nAnd the rental and um my rental Ohio one fix the end is worth about I Would say or thirty Philip has four fifty but I if I'm at a little bit less\nOkay so I mean the two ways to do it is usually income to clear up the mess or use the rental to clean up the mess right\n[noise] right and so on you know if we stay taken say um you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these callers paid off and so they're going to be paid off and well under a year\nAnd then once they're paid off a then I'm going to decide I'm going to pay all the the little house or the rental for probably go ahead and pay off the rental um my pal files first I don't know either one's fun but um you know he starts on forty fifty grand a year and that\nStuff let's see here we got three four uh\nFour twenty so you got about five to ten you got about seven to ten years to clean up those two things after the euro paying off your car I'm ordering soul the rental now and be done right\nI mean that's what I really had him classroom whether to to do that and and pay off most of the party much taller rental and pay off pretty much all my dad\nOn it but I also have in mind as far as that like I have a son who's about to well I Would say in in two years she's going to go to college\nSo I don't have a house payment you can cash flow that right okay good no doubt no the only way this makes sense is if you don't borrow money anymore I Know my credit card check that out there and they told me Gary by a car\nYou pay cash for it I'm All right you never know money again on anything if you do this because otherwise it doesn't make sense\nRight that's that's the planet you can to get on track\nYeah you can't sort or ride this out of debt horse it doesn't work you can't sort of routed me gotta ride him or not\nSo if you're gonna ride him it makes a lot of sense and I think it makes sense I Would sell them\nFirst it didn't work you can sort of routed me got a ride him or not\nAnd so if you're gonna ride him it makes a lot of sense that I think it makes sense I Would sell the rental and pay off everything I cash flow colleges and outside but by mission where the rentals with cash as I go along out there in the future and I think ten years from today you'll be in a better place by having done that if you stay on budget and you don't keep you know you don't spend money that you don't have\nTo go back out there and borrow money and all that kind of stuff but you got to stop it you got to break the cycle and if you've broken the cycle and yeah I don't the rental and\nPay off the cars would pay off the house um and it does look like you got enough to do both I'm barely close very close but you need to be a hundred percent that free a sap build your emergency fund and then start building George junior college fund and then once you got junior college covered um\nBy just don't want to just on the same as ... as a junior college junior dollar just throw it in their build it up build it up build it up build it up and work your way right through it and then I'm a ... then once that's done then you just start saving up paying cash for rentals or doing other kinds of investing along the way but we're\nWorking the baby step share the only thing is we're just short short getting everything by the show at\nWould I Love rental property but I Love being there for a more and so I don't borrow money in life is good when I don't have any payments any where life is good it's awesome\nI thanks for the call

you sign for it\nAh my mother and my mother's I actually don't know how much it is\nOkay so she borrowed money to go to school and she signed for it you didn't sign for it you weren't the student\nOkay is that what you're saying is that what you are\nOkay if that's the case you are not liable for it\n... ... when she died as if she has\nThat that that will be paid by the sale of the items that she owns before airs receive anything show when you die what you own is sold to pay off your debts and if there's anything left that's distributed to the air's\n\nBut you are not let let's say she dies penniless and she has three hundred thousand dollars in student loan debt the student loan debt people getting\nNothing no one will pay them no one is liable to pay them act\nBut if she has a three hundred thousand dollar paid for house it would be sold and we would pay off their student loan debt before you guys got anything in that example if there's around I was more than that for all of our house\nThey would you would get nothing they would get paid\nOkay 'cause she's also a refinance our parents um I'm trying to get into the chat for houses and I'm On top of the student loan debt\nYou know sort of a hat or bicycling she's doing stupid on parade\nYeah my father and I'm kind of given up trying to teach and he he kind of keeping their finances are separated from what I

know\nFind anything for taking my call true on\nWe're on currently on maybe one on live and I knew him for a month and I'm David ... to ... so we're getting a life insurance um evidence\nAnd you might have been a missed that his dad took out it's hard\nTo say I have a German car seats on him when he was younger and he wants us to eventually take that over and make those payments um I don't know what that is how far can I'm not exactly sure\nWhat the best thing to do if I'm not the beneficiary to that it ah how to handle it\nMhm good show he took the shot when your husband was a child yeah this is not a term policy at your whole life life insurance policy\nAnd it's close to half a million dollars\nWow it should be canceled okay there's a whole life insurance policy but happily and ours is a very expensive\nAnd yeah and like in my main concern is you know we found out\nRight and I like when my main thing that you know I found out the beneficiary I doubt I mean he's a great guy I'm not worried about you know that it's out on my own here as a guy\nDoesn't matter if it's a good guy this is it's really weird that it's continued to have the parents are the beneficiary and this is a grown man with family of four with four kids\nYeah there is a very ... and like going out on you know a wild one but it's strange how long have you been married for a long you been married five years you know in five years they've not address this issue that strange restaurants you know\nIt really I mean they should you should address the issue is that they should not be the beneficiaries anymore you should be and really the policy ought to just be canceled because I Would I Would not want to pick up the ... I Would not want to pick up the premiums on a half a million dollar policy on there's a whole lot policy\nBecause it's new at twenty times more expensive than term to create an investment inside of it called the cash value that has a poor widow overturned that when you die they keep your money\nSo that whole life insurance is a horrible financial product [laughter] and so\nIf you just call me up and you just owned a half a million dollars of whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you got your term in ... but you're not paying for it today anyway so today you get your term insurance symbolizes proper around you and your husband and I I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad\nAnd said that uh I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now I Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's right I don't want anything to pay something that you know and then it cut that you have a long time so\nIt's not only nah needed because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan\nHas now changed yep 'cause you know he made a decision as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nWaiting how are you today better than I deserve what's up oh God\nI have a question regarding up part of my retirement savings said comes here's a thing called a pension from my company and that overall is a bad guy eight percent of my total has had a\n...\nWell it's I mean a crusades projected to be a at a project that retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be ... percent of my total as happy here [noise] and\nAnd my question is whether the cat is a lump sum yes or ... okay\nHere's why okay if you die or not we if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all going to die I get when you die a that money's gone\n'cause it's a ... and you get ... a if you have a survivor benefit or something there it may it may go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there's a survivor benefit the money's gone it's gone and if you live I or\nAs long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market so it's as if you had\nAnd the investment advisor said Okay Steve we got an account for you over here two hundred Ninety five thousand you can invest it you make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone or you can take that two hundred Ninety five thousand you could rolling into some mutual funds and a good IRA roll over and Mitchell\nAnd and when you die the money stays with your family well that'd be a better deal right\nYeah I guess [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity but\nIt's still while you have your diet and yeah you got survivorship on it but we both have you done the same concept ... so the bottom line is it's got a decent but low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you die makes this a bad deal\nAnd so you always take pension lumps on almost always type engine lumps arms enroll them to IRAs and invest them and good roast I've mutual funds that sounds like you're networks in excess of a million\nA yet so close to too close to ... probably about four oh well in there to tell them that where the assets house and so forth\nYou know well known ... congratulations how old are you I'm sixty three white ago how much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um\nProbably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from both my um my family and my wife pay more for\nYou a millionaire or that was that before that happened\nA a millionaire or my wife's mother passed away us ah when my mom my my parents type relatively young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar networks because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nA holding pattern is hard because the amount in his heritage is is maybe ten percent maybe ... percent\nIt's lower sterile relevant yeah OK cool is I'm a I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now it's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell that twenty four year old [noise] how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [laughter] well\nI certainly got a new well below you mean as long as they are a modest lifestyle which we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I was you people do stupid things I've done the stupid things I think if you can limit\nA stupid thing to do along the way that's good I like that [laughter]\nBecause because every every everybody listening right now is has done or will do stupid things\nBut then you can minimize those ... along the way in a\nWay of a modest lifestyle with below you mean um yeah Lloyd\nSo do you think there will be done
