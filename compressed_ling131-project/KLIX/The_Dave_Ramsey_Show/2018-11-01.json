an avid listener and I can't believe I'm by myself and the situation a little background a while back I was entering my apartment complex and shutting down my vehicle and crack when Cher\nI tried to collect from the complex for the damages caused to my vehicle and from there\nIt sent me five dollars to pay for the gate that caused by my vehicle\nUm come back and forth conversation with alternately refusing to pay that just because there's no indication of at the gate with cause et cetera et cetera I thought everything was clear after I stopped sharing from them in this packed we got a call from a collection agency and gets home and get food for\n... for fat hire an attorney\nSo seven hundred and Seventy five dollar play the damage it yep okay what about do you think that small claims court could be an option yep\nBut I I'm ... and I think if you hire an attorney for a couple of hundred dollars and they ride them a letter or you may shut this whole thing down I don't know you'll have to go to small claims court\nOkay and so and I make I mean conversation would be a collection agency cracked it had nothing in the apartment I'm like\nOh yes it does they still on that and they're the ones that are hard to collections agency I Would say like I was in the apartment complex\nOkay for I Am college's Web just come back on the part that goes on to think my my neck that

and you weren't doing anything wrong and the stupid thing broke your caller they need to fix your car and not charge you for the gate right\nWhere I that's what you're telling me and if that's the

gimmick or something\nI should keep paying don't or insurance is one of the most easy insurance has to figure out that they're charging you more than you're getting\nUm we've had dental insurance proposed to us as a a\nA employee benefits several times and it's really simple when you add\nUp what you pay for it in a year you'd never spend that much on the screen it just doesn't work out it's one of those things you should shelf ensure through now we do have an advertiser is with us\nThat is a a dental discount company and that\nIs worth it because that helps you get discounts on your dental repairs your dental work and show force and um\nYou know you can check them out as well you find\nThem on our website one dental is what it's called one dental and a dream she'll tell me 'cause I was looking at him my brain was it was firing and I couldn't members are great people to have gotten another one dental but it's a discount program for dental churches nobody is worth it and we do

deserve what's up\nOh my goodness longtime listener and just so excited never call before\nSo um my husband and I our debt free including our house why go oh yeah well thank you for your teaching we followed them all [noise] um and we are actually we're everyday millionaires I'm a teacher he the nitrogen\nAnd um so we we didn't invest in a way that you um recommend and you know just out of curiosity we finally decided to meet with an lp went online and found one that you your site recommended\nMay know over investing\nOkay yeah yeah I ... thank you okay um and we met with him and he was very ah you know we've had a lot of information for us\nAnd then you know that the structure is like a ... percent I guess and\nSo when my husband and I didn't know is since we've been investing in a way that you teach since we've been you know we both are blessed to have pensions we have you know not only in our fifties and we in area we can retire and five years\nAnd we couldn't be comfortable with um [noise] what it makes sense to hire um a financial person for a year at you know whatever I think it's like five thousand dollars a year because they go a five point five percent of what you're\nActually there looking they're proposing a manager a manager to count for you correct OK yeah a lot\nOf the industry has gone to the managed account approach and uh so the question is what do you get for your money that's what you come ... and a anytime you're investing and when I'm investing by the way my\nPersonal money's invested with one of our smart rescue approach okay [noise] um and so the there's two ways to do investing in mutual funds upfront fees\nOr that as you do the investment they charge a fee and then there's very low almost no annual after that or they managed account or it's a percentage of the balance every year\nAnd a writer you getting that well they're helping you select the funds\nAnd putting you in funds that are out performing the market overall um you know over a long period of time over average you know phones that outperform the ash and pay and of course you've got someone to meet with uncover anytime there's a question about anything I'm\nA if there's a change in the market and you're worried about it or up or down\nAnything along those lines and there's tons of studies that say that you will come out ahead doing those two things one is getting good advice and picking the proper funds and to a\nYou know just not jumping off the ledge every time somebody comes on the news and freaks out you're probably not already not doing that one where\nWe live in I mean I listen to you every day\nShe every kind of got that down there and you're not going to jump off the roller coaster and get hurt you know so that that part of stuff so you know the thing is just ask them to show you okay why are you worse what is your charging\nAnd you know 'cause you're charging me of the worst that uh and in most cases you'll find it is and then you're going to make more than the cost of the fee in extra returns\nAnd certainly in services in terms of um you know education is available to you and\nUh you know there's a thousand mutual funds to go through I don't keep up with eight thousand mutual funds I have a day job you know and so a a a life you know I don't want to do that but those guys that's all they do all day long this comb through those funds\nIt's a whole world they eat live and breathe that stuff and it's also\nDon't work on my own car or I could probably fix my car cheaper than the mechanic fixes it but it would take me longer or\nThere'd be several trial and error is along the way I might break something in the process and so it's worth it to me to get somebody to hook the computer up to the car that actually has the computer hooks up to the guards instead of me being a redneck laying on the trying to figure this out and it's kind\nOf like you know investments out on the eye why those either um I don't even do my own taxes are and\nI'm pretty good at this stuff it's what I Do I'm a money guy\nAnd got a natural for math and all that kind of stuff but I don't why when it gets to the end of the ... the the you know the dirty details so to speak so that's why I think you're going to find the investment is worth that they managed account is worth it but I it's fair to\nAsk them to show you okay you the typical guy does this or you've been doing this over here but if you had been with us during that same period of time and here's what we would have had you and here's what the ... and and you know what am I Do you want and a half percent more what it costs to half a percent Sweden ended up for one that kind of a thing um\nIt's a fair question to say hey prove your worth it\nBut it costs to half a percent said an editor for one that kind of a thing um it's a fair question to say hey prove your worth and uh I don't think any more risk or pro that we have with um tell you that that they can't do that um\nThat they all obviously all believe that they can and then just asking to show you that question Alex is with us in Charlotte North Carolina\nAlex welcome to the ...\nAnd I are are you doing today\nBetter than I deserve so what's up\nA good question um maybe a better question or can't comment about my career or I'm currently by but that too and I'm a welder I worked at a town\nAnd I'm like around a hundred and forty thousand a year mhm and um\nI've got opportunity to go work at home or the pay is about a third of what am I working out of town and I'm just a curious if you

are you where are you working out of town\nA member going on now I'm actually going on we're on um [noise] you know my own have their own right now I'm On\nAnything other than a day to file a mhm mhm\nOkay well I think the answer for me would always be see none of the above ... uh I like the ad that coming off the road I don't like the idea of a two thirds pay cut so I got to figure out now and I don't either how can I come off the road and make more money\nWhat am I gotta do to make more money off the road or can act of some kind of a mix and say I'm going to be gone two weekends a month and a\nAnd go to ... on the road that way and pick up some serious change as until\nBut is there is there a pass a career paths at home whether it's owning your own ... or\nYou know [noise] I don't know run running a different kind of a ... a different way of doing this rather than just saying a J. O. B. at home versus a road jobs and is there another way to do this and that's that's what I'm going to be to the rocks I'm going to be turning over looking forward to how to do that and\nUm you know where do I want to be one I'm forty two\nRoad [noise] you don't want to\nYou told me that and getting married I don't blame you only get to go there will be home with their wives like good question I

you're reducing your debt substantially by doing that and I was what you're paying a month\nYou beat you pay off that you know a couple of thousand dollar loss\nAnd and just a few months she'll be done with it very very quickly so you'd be right on track ghetto you made the right decision button I Know I wouldn't lose ten thousand\nWe've been talking a lot about the millionaire\nAt the way you think if you're a millionaire around\nOne thing we found for sure as a millionaires think long term they don't think thank God is friday oh God it's Monday\nThey're looking out for word\nAnd they're thinking and there's two things that millionaires do\nThey play off and so they play defense all fans is they do the right things to build the wealth they do the investing to build the wealth you know investing in your mutual fund engineer four one K. investing and paid for real estate\nThey do these kinds of things that defense is avoiding stupid stuff that cause you to lose everything all the progress you've made\nAnd so that stuff like the right kinds of insurance the will all that kind of stuff and so having a good solid financial plan is both ... and defense and that is one thing we find one of the data points we find with all these millionaires they really good at defense\nAnd um it sounds tedious ... it can be but we've got a thing to help you with free it's called the five\nMinute coverage checkup so you get your phone out any text the word check up to thirty three Seventy nine or go to Dave Ramsey dot com slash checkup\nThe text the word check up to thirty three seven eighty nine or Dave Ramsey dot com slash checkup completely free and they will really help you I mean they'll help you get that millionaire mindset going and that's what you've got to do Andrea is with us in Pasadena, California Hi Andrea welcome to the Ramsey show\nHi Dave thank you for having me on that um I Am so happy that I'm like my husband and I ... I might have\nSaid to me now not totally again within within about three months already okay I'm In trying to see what I accept that we have about a\nThousand dollars in credit card that we have about fourteen thousand in the evening and we have to he said after like they're really holding but we're just not sure what else we can do with that I mean it could come and get rid of them and there I agree it's not really sure what to do\nRight well you can we can do some math and determine if you want to just ride them out or if you want to sell the car\nNow if you want to sell the car here's what you would do we need to get the information gathered up you need to call the fleas company and ask what the early buyout is meaning if I wrote you a check that day to get my title what would it be\nThat should be less than the total of your remaining lease payments plus the residual value the buyout at the end\nOkay and um so you get that number that's like the only pay off without the interest on a car payment okay just same thing the early buyout number that's what you're looking for and then you compare that to the value of the car have you done that on any of these cars\nYes we have on both because I'm like oh wow okay so we got the actual numbers always talk about vehicle number one that was the early buyout\nThat early buyout is thirty three\nDollars okay and and what the value on that car the value of that car I Believe he looked at it it's like twenty five ... Kelley Blue book private sale yeah yeah my husband is thirty two that's how much it's I'm Kelly I'm Sorry\nBy ... Kelley Blue book private sale yeah yeah my husband decided thirty two back how much it's I'm Kelly\nI'm Sorry thirty two or twenty\nI made a mistake it that the early ... thirty three ... and get the Kelley Blue book number is thirty oh great\nOkay so you can only lose a thousand dollars by selling that car you'd only write a check for a thousand dollars if you sold it for thirty two but you had to give the least company thirty three to get the title you're a thousand and the whole right right right now your lease payment is how much\nMy statement is five hundred and forty two dollar demise and how many and how many payments remaining where we have about Eighteen why payment\nOkay I'm just putting that in here that's nine thousand five hundred and Seventy six dollars mhm mhm so if you sell it today you lose a thousand if you keep it you lose ten thousand\nYeah no brainer salad okay okay you see how the analysis now let's look at the second one then right what's the value of the second one\nSo the value of the second vehicle is twenty five okay\nOne of the early buyout on it\nThat early buyout on it at ... o'clock in the early five twenty five okay I haven't done the Kelley Blue book 'em out but I'm sure it's ... I think actually my ... I live in town and for that one where really in the hall\nAnd okay and what is the lease payment on it\nThe lease payment is two hundred and thirty dollars right and how many of those are remaining fourteen my payments K show that\nLet's see here to thirty ... thirty two hundred dollars if you keep the car till the end of the leaves and hand them the case right yet as to thirty times fourteenth okay and that one is somewhere\nFourteen thousand and the whole today\nOkay so you get to drive this caller for free until the end of this lace on that one you keep it because I'd rather lose thirty two hundred and fourteen thousand and I drive the car\nOkay you see what I'm going yeah comparing a total of your payments against the amount you're in the hall so that one\nOne I Would probably keep it for your husband's numbers are correct on the value I suspect there and I suspect you're going to keep it anyway because I don't think he's going to be that\nFar at all so I mean we've got a fourteen thousand dollar deficit right now if he if he's eleven value is right but even if he's hassle it's still a seven thousand dollar deficit versus three thousand to keep it so that one we keep\nOkay and you pay it out now is is it overall miles\nNow that one grand guy mile\nOkay and the wear and tear you're going to keep it up so you're not going to have to write a check when you turn it in fourteen months from now\nNow they're both in that for that one day in great condition\nOkay good good yeah that\n... you see how did that analysis\nYes yeah that really clear that track we were really struggling with what you\nKnow ... that one and you know what I Would do is move on past a baby step to once you've gotten rid\nThe the big car the more expensive one and once you've gotten rid of all your other debts except this but if you still have this one with the two thirty payments were just written the car all the way through the end here and you might as well keep the car you get no advantage to turning it in early\nRight you're going to like the three thousand two hundred and twenty dollars worth of two hundred and thirty dollar payments no matter what you do so you might as well drive the dad gummed car you know and um if you want to put thirty two hundred dollars aside extra in your emergency fun just to make sure you got that plus your emergency\nTwo and three then that's fine but that's how you do the analysis on whether to keep a leash or not and um most of the time\nYou're close unless you're close to the end of the lease you're going to be selling the car\nAnd that's what happened with the more expensive one there it's killing you know that one lives will be ... by ... show good question thank you for joining us ... ... if you've never heard the saying it's kind of a country saying you're getting ...\nWhich means it it's it's like a\nA sheep getting its for\nRemoved that's where it comes from your getting ripped off as well ... that's why I called little car fleet says\nBecause if we take the value of the original\nMarket value of that car that thirty three thousand dollar car on the expensive one there for those folks and I put that five forty two into a calculator and then I put the end of value into a financial calculator with residual value at the end in other words the residual value just what you can buy the car for at the end of the lease\nYour your games up number at the end of the least you put those numbers on the calculator you come back out what the effect of interest rate is in motion of the time\nIt's around fourteen percent they call it costs to Capitol and they don't have to disclose the interest rate da PR too you know if you get a car loan you get this there's truth in lending sheet\nThat the Federal Trade commission make she makes them show you the a PR the annual percentage wretched you're being charged but when you're leasing it's technically not that\nAnd so you 'cause you're renting a car and so they are not\nTo disclose the cost of capital or the interest rate but you can figure it out with a calculator that'll make you view [noise] I mean it's ridiculous because leasing is the most expensive way\nThe car leasing is a disaster\nDisaster as a financial issue if you just do the math you can understand why I'm saying\nThis is the rams are shared\n\n\nA common theme around airs

dollars or greater how did you get there what did you do so that we can find out the facts not what people with political agendas have\nAs an opinion on what people who are just de motivator unloaded have aged out of it as an opinion and really not what some capitalist pig like me has an opinion because I Am a capitalist pig a love capitalism and I think you can do it I think America's greatest country in the world has ever known I still think you can do it\nI Know you can and they we did\nIt as we talk and did the largest study that's ever been done on millionaires talked over ten thousand or emphasize that people said oh you did a thousand you talked to a thousand people know over ten thousand people all across the country\nSome people that didn't know who day was that no why was these are the reality of what they've done and I'm telling you we found out the truth\nThe American dream is alive and it's available day for the people who are willing to put it into work and the sacrifice\nI was reading a political article this morning 'cause I really completely lost my mind and went down a rabbit hole and they were talking about the lead that one candidate has over another mhm and there's this poll and it's in a major newspaper someone hundred and Seventy seven people because they polled\nDown so we didn't pulse foreign Seventy seven people we fall over ten thousand you know an actual millionaires guess detailed information about them and that's what we're doing today Carlos ... is with us in Sacramento Hi Carlos what's your network\nIt is a two point nine million perfect break that down for me how's it invested\nI had some company stock at five hundred thousand a mutual fund at one point to in my house and and there's one point here perfect love\nIt how old

bachelors two hundred and fifty thousand [noise] and my worst is when I first started for ... years old I made a Fifteen Years old I made a nine thousand dollars\nWhile Carlos I'm curious what age did you start investing\nAnd I ... when I yeah I I was always a good saver mhm I bought my first house with my dad when I was Eighteen years old\nWow when men ordered investing in mutual funds how old are you\nUm I was twenty five\nOkay start early good who did and what is your career field\nI worked for Kentucky Fried chicken okay we're almost almost Thirty years\nWow forty years and did you go to college you know I did not okay and did you outside of your mortgage did you use any kind of ... to help you reach millionaire status\nI'm a little bit of ... uh with the company they offer a stock options mhm and so for several years we would purchase an option at a at a large discounts and then when I Would get performance bonuses and you would pay those options are okay\nYou weren't borrowing money though you're just buying the option right yeah that's right you just took advantage of the option you have to go into debt you didn't pay payments to do that no no\nNo okay okay and do you do any giving us a household right now\nOh yes yeah we do a lot of uh [noise] we spend a lot of time giving and a monetary also mhm I'm\nYou know and then one of the interesting things about being retired been retired six years now and people ask me well how'd you do it and it's interesting as most people look at me about halfway through and I can't do that\nWhy why why do you think they say that\nIt would have to be to discipline I mean every day you make a financial decision or do I say the money or dies and that you know I'm\nSo that leaves ... there's not a true statement I Can't do that the statement as I won't\nDo that yes that I I agree with that and do what did you do for KFC\n[noise] well I started at the dishwasher when I was Fifteen or became a manager of a stove and I was Nineteen [noise] and and uh my wife and I worked together for many years\nAnd then um during that time I was able to have a partnership meant ownership and man in the last twenty five years of my career I was a consultant for the franchise\nOkay ah the the girl was made millionaires all over the world and I just thought I thought I'd ask is very interesting I've read some articles about some of you guys and it's an impressive culture that you came out of very very cool so you work for one company your entire career\nCorrect well uh yeah so at\nThe end you and you apparently we're self taught how much do you read\n'em or you know I I don't leave a lot um well I think a lot of financial magazines and books I mean it's kind of a hobby of mine of of\nOf money and how it all works and investing as it is a hobby I'm not about hobby [noise] no no I'm like so the the other thing that I found interesting in talking to people is Flynn when I was young I was the first one at work and allow them to leave\n'em you know I'm I Do I dropped out of high school when I got my GED when I was Thirty years old\nI'm you know so it's it's not and it's not an education thing that the hard work very\nWell and and when he said the discipline to every day and make a good financial decisions so what would you tell the on Nineteen year old a dishwasher can he still do it today and if he was going to what what do you need to do\nI Would tell him to ah don't spend all your money and uh [noise]\nWashing dishes should we learn learn the next job in line for them and management ash and can you how can you move up and he's already prepared to do that\nAnd that worked out for thirty eight years show pretty incredible wild on what a great\nStory dodged now that's an amazing story high school dropout started out washing dishes at KFC\nAnd if you could just blinked Ford America just a few years about forty years he's sitting at a network of two point nine million and now he's able to
