you too sir what's up crawl uh recently got married a couple of years ago uh we're looking to I'm trying to figure out whether or not to\nPay down uh my house or my wife house [noise] uh and we also have a some equity that was good to me when I purchased my home and I'm actually a kind of paying my father back 'cause I purchased a home from my father um the interest rate that I'm getting on the mortgage [noise]\nAh so we're we've I've I've been on the program for about two years ah everything's paid off and we all uh I worked for the government in my wife's a teacher [noise] uh so we're already putting uh about ten to Fifteen Percent of our income into our ah sure myself\nUm I actually am a I went to the government version of a financial peace university [noise] um so where are you talking about the ts eight oh I have my job my wife has a form of a three day I'm funny thing is is I'm actually one of the ... coordinator for uh\nFor for that so you're working for five and six you got your retirement going you're dead for a you have your emergency phone in place and you have a house that you live in and you have a I guess or rental house as a second house that want to be used to live in is that correct correct and as the other house rented\nIt's her her brother is living there um he's living there by himself he's paying us uh ultimately after the mortgage and the uh association fees and the taxes are paid and we're actually losing about a hundred and thirty six dollars a month on the house\nAnd ... and her brother\nWhile it's not that we're subsidizing him um both of mentally I Would just rather as at least this with the mindset was that I Would rather have him there and\nUh we get some tax benefit from the house so I assume that the hundred and thirty six dollars a month that we're losing our actually getting back at the end of the year to at least break even or maybe still make some money on on the home\nIs with us in Lafayette, Louisiana\nHow are you in theater than I deserve how can I help I had\nA question and I am Seventeen are graduated a year early and I said here when my parents because of a scholarship opportunity I Do not know how does it work myself while going the nursery school because nursery school is such a tight oriented program\nMhm okay a shower and no I'm Sorry ... show you how old I said anything you told me that I'm sure now and you stayed there because of a scholarship Yes sir\nTo nursing school Yes sir it's a it's through the state I graduated here and my parents knew because the job opportunities occur show the scholarship is partial Yes sir how much of a scholarship to to get at twenty\nThousand every four years so it wasn't a large one twenty over four years and it's a four year program I take it yet they're dying and what does it costs it costs ... nearly all kind of what you have five it's actually need eight yes our plus you need to eat yeah\nThere's that detail right where we are living with friends family what\nI'm living with friday we split out in the country because it's cheaper\nYou and some friends are run by age ... current and so you have rent and electricity or share and you have food and you need it out and you need a thousand dollars a year and yes there okay show when we add all about up what does your rent and other stuff cost you a month\nIt cost me about nine hundred without looking on my gosh and I work minimum wage and I do things like clean and people out there and things like that trying to make a little bit of extra money\nMhm okay All right so let's let's go ahead\nUp then I get about twelve thousand dollars a year for that\nAnd I need a thousand dollars a year for ... for tuition and some other you probably some books some stuff too but we're pretty close their ... twenty thousand dollars a year as what you need to earn it there and minimum wage doesn't do that\nEither sounds like you to another job\nAnd I had an opportunity to start a whole failing senator name brand clothing and now I don't have the money to put up right now\nNo need to get into that union job you need a job you need to show you can make more you can make a Fifteen twenty dollars an hour babysitting and managing you can make good\nFifteen dollars an hour or ten dollars an hour cleaning houses I'm walking dogs uh other stuff\nSo I I think we need to get your doing something along those lines and the other benefit of those are not only do you make a lot more than minimum wage and by the way you make enough to work your way through with the numbers that you and I are discussing here\nI'm In um you are going to be working all the time though\nAnd if you but if you can get a situation like that the semis self employed when you're cleaning some houses you're doing some nanny and you're doing some whatever [noise] um and you uh uh you can control your time\nAnd you can make more money you can control when you work and how much you work now you are going to struggle because you're going to work and study and got a clash and that's all you're going to do\nWhat you can make it if you do that the other thing I Would do is I Would apply for a bunch of scholarships the third thing I Would do\nIs investigate some of the hospital companies that are out there particularly in your immediate area to talk to the nursing school and see if there are any of them that if you agree to work for them for a couple of years after school\nHow much of the nursing they would pick up for you okay kinda been indentured servants type program if you've ever heard of those\nAnd I married a hospital that actually planning I like that I think they will forget all life line that I like that and in fact body\nWell let's see if we can get a job over there now\nAnd let them just pay for it now\nOkay we're going to have to pay you back for student loans because I'm trying to keep you out of student loans with the math were you in are doing here\nSo I Want you to apply for a hundred more scholarships you'll get turned down for most of them but if you get another five thousand it really helps the situation a lot I Want you to think about doing different things for work that make you a lot more money and you can control the time\nAnd I want you to investigate with his hospital or what they will do and talk to the nursing school about ... anything they can do to help you as well that you're working your way through but you you sound like you are to me just talking to you\nYou're you're very very mature for Seventeen years old that sounds to me like you're a rock star\nThinking and so I don't think you need to play beer pong his real\nHot [laughter]\nI think you don't mind working and and grinding and hustling grind to get your way through this and not come out of this with you know forty fifty ten thousand twenty thousand dollars a student loan\nThat you don't need to it but you're going to have to make some very distinct and very careful choices to do this\nAnd the good news is you're living expenses are very reasonable and your tuition is very reasonable and the third piece of good news is you've chosen a fabulous career in terms of employment you will be able to get employed instantaneously I'm\nMean nursing is just there's always a shortage\nSo you're going to do very very well but I Would do talk to that go talk to the hospital administrator at the local hospital just set up an appointment with them and just walk in there like you own the place because I kind of you can do that\nAnd uh just tell them that they need to pay for your school and then you'll promise to work there how's that work and how can you help me get through school because I don't\nWant a bunch of student loan debt I'm trying to not be a

quickly the emotions are carved often said over to one side\nAnd the actual technical legal financial details are on the other side and it becomes very transactional kind of thing at that point does that make sense yesterday and show a here here's a couple of things to look at your student loans or your student loans that are going to go with you\nUnless you know you may or may not get alimony child support or something else but your student loans are going to go with you [noise] um and you're gonna have to pay them so what is your personal income\nThat it took out\nOkay All right and so what you start doing is if this is a a direction that you you know after seeing a counselor and doing everything he can to save a twenty two year investment uh\nAnd with all the help you can get a you start preparing for living on her own for fifty thousand bucks a year and you'd you'd look at your student loans how much they're norm that if you got\nA gun Kim I'm Sorry sixty thousand oh my lord [noise] okay [noise] well\nI Would let them know that this was going on hardship different or until you get past uh\nWhat else whatever else\nNow do you own a home yeah what's it worth a two hundred thousand what's out on it a highly February Tammy\nOkay so now like would either to amount to anything or is your car paid for yet is he has corporate for no okay is your name on that loan no good okay are there any credit cards that have both of your names on them\nAnd they're the one that I hear ... in ... I'm Sorry\nAre you refuse to let him you're at it a better than that glass closed that account today just completely closed the credit card if he has the number he can use it if he's one of the users on the car [laughter] area and if things go sideways emotionally inside your house\nI have run into situations in Thirty years of doing this where somebody takes Mexico driven puts it on the guard and you don't want to pay for five thousand dollar cruise for somebody else you know and it'll end up on this card so close the account today just completely shut it down to zero balance\nYes good close it okay the it does your checking account both names on it yeah\nOkay sure your money separated by march is there any other debt or dead instrument that's open that as both of your names on it and now now okay All right except her mortgage probably as both your names on it okay\nSo here's what happens you can't afford to keep the south ...\nYou can't stay there yeah um so the house that needs to either be refinanced to get your name off of the mortgage or sold you cannot stay on the mortgage and given the house\nThat would be dumb and people often do that in a divorce they often do that but just\nYou know the negotiation is the cars in his name he keeps his car your cars and your name you keep your car you're checking accounts are already separated there's no other debt you get your student loan debt I'm ... does he have any big savings or investments to order you and for one case\n[noise] I'm not big you know how much am I had I had a ten thousand mhm four one K. and I'm not sure what he had a pet I'm thinking about five or six thousand not much at all okay for them as well as his income uh it around Ninety thousand\nOkay in most states your attorney would have to advise you've been in most states you would do some alimony after twenty two years and that we're going with your fifty thousand is how you will reset your life and stay out of debt and start working your way through these student loans that are outrageous and we're going to take some time to work through\n'em but you're going to be working extra job you're going to be doing everything else taking any any money you can squeeze out of your budgets and you are not going to Mexico you gotta mess on your hands\n[laughter] okay on that\nShow um unless it's to escape no just kidding [laughter] ah but the ... so you know you're going to be on beans and rice rice and beans you're gonna get the cheapest apartment you can get you going to stay dead free and address these student loans as soon as you can get stabilize ...\nAfter the separation which will lead to divorce unless it leads to you all getting back together okay okay you prepare for separation the same way financially you would prepare for a divorce\nAnd that puts you in a position of strength to negotiate and the divorce financially um and that's something that you don't have to do and your attorney and you get representation\nShe ate in a divorce financially\nUm and that's something that you'll have to do and your attorney and you get representation and you'd be ready to pay them pile up money for deposits and for paying them don't pay extra on the student loans until you get the other side of this\nAnd I just put 'em on ... and pay nothing right now but let's get the other side has but my hope is is that you guys you can see a counselor who can give you some words to say some tools\nTo get by by wake up call maybe the two you sit down with a coach or counselor and walk you through turning the corner on all of this before you get so far around the corner we can get you back\nAnd may be you can save this thing I\nWould be best for everybody involved I'm assuming the issues that you have that are causing you such concern\nAnd I'm sure that I'm sort of like a pretty long list but um to sit down restaurant ... see a counselor for your sake call your pastor say who cannot shut down with that can walk me through\nUm\nFor the right questions to ask myself the right questions to ask him a casino and I think you're kidding you may think you're bluffing and when you actually move out it may it may wake him up and he may be willing to work on that list at that point I don't know but those kinds of things are best guided by a really good marriage counselor\nThat's really experienced and why isn't a\nGodly council a will help you in that situation I sure hope you guys can turn that\nThat would be my hope for you and be better for all of you are financially as well as everything else so good question thank you for joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five to to find your job and we'll talk about your life and your money\n[noise] interesting data that just came out on an

up\n[noise] um so I recently to cover you I got three only about three years ago um started doing if you think we are we ended up selling a how to get out of debt I'm from New York teaching a my father died about five years ago on a motorcycle act and and um there were a bunch of life insurance policies that went through our personal financial adviser has\nBeen advising my mother ever since then\nUm and the question that I have is\nA clear and in in ... about um\nFive years ago whenever my dad died a three hundred thousand dollars in the annuity um and then the other end up Peter conducted and they've been growing a little bit\nThe question the annuity ripped recently we had a five year mark and advising her to all the money I turned ... which I think is a good idea however the question is is that\nShe should have should have had that money in ... and actually at the beginning of the uh turning up pretty putting in ... she brings home about thirty five hundred dollars a month in retirement and Social Security but she doesn't need the the draw anybody at all you know and he knew that the beginning of the time\nYou know well yeah you're right that makes me question other things that are going on that I don't know what they are um you um but I I I and I am I personally would have put all of it and the good investments at the time um you know it is the home paid off\nAlmost paid off one hundred percent car the head off she had the rug that you're a\nGood good okay and how much is investments total there's three hundred plus\nI'm yeah we're looking at probably about four hundred and twenty four hundred and fifty thousand a year auto at all in that interview at the house another fifty to sixty yeah how are they under their\nHow old is she\nUh she ... she just turned sixty okay All right cool grandchildren great out go she's not like an old ... year old on her way out I think right now [laughter]\nGood I'm feeling better fifty seven there you say that so um [laughter] uh I'm not on my way out that I either a anyway or at least to do them out to my knowledge anyway so yeah I I'm probably going to question all of that I mean it's um it's not it's not like you put her in Hawaii policy which will be like a deal breaker or something silly like that\nI mean that just the enormity is is you know got a lot more fees to it a lot more commission to it and if it was a variable annuity and the money was in good mutual funds are probably performed okay uh they're okay um\nBut it's not my favorite thing to do but it's not to the point that I questioned his entire competency I just really want to know if it wasn't right for her ... if it's not right for her\nNow why wasn't right for her then that's a good question in your mind Mr advisor and um I think you've got the right to ask that question and talk it through with them and if you can't get a comfort level or if he blows up on you and starts having an\nAttitude and that's when you know it's time to move to anyway so you do that with any financial people are people that are devising you on technical\nMatters when they start getting like ... like you have to oh them an explanation instead of

[noise] um [noise] you know we have three hundred and Fifteen cayenne retirement already and [noise] but I Would have to take out two hundred twenty five K. and non retirement investments in order to be able to afford a house up there in San Diego so [noise]\nYou know I don't want everything in the stock market so don't want everything he didn't want a house special ... going to leave their short time and I wanted to know your life [noise] um\nI don't have a problem with you not wanting everything in the stock market I Would not long distance landlord in order to accomplish my goals though so you're talking about keeping the homeless paid for in Pensacola when you moved to San Diego is that what you're telling me\nYou know sort of a we have it on the market I I I Am a cash out of this now is either going to die out while they're sell for a a total of three fifty\nOkay and uh you're not going to be able to buy anything in San Diego for three fifty\nWell not unless I catch something on retirement investing each uh you know at two twenty five ... and now I can afford something out\nThere how much do you have in non retirement is that all you've got a two point five K. non retirement home about\nA half million dollar house then yes or what's your household income or about one eighty [noise] okay\nThe reason we tell folks to not buy in the military in most cases is because you're not in the home long enough for it to appreciate enough\nTo sell it and make a profit and\nAlso sometimes some military markets have an oversupply of homes on the market they're hard to resell show you get stuck in it and you lose money on it\nIn some markets in Pensacola would not be one of those markets usually and certainly San Diego would not be one of those market you're going to see incredible appreciation and incredible market activity\nIn both of those markets you should so so you should be able to get out of this and make a profit on the one you bought there and that's what it sounds like you're doing and you should be able to do the same in San Diego and I do agree real estate prices are up substantially um I'm not sure that you have to use all of that\nI Would probably if I were in your shoes what would I Do is I woke up in your shoes\nOr I wouldn't either a rent or be I Would pay cash for whatever\nI bought in San Diego\nAnd that would mean one of two things that neither one of which are going to be comfortable one is I'm not going to I'm not going to spend as much as you're talking about spending that have been spending five hundred maybe four hundred and leave a hundred and non retirement [noise] um or I'm I'm just going to get comfortable in order to have a house like that\nWith having no non retirement investing\nUntil I re sell this house now if he re sell this house let's say you bought it for five Seventy five or five fifty use up all your cash\nOr non retirement cash and money from this other homes\nAnd it goes up to seven hundred and when you sound like you're probably next move moving to a cheaper market there's not any more expensive markets for you to move to in the military than San Diego\nThat's about the Thomas a main Hawaii ... Hawaii maybe okay by a there's a couple of other main that there's only one or two but most of the markets would be almost markets in general not just ...\nOr you may be okay but uh there there's a couple of other main there's one or two but most of the markets would be well most markets in general not just naval markets but markets in general would be cheaper than San Diego I think we all agree to that so if you make some money\nAnd you're there are three years and you sell out you're going to put money back in on retirement investing in by\nA less expensive home maybe a larger home but less expensive\nOn the next by and the next station does that make sense yes or the so it's not really a permanent decision even if you use all your non returned my cash although I'm with you I don't think
