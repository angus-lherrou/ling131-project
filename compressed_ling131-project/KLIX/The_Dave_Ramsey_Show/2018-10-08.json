E. I. D. O. C. dot net or give it a quick\nGlutamate many look I I Would generally say don't go there just get it directly from Microsoft there's always a concern when you're getting windows from a third party that they can be modifying it and then the theoretically\nThe nice thing is Microsoft offers the meat they call it now the media in you know installer media creator creation tool and and it makes a USB key does everything I ... what is high doc do that Microsoft doesn't\nI I guess the only thing it does is it gives you the actual image from Microsoft and actually one reason I can tell that it's coming from Microsoft as it says copy you can actually you\nCould download it with the tool but I prefer to hit the thing that says copy linked for thirty two or copy like for sixty four bit and it copies to your clipboard to link\nTo to download and uh I've looked at it very carefully and verify that you know yes it does indeed come from Microsoft\nAnd that's good do you want to make sure I don't know if Microsoft too careful in in the open source world or when you download software they do something called a hash empty five hash\nThat you can see you next to the Arab and then you could verify it because if the if the download has been modified in any way the hash will be different and so in a in the open source world we say because there really is this just happened happened recently oh you are and it's really an issue because if a bank\nSo in in the open source world we say because you really is that this has happened seven recently oh you are\nAnd it's really an issue because if a bad guy can get a you know his own software on your system and might look like windows in my in fact the windows with a little bit of extra that's a real primarily I don't know I think Microsoft does now offer a way to validate that download\nThis looks like a nice to have one of its written by yawn Krohn published a couple of years ago probably because the Microsoft media creation to wasn't available yet but it does do one thing it looks like the media creation doesn't tool doesn't do it will add\nOffice [noise] to the download so if you're one of those people who wants to install office at the same time he has all windows that would be convenient but again I\nHave been very careful especially says now you can get an ice so directly fry or soft and the media creation to turn it into a USB Buddha ball you asked me I Would I Would prefer to do it that way he\nUs and that's probably the best way sometimes I'll even if I Want the image directly sometimes I'll even downloaded from Linux because if you do until the Microsoft flip side from the limits it will not uh it it doesn't offer you the media creation till you're ...\nAnd I actually I Am from Michael is you just get the ... so that's just if people are comfortable with Linux it's\nVery easy to take a any any I sew and make us a boot us be from it so um that is the best thing I often do that as myself better for you know for me I'm I'm familiar with and comfortable with the DVD tool so did\nI Am you know ... have you got the old computers or the screens busted on on\nThe opposite of the when I Do

for one much of the content is censored so users can search for certain subjects there's also what is called the great firewall to keep western information out of the communist nation\nAnd looked to me like I could see three of the new Chinese will pop weapons back here you can't get them\nThe only thing I gotta say people is a B ready yet are against the vigilance is I think there is a small Chinese sport's already in the United states and what they got the word they would come out are you guys have a good day\nWell there's always that possibility I guess David that a a Maureen nation would infiltrate a much because more different these days I mean we see what ISIS is doing\nOh Jacque from what I was stationed in Jacksonville met my wife in Jacksonville I have great town\nGreat memories of Jacksonville green navy town\nThat we have the same concerns about a German restaurants in World War one ... Japanese uh farmers in Hawaii and World War two there were very few or treaters as I recall historically there were some\nI Will still frequent the Chinese restaurant every once in a while it's Greek food [laughter] let's go to Las Vegas Hey Tom thanks for calling did they have you with us\nAh there's already been three explosions that chemical plants in China I Believe we were already performing a covert operations\nThe gas line explode or just yesterday morning and took down a landslide a on top of all these industrial type buildings where people are slating\nOur companies are they're making money and they can't trust our bankers so they started their own bank and that's what Hitler had to do is start his own bank\nBut but actually we still financed Hitler the Bush family the union bank\nWhere real good at financing awards and financing rebels with arms were in the Ukraine were all over the place where only the middle east\nAnd were real good at these stabilizing nations are financially and then we'd like to start wars I think we're the call [noise] [noise]\nA lot of people think we could be the culprit David a that's a different issue that's not part of your book but it's a problem\nWell I think that's a that would definitely be the way the Chinese would present out as the stabilizing force before that operates against the traditional way of life\nBefore that uh is against the Asian people ah editor for the uh brings disturbing a curve saw like feminism and democracy who traditional societies just seem from their point of view these can be very threatening\nAlways wondered when some company country is going to see enough is enough folks I mean you've been in Afghanistan you were in Iraq God Knows where else you're going enough is enough good that'd be a catalyst for war\nWell it certainly was with Iran was that the Iranian Revolution of they were they were reacting against uh against our our repression of their movement toward democracy and Arthur imposition of a of the shah\nUnfortunately it took a very ugly turn with the Islam is a resolution but a beginning it was a democratic revolution\nWell that is true did we did we not is somewhat support the ayatollah or when he was in Paris\nMm I'm not privy to that\nWas going to Rochester New York pizza is with us on coast to coast hey Keith go ahead\nSir I have two points militant Islam is different from any other is I'm In the world I'm ... ... people should know that during World War two one third of our combat troops in Europe had\nGerman heritage in them so asked was mentioned about the Chinese or whether it's any ethnicity it's it's\nGerman heritage in them so as was mentioned about the Chinese or whether it's any ethnicity it's it's laminated different from any other threat they really mean to destroy us and they might even welcome a nuclear Holocaust\nAnd as a their way to heaven it's cetera so that has to be looked upon or even if I didn't get the bomb they could still play off the superpowers secondly\nMan neutral ... destruction was meant to even up the score with a country like China who ... who does have superiority and manpower and the Chinese would happen to know we would never let go of our\nSovereign country but the so we would use nuclear weapons but my final point since World War two is now Seventy years behind if we don't have many of us a living memory of the horrors that Japan went through when they were at\nA time in your book faint people are just going to have to be reminded that nuclear war is different from any other war and combining that with Islam if we go nuclear that is pretty much uh the end of earth\nWell there's always that possibility David you know if you've all countries started you know launching new Pakistan, India China U.S Russia each\nYeah it would be the most demand disaster we could ever bring on ourselves I totally agree\nAnd you know there is a good values has scared of so far from beginning World War three\nUm what what the danger is is if the smaller countries with a smaller nuclear weapons are and the last um shall we say less rigorous command and control systems\nBegan getting into little scraps or we may see regional nuclear wars now these regional nuclear war is could grow a I'm more concerned about the reach of all the theater nuclear wars than I Am about major nuclear wars between thermonuclear powers\nRight yeah I don't have any doubts that the team he's on own would would launch somewhere oh\nNo no doubt whatsoever the guy's mad\nHe sure is ... ... ... what can be done to avoid this in your opinion [noise]\nUm a war with China yes oh\nWell let's see I think the first the first thing we need to do is look who our alliances um China plays a very long game you can look at what happened in the Paris out it's a Nineteen Seventy four the parents how islands [noise]\nThe Nineteen Seventy four we had pretty much well the south Vietnamese army around\nOr the Chinese saw an opening and moved in with a pair of cell islands and actually fought a battle with the south Vietnamese to take over the pair of cell Iowans and they did and the north Vietnamese sort of grudgingly acquiesce but they never re now their claim to the carousel Ireland now the Chinese occupiers\nBut what the Chinese did was they were thinking many decades had or what they perceive was a vacuum of power the U.S was withdrawing\nNobody was backing up the Vietnamese at that point the southern Chinese move them [noise] um okay the next step is the Philippines were Philippines ask us to leave sue big back\nThe Philippines ask us to um to leave the area and let them defend themselves okay great but they don't build up their own forces and therefore the Chinese feel free to move into this\nVacuum again the Chinese right thinking way ahead the way we do to curb that is to build up our alliance structure again we build up our allies we make them more powerful we show for a mess we engage with our allies we build up our reading math\nI think you are brilliant David I really do I mean you should be part of our foreign policy somewhere some administrative should should gobble you up\nWell now I'm going to say something that probably some of your listeners are not going to like\nI think we should write a five un a convention on the ... the\nAnd I think a lot of your listeners are going to say oh it says he went in front of it therefore we shouldn't be part of it well the problem is that the UN could come out in the water to see is what we are relying on the couch China that they have no claim to the silent\nAnd it's difficult for us to say you guys are not complying with the law to see what we haven't signed the law to see\nRight we need to find that because if we're going to enforce the law we need to be party to the law so I can understand their reluctance to find some un agreements but I think this one would be in our interest\nThat's a good point where do you get the book tipping point\nTipping point Isabel but any bookstore any online bookseller for the book it's a hardcover book\nAnd it sounds like you really took some time putting just together when can we expect the next one\n[laughter] it takes me a year to write the so the next one will be called um arms flock and it will be out next December\nAll right stay with us we're going to come back in a moment David and take final phone calls here for you as we talk about the novel folks tipping point the war with China the first salvo\nAnd are those who have been on hold but just saying there we'll get to you as soon as we get right back on coast to coast day um and don't forget to like us on Facebook and do follow us on Twitter\nDo too much of a TV show beyond belief was George Nouri simply go beyond belief dot com [noise]\nRather on [laughter] yes we do\nWe do in deed but they're warning signs for people aren't they kind of like wakeup calls\nWell and you can see us responding already or remember three days ago the to be fifty twos have quote got lost um quote yeah in the south China Sea have quote accidentally unquote flew over the Chinese occupied island into this ... um be fifty twos don't get lost not in this century\nOh and they take great pictures\nToo that was a that was definitely a signal that was a signal that we're beginning to signal back you see the thing was um [noise]\nThe ah the period where we were sort of trying to get along is over the period where we were we were trying not to pick them off of it was over the period of alliance building has been gone and the period of ... behavior is beginning who's the aggressor\nUm who's the aggressor I have to say if China or it really has to be China [noise]\nUm the way that they are pushing forward into peaceful areas and establishing claim that they really have no claim to is simply a land grab a sometimes into the ground but basically it's a land grab\nThey're attempting to establish markers and seeing how far\nHow far they can push the boundaries out and they will continue to do that until they establish a how far they can go\nOn commercial doesn't get involved to stop\n'em well that's pretty far pretty far from Russia's sphere of influence these days the uh the USSR had a big enough sleep I may have worldwide basis and they had\nAllies in Vietnam and they had Cam Ranh bay for a base and Russia doesn't really have any allies in that area they have no basis in that area their Navy is much smaller or they don't have that to a fair anymore and their economic base is much smaller who\nYou think China's saying okay the United states shaken worry about the middle east Russia's worried about trying to get their old Soviet Union nations back together as a whole and we're going to concentrate on the south China Sea in the south Pacific\nI think that's exactly what's happening George and are they perceived weakness they perceived to retreat and now they're pushing pushing the envelope\nNear ... they're coming up against Japan and that will be interesting yes\nAs we see Japan is discovering I wouldn't say a new militarism exactly but they're they're discovering a backbone\nWill we go to China's aid if I've to a Japanese Japan's aid if China gets aggressive\nI definitely think so we're committed\nWill we go to China's aid if I've to a Japanese Japan's aid is trying to get to ...\nOh I definitely think so we're committed to South Korea and more committed to Japan and if we left them in the lurch I mean nobody would think much of us\nDo some argument David about whether we should be the policemen of the world\nThat's really that's really one of the things that we create in this book or one of one of them um [noise] one of Dan of um things that he keeps getting in trouble with\nDan mean captain Dan of the United States Navy\nCaptain Dan of us have saved the oil and at the moment or is he has what's called the lens and Dr him\nAnd he didn't call it that but his enemies in Congress are calling up that\nThat his belief is that if a if his ship has the capability to shoot down a ballistic missile right a weapon of mass destruction them he has the moral duty to shoot it down no matter who fired at right\nNow that's a pretty big chunk of it really does make the U.S the world's policeman\nAnd there's some question in Congress and really in my mind to\nAs to what extent we can commit to that do we have the power to back it up because we have the will to back it up or do we have the right to do that further all good questions and those are those are really why I write I I don't ride just to entertain I also like to entertain\nEthical question was asked questions of I don't know the answer to\nLet's go to the phones sure he let us go to Leo in New Mexico west of the Rockies Hello Neal thanks for holding your up\nOr get even George and David a highly I'll show um uh uh yeah it's very astute callers I notice last hour and so uh I've had the kind of modify my original comments in the context of the flow\nAnd I'm going to go out there as in our planet for example I'm I'm curious to know how factual is it a if indeed it is factual as I've heard Don several speculation belief that\nWe have nuclear silos for example that or shut\nDying Monnett extraterrestrial presidents\nThat's my first question and uh the second one is that I've heard some a remote viewers are particularly at games as bill show ... way back to our battle days\nI'm a ... plus he's he states that uh we will not be in a loud to engage in nuclear slug fest as it were what do you think about that\nLet me let me answer those David because that might be a ...\nWell my comment is that that sounds like an Airforce crushed her the rain\n[laughter] we has had some people some experts are military types on the program and they have a testified at various committee hearings and I'm On the program and said that they have witnessed strange objects shutting down our new silos\nOr at will and um these guys are pretty darn credible so oh one never knows one never knows about things like that indeed but the that's for another show

I still look at our moon landing you know Nineteen sixty nine here we are you know forty four\nAreas her arm sorry\nWell we're forty six years later we're still the only ones who've been able to put a man on the moon\nWell but in certain areas I think the Chinese are challenging us for example they have a new stealth code even for aircraft that as far as I Know we don't really understand yet\nWell that's a good point John ... here we go Joseph taken away\nAge you a merry Christmas ...\nUh he uh and happy holidays to you and your guests Tom I Want to ask Dave uh down the a role that the ambassador Caroline Kennedy would have\nA ... she is er and er should in Japan and ... um [noise] I Know that China is desiring ...

surgery and they can get you know their stomach fitted with a band where I had to close off the stomach\nAlmost like these are people that smaller or something like that\nRight exactly exactly so so that person now instead of their stomach thing really large it's the size of like like a like a golf ball it's really small and they get fall very quickly therefore they lose a lot of weight or where\nYou can do that with hypnosis or even a regular hypnosis but with this new way the so the the state way more sleep\nSay is fact so you put somebody into that state and you basically build this story up saying hey you know what\nYour stomach is the size of a golf ball you just simply cannot eat more than five bites the food and what's cool about it is then you can tell them how happy they are to do it\nBecause uh George I'm telling you through the years I've probably did at least thirty people I've worked with that had the real gastric band bought the reason they gained all that we wait to begin with all those problems are still in there you know\nWe have the address fast right so they're really struggling even though they last like a hundred pounds or whatever\nSo in in this fashion you basically say hey you you simply cannot eat more than five bites the food and you're really really happy about it you're really really satisfied and um and then actually after the fact when they lose the weight you can take it away\nIn the bill in the the the state's therapy can you create and we get too dark here what can you create a main cheering candidate skin can you literally make somebody a B a B a monster an assassin whatever\nWhere like I've never tried that no don't try it [laughter] but\nNo I I'm not going to try it but um there there's something to that effect in your conscious mind there's something called you're critical factor where you're critical facilities [noise]\nSo if I came up to you and I said\nYou know you've now decided to be an assassin okay and you enjoy killing people you know blah blah blah blah blah well if I said that to a person in regular hypnosis or I could say that you are right now I'm\nYou know you you you hit the critical factor in the conscious mind\nIn the world whoa whoa whoa wait a minute\nNo no no I mean that goes against my belief systems um no there's no way in the world I'm going to do that however with this other way of doing this or you know the sleep hypnosis the estate way there is no critical factor\nIt's sleeping so what you say is fact for the subconscious mind so\nTight pathetically year might be able to do something like that\nSo tell me how did you tie this hypnosis into this ... where a realm how did that happen\n[noise] well in in my regular hypnosis sessions for years I I really considered myself the clinician you know\nI I didn't really conduct a lot of past life regrets shows and I really kind of went by the book however I developed this um this other way to do hypnosis some I briefly explain so let's say you're coming to me and let's say you're clinically depressed\nAnd I would I'd I'd ask you before the session the one that's just the worst at let's say you said well in the morning it's it's worse in one I'm Alone that's what I feel depressed\nSo in a in a hypnosis session there's something called parts therapy\nSo I I wouldn't have you identify the part with them you that wants to be happy to feel good and I would have you actually literally imagining it in a chair and give it a shape a feeling and then we would name it with them\nThe part that's causing the depression and we put it in a chair and you give it a shape the ceiling\nAnd the name and then what I Do is I talk directly with\nThe closet to part I talked to her ethically with the the part that's causing the depression ... what the heck's going up and surprisingly about maybe twenty percent of the time that part that's causing the problem\nActually is not a part of the person it's actually a spiritual attachment\nAnd spiritual attachment it could be um a deceased Percival or it could be I guess you could see it like this like like a demon like a negative energy\nSo after you know doing this for for you know several years I became very good at it to find out if this part that's causing the problem is really a part of that person or is it a spiritual attachment\nAnd that's when things get pretty interesting that the honest with you you know I mean I've asked the the national team you know why are you doing this\nTo see my client you know why why are you giving them migraine headaches and I've heard things like because it's fun you know things like that I'm like whoa so I'm the spiritual realm really ... you know it really comes into play\nAnd especially when they're thinking conscious mind isn't there um you can tap you know you can have a long long conversations with people's spirits guides um you can request them to pass lies you can actually progress them into the future\nSo the spiritual part of the things really it really comes into play quite a bit\nNow ... years in the hypnotic state in the spirit world I mean do they communicate with somebody who's passed on I mean what what are you able to do with them\nWell I'm\nYou know like I said if there's a problem it could be a spiritual attachment so you know I can get the person's name is related to the person I'm I've I've seen several times where\nThe the attachment actually is is mom who passed away you know or uncle Joe\nSo um you can do that um when you talk to a person's spirit\nGuide we all have\nAt least one or two spirits assigned to us right uh usually it's more like four or five so what you can do with that is before the session you can you know I can ask my my client and say hey you are there any questions that you'd like to get the answer\nAnd it could be personal questions it could be like you know what is my purpose\nIn life you know ... or they're trying to make a decision you know should I Do this or should I Do that so you can get all of that person's questions answered which is really pretty cool\nUm so what you can do is you can get healing done on that person's body [noise]\nSo what I like to do is like if they have a specific problem or if they have some kind of specific physical problem I Will call that up to the spirit guide I also always have the spirit guide to like uh\nYou communicate with Tim do you communicate with the spirit guide to the person who's been hypnotized\n[noise] yeah that's the way it works um I I basically have that spirit you lose the whole race of the person then hit\nAll while you're talking to that spirit guide\nYeah that was amazing how\nUm I guess technically that's called channeling your channeling that spirit and they're talking through the whole ... of the person and to know\nHow do you know that when you're doing this because I'm looking at the hip to entice person almost like a ... G board how do you know that that spirit that's coming through is legit and not some demon for example trying to trick you\nYeah good point when I was already do prefer aren't getting into traveling and spirit\nAnd it's a waste of protection so like I actually set of protection for the show and then you're stashed in before we get to that point um there there are so techniques that you can do to ... Percival with white white and to protect them\nAll right let's let's talk about that protection when we come back in just a moment Tim Bartley is our special guest we're talking about hypnotism next hour we'll take your calls if you've ever been hypnotized checked in with us that will be back get\nDaily Show updates right to your inbox for free with the coast noon newsletter sign up to the coast to coast am dot com\nAnd actually that's a really good idea for like ghost hunter's can only do you watch these goes hunting shows and sometimes they'll go counter will go into like a haunted location and say okay if if you want to attack anybody you can attack me [laughter] you know which is ridiculous why would you ever want that right\nSo um yeah having a protection you know it's really important or you you don't want to have any kind of attachments folly home so to speak\nThat no that's absolutely right and it could be dangerous for you to him as the hip to test for these things to leak through\n[laughter] yeah exactly exactly and you know\nAlso you you you want to make sure that the spirit you know there's there's no doubt that you can channel spirits and talk to them but if you get a spirit that are not the nicest end to the you know they could give you like Ninety five percent accurate information\nAnd then the last five percent they might be like yanking your chain you know how to I mean so are you really want to protect against that kind of thing as well\nAs anybody under hypnosis gone into any kind of ... or anything like that\n[noise] yeah I've had that happen a couple of times\nLike what I said before I had this one woman and I don't know it was like five six years ago she was coming to me for migraine headaches and she walks in and she's all like to do her and she had these really thick glasses on subtle some classes and you know she was feeling really horrible\nAnd in her sessions you know the part that was causing the migraines was a spiritual detachment and I asked it you know why why are you doing this to her and this is that's ... that's what I've heard this a couple of times but\nIt's sad because it's fun and her voice drops like too often\nAt all by then I heard that a couple of times\nLike it's because it's on something like that\nYeah pretty much all so I did a session once with this man and he said that every time he closed his eyes and I'm Talking just blinking she would feel the shimmering word that would say you know tell that\nAll these negative shimmering words that\nTurned out to be an attachment and um I kind of built up the story to get rid of it I said you know this is you know my client his name was bill and remember this so I'm like Bill has trained she's not negative anymore and like the tracks lay there for you negative\nEnergy you have no place here any more\nSo as to count on one you're going you know we're vanishing you were getting rid of you\nKnow so it does that count ten down and a woman at the counter one I can you not\nAll the lights and my roommate went out and then they turned back on and it was like a bomb exploded in the room like like the shock wave of a bomb and uh after the session\nYou don't laugh and he's like oh yeah so that was that was pretty tripped out [laughter]\nAnd people learn to the states there will be on their own and put themselves in into a hypnotic state\nYeah yes you can um I I look at this this thing that I've developed more as like a meditative process and for you to learn it you know anybody can learn it anybody can do\nTherapy sessions or conduct spiritual session\nAnd I'm really what it is in the training it's the script that I came up with and you have to use your voice properly but\nTo do it for yourself here's the thing once you're conditioned to enter this thing you can answer it very very quickly and so if you if you learn this you could use like self hypnosis\nOr you could record you know things like on your computer\nFor things that you would like to work out for yourself so one shirt condition to ensure the state it's kind of like well what are you on you know do you want endless energy or do you want an overall feeling of well being and happiness um\nHow would you like to really dislike\nFattening foods and how would you like to really love to exercise you know and it goes on and on and on and and you can you can pull out spirit guide all the time to talk to them or because they're always trying to talk to you or that that's\nThe number one thing I hear all the time when I'm Talking to them I always ask hey have you been trying to talk to you know my client let's say the clients name is\nJoe okay you know spirit guide have you been trying to talk to Joe mentally yes and has even listening to you know [laughter] I hear that all the time\nWhat is ... what is the criteria for the spirit guide to be the spirit guide\nWell the way I understand it and what I've seen over\nUm they are basically your friends on the other side you know their their friends um a lotta times that there are people that you know a for instance for me unfortunately my sister passed away two thousand nine\nAnd she's now one of my spirit guide and I actually communicate with her rather frequently so\nA lot of times it's it's a cease loved ones or friends on the other side that that step in and each spirit guide they have like their own task\nYou know like one might help you in one part of your life while another one helps you in another part of your life and they and they do rotate they do change out\nThe ability for you to hypnotize someone and for them to stay in this induced state what is the longest time period gym you've had somebody under\nProbably about three hours that's a long time yeah yeah it is um\nDo you have to keep reinforcing the hypnosis to keep them under once in a row under the under\nYeah pretty much once they're under the under um the whole going deeper into hypnosis or being under\nKind of miss perceived ... like I was saying before when you don't want to read blur hypnosis the thinking conscious mind is still there you know it's just kind of pushed to the side um when you go into the the the state or the sleep hypnosis the conscious mind is gone\nSo either way you can have a very very long session with the person\nAnd I'm the only thing that might pop 'em out is like if you know like their arm fell asleep or ... or something like that you know or they're physically had where they had to go to the bathroom you know [laughter] in the middle of the session that can happen sometimes\nHave you ever had a session where you couldn't pull somebody out of a bean hypnotized and they were like stuck there\nAre no that that actually cannot happen um you know if you think about it hypnosis is just brainwaves that's all it is we have a beta health a beta in delta brainwaves so like when you're away your your brain waves are very fast\nKinda tightly knit together then when your brainwaves slowed down a little bit you go on to something that they called el ...\nAnd that kind of like when you're at work let's say in your daydreaming about being at the beach or something and then somebody comes up and says well hey Tim as like oh oh\nOh yeah Hi you know kind of thing and then under that is data which is hypnosis slash a meditative state and then under that is with Dell child\nWhich is a dream less sleep\nSo if you're in any of those rounds somebody can come up and and wake you up or snap the out of it instantly so a hypnosis is really that the the area so you you can't get stopped going it was pretty much impossible\nWhen you're driving in some people have no recollection on how they got from point a to point B rather than they just got there and and they kind of forget the dry been between these that self hypnosis what is that\n... yeah it is not a why that happens is you're staring through the windshield and you know their assignments and trees passing you in your career field vision\nRight and when you focus\nOn something your brainwaves slow down so like when you drive you know like how did I get here or or if you remember being back in school and the teachers just kind of rambling on and on and on you know and then you kind of come back\nIn your life I have no idea what you just said [laughter] you know a vast hypnosis so we're or you can simply stare at it had a doubt on a wall for five minutes and you're going to have relative so it's really just focusing on one thing basically just wanted", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey
