they're looking at\nI'll tell you I can speak from experience we we looked at making an app for our podcast network and we actually\nSpend a lotta money on it a with a developer a and we wanted to do I owe us in Android and it more than double the cost it's a big deal [noise] usually it's a separate team because people who can write fryer west our Android developers or\nSometimes and this is what they were our this company was going to do for us they they use software that works on both they made I guess a bad choices software they never got to ap running it ... they did but it was so bad\nI couldn't possibly push it out and we were at a lot of money I don't want to tell you that much 'cause it's embarrassing uh so yeah I'm a ... it's a it's an economic decision and they probably look and see and they say well you know almost everybody\nWho's doing mixing an stages is using an eye pad\nSo you know we're not going to do it for granted there's also the issue of there are a lot of different Android devices if you make it for the eye pad it's easy because you know only apple makes I pads there aren't very many to make it for an Android platform you don't know what you're getting\nThere's also another issue which I think they've licked in the latest versions of Android they've been working on ... based on Linux that uses a Linux colonel and Linux has a built in issue with late and see\nThat makes it very hard to use for real time music applications one of the reasons and this is one of the one of the big categories is music that Iowa\nHas a huge lead on handwriting probably always will because of this late in the issue and it's for live music applications so it may well be that they don't feel like the Android platform his performance enough for them to even work on so I'm just giving you all the potential\nReasons [laughter] why they may not do it but all you can really do is big um there is no way that I Know of to run Iowa saps on Android period I Know that's what you really want there's no way to do it\nUh that's that's Apple's\nProprietary platform it's the same reason you can't run Mac\nOS on a on a windows machine while you can but they call it a hacking Tosh for a reason there's no hacking touched that I Know of it lets you run Iowa is on a on any Android device\nIt really requires a apple lock that down to a certain ships that the difference is ... ... on on Macintosh they're using standard piece\nThat's going to change by the way it's widely agreed that apple is going to move to using its own ships on Macintosh computers\nChips it designs\nAnd when that happens in the next couple of years I think it will be around twenty twenty you you won't be able to run hacking touches either they've already got that\nKind of walking on Iowa so there is no such thing I'm Sorry\nYou're stuck with getting yourself and I had the good news is new eye patch come out on a Tuesday or at least will be announced on

those botanical that is so absolutely so amazing David ... guy that has overcome severe issue\n[noise] [noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay\nAh where they yeah they separate the monkeys head and then they re attached it or just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to\nA level of success with monkeys and so now emboldened\nBy that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who has been quoted a frequently or\nWho is a quadriplegic ah you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig and\nThere are scientists who are over her quoted as saying yeah they're going to do it so we're once again you know remember\nI'm I'm old enough to remember the first artificial heart transplant\nSure yeah remember that uh the jar Vic a sure he um what was his name Jobbik writer yeah something like that and um\nEverybody cringed at all my way way putting them which lab mechanical hard in a human being and you know was in South Africa right and yeah he jumped in and and and and\nAnd you know now artificial hearts are pretty routine thing although now you know with stem cell research and other things going on um you know we are even getting past mechanical hearts hey by the way in a you talk about things that give me some pause here's one\nThere are three groups of scientists in California and Minnesota and you know I read that it's like Minnesota that's like so random but okay there you are\nNo you're right that the minute University of Minnesota's a monster recently do you have a huge research you it's a it's an hour one it's a big school\nNo no you're right you're right I just I just I don't know why this gives me an uncle but anyway you have three groups of scientists who are creating a creatures that have never walked the face of the earth before they're called ... really there shape human and pick human ... so these are\nCreatures whose DNA has been together using human DNA and she'd be in a or human DNA picking a and they're creating these creatures because they will have human Oregon they will have human kidneys\nHuman livers human hearts for the purpose of you know transplanting them to patients and neat\nAnd you know I get that I had a friend who who died recently because his kidneys just went south and he couldn't get a transplant and boom\nAh but now what that's done is to raise the very real possibility and I discuss in the book that if you put too much human DNA into the recipe you know so it's always a question\nToo much human DNA too little human DNA then you don't get the human Oregon's right if you put in too much DNA then you can have an animal a creature\nThat thinks like him and that has basically human brain trapped inside of a body of a sheep or a pig I mean these these are the things that are very real now because of our ability to tamper with DNA um so that's one of the things that gives me it gives me a little bit later that we really\nAnd now because of our ability to tamper with DNA um so that's one of the things that give me give me a little bit later that we really wanted to and what's interesting is that\nThese guys are doing it and by the way I quote one of the researchers it says yeah that's that's a real are really so there's not like you know made up of pie in the sky I mean they even the researchers admits yeah we got to be careful this possibility\nBut they're doing this research against the wishes of the anti age the national institutes of health which is the government never won funding body for biological genetic engineering so even the anti age it's kind of very um [noise] yeah you know forward thinking funding organization is saying you know maybe we should just push the pause button\nAnd decide do we want to do this and if so what are the guidelines for the guard rails\nAre I'm sure that I'm sure these guys are not just doing it a violation of the age they're probably doing it against the advice of their moms and what do you do yeah yeah they don't mind\nThe oh my God it reminds me when I was growing up in east LA and then ... the town over and I was a real geek I mean I was speaking out when I was a kid and I found a way to make hydrogen gas using stuff that I found my mom's kitchen and I look back at I'm Out there in the garage at the ... of our how\n[laughter] making hydrogen gas and you know that stuff is explosive\nYou know below I Would filled balloons up with it and then send little insects are locked just to see what happens is that the uh I was reading a little mad scientists and area to create\nYour own space program against their will run by the way\nGuys that come area you're right the mothers I say why don't you know I get it right not filling that already go this is all play tiddlywinks\nOr something safer\nMentioned LA as you mentioned earlier when you mentioned that the the game is still tied in the fifteenth between Boston and LA you kidding me know so I just thought I'd insane thinning\nFifteens any game three of the world series Richard tweeted out on Twitter he said he's listening to this show and watching\nThe uh the world series game he said it's like sinking a pink Floyd in the wizard of Oz he said the kind of works and so I don't know I I guess I guess that means I'm committed a lot of errors ... when it snows happening but right now still there's two men on top of the fifteenth and we'll keep an eye on it\nSo sorry Joe ... the the island of Dr Morrow things pretty scary it really is but I I I still you know now do you think of what the technology that people you see all the commercials for\nWhich I'm you know we're Siri you know what how cold is it outside I don't want to look out a window Siri is it snowing\nYou know or you know Google ... ... ... you know by me some more uh ten meet whatever in these commercials or the ... everybody's focused on that type of business and I kinda get\nIt but there were just beginning to learn the down side of having a microphone connected um and and monitored inside of one's house aren't we\nYeah and that's another it's interesting you bring that up because that was on my short\nList of things to worry about and that's the other thing we're bringing about ourselves okay you're a ... if you're absolutely right I tell the story of a little girl in Dallas texas who use the Amazon Echo or you know and said hey Alexa buy me a bunch of cookies hey Alexa by me ... you know this a\nDollhouse fancy fancy dollhouse and parents were totally clueless stuff starts arriving at the house the parents freak out but here's the punch line and you would think that\nParents were totally clueless stuff starts arriving at the house the parents freak out but here's the punch line and you would think that the parents\nWill have learned a lesson and like ditch the echo you know get rid of it ah but instead I have the mother quoted as saying you know we need to whisper around ... Alexa now are you\nKidding me I mean that's the take away having leaders are oh yeah I Know it's so\nBig brother in a way to because it's not just I mean that story and ... and again I remind people will get to the phones you're coming up sorority ringing in little line of people to to talk with Michael deal in the end of life as we know it in a few but\nBut that story out of turkey about the supposedly the audio recording that was made by this guy ... um you know apple watch\nThat they were able to monitor his apple watch and record his torture and just now I I don't know that I Believe that I don't know that it really really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter\nMay be in there in the Saudi constantly that they have a they have Google and they had the Little Syria or whatever and they monitor that way but however\nIt happened that kind of the debt that passive\nListening that is going on now we have not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are communities\nAnd for the security of our country I just had an op ed that is going to be published very shortly I'm a U.S a Congress issued a report on Thursday so\nA saying that um the Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nThe bigger the kind of a ... year three injuring or your dishwasher everything that's going to have\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's the the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on\n... there are now a more than a billion Internet uh of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book\nAnd the Chinese are ... see this as an opportunity to buckets to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you talk about the show he thing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed a one story and the police looked into it or his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a face woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so\nThey downloaded the data from the fit fit and they found out that the they could actually get this\nCalculate how many feet chi walk\nAnd it didn't square with the story from the hospital and then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology out at this husband he ended up being charged with murder because of this this kind of a Internet of things\nThat are fine on every aspects of our life they can tell you when you're at sleep when you're awake how many feet you are\nWhat your heart rate I you know it if you watch Netflix the the the they they download what you're watching when how for how long I mean\nThere ... this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but we've invited on ourselves than we are well these gadgets\nYeah and I like a ... a lot of them I mean I I wear an apple watch by the way they use that as a plot device that thing about the fitbit in a ... a law and order episode last week the ... same thing or or took it from the real life oh they do maybe they are they always do no\nRipped from today's headlines so he uh but that's where I mean I\nI think that they like to catch a killer is one thing they ... they go oh good they got a killer because of the ... the hard part will be is when evidence is presented in court that's collected from some of these ancillary passive data collection systems\nWhich accidentally convicts somebody who didn't commit a crime I mean that that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test of this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI\nBut that's going to be the real test of this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI now having this humongous database of face prince\nRight or that they mentioned covering\nThe yeah and and and and they have like a eighty they they allow themselves in eighty percent accuracy rate for the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent inaccuracy route with which raises the possibility that you and I\nCan have the FBI knocking on our doors because they think we committed a crime based on their database but the facial recognition technology that they're using to id and could finger culprits is wrong twenty percent of the time and and by the way\nResearchers who are looking into it from Australia and elsewhere are saying it's it's more than twenty percent and so this this is what you just described is a very real possibility now where innocent people\nAre going to be fingered by a by a screen up\nA Michael deal in the end of life as we know that let's get you Keith who's in Virginia on coast to coast am key\nHello can you hear me am perfectly\nGood ah how are you tonight on my own turned back up\nThere you go and get a question from Michael\nYes Michael and I heard you were speaking about the ah Jarvis cart have a couple of friends one of which I Would be a great guess because of his varied experience and service even as a whistle blower this call them coast to coast and before but uh it'd be great to have them on to\nTell a story about a lot of things [noise] um one of the um the predecessors of that artificial heart was a a heart open heart surgery that was a heart lung machine\nAnd Dr wrestling Nelson a worked on that at the University of Minnesota I understand that the sharp a cart was at the University of Utah\nAnd some Thirty years earlier and he and his career as a heart surgery I\nHad some paranormal experience is one of which was a where he did a surgery that a technique that had never been done before\nAnd he describes it as after praying to know what to do that basically a ... or whatever it was quite right in his mind any did the surgery a\nFrom those instructions said he was able to see in his mind and later I\nGot to get you a question because there's so many people who have questions for Michael so do you want to hang on for an open line called that sounds more like that but did you have a question from Michael\nThat could be yeah I'm a law that wrestling Nelson by the way is\nI'm going to put you on hold I'm going to put you on hold right now and we just let me get back to it because I knew there were ... we have our time is pressures in I open lines is where that kind of blown\nSo let me go to a Tracy who is trucking in Alabama with a question for Michael Guillen Tracy\nMichael I got one question for you here where does it end whereas you just stop why do we stop playing God\nOr are we ... we this is a good question I mean are we playing God yet and when do we play God is maybe another question but Michael\nWell I think that is the ultimate question that Tracey is asking and uh you know I I call\nMichael [noise] well I think that is the ultimate question that Tracey is asking and uh you know I I call a very well known biologist in the book\nUm who was actually a a major participant in in mapping the human genome remember the human genome project sure it wrapped up in two thousand and three and there was a big ceremony\nAnd the White House Bill Clinton was president he said now we have discovered the language of God now that we've mapped the human genome well this biologist Craig Venter I quote him in the book\nAnd ... and it's a very telling quote and I\nHave to be careful but he says you know when it comes to biology we don't know blank I'm not going to use the word he uses but he was when it comes to biology we don't know blank now this is a guy who was in the thick of it\nAnd this this is directly an answer to Tracy is excellent question that in effect what Craig Venter is in South is saying is look we're we're toying with something we don't know squat about and and and that is a recipe for dangerous picture\nA child playing with matches or worse than that plane with a nuclear bomb or playing with a dynamite you know you pick your you you pick your image imagery and that is really the picture that emerges when you read my book\nWhatever you think about the technology and there's a lot of positive but let's keep in mind that you can have Ninety nine positive consequences wonderful sunshine positive consequences like the neural prosthetics but all it takes is one thinker that Canadian within\nRight there but it was everything else\nBut I think that's the crux to um the playing God premise are we playing God or are we when we cure a disease if the diseases natural it was as God made it natural in Europe is hurricanes\nAre we not playing God when we cure a disease\nI I I I get what you're saying and that's why I tend to avoid this phrase although I Know it's a popular phrase phrase ...\nThat's what I'm saying it's too weak to use for the context as it doesn't really encompass all the ways in which you know when we make better break pad\nOr do I mean there were always attempting to try to save lives and sometimes those will come with unintended consequences but it wasn't really a matter of playing God I I think it's more true with the ... thing I think that gets into a very weird area though [laughter]\nYeah no no I agree and and I I think you know what it's like when we restore sight the blind with these retinal transplants I I mean that can be said we're playing ... so what I like to do is look I when I was at ABC News I covered the Persian Gulf War story you remember when they lift the oil fields on fire oh totally\nI was I was the first TV correspondent to actually find my way to those oil fill a oh a oil fields that were on fire and the way I had to get there was through a minefield we got a guy from aramco the you're a Saudi Arabian oil company he knew way through the mind feels\nAnd so that's how I I think of traces question is I see as their I see as navigating a minefield\nAnd as you know so far we've been able to avoid to a stepping on that one mind it's gonna do it in but as we progress with some of the stuff that is unsettling and outright dangerous never mind the great stuff okay\nThat's gonna sunshine I as I say all it takes for us to do is to step on that one mind that won the hidden mine and it's just going to blow us up okay remains to be seen I think that will be the end if it\nI don't mind that one hit and mine and it's just going to blow us up\nOkay Mississippi thing I think that will be the end if it comes that way but no I don't have it in\nOkay so you're the scientist you're the you're the you got the PHD in physics [noise]\nTV phone

echo you know get rid of it ah but instead I have a mother quoted as saying you know we need to whisper\nEarned a lesson and like ditch the echo you know get rid of it ah but instead I have the mother quoted as saying you know we need to whisper around Alexa now are you\nKidding me I mean that's the takeaway having leaders are oh yeah I Know right it's\nSo big brother in a way to because it's not just I mean that story and ... and again I remind people will get to the phones you're coming up they're already ringing in will line of people to to talk with Michael deal in the end of life as we know it in a few but\nBut that story out of turkey about the supposedly the audio recording that was made by this guy ... um you know apple watch\nThat they were able to monitor his apple watch in record his torture and death now I don't know that I Believe that I don't know the new ... really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter may be in there in the ... they have a they have Google and they had the Little Syria or whatever and they monitor that way but however\nIt happened that kind of the debt that passive\nListening that is going on that we have not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships a park communities\nAnd for the security of our country I just had an op ed that is going to be published very shortly I'm a U.S a Congress issued a report on Thursday so\nA saying that um the Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about the\nVideos that kind of a ... year three injuring or your dishwasher everything that's going to is\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's or the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on\n... there are now are more than a billion Internet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book\nAnd the Chinese or the this as an opportunity to bug us to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home\nYou talk about the show key thing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nMichael before we start getting all these calls waiting for you let's ruled that story back about twenty seconds before we can cause I was ... I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [laughter]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it or his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing of these women wearing to fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so\nThey downloaded the data from the fit fit and they found out that the they could actually get this\nCalculate how many feet chi walk\nAnd it didn't square with the story from the hospital and then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology out at this husband he ended up being charged with murder because of this this kind of a Internet of things\nThat are fine on every aspects of our life that can tell you when you're asleep when you're awake how many feet you are\nWhat your heart rate uh you know if you watch Netflix the the the they they download what you're watching when how for how long I mean there ... this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but we've invited\nIt on ourselves than we\nAre well these gadgets yeah and I like a ... a lot of them I mean I were an apple watch by the way they use that as a plot device that thing about the fitbit in a ... a law and order episode last week the exact same thing people are already took it from the real life oh they do maybe they are they always do no\nRipped from today's headlines so he uh\nBut that's where I mean I I think that they like to catch a killer is one thing they people literally go oh good they caught a killer because of the ... the hard part will be is when evidence is presented in court\nThat's collected from some of these ancillary passive data collection systems which accidentally convict somebody who didn't commit the crime I mean that that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test of this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI now\n... database of face prince\nRight or that they don't you cover in\nThe ... yeah and and and and they have like a eighty they they allow themselves in eighty percent accuracy rate so the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent inaccuracy room with which raises the possibility that you and I\nGot to have the FBI knocking on our doors because they think we committed a crime based on their database but the facial recognition technology that they're using to id and could finger culprits is wrong twenty percent of the time and and by the way\nResearchers who are looking into it from Australia and elsewhere are saying it's it's more than twenty percent and so this this is what you just described is a very real possibility now where innocent people\nAre going to be fingered by a by\nA screen up\nA McGill in the end of life as we knew it let's get you Keith who's in Virginia coast to coast am key\nHello can you hear me in a perfectly good ah how are you tonight on my own turned back up there you go and get a question from Michael\nYes Michael and I heard you were speaking about the ah John cart have uh a couple of friends one of which I Would be a great guess because of his very experience\nAnd service even as a whistle blower this call them coast to coast and before but uh it'll be great to have them on\nTo tell a story about a lot of things um warmly um predecessors that artificial heart was a a heart open heart honestly that was a heart lung machine\nAnd Dr wrestling Nelson or\nWorked on that at the University of Minnesota understand that the sharp a cart was at the University of Utah and some Thirty years earlier and he and his career as a heart surgery I\nHad some paranormal experience is one of which was a where he did a surgery that a technique that it's never been done before\nAnd he describes it as after praying to know what to do that basically it's ... or whatever it was ... right in his mind and he did the surgery a\nFrom most instructions said he was able to see it in his mind and later I\nGot to get you a question because there's so many people who have questions for Michael so do you want to hang on for an open line called the sounds more like that but did you have a question from Michael\nAnd that could be yeah I'm I wanted her someone else and by the way is\nI'm going to put you on hold I'm going to put you on hold right now and we just let me get back to it because I knew there were ... we had our time is pressures and I open lines is where that kind of blown\nSo let me go to a Tracy who is trucking in Alabama with a question for Michael Guillen Tracy\nYeah Michael I got one question for you here where ... where did you just stop when do we stop playing God\nOr are we can't we those are good question I mean are we playing God yeah and when do we play God is maybe another question but Michael [noise]\nWell I think that is the ultimate question that trace he's asking and uh you know I I quote a very well known biologist in the book um who was actually a a major participant in in mapping the human genome remembered the humans\nWrapped up in two thousand and three and there was a big ceremony and the White House Bill Clinton was president he said now we have discovered the language of God now that we've mapped the human genome well this biologist Craig Venter I hold him in the book\nAnd ... and it's a very telling quote and I have to be careful but he says\nYou know when it comes to biology we don't know blank I'm not going to use the word he uses but he was when it comes to biology\nWe don't know blank now this is a guy who was in the thick of it and this this is directly an answer to Tracy is excellent question that in effect what Craig Venter is in South is saying is look we're work toying with something we don't know squat about\nAnd and and that is a recipe for dangerous picture\nA child playing with matches or worse than that plane with a nuclear bomb or playing with a dynamite you know you pick your your your pick ... imagery and that is really the picture that emerges when you read my book\nWhatever you think about the technology and there's a lot of positive but let's keep in mind that you're going to have Ninety nine positive consequences wonderful sunshine positive consequences like the neural prosthetics but all it takes is one thinker that\nCanadian within right that does everything else\nBut I think that's the crux two of the playing God premise are we playing God or are we when we cure a disease if the diseases natural it was as God made it natural in Europe is hurricanes\nAre we not playing God when we cure a disease\nI I I I get what you're saying and that's why I tend to avoid this phrase although I Know it's a popular phrase phrase right and\nThat's what I'm saying is two weeks to use for the context as it doesn't really encompass all the ways in which you know when we make a better break pad\nOr do I mean there were always attempting to try to save lives and sometimes those will come with unintended consequences but it was really a matter of playing God I I think it's true with the ... thing I think that gets into a very weird area though [laughter]\nYeah no no I agree and and I I think you know what it's like when we restore sight the blind with these retinal transplant I I mean that can be said we're playing ... so I what I like to do is look I when I was at ABC News I covered the Persian Gulf War story you remember when they lift the oilfields on fire oh totally\nI was I was the first TV correspondent to actually find my way to those oil fill a oh a oil fields that were on fire and the way I had to get there was through a minefield we got a guy from aramco the a Saudi Arabian oil company he knew way through the mind feels\nAnd so that's how I I think of trace this question is I see as their I see us navigating a mine field\nAnd you know so far we've been able to avoid a stepping on that one line that's going to do it in but as we progress with some of the stuff that is unsettling and outright dangerous nevermind a great stuff okay\nThat's gonna sunshine but I as I say all it takes for us to do is to step on that one mind that won the hidden mine\nAnd it's just going to blow us up\nOkay we're Mississippi thing I think that will be the end if it comes that way but now I Am committed\nSo you're the side just you're the you're the you got to a PHD in physics let me just give you and I think is a better metaphor though for science is is we had to get you had you know let's see the the goal is the other side of that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "28"}
