or none of the above you take your car back that you own money on\nOr if signed a lease on that's effectively a voluntary repossession and that that would be dumb because they're going to sell the car after they've repossessed it and uh they're anal\nRepossession lot and then they're going to sue you for the difference if you don't pay them the difference immediately\nAnd you don't have the difference 'cause you're broke so I don't know that would be a dumb idea we're not going to do that [noise] um what we are going to do is find out two pieces of information one is called the car free ... company that you are paying the ... to ...\nAnd find out what the early buyout on the car is now the early buyout is different than a total of your lease payments pleasure really drove out you at the end it should be less because you're these leases are very new and there should be it's kind of like an overly pay off I'm Alone\nIt doesn't include all the interest from the time that the ... from keeping alone the whole time show the early buyout as you're only pay off now\nNow that was what strikes by the car off and get the title in your hand then you compare that to KB dot com Kelley

car for sixteen\nYou've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer and so um\nYou have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able

you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the differences greater\nAnd you do more damage to your life at least more control of your life by doing a repossession\nAnd so you cover the difference cover their mouth that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather you'll be four thousand dollars\nIn debt than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the

said Dave Ramsey is talking about oh la permanent insurance not core folly of a permanent insurance which is what you\nDo it it's still bad shall we still didn't get the term\n... he doesn't know much about Dave Ramsey\n[laughter] because they Ramsey does not ever invest I was real clearing the lesson you heard me yeah when you are never tell you under any circumstances to use life insurance as an investment vehicle\nOne hundred percent of the time it sucks\nSo would you say because what we told him we wanted to do it\nWhen I Would say you need a new financial advisor okay that's what I Would show you you don't have a financial adviser you have a life insurance salesman okay the selling you insurance\nSo what we were thinking we should do is switch to four hundred thousand just the term H. and then that money where your because it was like three hundred dollars a month for trial the law yeah um and just go ahead and open up our boss Roth are IRA and start getting money into that\nAnd then that mutual funds okay it's exactly what you learn in class was it yeah so you already knew what she said yeah he just language tells me one of the things he did this guy's a liar or he's are ignorant but he's a family friend isn't the\nI'm actually one of our friends just apparently gave them our number became a youth and for as well\nYeah yeah okay so I I don't know which is I mean I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I never in my life told someone to buy life insurance as an investment under any brand heading name or description ever\nRight and the last thing it on our term policy um on your car you said you know Twenty years Thirty years whatever was on ... and our term policy with until we were eighty with hand [laughter]\nOkay\nWhy don't you jump on the lander insurance dot com and see what you can buy a twenty year level term policy for I think it's going to blow your mind how much is guys over charge you for everything you sold you OK okay and you're probably going to end up just canceling everything with him so this kind of really needs a good firing\nOkay that sounds like what we're getting a deal I'm In the end of this week\nAll right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... never for some reason I heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically\nUm the people who sell investment based or whole life or permanent\nLive or portfolio or universal or anything where there is an investment going into insurance\nAre not happy with me they don't like me and so they\nGenerally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business\nBecause they say oh crap crap\nOkay it's pretty simple so here's the thing when you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return regardless of what they quote you after\nThey take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to four years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out and fees even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been in a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your body\nAnd that's where you should be when you die\nWith cash value permanent portfolio universal indexed universal life insurance\nThey pay only the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone\nSo you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you a better rate of return and when you die they keep it all\nThe bad savings account it's bad investment broker the pay the the life insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more\nThan you would pay for term insurance an older that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap and that's what they Ramsey has always said for twenty five years here on the air upset at them for twenty five years is alive owned myself\nI have never owned while this show is operating\nAny kind of whole life or investment based life insurance of any kind ever now I did get a horrible northwestern mutual whole life grotesque old school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives\nWhen I was in my early twenties and there was the same way Britain they it was a guy\nMy wife knew from college came around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from it I had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was\nAnd got rid of it and since then I have never on that and since then I've never told anyone to buy\nAnything other than Fifteen to twenty year\nTerm life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you the best way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shops several companies the best way to buy insurance of any kind of similar broker the shops several companies\nAnd get you the best possible deal or that your car insurance your homeowner's insurance\nYour long term care insurance your life insurance or insurance\nOf any kind of lead a broker shop among several companies and get you the best ... and that's why we've endorsed for about Twenty years ... insurance Jeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my\nPersonal life insurance from Zander and I don't own Zander insurance on our own any of it that is there a lot is always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the Dave Ramsey endorsement but the reason he done well is he said he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price\nRamsey endorsement but the reason he done well is he said he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price\nOn her life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds and they don't sell your name the list of people when you go on there either so that's ... it's real simple takes care of you guys you the listener\nAnd you need to get term life insurance have been cost that much so just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank\nYou for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that yet again yet again yet again yet again yet again yes you need life insurance out by the way a broker ... you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with to get what they you know usually a nurse local providers\nFor your for what we call PNC property in casual yes your corner homeowner's insurance\nYou can shop most people say three to eight hundred dollars a year on the\nWhen you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agent in the business captive agent can sell for one company like a state for a major part nationwide in Asia\nPeyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent was a nationwide that's nationwide and\nAnd they're both good guys I like both of them something to do that and what you're paying for those guys when you when you use that insurance is ... it's built in and neither one of those guys were cheap I'll just tell you this is the day Ramsey shower\n\nFocus is one of my favorite times of year the kids in school football season is here and people everywhere are preparing for their new routines well while you were in preparation mode think about this one was the last time he checked on your financial plant you heard me or do you even have\nSo you do whatever you want it will be your friend either way but the way I live my life is how I answer questions on this show because it's brought me great wealth and great piece and great prosperity and a great sustainability and up terms and in down times\nEnjoy to not have a showroom or named country wide on my\nBack bank of America on my back can't even imagine it's been so long since I've had him that just ... I think I Would probably like having anxiety attack it would be bad call was with us and Pennsylvania have caller welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nI gave thanks for taking my call I appreciate it sure was up hey I've got a good problem that I'm hoping he can give you some advice on I'm forty eight years old would that free uh recently at our house off\nYeah the way to go and\nYeah we're happy about that a decided to sell off some investments just to do that people kind of said well why would you do that other people's money you're low interest that's right and I tell you what the peace of mind is great but I had a good problem I have is we were able to\nSell some stock options and I've got about five or six hundred thousand dollar suit that I'm trying to figure out what to do with a mix you read about the same amount in four one K. which I have to be in the market\nUm I'm a little nervous about possibly also invest in the amount of money in the market and I'm\nFive foot palms we for about ten home in the past and I'm thinking about using that money to buy a rental property you know outright mhm and uh and do that and maybe diversify a little more than I Want to hear what your thoughts were on that\nOkay um I think is excellent if you've got the stomach for real estate real estate gives you a better return when the stock market will give you but it's a higher hassle factor yup it is you know you put my mutual funds I don't bother you you know but you you put and put a winner\nHouse they go out here [laughter]\nAnd so there's a ... you know you've got the hassle of buying it you got to pay the taxes you got to pay the insurance I mean they're dealing with managing real estate all the aspects of it is a national fact I've got a bunch of it I'm not by far I have more in real estate than I Do in the stock market I got a lot in both\nBut a real estate will give you a better rate of return but it requires\nManagement by you or someone else and even if you have somebody else do you got to manage the manager you cannot ignore it and so my real estate with an internal right of return which is the tax benefit to the you know that appreciation schedule in other words the actual cash on cash return ... modest expenses as a return on\nInvestment and the growth in value you put those three things together and real estate you get the actual returns which is called the interim right of return the IRR okay which you would compare to a mutual fund right of return to do apples to apples higher hassle factor but most of my real estate is Seventeen to twenty percent right of return I\nNot casual cash is about ten okay a little less and some of it okay but\nNot casual cash is about ten okay or a little less in some of it okay but\nOur total what the increases in value and other stuff so I'm making more on that\nI Am on the real ... on the other maybe double what on that are making a mutual fund but I've got a lot more hassle with it\nI mean ... you know even though I don't manager Ron I'm a son in law\nRuns our our real estate company and he manages all of it and I don't I don't put up I don't personally\nDeal with a renter or something like that or anything of vacancy or a broken air conditioner all that he deals with all that stuff but but you know I went over all the ... this morning with him and to see how the properties are doing we check on him and he's telling me the stories of the drama he gets to deal with and such is real estate but I Love real estate do\n... and that basket Holocaust Hoosier\nHim I probably point with a hundred thousand dollar house sold five hundred thousand I have I can get five home mhm I'm all in a hundred thousand each now so I Want them out right all the rents minus expenses are free and clear or somebody else and wanting to buy tree and language for fifty percent\nYou know ... you know I I look I Know your answer there on a leveraging I\nI'm not going to leveraging the I don't I ... I went the extra pain in the butt of dealing with a banker on top of this and on top of that I got risk and it just takes all the joy out of this whole discussion um what's the average price point in your area nationwide it's a little over two hundred thousand\nWell yeah probably about that I mean I can get a three bedroom one bath three but I mean that for about a hundred maybe a hundred and

pay some taxes on it and if you want to fund a Roth IRA for her or something the point here in this situation is when you have a kid running a business to the point is not the business the point is what the kid is learning\nLearning work\nThey're learning interface with customers on how to treat people ah they're learning that they have to deliver on time they have to deliver quality they're learning how to put prices on something or they're learning that it's a good thing to make a profit the capitalism is not evil ... that these are the lessons are what is important\nI understood the accurate or if she make some money that's just a bonus\nSo as you've identified the way this kid is wired and a lot\nOf us that are entrepreneurial are are a lot or at least a little bit ADD [laughter] right right I mean how much you'll pass anything the shiny I run towards it you know I'm\nSure you know but I ... if you start may start to make a hundred dollars a year or something you may want to do it in all honestly but if you if you're making under a hundred grand where the profit or an international you know unless you just hit some bizarre thing or something like home depot wants to buy her out or something I don't\nBecause it is one of the most bizarre thing to learn\nThe [noise] the distance between the less expensive schools and the most expensive schools I mean we're talking a thousand eighty thousand a year spread I mean it's it's even cheaper probably than that but it's amazing and people just assume all of color just the same cost it's just not and it's the number one mistake\nPeople make when they don't have a lot of money in the kid is going off to school it draws people in the student loan debt 'cause they simply go to school we can afford\nAnd as you know we have a student loan crisis with a half a trillion dollars in student loan debt we have an entire department within our company called Ramsey education\nThat puts a curriculum and the high schools and colleges across America will now and forty percent of the high schools teaching high schoolers those comments stop of staying\nOut of that and being on a budget and learning to save money and\nOf that kind of thing and what happens\nAnd being on a budget learning to save money and all\nOf that kind of thing and what happens from time to time as the schools can't afford the basic resources and so someone will come along side and the community of business or an entity of some kind and we'll pay for that high school to have\nFoundations in personal finance curriculum from the rams the organization\nIs that we've had about four million students go through it one of the coolest things happened lately is the University of Wyoming has decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have\nThis curriculum and they're sponsoring it and paying for it dang dang touchdown baby that's how that happens the college university says we're going to take care of these high schoolers in our state and make sure they learn about money\nAnd of course University of Wyoming is the best cost alternative in the Wyoming area to go to college so this all works out really really good now\nAnd title is from the University of Wyoming usually associated vice provost of enrollment Kyle lawyer to go man thank you for doing that is\nWell it's a it's a pleasure to visit with you David ... thanks for that we are certainly Saturday here in the state of Wyoming can be able to partner with a Ramsey education and provide some practical applicable things\nFor students to be able to apply that college search and uh and and be real fatty consumer of higher education\nYeah 'cause you guys do have low tuition I mean you're you're you're you're the best deal round I wasn't getting right\nYes we are we have the lowest resident tuition at any public institution that grant doctoral degrees anywhere in the United states\nHave all fifty states of all the rooms are like so like you are cheaper than my University of Tennessee you're you're cheaper than the University of dot dot dot\nThat's correct wow very cool very cool and\nWhat your whole promotion was behind this I immediately wanted to steal it and bring it and use it somewhere in\nLike in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you I'm doing a few minutes but I Will get them to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nSo that our our our campaign is called the world need more cowboys ... we're not talking about guys and cowboy hat that ride off into the friends that we are talking about a state with a long heritage and a university mascot and a cowboy that can be\nAnyone from any gender any background but we're talking about that enters fair we're talking about a curiosity independence boldness at pursuit that adventure and we're talking about someone who changes\nLandscapes and and look for opportunities to make differences in the world we are talking about trailblazers and people exemplify the spirit of the underdog you know it's not a cowboy isn't what you are but it's who you are\nWell and you guys are the cowboys\nI mean so it's a play on words obviously I mean if you're a mascot right vessel decorate your football team your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like my University of Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right as as as good I play on words but you you guys got though that you got to the table first with this way to go\nIt it's a great motto and aid 'cause it's so so much in just a Sophie\nReally grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and you guys sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is going to have as of coming up soon the the high school curriculum because the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool Kyle thank you man\nWe're happy to be happy to be a partner we're we are we are state that is very practical were state that very much um applicable in terms of being smart with our money we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out opportunity to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment in your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation and the state of Wyoming through the Ramsey education product\nWell as one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're\nYou know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this ... going in there we're we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that I'm\nIn the winter is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboys right in front of every high school student and remind them that's where they ought to go to college because sometimes people do silly things like wander across the state line I've talked to a lot of Provo is around the country I'm my\nOwn chancellor and vice chancellor the emergence of Tennessee and it's a constant thing the ... the state is trying to woo their own residence to their own university and it's become a thing you gotta you gotta go after it don't you\nYes sir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who need to know that there are opportunities even out of state that you have to be\nSmart you have to do your due diligence in that process of searching for education in addition to being the lowest cost but resident tuition of doctor are renting institution\nWe're near the very lowest for non residents to come to Wyoming so we have a lot to offer not just here in the great state of Wyoming but from coast to coast north and south\nWe can be a solution that provide students an incredible opportunity for education and we're going to be very very good at making sure that we are helping\nA student be successful not just students access and part of that is not racking up a lot of debt at the end of their degree completion\nName in so many students on your campus\nWe have we had a little over or twelve thousand so it was twelve thousand a little over four hundred students here that are called himself the cowboys\nYou know that's a good school and so not too big and small and so that's that's just right those are ... Dale dress right very\nVery cool ... it's an honor to talk to you again rather thank you for coming on with us\nThank you very much a best wishes to you and your team there in uh in Tennessee and we appreciate that pertain to say the world needs more cowboys\nI Love it I Love the motto and I think the world does need more cowboys in so many ways [laughter] good stuff I got a picture of John Wayne going in my head I can't help but it's just the way it is but a bottom line\nIs lesser mascot and so now that's a that's very cool stuff I Love it and want a neat thing that the College of the University of the state is buying it for every single high\nSchool or if you're a business or university and you'd like to do something like that maybe you don't have to maybe don't have the money to buy the whole state or something every hospital in the states some states have more high schools and others can you imagine you know\nBut uh um you know maybe he just wanted to be to the hospital used
