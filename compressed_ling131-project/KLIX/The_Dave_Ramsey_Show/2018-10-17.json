be that you're looking at some of the other trades and you can Illinois electrician that's a good person or a tram carpenter that's a good person and you start asking them who do they know that's a great\nPainter that you could bring your own to the job a part of the problem is you're in a very very hot construction market in Denver and so every body's got work even do fishes yes\nAnd your has your husband's got my work in a in a hand on maintenance so that that you've got a bit of a labor shortage ah\nWhen you've got a construction boom always in the city\nAnd that's what you're facing a little bit of but the way I have found like you know and it is ample in our world it wouldn't be a painter but in our world it might be someone that's in technology someone that is a a great Rubio on the rails developer as an example there's a shortage of technology and Web developer is out there right now\nIn most cities including Nashville nationals actually attack but\nUm you know there's a shortage so where do we find those where we you know we go on like you've done websites you've gone on Craig's list but we get in technology groups and associations and but mainly great developers no other great developers great painter isn't or the great painters or somebody is not a developer man has other\nInfluence in and other knowledge of the tech industry that's a great person will no somebody should ride developer and send them our way and\nCourse you're going to pay them and pay them well\nBut paying a duplex doesn't make them anything except the well paid do this so you you want to pay people well but you that that's not the part of the only part of the equation as you've already discovered so the only way I don't know how to find them would be to find other people in other trades that are excellent and people in the\nPainting world that are excellent and try to move them onto your team once you get a couple of excellent people they will have a tendency to help you find the other excellent people uh sixty four percent of people to join our team last year were internal referrals someone already working here that was a thoroughbred wanted new in third\nFor area now we have the advantage of being a little bit larger and having a vast array of jobs not just a single job available but but that's how I've always done it I've I've found thoroughbreds rumor thoroughbreds and donkeys run with donkeys\nAnd so you know you just got to find out find your thoroughbreds and and people in the community to serve bread some I Do there's a steak dinner\nAnd it for you guys send you a good guy you send him a steak dinner you send him nice seeing him and his wife through scripts or something because it's worth it\nTo get somebody in there and you know being being good that way and I'll tell you I'm going to send you a copy of a book that is one of my favorite hiring books that have written the last two years and it's from a from pat Lynch you only it's called the ideal team player and the ideal team player is three things hungry\nHumble and smart hungry humbling smart\nAnd that's what you're looking for in any position in any organization in every trade and every organization has some people to qualify other high quality people every single one\nAnd if you can put them together in a trade that by and large is not that kind of people then you really a brand differentiated yourself from the other people in your marketplace so hold on I'll have Kelly pick up and we will send that to you opens owns a triple eight eight to five\nFive two to five that's

when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance was not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings\nTo provide for their financial needs that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are and your baby steps it's a necessity not a choice does include working husbands and wives as well stay at home parents it's pretty expensive to replace a stay at home parent\nYeah my hero yeah how do you do that\nWhat do you tell them what's the key to getting out of debt\nI think it's the budget you gotta start there um and I think now on this side of it you just have to believe that it's going to work and just keep plugging away at it um and small steps add up to a giant stuff at the end\nAnd I I Would add to that ah the giving them the ... um was really clear to me where\nWhen we started I used to routinely saying click while we're driving in church like boy

fifty or you got down to a hundred or when was that you went had gone we're really doing this\nBut I think it was last year I I went back to work for one year and it all of my income went towards a mortgage because it was about fifty fifty thousand laps and we just just piled on every month it was like you just kept counting down\nMonth we're going to make it and it was it was awesome\nWouldn't have even going back to work if you didn't already have those numbers calculate knew it was just for a year now the prognosis for a year were done by some in for a year yeah I think that you can embrace a year of pain so by then you knew it was really going to happen it was real it was before that that you believe that yeah I I mean we were underwater on our mortgage for about three four years ...\nFor me it was like when we uh oh it as much as what the equity was um then it's like started feeling you know if we can breeze and and now at least we can sell it and get out of around

percent five and a half percent something like that\nSo you probably like five and a half percent on your money and if you die you lose it\nWhen you die if you do when you die you lose you know and I

you need to take back control of all your finances okay before the next hour rings twelve\nYou have thirty minutes get it done okay if you have to shut down the checking account if you have to shut down the credit cards and if you have to freeze your credit that's fine but you need to get control of your finances because your grandmother for whatever reason is misbehaving we've established that correct\nYeah that would never money with your grandpa has money and with your sisters id and for all we know she was open up credit cards and your name as well correct we don't know\nI'm not sure yet\nI'm telling you need to check your credit in a safe she's done that to you as well but you need to shut down a so did you get rid of your checking account is that what you get rid of take over

in their ... you use it to be moved over to a different account and have that bank a pill that bank what's going on that this lady is\nUm ... you know she's she's misbehaving she's mentally ill she says the we don't know what it is but\nWhen you do get all control taken away from her eyes that all she had was your debit card in your checking account and that's all I have food and that's all she
