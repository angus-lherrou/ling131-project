your money is from where do you call AAA eight to five five two to five Danielle is in Fargo North Dakota Daniel welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nThanks for taking my call Cher what's up\nMy wife and I are relocating for our job or we currently live in Grand forks removing the Fargo and um when we sell our home will have roughly fifty thousand dollars inequity after a real turkeys\nAnd we're wondering what they would do would you put the fifty grand down on the new home or pay off something down that we did and that is a thirty one thousand dollar car loan and ... ...\nEr which saw the car\n[laughter] tell their car okay [laughter] I thought that's what you might say\nWell okay what's your hospital in\nA one hundred and bought a hundred and sixty five thousand\nRight so let me let me let me kinda market to the equation oh how I went there so clearly okay let's say that we pay off the car with this money and then that means is twenty thousand are split down our\nHouse and if you are the exact same house you're talking about buying\nOr was this money and then that means is twenty thousand are split down on\nHouse and if you are the exact same house you were talking about buying earlier I'm a centrally you have financed your car on your home mortgage would you agree with that\nYou are correct\nAnd um that would take a dumb car purchase and make it even worse\nOkay that's where that's how I got there so quickly\nBecause basically we're financing a Cornell over Fifteen Years or ... or ... to ever obviously ... mullet I refinance my house\nIn order to buy a thirty thousand dollar car not a million years [laughter] you know and it's basically the same equation were just saying it in different ways as we continue in our conversation here\nAnd sometimes if you just look at it through a different different standards on the other side of it and look at it from the left rather than from the right you see oh my God that really is don't you know and so it's not as it's not as a you know it's not just Dave says sell the car it's do you really want to finance this call over Fifteen Years\nKnow what I Want to do that so and as a car I Can't afford I Can't afford it 'cause I didn't pay for it\nUm if you didn't pay for it when you can afford it so yeah I'm Sorry dude I notice this week or none of my car guy like nice cars but I'm too many times are nice cars that have us instead of us have them Shannon is with us in Atlanta Hi Shannon how are you all\n\nSolutions human coffee\n\nWelcome to Nashville and all the way here to do a debt free screen Oh yes I Love\nHow much of you to pay it off\nSo we paid off a hundred and forty two thousand five hundred dollars and twenty eight months\nGood for you and your ranger income during that two and\nA half years we started out about Ninety thousand and ended it about a hundred and forty five thousand wow great or you'll do for a living on a physical therapist and I'm a engineering assistant at a local electric utility company very cool well congratulations gosh so what kind of what was the one\nHundred and forty thousand dollars\nWell answer this question because all of it was mine\nYeah unfortunately I'd Fifteen five and a vehicle and then a hundred and twenty seven thousand to good old Sallie Mae so wow\nHow long have you guys been married three years three years and so shortly after marriage the two of you look at this pile of debt and something happened tell me what kind of your story\nWhere we were just kind of do in a normal thing um we were actually started out on the the ten year forgiveness program\nAnd I actually heard you come across the radio um I was driving around in my work track and uh just was always interested in finances but really never knew\nUm where to start or where to begin and we picked up on your program and within a few weeks I purchased a total moneymaker ever read the book I talk or and I said well you got to get on this I said we're doing it all wrong and we started it out and uh she just kind of followed my lead on it\nWhich is that yeah it was it was I mean she's a follower and she was really good leadership\n\nShe uses a draw or words she didn't read the book really at all um and then eventually after\nI don't know about a year into the program she was starting to get mad at me because of the program and everything I said we just need to um instead of yelling at me we need to go the financial peace and then you can hear it from the source right from days and then you can ... it takes off my back exactly\nWhat the the video guy [laughter] yeah very cool okay so you got in there then and you saw it for yourself rather than just going oh the engineer and does the numbers you know I kind of how it started right yes the engineer guy he's going to do the numbers I'm the medical personnel let him do the numbers and then you get in there and you see for yourself so what happened\nWhen you went to the clash corner that gave you a emotional ownership really in this thing sure I think\nIt made it very tangible for me something that I can see and the the leaders of our class they were very open about their debt and how they had read it and that was something motivating for me for me it felt like it was this constant uphill battle\nAnd I had this crazy burden because it was on line yeah it's a little bit of a guilt trip yeah ... and so that class honestly made me feel a little more support it and just give us the opportunity to truly jumping and know that actually getting out of debt was realistic\nWhen you first or do you ever had to do with the ... we are\nOf data in twenty eight my it was a long\nYeah it was hard we started the\n... the very beginning of January in two thousand and sixteen now and uh it was it it it was hard me\nTwo years and four months right and then yeah and that's what that is a long\nLong time but it's a hundred and forty three thousand dollars and you killed at all if you ask how old are you too I'm too well we're both twenty and you're not even Thirty years old so some of these rockstar also millennials I talk about all the time [laughter] very good good for you guys\nThink well time very cool how does it feel now that you've climbed the mountain is so great\nIt's incredible [laughter] I think it's one of the best feelings it's nice to know that we can move on to the baby steps now and we just want to live and give like no one else when they were excited for him to keep travelling through the baby steps\nWoman you're making a hundred and fifty thousand bucks a year and not even Thirty years old and\nIf it was pretty good yeah that's awesome show or who are your biggest cheerleaders I think it was kind of each other and the very beginning we we didn't talk about it a whole lot we can have some friends and families that were saying like what what are you doing\nI think after we got rolling through the process and we were getting some traction panels quite a bit of money are quite a bit of dead people started to come around now when you look at somebody already paying off a hundred thousand dollars are going to shut them up you know absolutely yeah\nYeah it's like you don't have to shut up it just says it that's good yeah that's great very cool you guys very very well done which the key to getting out of debt\nFor us I think it was giving it together first of all\nAlso being willing to work very hard I work three jobs and worked every time I bet on and also never really strengthen the path I feel like once we decided to jump into the plan we did not stray from ... in honestly whenever I Would buy something like if I spend too much on groceries I Would feel bad\nBecause that was money that would be knocking on my ... now\nMhm yeah I gave you gave your boundaries on a process yeah what about you oh I think the the the\n[noise] I\n... it was it was it was good I mean we we are working with a key for him for you what was the main thing that got you out of debt you know work extra average or yeah or the raise your income over fifty thousand dollars Cody finished a residency program\nShe got a big raising them you know I Would I Would say call 'em and and be dispatched to utility company and just uh the extra income any chance you could get extra overtime home do it you know it really helps the snowball just\nPlow through and go to the finish line\nYou know there was something about that because you're getting traction if he was working like that and you didn't know what if you're doing any good at it you just be exhausted but it's weird how it's exhilarating 'cause you know you're winning mhm you know you work your butt off when you're winning absolutely and uh it changes everything and now you

Ramsey Dave Ramsey dot com on bonds dot com you can't buy blends rented I Am\nCalling his owner died when you retire start making money from your investments is that income considered on income or capital gains also aren't capital gains tax much lower than earned income or that is not considered on income it is considered investment income and it depends on\nWhat the money's invested in as to whether there'll be capital tax capital gains rate or tax on an ordinary income right if the investment is paying off on something that is less than a year old it will be at ordinary income if it's coming out of a traditional\nOr it's never yet been taxed\nIt'll be on ordinary income if it's coming out of a four O. one K.\nTraditional not Ross it will be taxed at ordinary income as it comes out um all of the money will be a hundred percent not just the returns because none of it the growth has never been taxed nor the money you put in has never been to act on a traditional so you'll pay\nOrdinary income on those if you have investments simply invested in the piece of real estate you don't pay any taxes\nUntil your salad and then you pay taxes on capital gains portions you own investments like a a mutual fund or a low turnover mutual fund\nLow taxes on that are virtually no taxes on that until you sell it and then you would have capital gains if he's how's it over a year so

couple of years after we did we bought on the right side on the downside of the top but we're still not back there even a you know I guess maybe it's our neighborhood worse than others but [noise] um so we're not there yet\nAs we approach four or five and six steps for five and six I'm\nYou know I have two teenage sons are going to be faced with college here soon I'm very excited to get back into our retirement planning which we put on hold back at the beginning and so now I'm just trying to figure out\nBut yet the house and not put anything were to find\nA better in order of priority for five six but done simultaneously show the way that might sound would be you start with Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement that's by recent for period unless you're in an emergency situation you you do that now\nAnd then you move on to kids college you've got college looking down you're looking at about what's going on college and so that's probably going to take everything above and beyond your Fifteen Percent going into retirement and your rights to house it probably on hold for a little while when you've got two teenagers and no college funds you got some catching up today right\nYes sir now so you're going to probably that's five is probably going to suck up all your extra money right now\nI grow up I don't want to be a piece of garbage and if you recycle me I won't be\nYour garbage another lush recycle learn how I I won't be recycled dot org a public service advertisement broke you buy America beautiful and yet council\nRamsey Bonnie\nAnd by inexpensive laws and expensive cars and all of a status symbol of the um you will be treated as a social loud costs and I can't understand what would be your take on that [laughter] I\nIt [laughter] or did your immigrate from\nA United Kingdom you know the kingdom okay and where did you grow up um I was born in India I immigrated to the u._k. when I was Seventeen okay and you're how old a twenty nine okay and how long did you live in a ... eleven years were you a social outcasts there um no [laughter]\nWell ah where did you live in the u._k. a city called ... off right pretty good size city it is it's it's a nice day over legitimacy and and you weren't a social outcasts there for being frugal now but um I was like oh what do you live in the United states um I live in San Diego\nThere to [laughter] you might be a social outcasts they are now I'm getting okay there are people who is in San Diego that have\nCommon sense as well so um I don't know what crowd you're running with their bought 'em it's different than the one you ran with an India or the one you ran with an ... for sure uh\nBecause they have been bitten by the bug of consumerism but plenty of Americans um in any city I'm well I'm not consider us social outcasts for having good common sense values now a\nThat's assuming you're you know you if your clothes are not necessarily expensive but they are at least clean mhm and your watch um\nI'm I'm I'm worth well over ten million dollars is buildings worth twenty million that you're standing in is paid for and that's my watch it pretty on assuming I'm\nLike it costs about a hundred and fifty bucks a\nProblem is I don't care what you think and if you think I feel like I'm cool 'cause I have a watch I don't really think you're cool so um you know that's the thing you got to decide who you want to influence you um and where you want to end up so what brought you to the United states why did you come here\nIt was um I chatted a dream that I had mhm um I read somewhere that um because it's going to guarantee freedoms to all people the Supreme Court ruled that no one can be false to a re signed a pledge of allegiance and that just got hold of me I was about twelve years old and I tried to uh\nApply that in my school in India or get a naive I was ... I'm In er like the American constitution doesn't apply in India and uh and I I think about um the pizza floored me out and got in trouble with that I did I think the principal and the fact that the principal one day when I make it to the United states you wouldn't be able to do this to me anymore\nSo freedom that is correct freedom okay\nAnd now people are trying to take your freedom for a meal with ah forcing you to conform to something using a social pressure but not all okay and so I Would treat it exactly the same way as hard as you have fought there you know twenty\nNine years of your life to get to be standing here um I wouldn't surrender my freedom to stuff not all in the name of someone being impressed generally speaking\nA here's a good rule of thumb people who are impressed by\nThings that you have or where are not impressive people when you get inside of their hearts and inside of their minds that\nWe would call shallow and show on the very people you might attract by having some mulling by having some jewelry or some watches the proper clothing are the people that you really don't want influencing your future and your character in your life\nYou've paid a huge price to get to be here\nAnd enjoy the freedom and so you're a man\nUm the uh ... and ... the show the people that are telling you that are probably not people I Would want 'em to be influencing me I might want to influence them and try to help them but\nIf I were in your shoes I Would say that doesn't need to be your inner circle that are teaching you how to live mentor near the site billing you and so forth um\nAnd so you know check out a folks that have a little more depth of character in our judging you based on what you drive now again\nIt needs to be if you're driving a car um that's a while you're trying to achieve a financial bowl or something or they should be clean and maintained you don't take good care of it but um it doesn't it doesn't need to be dirty and doesn't need to be\nMissing the same thing with your clothing or your hair or whatever else you take care of the things that you have and and manage them but most wealthy people or do not by\nA expensive things to impress other people are a few do but most don't that's how they became off they know they do by some expensive things that I buy some expensive things\nBut there for me and for my family and for my wife and that kind of thing and they're not for what someone thinks I'm I'm I've got a really nice home but I don't buy it for somebody else we live there you know and what you think about are good or bad doesn't really matter to me and so\nI don't know is that helpful is that helpful part of this year is that what you were looking for I think I needed to hear that that'll come what are you doing for a living\nI'm I work in IT IT okay what do you do a developer you're developing okay All right well you probably need to come to national work Roche [laughter] Saudis in order to meet you sir if you guys are quite a story brother quite a story well done thanks for stopping by their\nOpen phones a AAA eight to five\nTwo to five and this is the Dave Ramsey show D is with us in Atlanta Hi Dee how are you\n[noise] Hi I'm well thank you for asking sure what's up\n[noise] um I have to ask if I should pay my taxes for here and she reported off information um on our Seventeen taxes and as a result we're being charge that ten thousand dollars\nYou're being charge ten thousand dollars in penalties yeah mhm not taxes\nI Want to pay their taxes and penalties yeah OK it shows like the percentage on the information as well that I\nAlso from ration she lied yeah intentionally and you\nGet through that yes why we do is\nTo get back more money I don't know like right there she claimed that we have a business that we don't own\nClaimed that we're paying for cars that we don't own cheaply claims that we're paying 'em from mileage for their business again that we don't own\nThat's weird I mean it does your husband have something to do with this\nAnd he doesn't have heat that we could see what you\nKnow I mean just randomly\nOut of thin air she dreamed up a business that you don't have an cars you don't have\nA knowledge that you don't have right now we have a church but you know churches don't\nGet tax so there was no there's nothing in the um the documentation that mentioned anything about the church or do they use uh I I Am a number of the pie but when the three number ... this random\nAre you are you doing a work outside the five oh one ... see three as eventual is that you're being paid uh outside of the church\nNo you're not you know they're speaking engagements and get paid for that on the side no everything's through the church or a hundred percent\nMake any money for the church has its own in ... we both work independently room another company\nOr say ... your ... okay yeah okay um well I\nI think if there are I\nDon't know you need to see an attorney is the answer to that question 'cause I don't know whether you have grounds to someone on this is a very bizarre thing someone would do is just out of the blue ... it's not a mirror mistake I mean it's a complete fabrication\nAnd so um I mean this is all for it sounds like fraudulent activity on your behalf you sign the tax returns though didn't you\nKnow everything you know but you had to see the ...\nYou you you didn't let off some of the ... and ... and I do you may have trouble I don't know you need to see an attorney and asked them\nMy guess is the most you can hold to get back to the penalty for taxes you already over there and you're still owe penalties or Jew them not being paid on time new to this\nBut I think that's the most you might get\nSome money and\nYou know that if you combined the data breaches that have occurred in the past twelve months almost every American to shed their personal info compromise direct\nOver fifty percent of our listeners and viewers tell us that day or someone in their family has been a victim and Seventy percent of those folks have had it happen more than once to this is unbelievable wants these get your info the risk never goes away and they can use it when\nBut we had a unique opportunity with the car because we happened to own one of the Volkswagen diesel\nWas a scandal yeah you know\nYeah and they were offering us you know we could do that by Dr pet and we were planning to the pet\nBut I looked at the options and started looking at if we get the buy back and got the cash settlement and got rid of the payment and the position that would put a than I did actually had us at that point to where we would pay off in thirty six months\nAnd heard about two or three o'clock in the morning I called my brother back from what I've been doing and he said he would buy us as the you know\nI'm for Christmas and allow us to you know to the program at home we kind of lives in the middle of nowhere and then I told him that I Would ... the next day and ah to talk to him and I was nervous because the car with kind of pets and I didn't think he\nGot you got some any man that's driving the tractor\n[laughter]\nHe's like I'm not driving the media but yeah but he I texted him and surprisingly he looked like most and I told him about my spreadsheet that I made this nice color coded spreadsheet and I sent it to him and surprisingly he came back with let's do this\nUm and I I think that you are you are ready to you are sick of this\nOh absolutely yeah yeah yeah and then you come home and you guys go to the tradition of our city\nWe didn't end up going into that we did it um through the program at home\nHome study on\nOur church is an hour and a half ago\nRight now now nowadays you can just watch it all on line but it was different than they are very good you guys want is key to getting into that you made already one thousand and they seem much more than ... for\nAdults like in that role they paid off the loan as another team thousand and then we also got about an eight thousand dollar cash settlement on top of that\nOkay so you got twenty five of the eighty one was that one move on and then what what is the key to getting out of debt than you did it in Eighteen months\n[noise] um\nI Would have to say for for me it was communication close communication we're both of us know exactly what's going on with everything all the time rather than\nIn the past where I had largely let her kind of control everything being mhm which she she didn't have as good a job as I could possibly expect\nWhat she was by herself\nBut she was by herself I didn't have a full understanding of what was going on right how was being done exactly where we were I knew small numbers I did not have the big picture and you know guys being visual creatures the spreadsheet gave me the big picture in the color coded clarity\n[laughter] so it's definitely a huge lost some of the control one path not in ... but you gain um someone else's shoulders to help carry the load right\n[noise] yeah it became amazing actually what happened with that with this was beyond and fiber gossiping because\nThat that and God we had a huge enacted laws because he was told there be no more extension back like a few months before we started at man I'm about to\nBe about a year into it he gets a call ... ... it was home hearing one of his trip and he gets a call from work saying they just got an extremely before but they wanted him to come back I'm On early\nOn he\nGets off the phone and he's like what do I do and I'm like I don't know they want to go back and he's like what what what what are we were out of town and I don't even know how I got my spreadsheet their numbers if I just knew um but I sat down and he was sitting at my brother out actually calculating and I'm like you know if you do this we can be out of debt you\nUm instead of you know another year and a half and it was like\nWow I didn't get dropped on board and he he actually told them that he had it for the the line now if they would give them an extra two weeks on the end as well that would guarantee a ticket at all paid off in that time\nAnd
