I worked for the postal service they have a ... a student loan debt of life I'm about Fifteen thousand dollars [laughter]\nAnd um I have two friends one of them as I'm\nAsking me to go for a business or like a friend\nSo I was thinking about taking a loan for that and my other friend is I'm all for me like to go buy a house with him to the share like a two family house so I take one apartment he thinks other than it's going to be of course whether our mortgage growing too so I wanted to know what should I Do\n[laughter] Mm okay\nWell we tell folks don't have to borrow money around here if you listen to the show very much the shortest path to wells and peace and your finances is to avoid that and on top of that I Would tell you avoid partnerships as the ownership the one show show\nWhat that means is that if you still want to remain friends with both these guys I Would suggest you say no\nBecause at the end of these stories there was a nightmare going in partners with somebody in debt to go into the restaurant business would you do know squat about is a good way to end up bankrupt and lose your friendship forever going in partners or somebody to buy a house\nAnd then he doesn't pay is half or can't pay is half or you don't pay your for campaign you're half is uh\nWhen I was a precursor to the ending of a friendship and a foreclosure\nShown no I wouldn't do either one of those and that's my reasoning\nI think you'll have a lot better life have you avoid both of those paths and you can you can develop a career path that does not involve you're going into debt to start a business it's a matter of fact most businesses start without that\nThey just start small\nWe started this one without the whole card table my living room we didn't have a big fancy studio we went down to the local radio station drove over there and they let us use their stuff because we worked for free there\nNow is figure out a way to get going and you what we call bootstrap it

correct\nYeah I I've [noise] through the end my last year of school I got very turned off the actual science so I've been applying to finance jobs and I can't get anything because everyone everyone

well here's here's one thing I Will tell you and Ken Coleman will tell you this as well go to the Ken Coleman show dot com and download\nHis free PDF on how to put together a resume but resumes in applications without relationship are useless um\nI'll give you an example uh we have eight hundred people here just under a hundred people work on our team we hired a hundred and fifty to two hundred last year we had Fifteen thousand applications so there's a hundred\nThe last and that and it's not that I don't wanna\nAnswer and talk to every one of those Fifteen thousand people is just a logistical not reasonable and show what ends up happening is you get lost in the stack of that stuff unless you know someone that works there and you don't have to be best friends with them you just 'cause I got to tell you we don't ever hire somebody because somebody called me and says ...\nEver but we would give them an interview and pull their pull the resume out of the stack you got to get out of the pile you know and so some of these places you're trying to get on with you need to figure out if your sister that's married a\nKid play soccer where the guy that works over there or something like that\nWhere you can find someone that I put in a little bit of a word for you to at least get the door open and that'll get you in the door again you're you're not going to get hired because of that kind of a reference matter of fact very few references where you just calls up somebody and I get your higher but almost never happens that'll decent job anyway\nOr how are those bodies you can get all or something like that but at a good job they're really going to want to interview you and learn about trees\nAnd that will be true here so we don't guarantee anybody a higher but we will at least talk to them and you know what might be a very short conversation lower your qualified and ... and all of a Middle East will evolve to them and give the resume Alice Hi oh if somebody knows I'm Sorry go download\nListen to the king dome show they'll help you with all this stuff is very very difficult job there I think you can lay some\n\n\nWhy in the world would you trust

who pressures you into a pre packaged\nYeah and I think that was really the key to getting out of that was just to keep living like a resident while I was in his first few years out because that was really the easiest time to do it and so I think that was probably the most important step that I thought\nYou know 'cause now I mean you make three hundred four hundred five hundred winter or you make

yourself it'll cause a divorce because you're going to get more and more and more and more excited about getting out of debt and living with a plan and you guys going to\nDrive a wedge further between you own I don't want to do that so I just if you can talk or into just attending one or two glasses with you I think she'll go on and go to the others\nI'm pretty persuasive but uh but don't go by yourself to cause problems hold on\nI'll have to pick up I'll give you the financial position roasting membership for a year and that includes the nine lessons that you can attend and you can watch
