Billy is with us in Dayton, Ohio hey Billy welcome today Ramsey shop\nToday and thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nTo my wife and I are in the process of trying to consider buying a house the challenger running into is that we own to rental houses in we currently rent the one we live and then\nWe don't want to take on more debt and so we're trying to figure out whether we should sell the rental properties or um you know how to just sort of finagle that and I'm not getting into too much debt\nOkay do you have\nWhat is one of these rentals worth [laughter]\nI'm not getting into too much yet okay do you have\nWhat is one of these rentals worse\n[laughter] well what are the challenges that we face is that the rental properties are actually out of town and I'm I'm a military guy and we're currently living in Dayton, Ohio rental properties or in Georgia in Virginia solve the value sell them\nYes I Would not long distance landlord okay no that's your health we were asking for trouble you need the money you're in the military are trying to buy a\nHome and you need the money and they don't need to be like you got you did not set out to own rental property everywhere these are rental properties by default there is not your not your five year strategy to buy rental properties all over the United states\n\nTo 'em that's been in the inclination that I've been getting from a couple of folks that have been talking to my my only hesitancy though is that they they successful on adventures that have been paying the mortgage and um it seems like there there's the possibility of the value going up\nAnd think about usually go up but I'm also sure someone's going to change their hardly all in your living room 'cause you're out of town [laughter] this is going to happen\nProperties my I got a bunch of them I don't\nKnow probably for forty years and\nUm you've got to be I I just don't do any longer says\nLandlord it I don't have any property that I ran out that

you need a high\nTheir debts back up the only time I tell people to move that into a debt consolidation has to avoid bankruptcy or foreclosure and you're not asking me about either one of those so I think your bank wants to see you deeply in debt does that's what banks do\nSo well is when a bank says\nHey I got a great idea what they're really saying is hey I think I can make some money off of you\nI mean really it's like playing with a skunk and wondering why you got sprayed seriously it's not a ... it's not a pet it's a skunk so don't pet it\nThat's ... yeah this is what you're dealing

deserve this\nAnd granted it out of thirty out of thirty thousand it's a complete scam it's not happening the government is ... show good I'm Glad you're not signed up for that so what is your income please God told me as large\nA my combine I'm married so with my wife uh about three hundred and thirty\nGood [noise]\nOkay so you're you're you don't get to live like a doctor because you're a broke Dr yeah you're gonna live like a college student okay hope you had to start buying crap\nCan't answer that have you started buying crap bought bought one thing is once fought\nThe car what'd you buy a A R I got yeah yeah uh now do you know what did you pay for fifty thousand okay\nYou're a three hundred and eighty thousand dollars in that you can never do that again\nYou know I don't plan to\nYou can never do anything like that again you're not only on vacation we are not buying a house\nYou or a broke doctor here's the thing you have this absolutely fabulous income and you are going to destroy your wealth building ability with that income if you don't clear this data and treat it like it's\nCancer and we're going to hit it with chemo and everything we've got and show that I Am not a band aid off slowly guys that crap does not work and so what I Would do is I woke up in your shoes as I Would live on fifty thousand dollars a year or less\nWhich would make me debt free in under three years okay\nAnd then I Would start my life was a great news is you have the ability to delay pleasure for greater outcome we know that because you've gone to school your whole freaking life\nAnd they're very smart academically or you wouldn't be where you are okay you have the ability to delay pleasure which is a sign of emotional maturity and you have a great intellect\nLet's use those two things and apply them to this mess that you are in called deeply in debt now you can do it the other way but I'll tell you this your colleagues are walking around out there with three hundred\nFour hundred two hundred thousand dollars worth of medical school dad\nFor a decade because they play with it and they never kill the disease the only way you kill it is extreme treatment radical and that's the only way it goes away it's going to stay with you forever otherwise so that's what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes\nI Would treat it like I Am I broke doctor because I'm a broke doctor in both doctors don't by fifty thousand dollar cars are going to the development of vacations so you're not doing that crap anymore you get on a tight budget beans and rice rice and beans\nAnd clean up this mess because if you take the three year old older than you are now you and go forward with a three or four hundred thousand dollar income and no debt year it'll be so wealthy it's going to be blinding if you watch what you're doing\nBut if you just ... around\nWith this thing and keep it like it's a pet it's going to be a problem for you Laurie is whether it's in Boise idaho Hi Laurie how are you\nDave Bing taking my call\nSure what's up I'm at this point where I like to be giving 'em right now a letter and my mom has been in the house for ten years mhm and I moved here at the palace of and she is in a very very small ram and have a large one\nThat he can shattered giving to help get her in her semi private ram and help pay for her cost of living\nSure unless somebody giving um we'd be tightening no but it will be giving yes I'm a ... I mean I don't know what you mean by giving but um you have the money to do this or you baroque or what\nYou know I have many pecan okay and you're you're out of debt yeah okay and you have or how much money in your nest egg\nThree hundred look I think and how old are you having good very good okay what's your income about Ninety thousand cool you're single single and what are you talking about spending here\nIt will cost me about a thousand dollars a month\nOkay the twelve ran out of Ninety and you can keep saving doing that 'cause you know what I mean that you can keep investing and so you retire with dignity\nAnd you can take care of yourself when you're in the exact same situation later right that's what I Want a piano when a gay people where you don't put yourself exposed to the elements so to speak by helping someone else but I think it's wonderful you have the money you've done a great job you're out of debt and you're in a position you want to give to a thousand dollars a year towards your mom's sure\nNo problem with that OK absolutely what do they want to do the right thing for ... like you said about giving the fact that finding a mate Charlotte filling the right thing I found\nI think you are it was a wonderful gift and uh your your time to her and you know what a wonderful you know act of love torture mama and\nAnd and again you put yourself in a position you have the money to do that without bringing harm to yourself and that's that's what we're talking about live like no one else so later you can live and the gills like no one else was very very cool Tony is with us Tony is in a Washington Hi Tony how are you\nI'm well how can I help\nI was curious why you advocate a money market accounts liar low you accounts for like a murky coupon\nCause your emergency phone is not an investment it's insurance okay it's there the principal has to be there and accessible and a liquid\nBecause if you're transmission goes out of you lose your job you get your hands on it the right of return is irrelevant it's insurance they protects the things that does make you money\nTo see what happens is people don't have an emergency fund act accessible and they got to set up in something where they get penalized if it comes out is not liquid and then they they have an emergency you know what they do\nThe borrowing a four one K. long\nLike a four one K. along the ball gets her for winter the cash it out worse yet and they create a mess\nBecause I got to do that to save their house 'cause they didn't have money that was like what they got stuck because there were all worried about trying to make an extra point or two on the money\nInstead of Kurt creating it like it's insurance insurance is ... is an expense money tied up at one percent or you would agree is an expense because it's sucks it's a horrible way to return it could be invested\nIn be making more but there is that portion that five\nOr ten or twenty thousand dollars or whatever it is is just sitting there just as a barrier between you and the life and that's always for it's not an investment it's insurance investments make money insurance costs you money to protect the things\nThat make you money and this is insurance so good question though that that's the whole reasoning behind that thanks for calling in\nOpen phones at triple eight eight to five\nTwo to five yeah when you're a fun

just had her first kid and and updating our was cool so an event that we bought it by a three part and creating a corrupt for assets and the question are there any advice for how do we wind down this trust when the kid gum comes of age [noise]\nI don't necessarily want to give them millions of dollars when you're Eighteen but nor do I wanna hold it'll hurt him right now he's like thirty five year\nGood good balance or like that I agree with both statements and so you wind down by releasing some of it a different times um we had our set up a before our kids you know became adults are\nTrying to serve the same situation so we put it together we both get hit by a\nBus or the millions of dollars in a trust to beat good used only for their good uh we did not leave the money to the guardian we left it into a trust which is the proper thing to do that trust is formed only at your death we put in that trust exactly how the money was to be invested the four types of mutual funds for instance that I recommend we put in that\nTrust that the income off of the investments\nCan be used for their care and feeding of the kids\nAnd they used to the guardian that there will beyond that if they needed money out of that trust and had to be for a major medical thing possibly a little bit on my first car and paying for college\n... coming out of college when you graduate from college we would release a percentage and then we'd releasing other percentage at twenty five\nAnd another present at twenty seven I think we did a maybe a third third third I don't remember but we let them kind of roll it out a little bit like you say I don't want to hold a too long but also don't want an Eighteen year old to hit the lottery\nAnd they'd be like what we're doing too so\nYeah so you lay all of that that way and um you know we put hours and nobody gets it until after college age or answer you might as well go to college\n[laughter]\n... yeah they are just trying to track kind of trying to direct a few things from the grave but whatever I'm a control freak you know thanks for the call brother appreciate sharing an hour this brand is with us from Huntsville, Alabama I'm

heritage\n... that are asking you how it should handle that and he told me how to go slow and I'll take my time and be patient with it and it was very helpful but now I'm having a new and other problem whereas I'm so basically since then\nI bought a house remodel the air being be making a lot of money about fifty thousand dollars a month on\nGross I'm about yeah about Fifteen thousand dollars a month and I'm just blowing through that I had a crazy sex addiction um I'm studying just came out some money and other dollars a month on\nProstitutes in certain clubs and um ... all the above and I don't know what to do have tried everything I push sex addicts anonymous\nUm and but I I I I Want to know what you would do in the situation I I've done well\nSex addicts anonymous um and I I I Want to know what you would do in this situation I have done well I spent about how that money on buying a house in ... now and if I'm doing well with that and that kind\nOf it's been a long project I finished but I don't know what to do this how should handle it wet ... anything else that you would try that I Am [laughter]\nHow old are you I'm twenty two [noise] and um\nThe inheritance came from who passed away\nSo my dad passed away about two years ago and um and I he was missing plane and I might be coming into a lot more money because that's how the child or wrongful death situation is um\nIt it's a long story about your mom on heat out of the picture that divorced I barely talk to her um [noise] great cheat sheet at at the picture I ...\nAs you know John that I'm not a therapist I'm not a a trained councilor um I have worked with addicts for Thirty years but goes one hundred percent of the addicts end up broke\nIf if they don't feel their addiction and so you are going to destroy your legacy your dad's legacy with the money that was left to you and you're going to destroy all your future dreams that this money represents if we don't if you don't get the help\nAnd heat to help and site to win against the addiction um sex addictions and pornography addictions are the fastest growing addictions in America that we see that in our offices with financial trouble um people in your situation more than any other addiction\nWe see we still see cocaine we still see 'em and we don't treat for that but we ended up helping them with their finances we still see alcohol and uh but gambling and sex are both adjusted ... the the ... is a\nIs a is gone crazy because of the Internet access and um uh\nIt's affecting every part of our lives in a good ways in bad ways but the access in this case is causing excess and it gets people in real trouble with gambling and porn sex addictions um\nSo you're you you know you named off a couple of the right things and that's getting an essay getting in a um a\nGroup I'm getting in a with a therapist is the second thing I Would do um the third thing I Would do\nIs um [noise] it it sounds to me like just a guy talking to a young guy an old guy talking to a young guy that all of your family structure has gone it's just you didn't have it with your mom and then your dad died\nAnd so you're you're just left without any authority structure as a twenty year old young guy there's nobody in your life kind of standing over your shoulder is going to stump you when you grew up your life\nThat I Do have some family on my dad's side I'm actually a good way but they know what's going on\nYou know so I Know they were asked for problems going on like over a year ago I was like aside from that is a and I I never and whenever I tried it goes beyond that kind of they were like cheesy oh you're just being picked on this that and I never kind of trust again okay with them so I just kind of cut off the leash in that\nOK everyone's okay but\nNot sponsor that there are no help is what you're saying yeah OK\nNo health but they they ... they're they're good but I just I don't know how well\nAnd so that there are no help is what you're saying okay\nI don't know how but they they ... they're they're good but I just I don't know how\nWell I Know that all behaviors obviously have a psychology involved um as a person of faith as a Christian I also believe behaviors or spiritual\nAnd show to treat or something like this only as a psychological thing is usually a half treatment to treat it only like it's a spiritual thing might very well be a half treatment but um there there's something that you're obviously searching for\nAnd there's something that you're missing 'em that's causing you too I'm literally go crazy in this part of your life right\n[noise] yeah I I I think it like edited beyond lonely I don't know that um but um [noise]\nI I I don't know honestly\nI think that's probably right that doesn't sound that old [laughter] I can I can resonate with that I can imagine you being there in that situation and it's amazing you can be one of the largest cities in the world and be lonely\nYou know but you can be is very very real on the side of the last component I Would add to it um and you're asking me so you always get my opinion when you're asking me and that I'm\nAn expert on my opinion [laughter] so ah what I Would tell you do is find a great church and will help you do that and and sit down and get past oil counseling to go with your other counseling get west some young guys\nIn that church and become friends with some people who have some character\nHave some integrity and that are walking a straight line\nNot perfect there isn't any perfect people over there are at that church ... churches got people in them so you can find that out pretty quick but you will find a better than a guy I Know you're Jewish okay cool that is more effective than let's get one of the rabbi\n[noise] let's get the spiritual element of those going because there's a there's an aspect of that\nGoes with this and if that's your heritage and that your your your faith and wonderful ah by cause the Talmud as a lot to say about the issues that you're dealing with um a lot\nAnd um so yeah I that's the only thing I Know how to tell you though because I Can't just yell at you stop it or you would have already stopped it I mean you're smart guy you've already realizes just ruining your life and\nUm you know that I Know that um but the nature of an addiction is and you're finding this from the twelve steps is that one of the thing is you Roger powerless\nAnd you know God has to step in\nAnd I've got to push for structures in my life and I've got a you know figure out a ... there's some careful psych self analysis and insights loneliness as an issue so how do I fix loneliness well obviously I'm fixing it inappropriately\nAnd so how do I fix it was more wisdom and that will be hanging out with good people are that are lifting you up I'm obviously not hanging out with paid friends which doesn't work for anybody\nWhatever version of pain to friends you have in years is one of the more grows so\nBut that's you know that's the only thing I don't know how to tell you I I Would make sure I really lean into getting a group of people around me that I can trust and if there's a a group of people that um are are working on a social project that is worthy and you got to get with a bunch of young men doing that\nAnd you had some good guys around you um then that's very important I've got a group of guys I get with once a month those were the last night as a matter of fact and I'm fifty eight\nUm that group of guys got all our son's together that are in their twenties the other day and we all encouraged them and they all agreed that they need\nUm that group of guys got all our son's together that are in their twenties and the other day and we all encouraged them and they all agreed that they need a group of guys you know you've got a one of my friends the the man's bill calls a band of brothers and your life a\nWith you in these situations so\nNot I'm just a guy I don't know how\nTo help you and I'm not ... to tell you that\nLot of pick up ... Mansfield look he's got a lot to say about this kind of stuff and the man's man's man's manly men or whatever it's called and said look you need some guys around you do that's what I'm thinking and and you need some spiritual additives in component to this this is the day room Shadu\nYou know what I've learned after talking to so many people who have been victims of ID theft they feel violated and they have a sense of fear an intrusion can be overwhelming it's scary and infuriating at the same time people question your character you try to figure out how\nVacation to Italy and I said I Can't do it if you if you have credit card debt mhm so we can't\nSo we're getting ready to go on a vacation to Italy and I said I Can't do it if you if you have credit card debt mhm so we cancel that bowl\nOwn and part of that retreat was four hours of meditation and I listen to your book\nAnd I came back\nAnd said okay I'm ready to do that but that won't work we can do this guy and so then you got the books are financial peace university or water just listen to the park gift um mostly we listen to the ... that's good and then we got the book and then we lead um SP oh okay so did all all unfold after all\nVery good for you guys will congratulations I guess how does it feel to have no pay you mentioned in the world amazing\nIt's so hard to describe yeah and in ... case it also removes
