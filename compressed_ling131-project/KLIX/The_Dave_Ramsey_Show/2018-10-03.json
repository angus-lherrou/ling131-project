very early on and I didn't really have a choice you your voices on\nIn the bathroom as I'm getting ready every day so it was that you know I was in full bar and I and just Justin was the driving force but it was really easy to get\nOn board so you guys are looked at it and together in all seriousness other than the overdoing the day Ramsey part I'm you looked at it together and said hey if we really rolled up our sleeves we can pay off their shelves that's it and I had an a ha moment huh\nYeah I mean we're we're a good team we bounce ideas off each other and we always came to the same conclusion as to what we were going to do and and here we are\nNow you don't have a payment in the world not that ... and the grass does do better when you walk on it I'm telling you it's not an exaggeration it's a great metaphor but it's also the truth yeah very cool very cool so how long have you been married eleven years have you ever been dead for a while you were married\n... know this

lessons learned yeah well done you guys think leads people to key to getting out of debt is\nWell I think it's planning on having a plan communicating with your spouse\nAnd being a real strategic with your money when we when they were shopping for groceries would go to the discount you know grocery places ... whether it's going if we're going to go out to eat um we're looking for coupons group bonds of some sort of deal when you know when we go out to eat and\nWe pretty much every time we go out to a meal we share an entree as like no I mean every single time so things like that um I don't I'm I'm not a big shopper so all my clothes come from discount stores I never buy anything unless it's on sale that's just how and I and\nI don't see that changing ever so it can change if you want it to her and you you don't have your payments\nNow in my DNA I'd I go straight to the sale right\nWell that share and she always tells me how much money as you say may which means that costs me something by a shoe nuts but nowadays we can afford it it's not a big deal if you're like no one else later you can live and give like no one else and you guys are in that position so did you have people thought you were crazy or detractors or did you have\nA more cheerleaders\n[noise] ah we definitely had all cheerleaders around us and no negative comments it through the whole journey and and

paying custom prices from bonds dot com always put it in the promo Kobe Ramsey and you'll see the best possible deal out there you guys are great company blondes\nDot com she'll be is in Illinois is it a good idea to pay for the coverage offered by the gas company in the phone company to cover the lines that run from my house to the street if something were to happen we're not in a financial position to cover any repairs um no I Would not pay for that\nIf something were to happen we are not in a financial position to cover any repairs um no I Would not pay for that and I would get in a financial position to cover the repairs it's called your emergency fund\nSo you need to work your way out of that like we teach and that baby step to paying off everything but the house using the debt snowball\nAnd then from there ah once that's done once you're out of that everything but the house then we're going to build your emergency fund three to six months of expenses I Do not have\nAny insurance on the things that run to my street on my house is\nNot on any of them and if something breaks I Will just pay somebody to come out there and dig it up and fix it it's that simple how would I Do that while I Would use an emergency fund how did I get an emergency fund I didn't give people like this money [noise] so I had my money now\nAre you taking a risk in the meantime yeah I mean you could if something can happen between now and the time you build it up but the point is get your financial act together and the weird thing is it causes you to end up with more money\nShe here's what's called ever heard of the term the rich get richer the poor get poorer well there are several reasons for that but it's not\nOppression and capitalism is evil that's not the\nRich get richer the poor get poorer because by and large poor people who do rich people stop with money\nBecome rich people overtime rich people who the rich people stop with money stay rich people rich people who do poor people stuff with money become poor people in other words it's about have you were saying it's a set of habits a set of values\nAre set of choices that's part of it\nThe other part is is when you do get your head above water and you get they you know you get Murphy out in the street Sallie Mae has been evicted you have more margin in your life and the weird thing is when you have more margin in your life you make more money let me give me an example\nWhen you have your emergency found in place you can ... you can raise the debt doubles on your insurance safely what happens to premiums\nPay for gotcha insurance like these little you know shoreline\nInsurance or some such crap\n[laughter] it's unbelievable no\nYou don't put your money and stuff like that you're self insured through these kinds of things in the weird thing is emergency foot happening as soon as you get an emergency on isn't that where there is is that Iran's you\n\n\nAll it takes is one emergency trip to the dentist to blow your budget quickly now I'm not a fan of dental insurance I think it's a waste of money but there is another option it's called one dental and it's not dental insurance one dental as a discount program that functions like a membership clubs think of it like Costco you join\nDefinitely\nYou know we live in the age of of excuses you know everybody has an excuse for something and I got a lot of [laughter] yeah I'm just a you know don't make any excuses we've heard a million times\nYou know oh well if we major income we could get edited or if we didn't have kids we could get out of the ... the really anybody can do it I mean you know\nIf people don't have all all scribes on here you know\nVery cool yeah that's good that's a good point no excuses just get after it you're going to you that's your bills so do your deal you know whatever your deal is do it that that is what was dealt with your guest\nExcellent good job you guys ... we've got a copy of Chris ... book for

way okay thank you well done YouTube Randy and Jennifer\nFrom my first one\nAnd forty four thousand dollars paid off in thirty nine months up their house and everything by a hundred a hundred and eight thousand dollar income counted down let's hear a debt free scream three to one\n\nPlace\nAlso from Memphis area Hi Jacob how're you remember how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm In my fiance and I were just like a personal charm something I'm so we don't have very much that was about twelve thousand two hundred on a car that's worth about nine\nOr should she got twenty three hundred and student loan debt and then we have our house mhm um we bring home between four thousand I'm forty two hundred a month\nUm and she's looking she's not really thought of our weather job a career path and choose\nThe majority of recourse coursework to get an associate someone into the um about where that would fit into strip 'em\n'cause she makes and Seventy two an hour right now part time but she gets forty hours a week with some of it\nThat would fit into step um\n'cause she makes and Seventy two an hour right now part time but she gets forty hours a week with some benefit\nI'm ... and the programs that she was looking at a as a radiology attack which would take her about two years to get done in five estimated salary mayor ... year\nA lab technician or take about a year to get done with her current the stuff that would satisfy her and she'd been making thirty eight thousand after that or an HR specialists or take her about three years of a shot that now the last\nYou know choice for her to get done so well you know we're not we're not that much debt and I just didn't know where we should focus on first or\nWell the first thing is is I hear a wide variety of jobs elections here of course yeah the Shia\nTowards the rat pack as their number one it's a really good program here in the local area it's a short nap\nYeah you know and I think I hear that you guys are analyzing her career only on the short term income\nI'm thinking long term she is she right now she works in a HR I'm and she really enjoys that she is a metal day when\nThe ten years from now aside from income\nI'm more than half a million come she likes working with people and she she was really excited about the rat pack that because we did a site there that are kind of a an orientation type thing and she really enjoyed the the teachers in a facility than they are they're working with people in that way so\nOf the three I think that would be the best long term for her to your program did you say Oh yes sir and all that it would be around Nineteen thousand but I think losing remain and work\nThat she would have to get her her associates as well as the actual course work for the degree\nOkay so really what we're saying is is we need Nineteen thousand dollars over the next two years plus we need a\nAbout Fifteen thousand to be dead free over the next two years yes so that's thirty five thousand over two years as Seventeen five a year and you make about a little over fifty\nA yes so I'm so like you can do Seventeen time of year to me and but yet I have free and pay cash for her school in two years okay you've got a cat up when when you got to map out mapped the map out but um you know I may have done something wrong and I was doing the math but I don't think I did\nNot that sound right um so he\nHe plugging away at the death smart snowball and the short term and save up to pay cash for the right type program\nWell you can you ought to be able to cash flow the ... program is what I'm saying oh oh okay do you need to look at I mean I\nThink if she starts now and you figure out okay I got to save this much a month to stay a a one semester ahead of my

... probably by third of it would go to the government of national borrow money at thirty three percent interest playoff tickets but I Do\nThat so that that that's what I Would do is I Would rural led to an IRA\nAnd just get with your smart rush to pro\nWhomever you use for your investment advice and direct transfer roll over anytime you leave the company always take my money with me in the form of doing a roll over to an Iraqi and the way of got control of it what it's invested in it it's it's convenient for me to get my hands on\nAnd if you don't have somebody to help you with that you collect

are you\nHow good how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] okay um I Am contemplating going to a new job and my current ... says and um my current hospital offer to ensure held a life insurance policy that I think it's about\nFive hundred thousand um my new employer their life insurance policy they offer is only one hundred thousand and I can't get it um otherwise I have some other means his orders and\nI just I get night or I'd have an outrageously expensive policy and I just I'm trying to think outside the box or I'm not stuck in a job that I'm unhappy because of this one issue\nYou know I don't know how you're going to be making more the other position it'll be the same okay on our movie\nBetter I only have to drive ten minutes instead of an hour [laughter]\nI Wonder if the new place the new hospital or whoever has enough flexibility that they could add some insurance programs to their group plan to allow you to buy more\nThat and they said the man that I spoke with said that it's a bundle package and he doesn't believe that's the case mhm uh aspect with um our investor and he um he said he goes it goes by your credit for well and he's like about it\nUh aspect with 'em I invest and he um he said he got the ... for a while and he's like about it and manage on account\nNo that's not my principles [laughter]\nNever heard of it I I'm not gonna start buying bonds to offset the fact that you don't have insurance that's not\nThat's what he's doing and that no thank you um I mean you you need to build up a big pile of money called wells and then you don't have to worry about life insurance and that's the general principle that you moved towards a\nMountain of their house off in December we don't have any that um\nAnd so you know I and the more wealth you have the less and less we need to worry about replacing your income for the good of your family mhm right if you have enough wealth that your family is fine and you have no debt and your family's fine without your income then we don't worry about the subject anymore because you become self insured\nYour family's fine because the point is is the family major income to live\nRight on to the extent they don't need that just to the extent you don't need life insurance now have you actually shopped or are you making an assumption that you can't get insurance\nI got denied about seven years ago and I tried\nCalling ... calls and our insurance and the market has changed dramatically\nBut I got another diagnose it back in March that when I look a life insurance and this diagnosis that um they basically said you get denied but I haven't tried Zander\nYeah trying them I mean there's no it doesn't cost anything to ask mhm let's talk about it and find out that I don't I think you may be right I mean if you know you probably found some valid research and probably not insure all you know so\nThe only question is just you know if your family only got a hundred grand instead of getting five hundred grand how old are you\nThirty eight and\nThe auto immune that you've got I mean how are you know you're a health care professional uh does do you have a real threat here of losing your life\nWhen you can't there's different degrees of it and mine mild but I um when they hit show record it kind of gone down\nActual fact you die\nI Am Lee is left without you what's the probability of that\nI don't know how you doing I'm In I'm In good health so I mean it could get worse you know you never know how old are you thirty eight\nOkay so I mean in the next ten years a typical thirty eight year old will have very low probability short of an accident of\nPassing away and yours is slightly greater is all it's not like\nYou have a terminal cancer diagnosis right right\nOkay so I'm not gonna worry about it I'm gonna take the job I Want and then use your fabulous income what you have to build wells and to become debt free in the family but I mean if you're sitting there with a million dollars in mutual funds and your four one K. and mutual funds and everything's paid for house and everything\nAnd he passed away I think your husband struggled through\nYeah I think you know\nAnd that's what I mean by self insured by becoming wealthy and shout about\nThree hundred thousand in our time at\nThem and your house is ... and you get a hundred thousand in insurance so you know he is he gonna be okay yeah you'll be OK yeah\nPlus I'm guessing he works right hey we're here now so I mean he's going to be okay so I'm taking the job because the

Ninety five thousand dollars on miles that's what it takes to pay the mortgage off correct correct okay and the next thing you need to do is you need to talk to a real estate agent and find out what this house was actually\nWorse because right now you don't know\nYeah I don't I don't know I don't know exactly who it's if my wife my wife so great grandma so I Know where I live I Will always say there was a it's a hundred and three of them but I don't know if that's even ... they're not\nAre not like it was not always that accurate but it's probably not that far off we could use that for discussion purposes okay if you if you found a house that was worth a hundred thousand and you could buy for Ninety five thousand that really wouldn't be that great a by\nI just being okay by it's not like you're getting re great deals are where you just went wow that's the best deal ever ride 'cause his eyes or if\nI'm like to even get kicked out 'cause someone gated or should I leave or should I should I go back ran over well where\nDo I want to be long term with it do you want to own um\nWell my wife she we kinda do want to own because we got a daughter she's four and my wife she that school and now so we just trying to kind of settled down right now mhm have you got ... area if I'm like I say my wife great grandma's house has she been here her whole life so she likes it it's like about two and a half three acres\nMhm and um it kind of in a country what part of Atlanta\nGotcha okay and how old are you to\nUh my wife she turned twenty yesterday and and I'll be Twenty one and a couple of days so we both twenty now mhm and you got\nA one child you said and how much debt that you have\nA we don't have any debt\nOkay and what's your household income\nI I make a layer of I'm trying to get in school but I had to kind of work with the center that was that much I was wondering what else\nUm I pay about six hundred and Seventeen dollars a month\nAnd your wife doesn't work okay that's pretty high and that's where he lied on your budget is is very tight on your budget\nAnd we just found out about you not long ago one of my friends from turkey recommended me to start listening to you so now we actually kind of made a budget and stuff going out to eat and we're already kinda you know trying to start it off a little better than\nYou do it good for you okay well here's the thing if you wanted to buy the\nHouse the only way you can buy it is the ah the relatives that are involved that would be the air's a this would be great grandmothers children or grandchildren that would be the air since there was no will someone\nHave to petition the court you'd have to get a lawyer\nAnd go to probate court and probate court would have to rule that the house could be sold and would assign someone to sign the deed as the ... to be able to give it to you you're going to have to have a court action to do that that's going to cost three two or three thousand bucks to get all that done\nOkay I don't think you need that expense right now yeah though\nAll the blue the numbers you gave me in the situation you're in um now is anybody going to throw you out as long as that mortgage\nThey get thrown out\nYeah 'cause that's what I was thinking should I 'cause I feel kind of want to actually start even going into real estate 'cause I Do construction that's what I Do know I kind of this house has kinda is not beat a it's kind of beat up and fight the last few years she yeah here and like other relatives staying there kinda beaten it up so I mean I don't know if it's like\nMaybe work more maybe you know what I'm saying they Lincoln flipping and get another house or am I live ... unless you become the owner of it yeah and and that's why I'm saying like I Do I Need to you'd had icy interstate learning anything they just hurry up and now like lions game or should I tell you what I Would\nDo if I were you I Would be willing to walk away from this house some day when you get I I Would treat it like you're renting it you're probably not going to bother to own it and if you do you're going to go through a lot of hassle\nTo become the owner going through this court action that I'm Talking about okay so uh what I Would do is pay the rent or pay that payment\nAs rent I Would not spend any money on this and I wouldn't fret about becoming the owner today it's inexpensive rent in the Atlanta\nArea it's a place you like living any money you spend on it just say to fix it up is money you're probably gonna lose you're probably not ever going to become the owner of this thing yeah it's going to be in life is going to be a really strenuous process with the courts\nTo become the owner of this because we don't even know who the errors are\nYeah well I don't I Know a couple of the day is this is not that many on 'em or that\nThey actually know about it like I said we've we've been here for a year so I don't know like should I I I'm not like should I be worried that I'm staying here pain in order to keep paying it\nIn because that's not that you shouldn't be worried because it's not bad rent\nYet but I'm I'm just worried like can't nobody command me out because it's not in my name\nYeah they can get you out the people that only can they are the heirs but they'd have to all get their crap together and they're far from doing that\nYeah and they're they're they're far away they're like in another state and\nYeah but they're not they're not worried about this is what I'm saying yeah they're not worried about this at all it's not bothering\nNot going to get any money out of it when it sells 'cause it's not worth much more than a vote on it if it was valuable now there'd be some sharks and them water circling right but it's not got any new because it's not worth any more so you're not going to get kicked out\nBut some day you're going to want to move on so don't spend a bunch of money on it 'cause some day you're just going to walk off and leave it\nYeah 'cause 'cause I've already done paying eight and scraped up before they need a little some something you know and I met my wife had because\nMoney whatever money you spend to make her happy\nIs money is gone when you leave because there's going to come a day two years from now\nThat you guys are going to stand up and walk away or you're going to go to the trouble to get the heirs to take the thing to probate court and get to be transferred to your name and you can probably do that but again it's going to cost you a couple of thousand dollars\nAnd you want to make very sure that the property was worth more than a mortgage before you did that\nAnd um and you don't want to spend a bunch of money renovating his house because you're going to very likely move on in about two years but in the meantime I just looked at it as cheap rent to a place you kinda like leaving and uh you know six hundred bucks written Atlanta\nA bad gig on two and a half acres so\nI'm sitting there in front of you for now a smell hurting anything no one's you're not stealing anything you're not doing any more harm\nThe mortgage companies getting paid they're happy the relatives that aren't going to get any money anyways still aren't getting any money everybody's happy\nAnd some day you're just gonna move along quite worried about being the owner and then if you really want to be the owner then get ready to spend three or four thousand dollars and six months of pain in the bud court actions and you probably can work this through if you can gather up all the people you need to sign on it and that's what you're facing so\nIt's an interesting situation but uh\nMy guess is it's not worth any more than his old on it my guess is probably fairly close on that if we thought it was worth two hundred thousand box\nAs their relatives thought is worth two hundred thousand bucks a Ninety thousand was never going to get a hundred thousand their pocket when it's all those sharks would already been circling they'd have been trying to figure out some way to get that thing sold and get the coach Lou it when you die without a will you have to go in and the judge has to you know authorized the sale of the asset\nAnd it has to go into a pool to be dispersed too the heirs are just like in a wheel but it's just a lot bigger mess and do you can't get clean title to this thing unless you do all that and you do not want to become the owner of it\nAny other ways of doing it properly and getting clean titled 'cause you won't be able to do is get cleaned title
