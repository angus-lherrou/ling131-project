emergency fund of three to six months of expenses are like five thousand dollars a set aside for emergencies then you would start saving towards your home and by then\nYou are also in your first apartment and you just are saving as fast as you can\nAnd you won't put down as much as you can possibly put down how old are you you said you're twenty four\nOkay go ahead well you got a good plan so hopefully in the next twelve to Eighteen months you can see that income spike up as you start using your cosmetology degree and um\nBecause you know when you're at Thirteen thousand when you get your twenty six thousand quick as we can this doubling of that's still not a lot of money but that will at least get you out there and get you moving in and get your career to start to build so a thanks for the call we appreciate you listening Ian is with us in Prince Edward Hi Ian how are you\nI Do think are taking my call sure what's up\nMy wife and I we've got five boys I have kids and we just moved into our dream on a three years ago or ten twelve acres to walk through the kids turn around [noise] but the last few months which is thirty year plan that we're in baby steps you\nAnd Georgia thinking um when we got thirty five thousand at besides the house and we're just not sure if you want and we need to sell the house\nHas to be that free or which is called through the next and Fifteen Years and just make it out and\nTen to Fifteen Years they maintain a house and everything\nYeah like ... where you know we have twenty eight years left in the mortgage\nMhm so what's your house yeah income it's about Seventy K take home pay take home pay All right yeah and um then what is your house payment\n[noise] it is around twelve hundred a month\nOkay house payments not on the line here that's fun and they're on but you gotta lotta ... you got a lot of kids and you're not used to living on a limited budget and you're going to start that\nWay yeah\nBecause you've got thirty thirty five hours to clean up I mean you really need to clean that up it's probably going to take you year and a half two years about something like that you you no longer than two years you need to have this debt cleaned up like what is the thirty five thousand in debt what kind of bet\nA lot harder to log in her parents and part of it is my credits twenty five on a credit and ten grand and alone from our parents\nOkay All right so just a line of credit would you buy with a lot of credit\nOh it's just been life has just been there about a piano in years ago [noise] I'll just miscellaneous things\nOkay and that's over right yeah not doing that anymore right\nNo no no we were like we are just sick and tired we just want to be free yeah we love the place\nI don't think I don't think you need to sell the house\nHouses now killing your twelve hundred bucks at about fifty eight hundred dollar take home by not I don't want your your okay on my house but you do have to get your written budget get on every dollar you're written budget and get that going as quick as you can ever dollar dot com and I'm starting to you know using the app\nOn your phone and you guys need to squeeze every dollar\nSo that you Clara there's thirty five because if you can clear the thirty five you're going to have pretty good room in this budget even with five kids and you can clear I did just going to take a year and a half two years just a year and a half two years or Seventeen five a year out of Seventy thousand take home that's doable you couldn't do that as a lay down and you can do that are already\nBut I have kids that means one year I don't think you're going to do that somewhere between the one in there too and that's how I'm learning on Eighteen months Richard is with us Richards in Salt Lake City Hi Richard how are you\nRight there and said how can I help [noise]\nSo I was wondering about emerging until we have a fully funded ... emergency that are of the three to ... go ahead and have about ... came out and then now\nI'm at my job offer H up the out on the matchup hundred dollars a year great um should\nShould I fully fund into account and should I count towards or America through a Fonda\nHolly funded to get that match that's wonderful and the ... of course can only be used for one kind of an emergency and that's medical bills it will lots of other kinds of emergencies pop up and so um do you do both of you work in the ... going to come\nTo know them okay and what's your household income of around ... and what are you to er nurse\nYou're okay very very stable career meaning that if you were to lose a job you can get another one in twenty minutes nursing is just a fabulous career field so in terms of ah accessibility even add hours anytime you want to add\nHours you can ... you can change direction all kinds of stuff you just really and landed in a sweet spot there so very very good on that in that you've got that type of a career that's not so specialized that it might take you six months to find a job if you lost it or something to take your six minutes um\nThen given that that's the situation I Would back and do you fully fund you're at if a bond that I just say between the three to six months of expenses range I Would back down to the three months\nOkay and so that's kind a like partially leaning on the edge as a as part of your emergency fund but it's certainly not\nWe're not really counting it because I mean you can have lots of emergencies that have nothing to do with medical on your life when you can get you again you could lose a job you could um have the death of a relative and you had to pay for the funeral or wanted to pay for the funeral you can have all kinds of different things happened transmission blow out of the car they all kinds of things that can happen\nAnd you can't use the ages or anything but medical [noise] so I don't generally counted in the emergency fund but I'm looking at your career stability and the fact you got a big fat I just say where the big fat\nOn it and she's just wonderful both of them and that makes me very close to being on the three months side\nThe three to six months [noise]\nRain for your emergency\n\nQuestion I get asked all the time is do I need life insurance was in the whole point of life insurance is to replace your income for someone who counts on your show if you have a spouse or you have\nKids yes you need term life insurance is the only way to protect them until you're out of debt and build up your ... your only digging a deeper hole if you waste money on cash value plans says it robs you of the ability to make real progress and\nCongratulations and everything so who are your biggest cheerleaders each other\nYeah we were absolutely we were in in in in your guys as ministry hands down\nOff some very cool or glad we're\nOf it gives you guys are heroes man what a great story you're absolutely right what do you tell people the key\nTo getting out of debt is I'd say there's a few things are obviously one hundred percent if you're not a team with your spouse there's no way you're going to get out of that I don't see how there's enough troubles and trials in life that if you guys are working together at Thursday's when I was struggling that she wasn't and vice versa um and then obviously the plan that you guys set forth um\nAnd then you have to be with yourself and I think not\nNot live the entitled lifestyle that you're going to borrow other people's money to lose I mean\nYou know we talked about this and if you make thirty thousand dollars in this country are more blessed in probably Ninety nine percent of people in the world and I think you just kind of have to square your shoulders and say hey this is what I Want and it wasn't fun you know she was she was working three literally three jobs she had three different jobs really I got credentialed at another university and I would go in because I have a lot of time off with my job and I\nI didn't want to I didn't want to drive three hours and stay the night on my days off in and out of University in and work extra but you know seeing them in the rearview mirror made me want to do with that much more and just get it done and it's you know I I mean what did you might get that gift for\nMy average income is probably you know without working extra is probably one Seventy five I'm an ACT UP how much on that extra probably another ten or Fifteen just in a short period of time and then and then I started getting more opportunities at my at my interpretation 'em\nAnd you know I I got the only lease that I think he would approve of this is Dave Ramsey least um\nWhen I sold my truck I was going on Craig's list and I was gonna buy a beat her for a thousand bucks and my dad's got more cars and he knows what to do with and I said hey I'll give you a thousand dollars if you let me drive the Pontiac for the next year and it's an old beat up Pontiac and I'm driving two miles to work
