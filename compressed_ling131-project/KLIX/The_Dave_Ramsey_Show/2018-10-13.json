should but\nBecause both of our jobs are transferable mhm we could transfer there is still had both of our jobs if she quits also we our health insurance goes to my health insurance which is a lot more expensive than hers\nMhm and so what does your wife make er about thirty two thousand a year mhm\nAnd I make around forty okay\nYou know she's not going to know a lotta for daycare on that you

or open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five\nIs on the face but what is a home equity line of credit is it worth having or should I avoid it\nIs an approved alone [noise]\nThat you take out only when you would want to know where you could get pre approved and have a lien against your house for a certain amount of money and that's a line of credit home equity line of credit means you're pledged your house for that line of credit [noise] um and this is a method of getting a second mortgage on your home basically a\nIs it worth having or should I avoid it will die and we tell folks to avoid that we tried to get the other way we went to to get rid of your heat lock your home equity line of credit if you have\nWhen she could reverse mortgage if you have one we want you to get out of bed because when you don't have any payments you know what you have\nMoney the borrowers slave to the lenders so now we don't recommend home equity lines of credit and bar Paul is on\nFacebook is there a mileage limit your use as a rule of thumb one buying a used\nCar um\nKnow what I'm trying to determine is is the caller\nOut to the point is going to give me trouble so the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is\nThe more the miles what effect it\nIn other words a hundred thousand miles dodged neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes\nLike one is used up and the other one is just getting started at that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point\nI mean do they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay it's not called smart anymore so I just give you that example said no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built let's say a higher in nicer vehicle uh they're typically well bill I mean ... again a Honda Alexis a Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac\nUm the larger body Ford products forge building a great product or truck a Chevy Truck afford truck with a hundred thousand miles on it I wouldn't do anything about\nUh it's got easily another hundred and it may be another three hundred and depending on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing um but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all uh again though how depends on your budget and how nice of color you want obviously the least miles\nOr the last used car I bought was a raptor at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought it I drove until I got about sixty or no I got to got about fifty something on it\nAnd I'm sure there's a very low my car when I got rid of it the other day\nAnd um so you know you just you're looking at that your situation to what is the um\nWhat is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the\nThe I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more the miles\nWould have a negative effect on it um because I'm just I'm just really don't know how can I just looking for is dependability and how much life is left and it was a cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin how are you\nSure what's up I'm Seventeen are gone\nOf knowledge and then in the town I was wondering should I invest in New Hampshire and then you're going to college yeah I mean the college with and I caught for entertainment and the olive tree\nOkay she only got two years\nAnd then ending on how the program ... maybe ... served five of the Caribbean I keep them at the community colleges to either and you and I know of course yeah yeah\nI Will be true if you get some search some certifications and stuff and not the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that okay so that's what you want to do you want me program or you want to be an hour or\nWhatever Mm [laughter] okay uh and the community college is paid for as long as you keep an eye plus yeah um you can invest it a ...\nHere's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment a mutual fund\nLike on a scale of one to ten and a nine point nine finish college and all your education was the road that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money\nTo finish your schooling and that's much much you Dustin as a better investments in a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\n... field of study that you can you know really make some good money in and the you know getting that level of education is really gonna cause your income to go be a lot a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so so um\nYou know you're the best investment we can make much better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds and I you know maybe I'll talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement account at this stage\nUh with this amount of money in your situation because again my main goal for you is your friend is for you to get your degree\nAnd your field of study whether it's a two year whether it's certifications and the tax field or or whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools in your belt the educational tools in your belt for you to be able to live your dream without any that and that three thousand dollar spent on\nIs more important than but then the mutual fund so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out and use it for college if you're going to go that route if you need to thanks for calling open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago and Mike how are you\nI'm Gray Davis an honor to speak with you you too sir what's up in your world\nHeld my wife and I are currently on baby step forward because things with them for retirement and we're using the excess in our budget to pay off our mortgage early cool and we're both teachers and the state run pension pay nine percent of our gross take home pay our dilemma is when we say an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that nine percent that we already contribute\nWe don't have much left over from August coloration so when we think the ... percent were able to save a lot for a mortgage coloration is it okay to do that oil recommended saving their twenty four\nPercent now they they mandatory amount that you're putting in a ... or you vested in that is that uh uh you choosing an investment for that or is a pension\nGet the answer is no options yeah it's it's mandatory it's a pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on sixty seven uh okay uh innocent nine percent nine percent yeah okay so\nThe the equation is do we put Fifteen on top\nOr do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct\nCorrect I\nQuestion is do we put Fifteen on top\nOr do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct correct ... I\nProbably would split the difference because I don't like the pension we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run through its horribly runs state and now we're ... those guys [laughter]\nOh yeah no thank you so\nBut what I count some of it yeah Cal some of it\nI'm not going to count it as a phone line or do we counted it as a four or five if we count\nAs a four then that means we need to put it in ten percent right you got a million and not you know have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean likelihood is I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension in Illinois it's just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere be there you know\nSo um that that that's the truth and you know that show a\nGiven that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit or so and just round numbers let's put it in ten percent of sort of put an end Fifteen Percent on top or something like that and I don't want to celebrate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but it you know as a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction show um\n[noise] um [noise] you know come and do it and that's that's what I Would do a backing off a little bit thanks for the call appreciate your joining us today Ramsey show\n\n\nBig John extraordinary things start from ordinary things that may start from changing the ordinary habits in your day to day life you see changing these habits is the foundation of our teachings after smart conferences and I'm excited to announce this fall and\nWell there's kind of a couple of things I think first of all you got to believe you know I mean it's it's it's a program to believe that it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team it can't be an individual you know we're a family of four and it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that\nIt takes the team in his own is to have you can come together and really get on board\nIt can happen you know with the with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know\nThe main things that someone needs to do to get out of that\nBudget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just flies in the door that you I don't make enough no it's their you make plenty you spend too much\nWith us troop generally true have soil I also think that um they need to focus on why they're doing it though to think further out into the future and um and to recognize that\nMy reason why might not be the exact same reason as his life but the end goal that that way in front of us is what we're both gravitating toward Mm okay go what was your why\nRight here I I I like um kids and your family tree I just the legacy I I'm listening to a lot of your stuff and a lot\nUm had cats on legacy and love are leaving behind and I think that um if we want to see change like we have to start

work\nOn the Reynolds is there a reason I plan doesn't sound good\nNo it it does but I just I guess I just needed to hear a because he's got two younger brothers that are going to be going to college to hear a lecture years old yeah\nWell ... maybe stuff for five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income and retirement fathers kids' college what you want or cash flowing in this case\nAnd ah the Sixers payoffs mortgages how are you know rentals in the house and so forth but really um you know in your case you're going to really does you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt\nTo pay on your mortgage is which is stupid in an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo I should just pull out of our Confederate that we should just save up a a a three three maybe four month ... yep\nAnd then and then I stopped taking on student loans and\nClean them out and then do the same with the other day and then but if you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids if there's money above that then we started throwing it at your either your mortgage or your rentals one of the two but it sounds like a rentals are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still they're\nFamily houses tiny and then it has made in your house mortgage must be small\nIt's about ... all about fifty sixty Seventy thousand a piece\nOkay a moral fifty 'cause you said to Fifteen\nYeah yeah and for what is the only one only twenty five I was going to write them a check like a year from now when I was going to feel good and my son is still either take out a loan\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental okay Hannah there was one in there somewhere to make that math work I uh yeah still I'm just going to play along\nThose minimums and take care college without that first once we got college without that then we find money we throw it at the at the probably go knock out a little twenty five one out and then I'm going next to knock my house out 'cause it's pretty even with the other ones\nAnd then how about getting back in the photo one K. or not\nDo I get back in the four one K. Fifteen Percent now now okay yeah well no says you get your emergency fund right yeah emergency fund is maybe step three\nYour income in retirement then we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it at the rentals in the house\nThat's your order of attack baby steps four five six in order to actually three four five six 'cause you're finishing up the emergency phone in order right but it's not like about four or five or six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent were taking care of college and then if there was money left we keep going down the list in the next thing on the list is mortgages\nDoctrine is that there's so there's still a power is Asian even though some of the news is that logical\nYeah I guess I'll just trying to jump that had that for them to injury or two and three I guess technically\nYears given five or ... you know and you have any skip three to yeah [laughter] so\nSo yeah there are other ways in which you're back in order that's all we did you can do it good plan man thanks for calling in a lease is with us in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Hi Lisa how are you\nHi Mr ... the it's an honor to talk to you how can I don't quite often for yeah okay um\nWe had our house currently on the market right now the listed it in July for two Fifteen [noise] um [noise] I Know there's not an ill in our area [noise] um [noise] we just lowered it down to one Ninety nine nine\nWe've had only one showing we've had hundreds of heads on line [noise] um [noise] what we're struggling with here that we paid one fifty for the house\nThe average stays on the market in my area as three hundred and sixty nine [laughter] good\nLord what does rural area\nWell it sort of a weird situation at all um Pennsylvania we have like an elite area about Fifteen miles from us and those houses are selling for about a half a million [noise]\nUm and then ... and so that that occasion because it's on a lake or on water on a on a dream but I'm a realtor than at our house is kind of out of the local market so we're waiting on a vacation or\nYou know so you're not in our in Harrisburg proper them\nNo no I'm In like northeast yesterday a near up near New York border but\nSo your biggest problem is you have a very limited market yes or\nA dummy through sixty nine days on the market is unbelievably long in this current environment that we're in\nI mean and all that says as you're in a very rural setting um and it's not true resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff right and you just have a limited market I don't know what to do your other than\nA is there anyone in the resort area if you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe or is or is or is there a a realtor up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that you see there are signs\nEverywhere they kinda specializes in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want to quite pony up for that area but one of the house stepped down they knew you were there\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our military that just not not purchasing\nI'm Talking about your the real estate agent in that area is or someone who dominates their resort area\n[noise] the higher and stuff\nUm [noise] not really honestly I mean we kind of stepped out through our nearest town they get a kind of a high ... I mean we had a professional photographer [noise] it look gorgeous on line it's not you know these ... it's so horrible it's kind of like everybody's second job [laughter]\nSo why are you moving [noise] we need to get where we have an hour drive to work we can't can't do it anymore you know okay three kids you know on the road for hours a day and my husband didn't know how how\nAnd we just say oh well I don't think I don't think prices your problem of ah you got a marketing problem you know what I mean by looking at they're looking at it on line all there is workers or not they're not clients are lurking they're just like the picture flip through them and their allies where it was I walked away they were not client's\nLocation Gillum was not the house and it was not surprised\nBecause our neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor um same set up as ours sold for one eighty nine half the size of our house but double the law you know\nBut a pound a buyer for ... I mean you just don't have any potential buyers much and that's what I'm trying to do is fix the marketing side of this this is a this is a really tough one I mean do I pick another real yes\nAnd that's what I was trying to get you to do to go up there and look at the resort area who's moving those half million dollar houses that when someone going to talk about a million dollar house and says gulp I really can't afford it but I Love this area they go oh I got this place down there and the fringe at under two hundred and it's the sweetest little house and you got to see it\nAnd that's who your sexual yourself through your realtor is\nThe person that can do that this that the people that are\nThe leads in the upper area and they can funnel I'm Down to you for the people that don't want to spend enough to be in the other area\nAnd that's your best shot you just need more potential buyers you're not a good potential buyers and it's probably not your real first of all they probably just don't want this area\nA central Meyer stores you need to it's a very unique\nSomalis situation\nThis is that I Ramsey show\nIdentity theft has become an epidemic data breaches are being recorded

DC\nWelcome to show Ryan how're you doing OK man\nI'm ... years ago I had um a traumatic brain injury if we're\nSo how you doing medically\nUm luckily medically where as if it's just you know prayed and and day by day I found are all just a solid we get 'em Medicaid down\nAnd just try to more flash stay healthy and save save a little bit of money but until I found you all and I didn't you know have the discipline literally save\nOkay so you're you're right but you were able to go back to work then good get fat and that's got to be a big relief how old are you a plenty wow what caused the brain injury\nA fortune on there as a full but not really focusing on that just\nSure in our area is the man you've been through hell okay so you you you're you were down\nOut they cleaned out everything did you follow bankruptcy\nYeah um my discharges actually next week she bought a chapter seven yeah\nWhere are you cleared off all the dad okay did anything survive the chapter seven like student loans or a\nIrish dad or anything like that\nOh fortunately I didn't I'm getting to the student loan trap a whole lot about going into it so\nI tried to flag work I've always been at work or

you've come all the way back congratulations thank the lord I had a guy who should I put it don't get it so how do you start over your start over a\nWiser and a less naive about financial things so whatever kind of debt that you know you know ended up in the bankruptcy its reminder to avoid that right\nAnd uh we know that an outside variable a horrible tragedy\nUh caused your financial trouble but had you had a pile of cash and absolutely no doubt at all you probably could have survived that so that's our new goal was to become wealthy without any bad and so as life uh\nLives opportunities and problems come along you're in better shape to tackle either and so how can we quickly most quickly rebuild your financial life now that you're rebuilding your overall life and\nThat's the stuff you're hearing me teach every day that get on a written plan a budget or avoid that build up an emergency fund and then begin investing long term um and as you're able to get out on your own again medically and financially you will do that to re establish yourself as a you know a\nSingle young twenty eight year old guy that doesn't live at home or no shame in that game right now but a long term you'll want to be out right just like you want to have the dignity of your whole life a chauffeur\nThat's a cool thing uh but you know the basic stuff we talk about here saving for emergencies investing being generous avoiding that um you know living or written planet budget jump on every dollar and get that out it's free and start working that and um have you been through financial piece

someday when you're rich and famous I Want you to give it to some guy who had a tragedy\nUh definitely will be for about ... you know yeah you're going back you know the kids so\nYeah absolutely you get to pour into kids so that they don't get into 'em messes like you've been through hopefully so\nI'm not that it was your fault but I don't mean that but my goodness gracious man you're you're cool I'm Glad I'm proud for you you're doing good stuff hold on I'll have Kelly pick up and we'll get you into financial peace university Michelle was in Watertown South Dakota Hi Michelle how are you\nI'm good thank you for taking my call certainly how can I help um well I just started get program and August I'm I'd have currently pay down three thousand dollars and that um\nThat just got to actually that's the guy I was making payment on a monthly payments on so [noise] um but now I Need to start on like that that's a collection of out thousand dollars mhm [noise]\nAnd I've already received a lot of like settlements in the mail mhm or less like I had a federal king hundred dollar a barrel that they're they're there\nFor me to take seven hundred for\nA friend of mine was telling me that that thousand dollars that were given mhm that I have to pay taxes on that at the end of the year and I was just wondering if you have it true\nThat is true definitely given us except on a mortgage on your home is a taxable income and they likely will send you a ten Ninety nine for the amount that day for gays\nOkay so what's your household income [noise]\nUm [noise] it it's very very ... about how about forty five thousand this year\nOkay let's say let's say you're a ... percent tax bracket as an example okay let's pretend if you were in a twenty percent tax bracket and you had a thousand dollars in forgiveness that didn't cost you a thousand dollars and only costs you two hundred dollars\nRight and so it's still a good deal what's your yeah\nI have about two hundred dollars per thousand for that is forgiven that'll hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you if they don't\nYou have no obligation to list it and I would just wait until you know they do that as I follow through on that but at the end the larger the forgiveness is the more likely they will follow through with a ten Ninety\nNine and send you that but as you get that then you will do the taxes so yeah I'd I'd get ready for some taxes at tax time that\nI'm by April ... you know that you may have in in addition to that now if you had a larger return coming because you're over withholding\nWell then in that case so you're just going to lower your return because you need to change your withholding anyway so good question thank you for joining us opens owns this ours we talk about your life and your money
