I ran into oh I Know and they don't want to learn things I just I just want to [noise]\nI kinda wanna walk them and they'll say and\nI'm One of the things we're looking to be a Christian health share ministries and I think for a while you guys might have been your endorsing run for a while I Can't remember back when you have any ways we're we've got some other families in a class or your finger income just paying thousand dollars a month\nPer year for health insurance that you're in you know we can do a family on the health care mysteries for like four fifty a mind ... I just I wanted to get your taken\nSomething physically in baby steps to you know where\nMy wife and I talked about a little more comfortable you know when we have a fully funded emergency filed by now I don't know we're just trying to navigate that and I want to get your take\nOn the uh we do indoors a Christian healthcare ministries is one of our ah sponsors for the live events and for some other things over the years I'm\nFull disclosure I have a group health care plan at our company here this Blue Cross Blue Shield that is my personal healthcare so\nAnd I'm real careful on the show as you know or even through financial ... not recommend people to do something I don't do that kind of a thing but I'm In a little different situation I've got a decent program a available to me um\nAnd so a Christian healthcare ministries um the the you know the bottom\nWas the thing is it's technically not insurance as you know it all sharing and it is based on the book of acts we're Christians band together and share each other's burdens or innocence becomes cooperatives day on his what it's doing 'em\nAnd uh the the you know I Would never suggest going into something like that that did not\nHave a long or even the possibility of going into something like that that did not have a long track record and these guys have thirty forty years of having never missed a single claim\nNow you have to read and you should read very carefully to what it covers and what it does not cover and know that and they've got a couple of plans you can buy the upgrade plan that covers different things and that kind of a thing family plan the singles plan all that they've got a normal you know in a way of products so to speak\nShe'll learn what's covered and what is not\nPay my plan the singles plan all that they've got a normal you know in a way of products so to speak to learn what's covered in what is not covered learn how it works um because it is technically not insurance you're technically if someone else in the program chose not to share\nThen war would you be you know technically but they've never failed to make a claim show it's worked for forty years you know I mean whatever number of years but decades drive\nSo uncomfortable with its credibility in that regard it is different than insurance and we get our brains get dolled into how health insurance works and this has got some nuances some differences to it so learn\nWhat those are number one number to know that I don't personally do it even though I Do believe in at number three the only way I Do it as if they had a long long long track record which these guys do and it is a Christian health care ministries and so uh and and the ... that their definition of\nThat is is that if you use tobacco or ... or alcohol then you don't qualify and so they're hardcore in that regard um\nAnd show you need to you know be aware that that they are and that's a limiting factor as well and they ... you know they want you to US Army are safe as\nPart of the process you're Christian faith as a part of the process and so that's one of its for and how has laid out but all of that and once you know all those nuances and you know those differences and you can see them um we would not\nHave endorsed that if we didn't think it had credibility\nRight and that ... and and I guess if I could ask one follow up question we were to go through that in baby steps to you and all that kind of stuff that in my life with a little concerned about\nOne of the ones we're looking for you to have the long term track record and and we're OK recall the requirement for you know we're we're evangelical Christians and all that out of ... and we're normally pretty healthy [laughter] it seems like a good for our family\nBut like one of 'em you know you pay out of pocket kind of like when I say for Fifteen hundred bucks and stuff so if you're a baby that she would you recommend it when they go that route [noise] I I had a dollar to insulate you\nYou've got to you don't want her to guide you've already\nGot a thousand and baby sit around and so you're close enough I'm ... and if you run up over just budget your other five hundred into your budget slow you know you might have to slow down your debt snowball the little bit and baby step to cover some bills if you had an event right right right and it's just like carrying largest adoptable as you said in an age essay or something I'm\nBut I'm going to take that part of the risk gone for sure and I'm\nSo forth but but yeah Christian healthcare ministries is the one that we endorse hey man thanks for the call I posed weather's April's in New York City Hi April how are you\nOkay ... thanks for taking my call Sharon what's up [noise]\nSo I didn't know whether or not and my

... if we can have another radio show that wasn't Rick revolves around money in Korea spring we can have a current event will be good social here is a current survey\nYes All right now here's or at least at the scene\nAs of June two thousand Eighteen according to the Federal Reserve in America the consumer debt was three point eight seven trillion dollars and that's a lot of debt or to the point that some Americans responded to a survey from my bank tracker\nAnd it's a small percentage but when you look at the total amount of Americans is going to blow your mind and here are the basic freedoms here me when I say this folks\nBasic freedoms that these people were willing to forgo if their debt would be wiped clean all day reading Hi Kaylee here we go [laughter] [noise] two point four percent of Americans that's about six million Americans\nGet on the president's let's see like ... million so says again six million ... million Americans said\nThey would be willing to give up their freedom of speech if you took their [laughter] we have a\nLive studio audience in the lobby of a financial ... will headquarters are shaking their head\nIlls that are really nice to be able yeah there is a guy out there with the Georgia had on I Know how you feel when I get it okay freedom of speech meaning you can't say what you\nWant and I don't like it has like beyond freedom of press like\nHere's the deal Joe lunch pail will take away your debt you're sixty thousand dollars in that the difference is you can never express an opinion the rest of your life\nThe we we would be in ... what would happen\nTo us Ken that got put on that\nI Know what would happen to me I think I Would want to any ... like I I Would go to jail for that anyway lighted imminently not be able to ... apparently they're not very opinionated people know\nWhat that's absurd ready for this this is this takes the cake three point five million Americans Rachel cruise would go to jail ... state would give up all freedom not just speech vague would\nFloat around along they would put on the orange jumpsuit and go to tell you they know it does it's not that detailed doesn't matter how ludicrous are we talking\nMainly stuff or you know go to Ralph oriental jail they would go to gym all\nThe way from your family yeah now now have the freedoms are not the way for a family work and pay off debts you're just using that you're just\nLike he was offered them your ... food yeah now let's toast break this down for a minute we're having fun with this [laughter] but but I I\nI Want you to jump in on this so these are people there's there's three point five million Americans were going I don't want to sacrifice cable t._v. I don't want to sacrifice going out about it as a vice you sports I don't want to sacrifice my rent a couch I don't want to sacrifice my F. two fifty it's costing me seven hundred bucks a month or I don't want to sacrifice that\nTo get out of debt three day rains these baby steps and civil plant where I Want to go to jail I'll go to jail\nBefore that ... or ... or it's three point five million dollars have not heard of the babies hazard that snowball and they just truly I've lost all hope that they will never ever\nOut of it you just hit the point they walk out so they think I'll go to jail and then when I get out of jail I don't have any debt that is that because they may I I Want to believe in my the glass as half full cup if there is wandering glass as half full cup that's not right you know life is helpful\nAsked Georgia go down to pinion guy what do you think about that in the lobby he's like this he literally put his hands up and looked at the skies\nDid you go down to pinion guy what do you think about that in the lobby he's like this he literally put his hands up and looked at this guy's shit\nI what I Want to believe in my optimistic view yes that three point five million Americans is isn't optimistic but that they just don't know that they can sacrifice life out you can make different choices you can live on a budget you can take out an extra job for a short period of time\nAnd pay off that that is but the sad thing as a bad I'd read like that they've just lost hope they don't think you're ... you're exactly right\nI Hope that someone that I think that someone doesn't say I would rather not I'd rather not give up cable and go to jail is in jail did have cable in jail [noise]\nNo I don't think so I mean I Know I think is limited and it's like murder she wrote from Thirty years ago so here's the ... Dave Ramsey has a plan so we're having fun with this crazy that but the reality is if you're joining the show today and you feel that loss of hope you feel that desperate\nThat your basic freedoms you give up your basic ... we've\nGot a plan is called dais baby steps total money make over walks you throw joined the show the conversation on a daily basis take inspiration from the men and women that are showcased every day on the show to their debt free scream\nWell and on this show and the right to cruise shall we always have couples come in and share their story and when I left in it and it's ... you're listening to what you it's it's everyday average Americans that's where it is people don't\nMake crazy and ... they don't have like a super being taped like no these are every day people accusing something different Missouri and at that you have to choose something different for a different outcome inside that's that's the parrot but again anyone out there you can do\nInsurance doable AAA eight to five five two to five is the phone numbers that is how it gets started to take the step today triple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Eric who's on the line and Kansas City Eric how can we help\n[laughter] how's it going good how are you sir\nGood um so I have two options I'm a registered nurse and I'm going to grad school either nurse practitioner scores see aren't a school [noise] we owe a hundred K. on her house for debt free otherwise [noise] um we have a four month old and looking at having a second baby in the next year\nI'm In the school I get cash flow and worked full time through school would be a little bit longer it's about a five year program in totality a which is a prerequisite and and I could not work two to three years and the dead of that would be Ninety thousand dollars at the end of it\nAnd so I mean the payouts are different obviously in ... make a hundred K. give or take a journeys make fifty one Seventy five\nWhich do you really want if all those money things weren't an issue and you had the responsibility of the wife and the children in the house and all that which one would you want if you could snap your fingers\n[noise] [laughter] but it's hard for me to personally answer just because there was a vantage isn't disadvantages to [noise] um I don't think I Would take away our name Millar right okay but I mean I Would be happy as empty as well\nOkay so the question becomes a can you take that next step or what do you call it the in the\nEarly ... nurse practitioner\nOkay ill okay in ... and so if you do that can you over time work your way into the other role\nNot without going back to that tree or program and doing the same prerequisite\nBut my point is let's say you're in in ... for five to seven years and you got a no debt you may even pay your house off in that time and so you can cash flow your way through that as you move up the ladder how old are you\nTwenty nine yeah I just wonder can you do it just logistically can you do if you go into the in the situation you're going to casual that so no additional debt can you overtime save enough money to cash flow your way through that ultimate role\nSo no additional debt can you overtime save enough money to cash flow your way through that ultimately will\n\nReally know what are you making now the\nOkay you'd have a forty grand bump basically a year with that and how much is at school costs again you said that you the cash flow\nOr that one would be forty K total and the other one is nine thousand crap\nCrack who you could you just start bumper salary honestly and go and do that is forty can invest that but you're gonna make forty came back in a year the Atkins right if you do that I Know ...\nAnd then go back to school yeah you may not be able to do it and that our school right now like you said 'cause you know the cash for it so now don't go into the the loan debt for that but go ahead and go through the school get an upgraded job upgrade basically and you enjoy or in a sense that you are an increase of any kind of at least and yeah and then move into\nThe school and a few years and ... you know that ... I just want you to have\nThat idea in your head I think well you\nCause you're sitting there trying to run the numbers and I think what I'm trying to do is make sure that you see that there's a ladder\nTo that ultimate goal might it take you seven or eight years yes but guess what eight years from now you're thirty seven [noise] you can cash flow your way so I think it's both saying muscle loss because\nBoth of them are what you want to do also or something that you're going to focus more of your calls about your life your career your money you're on the day ran to show don't go anywhere [noise]\n\n\nAre you one of the millions of empty nesters are look around their house and just see unused space it might be time to downsize but when you raised a family and I have a lot of emotions tied to your home it can be tough to separate the facts from the feelings and that's where an experts advise comes in handy Anna\nThat takes a little bit of time to kind of build up your book a business that I read that financial coach but it's totally do it well and to make that money for sure and so I definitely would go through our training on\nRoute and I think you bring up a good point racial Chris at twenty I think you do need to look at the differences even if they're somewhat nuanced somewhat specific between the coach\nAnd the plant or because I think you can be a financial planner and make that money a lot faster and it's still a coach me Dave says all the time we go sit down with Jeff do bonds and his team that's that's one\nOf our local guys if I sit down and just and I we want to know that he's got a hold of a teacher all that's on Yahoo ... right well I Do think you got to do some specific research there\nChris to be able to determine what does it look like day to day what do I want to be doing day to day that fulfills me and at at twenty eight yeah plenty of time to get there but in the meantime while you're pursuing the plan I Can't say this enough\nYou're not being dishonest you're not being a shy stir in the current job so let go of some of that guilt um and and\nI think you're going to be fine I just would not let that way on you triple eight to five five two to five is the number two and Komen Rachel crew sitting in for Dave Ramsey this hour let's go to Kimberly who's on the line and nodding home Pennsylvania Kimberley how can we do\n[noise] I can um I Am fifty five years old I had been teaching in public school and the health and fitness center for um Thirty years on and I just held in the last few years that on time planes are on the for something else\nAbout the last year really then I'm drawn to real estate I looked into it um yeah I can collect my a retirement um if I retire with a little bit of a penalty\nOn as opposed to going up all thirty five years and my only on\nA challenge or block is convincing my husband is a good idea funded come there will be a bit of a difference here I was\nAbout twenty five thousand dollars in salary but I Know that I can make that um I I really get excited thinking it out on helping people find homes and property and found I find that really interesting okay love what I Love my teaching but it's just time for it\nI got good news I got a good news for you and your husband okay\nSo for you to become a realtor successful realtor it's going to take you a little bit of time and I think the fact that you just reveal to us and our audience that you're still enjoy teaching there is no big hurry you're not calling in\nA completely burned out and so I Would not take the penalty either uh how many more years just for fun real quick how many more years would you have to stay in the role of teacher before he retired without penalty\nFor five years\nI just want to throw scenario you want is over the next five years you build your real estate business showing homes at night and on the weekends I think that's extremely\nThat is over the next five years\nYou build your real estate business showing homes at night and on the weekends I think that's extremely doable anybody who's ever been successful in real real estate knows you're going to build a pipeline your husband's only real concern sounds like to me rituals that he doesn't want you to lose that twenty five thousand dollar that's just that's a scary thing certainly your age\nWhat if you kept the teacher salary for maybe three years still pick a little bit of ... but I'd like to see you go all the way build that real estate business over five year period is going to be here before you know it you step into retirement full benefits and by that\nTime you should have easily replaced if not maybe another extra you know twenty five thirty percent above and beyond what you make you I think you can just absolutely double your income while still being a teacher I think that's the thing that I Want you to consider Rachel\nWhile going to say it's a great situation to be an because real estate usually agents\nShow how those when people are working so that means it is night than it is weak and that's what the busiest time and so to say hey I'm going to commit for maybe when you and your husband can decide that a year two years three years old can even go to five years if you can whatever it is and say okay we're in commit the amount of time\nAnd if you start to see yourself like well I'm really good at it because you sound very enthusiastic about\nIt you sound like a people person which means you're gonna be a great residents say they drink because most people do great when they have great people skills it sounds like you to get really so even though you're enthusiastic you still may not be great at it you can kind of get some things on your belt while you're learning for again a year or two maybe three years whatever you and your husband decide ah\nAnd it kind of step into it yeah I wouldn't go cold turkey by any means but I think that this could be excellent because having a great real estate agent your ... or anything about it and it's so commission base that you get to decide what you lake basically like how much you work how many how you sell super fun versus going from where you where the salary of the teacher\nTo do something like that can be very incredible for you personally and you may find that you're really good at it and maybe in a year he\nSaid

I'm just not sure where to go [laughter]\nOkay and um [noise] show or what do you make\nRight now I Am not working I recently moved back with family\nSo you're separated [laughter] okay and family is in Los Angeles yeah okay and um do you have children no okay so\nI'm guessing based on that separation that the divorce rate is going ahead or not say it will be okay All right\nWell whether you agree on filing for bankruptcy or not is irrelevant um he decides what he's going to do and you decide what you're going to do if you're not married and even if you are married technically because you don't file bankruptcy as a married couple um\nIn other words when I filed I could have filed insurance not filed accepted she'd sons from the paper's closure she got to file too but um and we had to follow him all the different corporations analyses that we had at the time that was Thirty years ago [noise] um\nSo uh in this case he could file and you not file that's possible whose whose name is the student loan in\nMind okay so that doesn't affect him anymore that's your student loan either way whose name of the credit cards in Baltimore\nEvenly are all our you're both on all of them were both on all of them okay\nMore heat to file and you not to file you would be left last man standing and get to pay them okay okay that's how that would work whose name is the car in soccer who's got the car\nAre two different cars and we're both on him and he has run an added there\nOh it's so twenty five is cars and waste the breakdown of the twenty five break it out for me\nUh Fifteen into an ...\nOkay okay the rule on a an asset that has um that that has a lien against it is this you cannot get rid of the debt and keep the asset\nOkay so you you could or he could file bankruptcy and you can clear off the credit card debt student loan debt is not bankrupt double it's not going away you got your student loan back that's done okay the callers then\nYou cannot keep the car unless you keep the debt you can ... from\nThe debt okay if I may but they're the only way you keep the car and so\nIt is sometimes people don't understand bankruptcy and they think oh I can just get rid of the debt and that and the color of the debt off and they give me the car free and clear no that's not how it works is why they would lean on the car okay so they either get the car and wipe off whatever difference there is or is a um\nA ... or in the event of a bankruptcy you resign\nFor the whole debt and you keep the guard show which of the cars is yours the Fifteen or the ten Fifteen okay and what does that car wars do you have an idea\n[noise] I'd say about ten okay All right\nAnd so you've got the ten thousand dollars in student loan that you're going to get that either way no matter what happens here the Fifteen thousand dollars in credit card debt you understand if he falls and you don't you've got that\nThe court now in the event of a divorce what I Would demand is\nThat if he's going to keep a car that he refinance I didn't get your name off of it or if he's filing bankruptcy um I guess he turns it in in the bankruptcy or gives it to you to sell or whatever the car that he's driving is it worth at least once wrote on it\nSay about that okay so you could just sell that car and break even but I'm a you know if you can work that out in this deal so this is a mess is what it is and you already knew that okay so the scenarios are that\nUm you know what will you be making what kind of an income do you think you'll land into\n'em I'm Internet you name it and so I Would say about an hour and working full time are you a deviant no oh no I'm attack your attack\nAll right and so I'm In that's in the Los Angeles area or you're going to ask somewhere else okay All right so you're going to land on that and then you're going\nTo clean up your student loan debt and the credit card debt and the card that if he walks on all of it yeah okay now if he chooses not to file and fly through it than the two of you got to work through this together and you're going to be\nWhat does he make [noise]\nLast year he made about a twenty five okay be coming out of the military no he's telling his share in the military [laughter]\nYeah no no security clearance you understand that he understands it I'm sure there you file bankruptcy or security clearance has gone so his chances are moving up in the military are are are harmed\nPretty dramatically if he falls or bankruptcy they didn't make any money ... and and he just came home offered deployment and he's lost his mind it sounds like oh my goodness yeah\n[laughter] I'm so sorry I didn't care\nYou know just trying to start over and it's not going to be as easy for him as he wants it to be how old is he going to heaven yeah yeah okay well\nI think you sit down with your pastor and if you knew talked to a bankruptcy attorney to understand the things I'm Talking about that's fine um I I think if he files\nAnd you don't you've got to force him a to sell the car that is in his name and probably we're going to sell your too okay I'm In and get you get your five thousand alone for the difference and then you work your
