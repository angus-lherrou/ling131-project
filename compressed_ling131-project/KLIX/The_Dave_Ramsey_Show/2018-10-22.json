and found a correlation between optimism and cardiovascular health but the definition of optimism doesn't mean you have to do everything with rose colored glasses\nUm you know basically to figure things out and and you know computers are beginning to do that in a very limited specialize sense but artificial intelligence is of course the thing that powers the robotic it's what gives the the robot its brain so it can\nYou know it it has very broad based that application they may it may turn up in a robot you know in terms of a shame that can act actually manipulated environment or in other cases it may be just running on a computer in doing you know intellectual type work you know solving information problems\nWho is the leader you know I'm always looking at the companies that will become the next apple who is the leader in terms of companies public or otherwise that you know is really a head of the game in terms of robotics were were you'll get the robotic soldier and things like\nThat well there are a number of of companies that special one morning here a lot it specifically in terms of robotic soldiers as Boston Dynamics which is actually owned by Google um so I mean I Would say that it in terms of this overall trend including both robotics and artificial intelligence\nThe biggest players right now are actually the biggest technology companies that companies like Google like Facebook Amazon or Microsoft these are the companies that\nAre really driving the core technology that's really making all this possible and\nIn many cases um especially with Google they've actually gone out and bought a lot of start up companies that are specializing both in artificial intelligence and\nAn actual robotics um three even you know to drive that that frontier even faster so that that's where you know this is all coming from that's where the the advances are coming from\nSteven in Waterbury, Connecticut Hi Steven thanks for calling go ahead\nYeah I have a question and two quick comments okay my my question is if the robot were to replace regarded workers were with the money come from to buy things like products and stuff like that because if people are working are not going to have money to buy things\nRight I mean that's um that that's a very valid point and it's something that I talk about the boy extensively in my book um you've got to help people out there to come by to stop being produced and if we really get into a situation where there aren't enough jobs or where\nUm wages are very low because there's so much competition for jobs that are out there then it's hard to see how a a market economy or how capitalism can continue to thrive so\nThat's one of the best arguments for figuring out a way to adapt to this to make sure that people will continue to have access to an income even if all the jobs do it\nOut a way to adapt to this to make sure that people will continue to have access to an income even if all the job do eventually start to disappear\nBut education is that we can I Do look at number one of my first comment after that would be the robotics would they have in uh the surgery and things like that the medical or they think that's fantastic what they're doing right now\nAre my second comment is if you look at movies like either ... or perhaps robocop pre also the you know so down things that may happen with a chemical with computers and stuff like that because so far they have perfect of a protective things can be pretty interesting what the future will bring\nYeah absolutely it's going to be a very interesting next couple of decades I Would say\nGood time to be alive Martin ... what is fueling the robotics the artificial intelligence I Know it's man but how does it get better every year who's doing this well\nIt's been getting better every year for a long long time and we it's been doubling basically that's what's been happening with computer technology but the thing that I think is really key now instead of that doubling process that acceleration has been going on for a really long time thinking in terms of\nGetting in your car and driving up five miles per hour and then gradually doubling your speed like ten twenty forty miles per hour it kinda starts out gradually but if you just double your speed a handful of times you know once you get beyond a miles an hour\nYou you need to re cracking probably need a better car but if you could double your speed twenty five or thirty times and that's how many times computing power has doubled I mean you'd be a science fiction space you you'd be traveling it millions of miles an hour you know factored anything we've\nActually ever built a and that's what's going on now that's where we are today in terms of of computer technology and that's the reason that we're starting to see all this stuff\nFinally be real he realized I think that's why now we finally have the robots that we've been talking about for decades and why we finally have the virtual reality that that people have been talking about for a long time you know it's because of this ongoing acceleration people you know finally getting to the point where all this stuff is is beginning to be possible\nWell look at what the smartphone has done Martin to the world I mean uh I got a text today from a buddy of mine who just started using the smartphone I mean ... years of dinosaur and but he loves it he said this is like a mini computer in my hand and I'm going da ... but\nIt is really revolutionized so many things it's become a portable office\nUh I Know when I'm Out and I get emails from my staff or text messages or whatever I mean you cannot put a value on that in terms of saving time and efficiency it's amazing\n[noise] right I mean it's gone to a point where you can't imagine I mean I spent most of my life\nWithout even you know a mobile phone let alone a smartphone but already it's hard to uh you know how how do we live without it um you know I mean you you could ask you about that how you survive without it and you know what we've seen with smart phones we\nKeep in mind that the you know the iPhone was developed in two thousand seven right now it's only a year here not long at\nThat that this is accelerated um and you can sort of see the progress in mobile phones to think back or you you may remember the movie Wall Street which came out\nAnd do you love that movie yeah and ... member\nAnd and he's walking on the beach and holding this cellular phone and it's\nA huge thing you know it is Matt looked like one of those new smelling like he's holding on\nHe's walking on the beach and holding this this cellular phone and it's a huge\nThing you know it is Matt looked like one of those yeah smelling like he's holding a little refrigerator almost um that's how it started in\nOne way to think about all this is to say that when it comes to robotics and virtual reality and these technologies that are just taking off their like that\nThat phone in that movie that Michael Douglas is yeah that's the stage they're at and you can sort of see where it's going by looking at you know today smartphones I mean that's the kind of progress that we're likely to see 'em over the next Twenty years or so why is small in\nTechnology better\nWell I mean it it things just get smaller and more precise and you can talk more and more into the same side I mean that's part of Moore's law basically which has always been\nUm basically esteem when you come back more and more yeah onto onto a chip pride and that's one of the things that's really driven\nA miniature ... but I mean it's really gotten to the point now where um you know even if that eventually kinda Peters out and many people think it will because we're running up against some some physical limits in terms of uh the traditional approach to Moore's law\nThat other approaches are going to Mars you know people will start cooking all these smaller chips together into massive networks and things like that in order to build entirely new architecture so uh this is something that's going to stop it's just gonna keep getting more and more dramatic\nHave you seen that movie um ex ... is it that the name of that movie\n[noise] right yeah yeah I've seen it um and you know there are lots and lots of science fiction movies that deal with many of the issues I don't I don't know any of them really get it right a lot of them are\nStill far in the future in terms of what they are trained but we're beginning to see and the real world some of these issues come up and this is this is you know how it's going to play out eventually over the next twenty thirty forty years were eventually going to see technologies like that I think\nI I think so too let's get one more call in before the break a Westland or again Hey Tom go ahead welcome to the show\n[noise] church I Love your show thank you um if you took a smart move forward with

[noise] um on top of that uh I don't think we're going to need police anymore [noise]\nAh because the a law enforcement people can just basically take over a car and drive it to the police station\nSo they won't be a need for any high speed cases and [laughter] and ah for people who are at a map now in Tennessee [laughter]\nAh it's possible to take over a car and kidnapped someone sure or a you know just run them off a cliff or something if they want it to get rid of somebody so\nThat I I could see this as being a very powerful tool of either as a very uh September the ... state or a\n... you know\nWhat was the issue you raise is absolutely correct I mean I'm definitely security\nAnd and the potential for hacking or to potential for a cyber attack from another country or something like that that there was a huge issues with self\nDriving cars more broadly for really this whole trend we're seeing where everything is becoming more and more connected uh and it didn't name for that where everything is connected together is is what's called the Internet of things and basically it means that everything not not just cars but\nAppliances and maybe robots some day and all kinds of devices and everything will be hooked up together and and one of the main things that people worry about with that is is the security issue you know what if it gets hacked what if it comes under attack so there are definitely a lot of people that are working on that and and worrying about it so it's it's an important issue\nWell we've just seen over the past several months hacking into cars on freeways people have that ability to do that now that's amazing\nThat's right yeah anytime you know cars or sexually controlled by computers uh you know the computers are ... that's that's\nYeah anytime you know cars are sexually controlled by computers uh you know the computers are ... that that's absolutely reality and and definitely one of our challenges going forward is to figure out a solution to that you know to to defend against that kind of thing\nIs is a good field to get into\nAbsolutely if you're skilled in computer security that's one of the absolute the hottest areas right now\nI mean I think that would be a great career path for anyone who's interested in that and has that particular talent and skill set\nDanny in Richmond, California hello Danny it's your turn on the coast to coast go ahead\nHi George a great you know they wanted to ask dump oil I Want to make a comment and then ask a question sure I think what we're ...

an interest in that\nYou know I just mentioned the case of the missing the fifty four aircraft back in Nineteen fifty whether there are allegations and rumors that just weeks before that craft disappeared that there were sightings of UFOs over ... air force base where that particular plane took off from\nA but moreover going into recent uh times uh there's a very famous craft I'm sure you've talked about in your show the uh the November Nineteen eighty six there was a Japanese airlines flight sixteen twenty eight\nAh this is this a cargo seven forty seven loaded with wine and headed from France to Japan and as it flew over Alaska they actually the pilots\nOr discern three objects or that subsequently chase their craft according to them uh one of the craft or that they spotted they claimed was twice as big as an aircraft carrier and this and counter was corroborated from the ground\nUh that they spotted they claim was twice as big as an aircraft carrier and this and counter was corroborated from the ground by a by radar a workers down there it on a on the door face\nUm so you know that's one particular case there was a allegedly a kind of a cover up um when this a radar information was analyzed by different government agencies and they kind of swept it under the rug but this may have been the first real definitive radar evidence\nOr that our government our military had it been actually a ... but you know that's just one example uh within weeks after that incident there were other UFO sightings around Alaska\n'em and you know up until she just last year we were up in a a location or mount have which is up in a deli national park where there'd been a lot of UFOs sightings\nAllegations of an underground UFO base there under the under amount haze that date back to the seventies\nAnd ah there was a pretty notable UFO citing just weeks before we arrived up there\nAnd in these particular cases can these people are gone they're not brought back there not still here right\n[noise] that's true um there are thousands of people that have that have never been found um now there are some\nPeople I think some of the cases probably have been solved through the years but uh the you know a good portion of good a percentage of those cases are our unsolved [noise]\nAnd uh we got to kind of a first hand a taste of that ourselves and we were up there filming a in the city of Juno there was actually a tourist that went missing or the week that we were up there and there was a massive manhunt that ensued ah so it's it's just a it's an amazing proposition that so many people ... out there without a trace center never found\nWhat was her search or an officer tender heard of course who is also doing a series on the History Channel called the missing in Alaska how did you folks all pulling in Alaska\n[noise] well um\nWhat kind of interesting Georgia's that uh one of my cats mates or his name is Tommy Joseph and he's a a a clean get is a Native American bringing\nA his father actually is a missing person or when he was a young boy his father went out on a fishing trip um\nA in a boat by himself and never return oh boy so Tommy kind of grown up with that and um so you know as a kind of a tragic story but I'm a he was driven to sort of look into some of these other missing persons cases to see if you could find some answers find some closure\nAnd uh subsequently uh he I guess got in touch with a production company that was working with the History Channel and uh they were looking for other investigators to kind of help him out and I was a one person they reached out to an addition to another guy\nA jak sat well who's a private investigator and he kind of more of a skeptic so he was going to kind of bring his law enforcement background and of course I'm more of a crypto zoologist but I'm always been fascinated with other a novelist phenomenon so the three of us joined forces and that was kind of how the show was conceived\nCan in the movie the foreign kind of course they talk a lot about Noam Alaska for these disappearances he's Nome, Alaska in this triangle\nNorm is not in the trying not in right now is on the far western\nSide of the states um and unfortunately we did not have an opportunity to to uh visit no that was one of the places we were attempting to investigate but um we stayed primarily in the uh within the boundaries of what is known as the Alaska triangle\nWell I you know I've seen this movie twice I still can't figure out if it's Hollywood or it's these are real stories\nYeah I I I\nI don't know either I think it's one of those things they they they certainly made it look like kind of found footage a kind of documentary um but you know I have heard allegations that perhaps some of that was the ... yeah so I really don't know\nNow there's been a number of big cases in that region as well in Alaska that we don't hear a lot of stories a big foot abducted in people taking them away what do you hear out there yeah\n[noise] well I'm actually I'm as we investigated Alaska's version of big foot a which is known locally by a number of native names or ruin attack were usually equal to or\nA skill you can so forth but all of those translated means basically Harry manner Bush man so essentially the the ledge him speak of a hairy men like figure a giant hairy man like figure very similar to the north American big ... sauce watch\nAnd as we did our investigation is what we found is there actually have been um claims that they for type creatures have adopted humans on occasion bringing it up in the far Pacific Northwest\nAre now would example of that is a young lady uh in rampart Alaska or back in the Nineteen eighties claim that she was actually kidnapped by one of these big foot creatures the bushmen\nAnd that she was taken back to a cave or where this thing was essentially living or dwelling with other big foot type creatures and that she was held their captive for a number of days\nBefore she managed to escape I'm and she felt that she had been brought there in order to care for one of their infants which appear to her to her\nOr to be sort of sickly and and she got the impression that they felt that somehow she will be able to help this a juvenile creature\nUm that you know that's just one example um there was a very famous story of throughout Alaska that's a a known or from an area called Thomas bay which is on the far south eastern part of the triangle\nAnd from a book that's kind of well known in Alaska called uh the strangest story ever told\nA back in Nineteen hundred a number of prospectors went up to this area um to you know do some prospecting and they had some uh counters with these what they refer to as Harry devils which if you read the descriptions that sounds kind of a big foot creature spot on\nAnd in fact uh they were chased out of this area they claimed by these highly aggressive\nHarry man like creatures um so you know those are some of the Alaskan stories and then you have a in in the bigger part of the ... floor you have\nA the famous abduction of a man named Albert Osman who was a Swedish prospect or who claimed that he was abducted by a family of sauce watches back in Nineteen twenty four this is very well known in the big foot field\nUm so you do find the stories he's accounts of people being kidnapped or inducted by big for\nLet's talk a little bit more about this because I Want you to describe pours what it looks like we'll be back in a moment Ken hard with us all his information linked up the coast to coast stadium dot\nI'm very broad shoulders no neck\nI'm leaving footprints about Fifteen to sixteen inches long um so it kinda fits the archetype of the traditional sauce culture Bigfoot or that or is recorded in Washington state California and elsewhere but\nOne interesting that we picked up on and I was fortunate to hook up with a lot 'cause ah preeminent expert on big foot a man named Jay Robert alley\nAnd he's collected a number of sightings from the state of Alaska and actually told me that he has some descriptions that actually characterize these creatures are standing anywhere from twelve to Fifteen feet tall wow which is uh yeah so I was pretty blown away by that now you don't really hear about that here\nIn the lower forty on his hands if\nThey put her saw watch that big and it's it's really hard to kind of wrap your mind around that that something a hominid form could stand twelve to Fifteen feet tall but are there apparently you know multiple descriptions that state that they're they're literally that big or some of them are I think\nThat when the eerie to see Ken I think I can I can handle a seven foot big one but man you see one Fifteen feet tall that's that's eerie\nAbsolutely and you know it's a lot of crypto zoology is based on follow gene folklore so\nWhen you hear these descriptions of man like creatures that stand Fifteen feet tall well the obvious thing is to look at the worldwide mythology and folklore and obviously you have these enduring legends of giants [noise] I mean let's let's bureau that's what they call them giants dating back you know hundreds or thousands of years in different cultures\nBring legends of giants [noise] I mean let's let's be real that's what they call them giants dating back you know hundreds or thousands of years in different cultures all over the world\nSo let's put it aside is another possibility there are other legendary creatures that you looked at there's a strange one that I'm not too familiar with a shape shift or called talk of what is that\nYes the ... the ... is a ... legend I mentioned my friend Tommy earlier he's claiming it that that's kind of the southeastern part of Alaska\nThe ... is known as the land Autor man and according to the ... people this ... is a shape shift or a that essentially lived deep in the wilderness it bears the characteristics physical characteristics that both humans and auditors which are very common animals in Alaska\nOther two species of auditors there are of course marine orders and then you have the land of the river otters\nA but according to cling legends these Kush because they're very conniving and ultimately what they're what they're trying to do is to lure people out into the wilderness\nAnd essentially to assimilate them by getting people lost in the wilderness or\nCausing people to drown or die that you know various deaths are put in these wilderness areas\nAnd if that were to happen to you as a ... warrior are brave for example J you would become a ... so essentially it's it's a it's an ongoing cycle where these these shapes shifting creatures or will essentially lure unsuspecting humans are the wilderness and then assimilate them\nAnd turn them into cruise to cause themselves now one of the really creepy aspects of this legend is that these cruise to cook creatures will sort of trick you by\nI'm taking the ... the former the shape of somebody that is familiar to you or for example a friend or a relative and that is one of the ways that they will lure you into the wilderness\nOr another part of the ledger the states that they will make it sound like a baby crying what's your what's your instinct is a person if you're out in the woods and you hear a baby cry where you would think well there you know there's a baby and distress\nThat's right you need to go out and then the parents you got to find that can't\nFind the kid and then that that's the ... you out into the wilderness and I'm Mike half made Tommy ... things that he actually did encounter when are these ... are creatures at one point or in his town of Sitka, Alaska and that he said that this thing looked\nVery much like an auditor except that it had kind of a strange looking its eyes are almost like a it was possessed or something and that he ultimately against is better judgment you did you get to follow this thing kind of out into the woods why was that seemed to be leading him away from his home and then\nIt kind of came to at one point realize what was going on and was able to sort of break the spell but many of the people that I spoke to they were very adamant that this is not a Memphis is not a fable these ... creatures are very very real to them\nThat's repeat that this creature use creepy\nYeah it's pretty it's pretty creepy and uh you know there's that little sidebar here a few years ago Charlie Sheen are actually uh I guess it was kind of more of a publicity stunt than anything else but he's staged ache ... expedition of his own up in the state of Alaska\nSo it wasn't too successful with that one I guess not no [laughter]\nYou look under burns these these creatures are intriguing to me because they could be prehistoric but whatever they are we get sightings of huge birds as big assessment is what are we here in Alaska\n[noise] yeah well I'm as you know George I been investigating the Thunderbird phenomenon for many many years now elected accounts eyewitness accounts from all over North America but\nAnd as you know George I been investigating the Thunderbird phenomenon for many many years now elected accounts eyewitness accounts from all over North America but Alaska despite its very small population definitely seems to be a very active area real hot spot for these Thunderbird accounts\nNow of course you have to acknowledge that you have the many native Thunderbird legends and in fact if you go to Alaska you'll actually see five hundred birds are being portrayed on different ... and and native artwork and so forth so they believe in front of the birds and different native cultures their dates back many centuries\nBut in terms of modern sightings back in two thousand and two there were a number of sightings of thunderbirds over Alaska it actually made a international news because many of the witnesses were experienced pilots and so forth that saw these enormous bird that had like a fourteen foot wingspan basically the size of a small airplane\nAnd through the years uh and partially thanks to you for for having me on a coast to coast in prior years to talk about ... I've had people reach out to me from the state of Alaska that have also seen these\nAh thunderbirds and they describe them as essentially looking like giant raptor types of birds very much like an ego with a hook to be kind of a predatory bird ... a dark colored feathers or but again the thing that really stands out as we're talking about a wingspan that ranges anywhere from Fifteen to twenty or twenty five feet across\nWhich is about five times bigger than any known bird species\nAre so we we really could be dealing with I Believe something prehistoric in nature or if you go back and look at the ice age or the place to see any pock ten twelve thousand years ago North America actually was populated by these enormous birds noticed territory ends\nAnd they did have wing spans anywhere from twelve to Eighteen feet across\nA and they were somewhat related to modern contours of vultures so they may have had that kind of raptor like appearance of will copy in essence what we can be dealing with here is a surviving population perhaps a very small population of these enormous prehistoric birds\nAnd what better place for these birds to remain hidden that in the great state of Alaska\n... I'll always remember this incredible story and I believe it was an Illinois can open the woman who came outside to see a bird with the Taliban's stuck into its her son a little boy and it was lifting him up and she had to knock him down with the boom\nYeah\nAbsolutely that's a the lawn Dale incident you nailed it July twenty fifth Nineteen Seventy seven ten year old murder low was picked up by one of two giant blackbirds right in front of his mother and several other witnesses carry for several feet until they were able to basically\nConvinced this bird to let go of him and are are there are other accounts of history Georgia of of giant Thunderbird type creatures are carrying away small children for example um I don't know that he documented cases of the parents you know carrying away adult\nOr but theoretically if you were talking about a bird with a twenty five foot wingspan way perhaps a couple of hundred pounds or more than you know it is it is a a possibility so that is something we explored for the for this particular episode that perhaps some of these missing people in Alaska\nGod Forbid maybe carried away by these giant thunderbirds to some remote craggy peak in said the baby birds or something [laughter] it's hard to envision isn't it but ah definitely ... a chill is running down my spine right now like God about is\nHow do you think the eggs will be twelve inches tall two feet tall big\n[laughter] they'd be ... I mean a ... you get a badge and\nYou think the eggs will be twelve inches tall two feet tall big\n[laughter] they'd be ... I mean a ... you get a ... an ostrich egg and maybe several times larger than that if you've ever seen an ostrich egg or they're they're pretty big so\nYou know what that is one of the uh uh from a skeptical point of view that as one of the frustrating thing is we don't have any physical evidence that these thunderbirds no one has found a giant egg or or a giant master anything yet but\nUh that certainly doesn't preclude that uh the the possibility that they exist because I've\nInterviewed as I said many dozens of people very credible people from all walks of life who have testified that they've seen these things and I believe them", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "22"}
