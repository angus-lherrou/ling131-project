people George has had on his show I mean\nAnd I'm I'm not kidding anywhere do you have any recommendations that I might not have heard of yet\nOh definitely give me a a call or email me certainly sage looses up emotional energy it loses up negative emotional energy soldiers Frank concerns coal poll there's many substances that were very very well loosening up energy is kind of like spring something on the\nWall to get something off of it doesn't alone get rid of them the home\nSee that's the problem is is that stage will release it you know out into the atmosphere but it will not moving from your home will not removed from your living environment it has to be actually pushed down into the earth and away from the property in order for it to be removed because\nEssentially what I think that's going on here to Jay Z you've been releasing it by doing these you know really positive things stage breaking says all of these things you know I'd recommend them certainly\nBut we're releasing them into the atmosphere they still have to be released from and pushed out from the home in order for them to be out of your life and I think it was going on is that is just accumulated a\nTo the point where it's all around you and you're doing everything you can but now it needs to be forcibly pushed out of your home\nAnd this is where a lot of people have issues you know they do things you know that they they learn on the Internet or from you know qualified people that actually work in to some extent\nBut emotional energy negative spirits and all of these things need to be forcibly removed from the home so it's kind of like you know taking the Bruins pushing it all the dust into the center of the room we still have to take a ...\nRemoved from the home so it's kind of like you know taking the room and pushing it all the dust into the center of the room we still have to take a dust pan yet the you know a broom and get it in the dust pan into the garbage has got to go into the garbage and that's what's not happening\nAll right thanks for them now tell us a little bit about what is exactly negative emotional energy Jeffrey\nPeople generate both positive and a more a negative emotional energy is from the very first day that were born shortage\nAnd these things can become trapped in our bodies energy fields also known as the ... but the or is not just a bunch of pretty lights it is who we are as part of who we are a personality are our emotional systems\nHave an energy field that extends out from the very center of our non physical body which is our spirit\nOr maybe three or four feet outside of our physical body and emotional energy can become trapped\nOver a period of time in just about everybody everybody has the issue so emotional energy this negative that we generate can be trapped in our bodies energy field\nAnd we can also pick it up in any kind of store restaurant somebody's home\nI'm watching TV or you know a pub just every place there is emotional energy and our bodies energy fields have we don't protect ourselves\nAnd most people don't that it actually permeates into our energy field and mixes with our own emotional energy positive and negative and causes habits and this is one of the biggest problems that people who call me have it's not it was just a manic spirits\nThe idea is is that we are filled full of emotional energy on the positive energy I don't touch I'm not even capable of doing that\nWe only let go of what we want to let\nGo and so I deal with essentially clearing out the negative emotional energy in negative emotional energy is something that uh people want to release\nI bet they feel a hundred percent better when it's going pretty natural let's go to Terry in Houston, Texas welcome to the show ... go ahead\nYeah George or I guess what I'm a even as the original language was the scriptures and I'm I'm actually writing a book called that we really goes out is\nAnd I tell you the Bible in Nineteen eighty steak that I dealt with a lot as a party a theme and I was going to ask you Jeffrey are you a Christian\nI don't belong to the Christian religion I Do believe in guys I also think that ah the argument over creationist a series and a truly scientific physical theories as ridiculous they pull work hand in hand\nFirst prince will is creation spirits don't just sit around and clouds and do and do nothing higher spirits angels guide\nYou know they create almost like a ... of a cake on a non physical level the design of the universe and then comes the physical so that non physical\nProceeds the physical\nSo the idea that you know creation is does that happen as the universe created absolutely\nBut also the big bang theory why not so it's essentially like I said like baking a cake you know that spirit guide angels are in the business\nOr in a wonderful business of actually creating an designing\nIts spirit guide angels are in the business\nOr in a wonderful business of actually creating an designing these things perpetually right now as we speak not just in the beginning of time but right now\nAnd that filters up it's connected with a physical all things physical so each person has to levels of physical body which is very finite sixty eighty years or Fifteen Years or whatever\nAnd our spirit which is completely a turtle and her personality which never dies and and I'm really amazed at the argument that or not you have but I mean that is\nBeing fostered out there between religion and scientists which I agree with I'm I Am a non physical scientist essentially\nSo I Believe in all of this is science to me you know\nAnd I think that you know God has a personality you know whether there was one or two I don't know I'm not sure you know but I Do believe that there I Know there are higher spirits out there because I work with them and I work for them and so I Do believe you know I worked Christians all the time\nAnd I respect that religion and so I you know I think what you're doing is marvelous you know I think that it's just that there's a misinterpretation in needless argument between these two are theories that are both correct\nAnd let's go back to the other question go ahead Teri\nUh yeah what I was going to say is you're talking about religion religion teaches at ... and the guy go to church give your money\nDo this don't do that that's not from guy the problem is is that we have many ministers out there that teach uh this type of stuff then basically do they make money off the guy\nThe problem is with this with this whole scenario as it turns people off like you Jeffrey and and I understand that I\nReally do understand that and I feel sorry for people that don't know this but you've got to understand that the only Christianity is not a religion it said if it's a relationship between you and God\nNow why is that well to be an arbitrator you have to be God man\nJesus is title is Jesus is Lord Jesus Christ lord needs\nDia de Jesus means humanity in crisis means anointed what okay so what happens is because we don't do this in order to be because none of us are perfect on this earth in fact in fact Peter said\nThat I'm a ... that God is no respect or a person so we're all in the same boat\nNo matter how much knowledge we know we're all in the same boat with God because we have is the nature because we're we're born in stand because of Adam's then because we carry out and then\nUh our entire life we we are and and even Paul says is that that none of us are the glory of God we were all on the same

California is with us say Thomas charge thank you for taking\nFree great work that you're doing carefree my question is about war and the battle field and more ...\nHow does military personnel men and women in a battle situation protect themselves from the Monica solved I'm not talking about\nJust battling insurgents physically but there must be a lot of demonic energies in a wartime battlefield situation\nAnd do you have any advice for men and women in the military to protect themselves I\nDo I was in the air force myself many years ago um and especially there are messages through our rules on the other side\nOf emotional energy that we all generate and and as a in the battlefield hatred and anger and fear and there's killing going on and so it certainly is a a a place where negative ... tracked into demonic spirits negative ... says well terrible things are happening\nAnd so we need to build up and strengthen our energy fields or methods there are rules on the other side like there are physical rules so there are things we can do in order to build shields around ourselves to protect us from the effects\nThat negative energy that is generated by other people fear around us which is natural and the battle situation uh emotional energy that just you know so intense on the battlefield\nThere are multiple layers that can be applied that actually work so that negative energy actually bounces off of us\nThis is something I teach people to do every day it's very important and so it's not you know\nUh you know just about me the idea is is that yes there are lots of things that people can do on the battlefield to protect themselves in the military\nYou just had to learn how to do them they're actually very simple and it can take this stuff I designed over the years with the help of my spirit guides can be brought up in five or ten seconds\nYou needed fast you know the old style was doing things ten minutes in the morning in ten minutes in the evening I read all that stuff when I got out of the service ten minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the evening\nBut we need it's very different now it's very different we you know we didn't we need protection right away we don't know when things are going to hit us\nWe need to be able to bring up our protection systems immediately in order to deflect negative emotional energy or this being generated by the enemy by people around us are that are unhappy and are frightened and also by spirits that are trying to interfere\nAnd feed off of the killing and and also also are off the fear and here so I think that it's very important that we all learn that this kind of thing\nAnd it's a science it's not a religion what what I'm involved in is not religion I Would not even to say is really metaphysical is non physical science\nHave no problem with physical science I agree with everything that they have to say scientists do not call me up and to argue with me they are right I deal with non physical science which is essentially is the non physical part of our body\nAre emotional systems are personality everything else butter\nWhich is essentially is the non physical part of our body are emotional systems are personality everything else butter physical body that is susceptible to attack\nAnd also negative emotional energy by negative spirits demonic spirits and also people and really bad and scary situations\nHave you seen demons attack businesses and why did they do that\nThey do it in order to destroy a person's life hack the fabric of the family and the best way to do it is to pull out the resources money George to get it out\nIf they destroy your business than they have a two fold thing going on they have people that are fired that have to look for a job it can cause arguments at home it can cause people to lose their place\nOr where they live all sorts of problems that can cause them to feel bad and actually react sometimes violently\nAnd also it has an effect upon the actual business environment where now you have a field business I think most restaurants they fail within a year so restaurant after restaurant comes into the business after business comes in\nAnd you have problems of failed businesses and that has an accumulation of emotional energy as well\nPlus you have all the people working uh who don't necessarily get along as kind of like our our second family we have a family at home\nAnd we have our family at work and everybody doesn't get along and so essentially have a lot of emotional energy people at work who are sitting at their desks and maybe thinking I really hated here\nWhen they're doing that they're generating emotional energy and it can it can be positive or negative emotional energy but sometimes as negative accumulates in the environment\nThis also attracts negative spirits and demonic spirits\nBecause if they can get somebody fired by you know doing or saying something uh you know inappropriate more uh you know simply not doing their job or she'll be destroying the business itself by making of a the business atmosphere very uncomfortable emotionally\nEverybody's got a story about walking into a living environment a pub\nOr a business or restaurant and saying you know what this place doesn't feel right what they're picking up on George is emotional energy whether it be good or bad that's emotional energy they're picking up on everybody has a story of that this place doesn't feel right is emotional energy and the needs to be cleared out\nSo they attack businesses because they can actually make a business failed you might have two hundred or two thousand people out of work and now they're really unhappy they go home and there are arguments where there are significant others with their kids and a and then it just snowballs\nNext up let's go the Monique can sun ... son won the California Hi Monique go ahead\nHi George I'm way that twenty eight million that guy to hack if I say that they got you on oh I just found out this year at him and I had a couple of questions that first one is\nRegarding um mental illness schizophrenia now obviously there is a scientific reason behind it\nHowever who is just say that people with this condition Ari team spirit turning around and I find it very interesting that so I'm On the back in part a lot about seeing God he hits\nAnd then another side will talk about demonic air it here that's my first question the second question is either\nSide will talk about demonic hear it so that's my first question the second question is I've seen numbers on the clock\nAnd addresses a triple number it's short while Georgians had um multiple gas [noise] talk about these annual numbers and George you said how do you know that it's not coming from I didn't mind it works in most of your guests say on now like it's a good thing that I like it now\nOn sale and then if you think that it is possible that I'm negative spirits can come through you know by um number numerology yeah those are my two questions\nWell Monique a very powerful negative spirits can affect people on a physical level that's very sad but it's also very true they can actually hurt people physically it does happen I myself had been attacked you know I deal with this stuff every day but you know\nEat\nMeat needs to be in the ... we didn't meet the needs dot com Vicki\nJamie progress is

have some issues\nI didn't catch the beginning of the program and I'm not sure where you're from but I Am up in Minnesota\nAnd\nI have had a problem I created when I was back in the marine corps a prior to the war um after I went through that what happened often we'd you board followed me as it said it would\nAnd I've lost two families or Twenty years worth of families I I'm a dedicated man\nAnd\nI met the bottom of the barrel at the moment and I've tried cleansing my house was stage and everything else [noise] um I mean I've I've I've done everything I've talked to some of the the best people George has had on his show I mean\nAnd I'm I'm not kidding anywhere do you have any recommendations that I might not have heard of yet\nOh definitely give me a a call or email me certainly sage looses up emotional energy boosters up negative emotional energy soldiers Frank concerns\nCoal poll there's many substances that work very very well loosening up energy is kind of like springs something on the wall to get something off of it\nBut it doesn't alone get rid of the home\nSee that's the problem is is that stage will release it you know out into the atmosphere but it will not move it from your home will not removed from your living environment it has to be actually pushed down into the earth and away from the property in order for it to be removed because\nEssentially what I think is going on here to Jay Z you've been releasing it by doing these you know really positive things stage Franken says all of these things you know I recommend them certainly\nBut we're releasing them into the atmosphere they still have to be released from and pushed out from the home in order for them to be out of your life and I think it was going on is that is just accumulated\nA to the point where it's all around you and you're doing everything you can but now it needs to be forcibly pushed out of your home\nAnd this is where a lot of people have issues you know they do things you know that they they learn on the Internet or from you know qualified people that actually work\nIn to some extent but emotional energy and negative spirits and all of these things need to be forcibly removed from the home so it's kind of like you know\nThey can ruin pushing it all the dust into the center of the room\nWe still have to take a dust pan yet the you know a broom and get it in the dust pan into the garbage has got to go into the garbage and that's what's not happening\nAll right thanks for that now tell us a little bit about what is exactly negative emotional energy Jeffrey\nPeople generate both positive and a more a negative emotional energies from the very first day there were orange shortage\nAnd these things can become trapped in our bodies energy fields also known as the ... but the or is not just a bunch of pretty light it is who we are it's part of who we are a personality are our emotional systems\nFor the lights it is who we are as part of who we are a personality are our emotional systems\nHave an energy field that extends out from the very center of our non physical body which is our spirit\nOr maybe three or four feet outside of our physical body and emotional energy can become trapped\nOver a period of time in just about everybody everybody has the issue so emotional energy this negative that we generate can be trapped in our bodies energy fields\nAnd we can also pick it up in any kind of store restaurant somebody's\nHome I'm watching TV or you know a pub just\nEvery place there is emotional energy enter bunnies energy fields have we don't protect ourselves\nAnd most people don't that it actually permeates into our energy field and mixes with our own emotional energy positive and negative and causes habits and this is one of the biggest problems that people who call me have it's not it was just demonic spirits\nThe idea is that we are filled full of emotional energy not a positive energy I don't touch I'm not even capable of doing that\nWe only let go of what we want to let go and so I deal with essentially clearing out the negative emotional energy in negative emotional energy is something that uh people want to release\nI bet they feel a hundred percent better when it's going pretty natural let's go to Terry in Houston, Texas welcome to the show Jerry go ahead\nYeah George or I guess what I'm a even as the original language or the scriptures and I'm I'm actually writing a book called that we really goes out is\nAnd I tell you the Bible in the navy stay with I dealt with a lot as a party a theme and while I was going to ask you Jeffrey are you a Christian\nI don't belong to the Christian religion I Do believe in guys I also think that ah the argument over creationist a series and a true scientific physical theories as ridiculous people work hand in hand\nFirst prince will is creation spirits don't just sit around and clouds and do and do nothing\nHigher spirits angels guide\nYou know they create almost like a bad or of a cake on a non physical level the design of the universe and then comes the physical so that non physical proceeds the physical\nSo the idea that you know creation is does that happen as the universe created absolutely\nBut also the big bang theory\nWhy not so it's essentially like I said like baking a cake you know that spirit guide angels are in the business\nOr in a wonderful business of actually creating into designing these things perpetually right now as we speak not just the beginning of time but right now\nAnd that filters up it's connected with the physical all things physical\nSo each person has to levels of physical body which is very finite sixty eighty years or Fifteen Years or whatever\nAnd our spirit which is completely internal enter personality which never dies and and I'm really amazed at the argument that are not that you have but I mean that is being fostered out there between religion and scientists which I agree with\nI'm I Am a non physical scientist essentially\nOh this is science to me you know and I think that you know God has a personality you know whether there was one or two I don't know I'm not sure you know but I Do believe that there I Know there are higher spirits out there because I work with them and I work for them and so I Do believe you know I worked Christians all the time\nAnd I respect that religion and so I you know I think what you're doing this marvelous you know I think that\nIt's just that there's a misinterpretation and needless argument between these two are theories that are both correct\nAnd let's go back to a jury for the other question go ahead Jerry\nAh yeah what I was going to say is you're talking about religion religion teaches at probation a God go to church give your money\nDo this do do that that's not from guy the problem is is that we have many ministers out there that teach uh this type of stuff then basically do they make money off the guy\nThe problem is with this with this whole scenario as it turns people off like you Jeffrey and and I understand that I really do understand that and I feel sorry for people that don't know this\nBut you've got to understand that the only Christianity is not a religion if it if it's a relationship between you and God\nNow why is that well to be an arbitrator you have to be God man\nJesus is title is Jesus is Lord Jesus Christ lord need the anti Jesus means humanity and Christ means and only did one\nOkay so what happens is because we don't do this in order to be because none of us are perfect on this earth in fact in fact Peter said that I'm a ... that God is no respect or a person so we're all in the same boat\nNo matter how much knowledge we know we're all the same boat with guys because we have

situation\nOr emotional energy that just you know so intense on the battlefield\nThere are multiple layers that can be applied that actually work so that negative energy actually bounces off of us this is something I teach people to do every day it's very important and so it's not you know\nUh you know just about me the idea is is that yes there are lots of things that people can do on the battlefield to protect themselves in the military\nYou just had to learn how to do them they're actually very simple and it can you know take this stuff I designed over the years with the help of my spirit guides\nAnd he brought up in five or ten seconds you need it fast you know the old style was doing things ten minutes in the morning in ten minutes in the evening I read all that stuff when I got out of the service\nTen minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the evening\nBut we need it's very different now it's very different we you know we didn't we need protection right away we don't know when things are going to hit us\nWe need to be able to bring up our protection systems immediately in order to deflect negative emotional energy or this being generated by the enemy by people around us are that are unhappy and are frightened and also by spirits that are trying to interfere\nAnd feed off of the killing and and also also are off the fear and here so I think that is very important that we all learn that this kind of thing\nAnd it's a science it's not a religion what uh what I'm involved in is not religion I Would not even to say it's really metaphysical it's non physical science\nI have no problem with physical science I agree with everything that they have to say scientists to not call me up and to argue with me they are right\nI deal with non physical science which is essentially is the non physical part of our body\nAre emotional systems are personality everything else butter physical body that is susceptible to attack\nAnd also negative emotional energy by negative spirits demonic spirits and also people and really bad and scary situations\nHave you seen demons attack businesses and why did they do that\nDo it in order to destroy a person's life a hack the fabric of the family in the best way to do it is to pull out the resources money George to get it out\nIf they destroy your business than they have a two fold thing going on they have people that are fired that have to look for a job\nDid it out if they destroy your business than they have a two fold thing going on they have people that are fired that have to look for a job it can cause arguments at home it can cause people to lose their place\nOr where they live all sorts of problems caused them to feel bad and actually react sometimes violently\nAnd also it has an effect upon the actual business environment we're now you have a field business I think of most restaurants they fail within a year so restaurant after restaurant comes in or business after business comes in\nAnd you have problems of fields businesses and that has an accumulation of emotional energy as well\nPlus you have all the people working uh who don't necessarily get along as kind of like er er second family we have a family at home\nAnd we have our family at work and everybody doesn't get along and so essentially we have a lot of emotional energy people at work who are sitting at their desks and maybe thinking I really hated here\nWhen they're doing that they're generating emotional energy and it can it can be positive or negative emotional energy but sometimes it's negative accumulates in the environment\nThis also attracts negative spirits and demonic spirits\nBecause if they can get somebody fired by you know doing or saying something uh you know inappropriate or a you know simply not doing their job or she'll be destroying the business itself by making of a the business atmosphere very uncomfortable emotionally\nEverybody's got a story about walking into a living environment a pub\nOr a business a restaurant and saying you know what this place doesn't feel right what's her picking up on George's emotional energy whether it be good or bad that's emotional energy they're picking up on everybody has the story of this place doesn't feel right is emotional energy and needs to be cleared out\nSo they attack businesses because they can actually make a business fail you might have two hundred or two thousand people out of work and now they're really unhappy they go home and there are arguments with their significant others with their kids and a and then it just snowballs\nMatched up let's go to the Monique in some little son won the California Hi Monique go ahead\nHi George I'm with a twenty eight million that God or hacked by face but only they got you on oh I just found out\nMysterious him and I have a couple of questions that first one is regarding um mental illness schizophrenia now obviously there is a scientific reason behind it\nHowever who is to say that people with this condition Ari seeing spirit trimming other around and I find it very interesting that so I'm On the spectrum costs a lot about seeing God do you use this\nAnd then another side will talk about demonic here it so that's my first question the second question is I've been seeing numbers on clock\nAnd addresses a triple numbers for awhile Georgians had um multiple gas that talk about these angel numbers and George you said how do you know that it's not coming from a demonic worse than most of your guests say on now like it's a good thing but I like you know\nI'm Mr sale and then if you think that it is possible that I'm negative spirits can come through you know by um number numerology so those are my two questions\nWill Monique a very powerful negative spirits can affect people on a physical level\nIt's true they can actually hurt people physically it does happen I myself", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "14"}
