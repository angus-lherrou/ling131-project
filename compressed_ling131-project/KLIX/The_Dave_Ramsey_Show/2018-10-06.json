[noise]\n\n\nRamsey\nIs king and love\n\nShow up on a whim she\nUsed to be able to talk about your life and your money to recall of Tripoli eight to five five two to five [noise] I think I'm\nGetting old because I'm getting more and more nostalgic\nI was thinking this morning about the neighborhood I grew up in and you know\nBad stuff all your does remember the good stuff and so it's very ideal like in your mind I\nIt was an idea like neighborhood it was incredible is full of kids and we were always doing something you ever get a ... a piece of plywood out and put a couple of bricks up\nUnder it and go across it on your bike like evil can leave all your jumping and it didn't go well and you go over the handlebars I mean have you ever done stuff like that and went anymore how much\nI mean we play baseball we play football we spent a lot of time arguing about the call 'cause my weight would always argue about whether somebody is out of bounds we played and played and played and played and played run in\nOut of each other's houses and one mom always had some lemonade when mom would always have some\nBaloney sandwiches I mean it was a great neighborhood\nAnd I remember being a little kid and some of the kids I played with started going to school I thought man I Want to go to school you know be cool to go to school when I can go to school I'll be happy than ever thought that\nAnd and then I got to go to kindergarten and I thought man next year I'll be in a grade with a number on it I'll be happy then they teach you to read in the first grade I'll be happy\nThen and when\nWhen I went to school and I don't know where you go to school but I mean we had one through six was elementary school and and so you know you're about a second grader and all the sixth graders there the king of the hill right down the school right\nAnd so you're like man if I could just get in the sixth grade I'd be like the big dog on campus I'd be in charge I'd be I'd be ruined the school man I'll be happy then then you finally get the sixth grade and you know what you look over there and we had when we called junior high\nSchool or middle school which was seven eight nine the school I went to and I thought man if I could just get out of six gringo their middle school you know they've got I got the they've got football they got cheerleaders cheerleaders\nThey guy lockers man I if I could get over to middle school I'd be happy then you remember that\nAnd that was in middle school I got to be about the ninth grade and I was fourteen Fifteen Years old and one of my buddies got his driver's licence and all man if I could just get my driver's license I'd be free I could drive\nPlanned and my husband and I were both making more money at that time and defense than our income has gone down and we added another child and we've gotten into a credit card debt and they have a caller now um\nWe can take the money out and we've invested over the past three years without penalty should we do that or should we just path I got to leave that money and continue contributing to their prepaid plan how much is it in there [noise]\nUm about eighty six hundred\nEighty six hundred dollars on how much do you own your car\nWe have a ten thousand and what do you own your credit card a five thousand okay and um\nAre you guys on a budget and reducing debt already\nWe just started up here and that's and I realized we did that baby step out of order with having Peter Pan pre played piano letter I don't know what to do at this point gotcha okay\nI'm In your household income as well\n[noise] um I had the next twenty five and I have a small business that brings in about twelve thousand a year\nOkay so about sixty thousand give or take All right\nNo I Would not cash\nWould stop adding to it um\nAnd um you do need to get on a budget and follow through with what you're learning in central ... university and just work your baby steps if you stop\nAdding to its you'll be fine the other thing I probably wouldn't do a norm urgency a no rush but sometime in the next year or two I Would probably take that money out of their enroll it into a five twenty nine\nPlan in good mutual funds and here's why you're much better off to save for college in a five twenty nine\nOr an ESL and mutual fund or than you are with prepaid college plants here is the reason anytime you ... pay something your rate of return is what it increases in price and so if I prepay a an item I pay a thousand dollars and increases in price\nTo twelve hundred dollars my rate of return if it did that in one year would be twenty percent so that'd be a nice rate of return right so how much of an increase in price because that's the only returned when you ... pay anything they're not giving you an interest rate they're not giving your growth rate\nYou simply are saving the increases in tuition by paying it ahead of time that's all you're doing now tuition for the last Seventy odd years as average about seven point two percent inflation right so that means you're making about seven point two percent\nThat good growth stocks mutual fund you ought to be ten to fourteen percent\nAverage annual return over that same period of time mind and so\nYou make more by putting it in and you actually get some headway towards college the\nOther problem with prepaid college is a ... and it's a blanket statement but ... and it would vary from state to state many many many of the state's\nBusiness government are very poorly run and they screw up some of the prepaid college plans and the process\nI mean they're just horrible administrators now some states are well run my state happens to be well run show in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be concerned today under the current administration with a\nWith the stability of the ... still wouldn't do prepaid college even in Tennessee because of the other reason I was talking about I Want a better rate of return on my money than simply the inflation rate of tuition so all of that to say a row you already six hundred bucks into five twenty nine and a good mutual fund at some point right now\nI just stop adding get yourself on a budget cranky lifestyle down\nStop going out to eat canceled the trip that you had planned to call to vacation because you're broken you've been spending more than you make and you have to stop that and that's how you got a car loan and credit card debt so you're right on track you're doing the right kind of things and that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes Matthew\nIs with us in Fort Worth Texas hey Matthew how are ya\nI'm excellent or want to thank you first off for a a ... I was going through a few for the last seven years and we paid off over a hundred thousand dollars good for him and would have been in bankruptcy had a had we not gone through recipe you wow so ... to my question because this was a wonderful than it's fixing to happen\nOr we were at my family my parents have received an inheritance of mineral rights in West Texas ... a large portion\nAnd a habit struck oil a lot of oil we've had it for a hundred years and had a few oil wells but not not a time\nMhm uh speculators are wanting to sell a or by our rights for a large sum of money [laughter] or over a million dollars [laughter] and we're deciding whether or not we should sell mhm and cash out or\nHopefully you know we're being told don't sell because there's going to be a boom and\nWe want him out you know large nice inheritance and I want to make sure it's managed properly\nMhm [noise] well there's only a boom if it's not a dry hole and there's only a boom if after it's not a dry hole there is an actual uh oil prices that sustain\nA drilling a and then that's the only reason west Texas is struggling or on our oil prices are so far down\nThat there's no boom\nOkay I mean when the gas for five dollars a gallon or the boom baby him in about a ... and could that come back yeah I just probably depends on you know what OPEC does on turning on or off the faucet on the supply demand that's the issue all of that to say\nI'm no expert on the oil business I don't know much about it at all they get just about everything I Know just in a\n[noise] but um and so the way I asked myself that question if I'm In your shoes and you might answer the question differently than I Would because you might know more or your family might know more uh I'll let me ask you this you have to sell all of them you have to sell although it was an all or none\nNo it's not an all or none ah what do you it's it's simply a they're looking at a three million for all and ah and ah you know obviously one point five for half\nOkay so you're just add on how you doing\nBiggest concern is a risk yeah you're not oil people yeah I\nThink you know wearing them as many as women I'm ... so you're only talking about selling our house\n[noise] we're deciding on how much to\nTalk or if I were in your shoes I don't know much about the oil business and if someone asked me if I had a pile of money in the middle of my kitchen table that said three million dollars on it when I go by oil rights within my answer would quickly be no mainly because I don't like that much risk and I don't know much about\nOkay those two things would take it off the table for me I Would rather buy something else with it that I\nThat I Know a little bit more about like real estate\nAnd it's a little bit more predictable and less risk personally okay but that's the way you ask yourself the question if I had three million dollars by the kitchen table would I go go by what rights in West Texas where the if the answer is no then it's time to sell for the same reason I ... and then you know that you wouldn't die and I was actually\nAnd that's that's what I agree with his getting the family to understand that you know the stock market crash yeah well it might but I\nGot to tell you start getting less rock markets less risk than growing holes were hundred percent sure that you don't ... I mean walking around since tells you that you don't have to be a person to know that now uh so what I Would do a ... the family has to do these are family owned and so you can't just sell like yours off\n[noise] uh no this is I'm I'm helping or my mother and father make a decision\nAll I see so it's a just a day and they can make the decision for the whole thing or not\nYeah All right then if I were in their shoes I Would at least sell Seventy five percent\nOf it and I probably would sell at all but on the off chance that they are just dying to be a little bit and they're all business and they're scared to death so phone low you know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and uh you know so that that you know if it struck out right after I sold it I regret it the rest of my life\nYou know those kinds of statements then maybe keep twenty five percent of it and sell Seventy five percent and\nThen let's buy some real estate or by some mutual funds or something that's a whole\nSet of families entire portfolio\nThree million dollar network dot up as much [noise] um\nPersonally and if somebody asked me\nCoach is I Do that I Would say no\nTies thanks for calling\nThis is that I ... [noise]\n\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do\nIs just getting rid of it the horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally and forever is with time share exit team them\nAnd um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall net worth\nAnd so there are a toy is just a toy that happens to go up in value

know first of all thank so much for for taking my call I've been looking for like eight years now um and I had a question regarding retirement and college money from my one year old mhm\nI'm I'm I'm Thirty years old I'm among baby step for I'm about Seventy thousand dollars cash mhm um I Know that other than my house um which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on I'm On a thirty year mortgage\nAnd when I bought it I could Ninety thousand dollars down on it so I have some you know equity in it [noise]\nUm and I have about fourteen thousand coming in as a gift for my one year old college fund um so I'm going to be putting that into a check five twenty nine I think for him in and kind of picking up some\nGrow stock mutual fund to\nKinda see where it goes from there okay um so my my question is what are kind of my what do I deal with this kind of piled cash that I have um you know ideally I Want to keep my living expenses for\nFor um you know every any given month is about twenty\nSeven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home mother child so I'm pretty much the only income right now [laughter] um so I wanted to keep you know a good portion of that set aside and just cash and then kind of want to know what to do with the rats shut shut throat towards my how to do that every year or\nShould I put it someplace else\nWe teach Taylor is a process we call the baby steps it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial plan and as you lay the foundation then as you build a house and you put the roof on your financial plan it tells you each time what to do and what to do first what the new second and so forth so I'm\nThe baby steps one is ... dollars you've done that too was dead free but the home you've done that three is an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses um that's going to be nine to Eighteen thousand dollars in your case\nAnd so twenty thousand dollar emergency fund is adequate\nAs adjusted emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps for five and six and we do those simultaneously for is putting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans now or what do you make\n'em so\nUh about Seventy eight year\nIs the household income yeah okay All right and uh do you have a four one K. at work\nYou know I have a I had a pension um that I put a about a hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks into it um so I didn't know how that kind of played in the cards as well\nI'll tell you that mandatory yeah okay All right I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I published do with ... percent aside Fifteen Percent of Seventy thousands and thousand five hundred\nOkay and that would be a around eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something do you have a four one K. U. viable at work you don't\nKnow I have very I currently have I just opened up a ... or re ... with a better man which is one of kind of the global and hide\nI Would do instead is I Would use I'm a ... a person that as an advisor today a\nOr coming there they're they're doing pretty good\nBut none of 'em are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money in ... at this stage of the game there'll be a time\nAnd a place that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do with some or you know in certain situations and so forth but what I Would do just go to smart faster Dave Ramsey dot com click on the smart vest or pro\nLink and it'll drop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the ... business so I don't care what you do okay in effect my income at all but people always ask me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you you and your argument you you're married\nMarried um and have a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each uh\nUnless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you there of fifty five hundred as eleven thousand that'd be fully funded Roth IRAs and I would have those in gross stock mutual funds I spread Mayan personal investments across four types of growth stock mutual funds that's also what I recommend and\nPut forth in growth in income uh fourth and growth a fourth and aggressive growth and a fourth in international now once you're doing that and you have the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that with you've already dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine\nAnd you've got it in mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine okay I just be watching that you could you could review that with a smart rest or pro and see if you know if they teach you anything that makes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine\nNo issue there um and then everything above that that's maybe step three is ... by babysit for Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement five is addressed kids' college and it's different being there and you don't know how many kids how old they are and that kinda thing so we don't have a mouse on that but you're addressing it\nAnd in what you're putting your to Roth IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent above that everything I can find in my budget uh\nAny extra money I come into I'll throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's baby steps six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last baby step and that's max out\nAll retirement and invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy or what you will do especially when you get rid of your house payment so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house\nAnd then I'm going to set up those two Ross IRAs and any other money I find that my budget I'm going to keep jumping around that house\nYou're probably not a house paid off in three or four years at this rate that is what it sounds like to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nI Do I'm great how are you guys are better than I deserve what's up already so\nI have a currently two hundred and twenty three thousand that a hundred and Ninety three thousand is pretty abnormal it currently with the U.S department of treasury um it as a result of having been additional service academy at three years ago\nAnd the remaining thirty case like pretty normal debt I'm obviously much smaller so my question is I'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I've followed you for a while um should I continue\nPaying off as small as that first or should I I'm a just a start to save rapidly for the hundred Ninety three thousand of reason I ask is I Believe it's going to go actually I Know for a fact that will eventually end up any collections account\nIf I'm not able to pay the amount and fall um\nYeah um and what is your income now\nIt varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be this year at least a about a hundred ... a hundred and fifty thousand on on down a little bit this year although\nWow so you learn to you guys are going out on the side and so when I'm going to just put this on a night\nThree in the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can give you got one of one time you'll be dead for two years so I go into collections\nOkay when you start throwing thirty thousand bucks this thing or it's going to go away really really fast you make a lot of money you have to get on a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I Am never heard of this I'm curious I'm about to learn something\nYou went to a service academy one of the military academies\nGot this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nIs er so yeah a little known fact that you're just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year either after the surge through in the service or you're assigned to the recruitment and death um\nAnd it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if they get paid as it goes over to the U.S treasury\nSo you have the option of serving\nAs an enlisted person if you get ... for a period of time in its forgiven\nA yes or however my case I was not for Tibet often I I was given an honorable discharge half a\nSo like West Point as an example\nYou can get hammered with fish I did not know that you have to learn something while well the only good news and the ... story is you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nA common theme around airs teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste

that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago I mean\nI'd never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nWrite I actually last January took myself you know of of her check because\nHardware ... more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\nHe was doing drugs you know and and so he wasn't in his right mind I rest\nMy case you got shut up [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to participate in her healing financially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom to this baby and have a good life\nAnd make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent from mom of intentionally my if you can get her back I\nDon't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and not be perpetual but to do not tell it was yeah I've been out but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go the seat again\nBut you like go to the seat last time not because she was healthy but because she was on healthy yeah and I'd like to get her up and running and healthy\nYou know we got the meds worked out we got the counseling it's for the rest of her life she's got to balance that stuff but if she doesn't she don't hit the bridge every time man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially\nHere we are again borrow could you know and it's just I'm ... but the good news is I\nI hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating for the people that have it and those that love them but the good news is I have seen a innumerable number of people that with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper\nOf medication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of\nThem now she only the medicated as she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not medicate\nAnd others you you don't want them just you know in all the rest of their life has one and I mean\nPlease ward of the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen or as as a semi early mentally ill and she is she's not on a couple of different met she does well her\n... her only shot then is what we're talking about but our goal is this girl to be forty four in all this to be a memory\nCan happen\nYeah and it happens to people all the time though what did she say right now when they call her on ... so you get nothing so she does take up the phone\nAre you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them 'cause you're just a you know because they're going to just I don't\nThink I should be talking she should\nBe telling them to be either one of the American long conversation it's I got nothing you get nothing 'cause all their donors badger her and that's not right now the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs go and then we start negotiating and trying to work our way through the debt right well\nMy husband thinks that if this goes on a year or two and they will eventually come back and want to negotiate\nAnd I are going to negotiate after two months oh really yeah okay I think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months tell their their during our pliable\nToday but she's got no money and you're not giving or any no so they get nothing\nThey get nothing today know\nSix months from now she's balanced on our marriage taking care of the baby working still living

not\nMm times are tough\nYeah I'm I recently left um my husband who is very abusive and um I mean the kids left um\nHe had me fired from my full time job on the house got foreclosed on he ran a a ton

... is a part time job that barely Howard the expenses that the basic living expenses own so I have no way to you know start paying off the debt that he encouraged my main you know and\nA lot about the second okay All right I'm Sorry I'm Sorry you've been through this sounds like you've been through hell I'm show when did you leave your fulltime job um it's been a couple of years now I ...\nYeah I haven't been able to find anything else comparable to what I did um ...\nOr will you let me tell you you're emotionally not pass that because you're the way you're describing it it sounded like it happened yesterday yeah I mean if you're still would have been living in the abuse aren't you in your head\nYeah I mean like in tonight we we weren't homeless for a while we were just under a lot and I read he tried to get custody of them I had to go to court trying to deal with everything and it's been a lot I hear ya yeah\nIt'll the foreclosure on all the bills that he opened up and your name had been paid for years\nYeah correct given paid anything on them for years so there's really nothing on fire today that says you got to fall by friday right\nMy question is is my dad is Seventy five years old\nStill works He works in a steel plant\nMakes about four fifty to six fifty a week um\nAbout couple of years ago he got sick I found out that he had and he said he was behind on a lot of his bills\nAnd a somehow got a fifty thousand dollar loan from the bank and ah he doesn't have them attention he gets about\nFifteen hundred and Social Security and I'm I'm just wondering what what what can I Do at this\nStage for him um I Do provide him so I took over all the bills and I do provide him with about five hundred dollars a week on like a debit card that for him to buy food\nAnd what are you doing with the rest of gas it I'm Sorry what are you doing with the rest of the money\nI'm paying all I'm I'm paying all his bills he still has about um [noise]\nI mean K left on the equity loan\nFeel happy about I'm K. left on the equity loan ... two thousand on a credit card mhm eight thousand on a car and eight thousand on the house [laughter]\nAnd how much are you able to put on the debt I'm putting everything was it turned out to do everything on on the much money does that amount to\nWhat is it\nA month [noise] mhm\nI think it amounts to about a thousand a month\nAnd that's pretty good okay so he's got Fifteen and eight and two did I get that right\nAid on a car aid on the house and she won a credit card\nOkay All right and it ... you know if you divide that about four thousand a month I think you're done in a year okay and your first go would be to get him debt free you're done with the data you're right\nYou're going to get him to free 'cause he's Seventy five years old and he's still working at a steel plant the understand that right yeah ... there's going to come a moment and we'll come suddenly that he just can't do that and\nI'm afraid of you know my player is at least that he gets through this year mhm and that way you that free and if he's a hundred percent debt free house and everything you can probably make it on a Social Security if you had to write okay not yeah not ideal not what we want but we can probably get there and\nThen the next step is if we get past that that'd be wonderful let's get dead free then let's build an emergency found a three to six months of expenses when we get past that and then let's start building some nest egg for retirement but the fastest way to build a nest egg for retirement is to clear that day I didn't\nThat emergency phone employers and is still the baby steps in other words\n[noise] okay that sounds good you know what I'm asking is why a bank loan and I'm someone at his age fifty K. and uh you know four and a and it could be paid off in twenty forty three now and back\nIn ... live that long\nWell two reasons one is they're stupid and the second reason is counting on my house I've got a lien against the house right now that care and so the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on it upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral as part of it and\nSo that's part of the equation the other part of the equation is you know asking a bank or if you should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry\nI mean they'll they'll loan anybody does worry that are not breathing money you know what I'm trying the lending has gotten completely out of control and stupid so there's nothing\nYou know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing\nAn inside of the industry is just stupid is what it amounts to but uh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes people go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and it was like no\nThey would've offered the dog that credit card so I\nMean dead people get credit card offers so it you know it doesn't mean anything he doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and it doesn't mean you're alive if you've got a credit card offer you could be a dead dog and get a credit card offers it can happen\nSo I mean you can be that low on the deal so that that's what you got to think through and just you got to take care of him and you are you're doing a really good job\nCongratulations Tim is with us in Dayton, Ohio I Tim how're you\nDoing by Dave I got to require retirement okay um\nMhm and um I have a pension and have a four weekends off of pretty good mhm I click here at fifty two it'd be better to file for Social Security and wait for ... for ... for the whole time and they\nYou can run the mouse out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four one K. on the mutual fund that money is growing at a faster rate than your\nSocial Security check will grow if you delay it and that's the way you're comparing it to say now is if you wait from sixty three sixty five to start receiving it\nWill you know and what is the rate of return\nYou know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more in a mutual fund generally spots um and then the other question comes up you know even if I don't need it should I take it um and uh I I you know if you're willing to live on less than you make an innocence invest some or\nIt um by not taking out your four one K. or by some other things than than usually comes out better to take it earlier uh\nBut you know there's a lot of different parts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation oh definitely\nYeah as I got to kind of gas and you've got to say you know average death age of a male and the U.S is Seventy six average does a death I drove a female in the U.S is Seventy eight but once you've lived to be sixty it's higher than that\nBecause that and those numbers include infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old you got a real shot at Ninety according to the stat tables right now and so\nThat that's what you've gotta walk through and think through in the process so the question man thank you for joining U.S Open ... owns a AAA eight to five five two to five Todd is in New Hampshire Hi Todd how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you better than I deserve how can I help um I I when I spoke to the lady she said I could ask you a question and I just got the starter pack off of your website for myself from my from my daughter who's\nThirty one I'm fifty two and um I've been a dream or I guess for a free spirit as you would say from listening to your show addict now for the last two weeks [laughter]\nI Know who you were before that it's All right but um my wife and I sat down and we've never been able to agree on money she used the shaver um the spender and just I don't you know I don't know what the money situation is so I go and spend it [laughter]\nAnd I'm five we've set aside step one we've got a thousand now we've put aside to the shaving she wants to say more than that but [noise]\nShe I'm she's always ran the show and I've been kind of just kind of go along with her at this point um we paid off to credit cards\nAnd we paid off on the credit card my question is is\nDoing so many things right now I'm In the one thing I'm concerned me as about down the road is my retirement and I've worked for a company for Fifteen Years and I've got about\n... eldest daughter pack was the total money make over a book in there\nYes it is I started to read that I have read a\nMakeover has every detail about the seven baby steps as the seven baby steps on steroids and so it's going to walk you through first thing you do have a thousand dollars you get on\nA written plan you and your wife or an agreement and we're gonna we're in agreement that we're going to work this plan
