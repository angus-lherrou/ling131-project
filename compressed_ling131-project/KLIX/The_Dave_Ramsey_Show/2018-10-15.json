I had a problem with my PC oh I Want to see a longtime listener first time caller thank you all you need to do speech every day's so so yeah my window Jim update and we ... we have some through a tunnel free\nYes my my crewmembers yesterday's news update it won't do it no\nThere are two kinds updates by herself does two windows there's the feature up to date you know three was this spring feature update we are about to get\nIf everything goes well eight or nine to fall feature up they pushed it out a week ago and it turned out to delete it some customers data Microsoft said no it's okay only one hundreds of one percent of customers have their day to delete it oh my God that's a showstopper so they they they pause the update they've they've tried to fix his anyway\nEight you know come up with the important thing to understand is these feature updates are not critical uptick that's the second cut up the these are bug fixes and security updates those\nYou watch now if a blocked age you know three is keeping you from getting hot fixes after age you know three you got to fix it but as long as you're getting security updates every month on patch Tuesday\nTuesday or just as on your devices in this important security\nOkay that's bad news that means that the failure of Eighteen oh three\nScrewed up everything and you do and I you know while I don't think it's important to get feature updates its absolutely vital to get the security patches lined the way Microsoft with windows ... is not going to let you ... you know if you don't get eight you know three and then he tonight eventually\nThey're going to get mad [laughter] and they've really it's part of the deal that you got to get the updates even the feature updates so we got to figure out why\nYour updates or block Microsoft has a troubleshooter ah Fort blocked updates usually you know if you think about it updating and operating system like this is you know in place as is working\nIs kind of like I don't know rebuilding a jet engine one flight it's it's it's crazy [laughter] so it work and most of the time but if it fails ... you got problems\nSocially chili is it called the ... set up or something\nI'm registry a that well first thing they do is is go look for the windows update troubleshooter and that's on Microsoft's I don't use anybody else's okay so I'm a there you know a lot of people have\nYou know information about this and you can read information but never get a file from anybody but Microsoft\n... yeah so there are a lot of the reason I say this instead of saying oh here's what you do is there a lot of reasons that can fail\nUnfortunately and ah when it fails um if it's if it's sticking if the rest of the updates or pause because of it you really gotta you've really got to fix it so if you Google windows update troubleshooter\nAnd you get to support that Microsoft dot com or you can you can run that it is it is a trouble shooting tool to fix this common problems won't fix all of them but it fixes common problems will put a link to it in the show notes [laughter] it's it's it don't get it from somebody else get it from Microsoft\nI have a handle on this air ... air it gives me an air of ... you know X A hundred you know whatever and then and then I I go all that yeah I mean the little um a wiki page okay and then and Katie I'm [noise] it gave me a list of the chili catch utilities shut up\nYeah be nervous about that yeah yeah and maybe it is all you need but if if there is something like that didn't get it from Microsoft there are lots of it that uh yeah there are lots of little things that can go wrong and it could very well be that some nice person has written a tool the problem of\nCourse is if you're downloading a program from a site unknown or\nEven if that wikis legit which I'm sure it is somebody it's a wiki somebody could go in there and say hey I'm just going to change that link to my credit hacking too so you really don't want to do that get it from Microsoft or are they ... if you as I said if you Google the troubleshooter they have a registry fix troubleshooter and then they do have a\nProgram that will run but get it fixed and it may be it sometimes it may be you know you you got to do something more draconian like reinstall windows I most cases you don't but it is if it does in fact require that it's worth it because\nYou're really at risk if you're going on the Internet with on patch version of windows these days is just too dangerous the issue is of course you know in order for a bad guy to get on your system has got to get you to run a program\nHe's got to get you to agree to something ah and that's hard\nYou know what I mean maybe not as far as it ought to be but it takes you know you have to scare somebody a trick somebody to do it\nUh and that's hard you know what I mean it may be not as far as it ought to be but it takes you know you have to scare somebody a trick somebody to do it but\nThere is a little loophole here bad guys are always looking for flaws security issues not just with the operating system but with browsers and anything that goes on line things like the adobe reader this is or there'll be flash these are well known issues so in the past they've all been patched\nBut if you're not doing the patches you might still be vulnerable those in the past adobe flash had a bug that if you uh\nYou know had a ... actually this would only use it there'll be reader instead because you see PBS all the time right and you needed there'll be reader to read PBS and so it's natural habit there'll be reader on your system but it turns out they're bad guys who discovered multiple flaws and uh do the reader that allows them to create\nA special PDF normally a PDF can't hurt us about a program but this special PDF can because it takes advantage of the flaw in the reader to execute it program\nOh sneaky now how do they get you to do that well they don't have to get you to do that they just put that PDF on a Web page you go to most browsers will automatically\nLoad the PDF automatically call it there'll be routed to display the PDF and boom you're infected\nPick completely without any intervention on your part you don't want that you want a bad guy to have to trick you at least to make it his heart is possible so you've got to have pet everything that goes on line you're operating system your browser adobe reader do before anything that goes on line has to be patched has to be fixed because the minute the patches\nPut out bad guys go aha there's a flaw let's see if we can find it and you're much more likely to get bit\nAnd they can put these they can put these exploits they call them these these these these flaws on a website you might even go to they can imbedded in an ad or they get hacked the website websites can act all the time put there and you just go to this you're going to perfectly benign website\nIt in the background without any intervention or visible display on the screen it loads a PDF and your hacked you don't want that\nYou need to be patched stay up to date\nThat's the number one rule in security [noise]\nSo of course we always say don't click on links you know don't fall for stuff don't download files from wikis [noise]\nBut all of that all those bets are off if you don't keep your stuff patched do we'll look

ultimately pop sure in\nTwo thousand three I was warning on this program we were going to see a major housing crash and at the time it seemed ludicrous because housing was the only game in town it's\nRight or you were four years ahead of the game\nAnd that's one of the problems of being able to see the fundamental trends is there you know you always see these things a little bit early and who can ever really imagine or estimate how big the bubble can get\nIt when you when you will for ... years\nEarly but the housing market popped and today George ... we're in an economy that is supposedly\nSix years into a recovery or an expansion in which we cannot raise interest rates other than this paltry quarter percent that's meaningless were running this economy on zero percent real interest rates\nThe nominal rate less the rate of inflation so we're in the economy is in a sequel lip real it's out of balance and there's\nAn artificial suppression of interest rates which is artificially inflating the financial assets the housing stock the stock market in the bond market\nAnd so the house of cards is not yet past the point of crisis matter of fact the two thousand and eight financial crisis was really just the early this didn't warning of a massive financial collapse but it's going to make Nineteen twenty nine in the Nineteen thirties looked like a recession\nYou know when you look ahead in next hour really get into biblical process you should not talking about religion and we're talking about the bench that affects all of us when you hear them when when you look ahead and what you called ultimately war\nDid you mean war with like ISIS who is this something bigger coming on the horizon\nA there is something bigger coming we're going to see a global war I was afraid you were going to say that there is a World War coming ISIS is merely upon being used\nBy our enemies to destabilize the middle east to drive a massive influx of refugees out of the middle east and of course George how many refugees are pouring into Saudi Arabia\nOr any Arab country for that matter none\nNone there they're coming to Europe they're coming here they're coming to Mexico Canada that's where they're all going\nAnd why don't they ... none of them want to resettle or they're not being allowed to resettle not any of the Islamic country yeah isn't that rather odd ditch your is it sure why does this question has never been raised and you\nKnow this refugee flow\nIs really the death of the culture of the west because the evidence if you just look at\nThese moslem\nNeighborhoods that have grown up moslem in areas within the major European cities\nThese are no go zone for the European national ... even the police are afraid to go into some of these Islamic neighborhoods and the crimes that are being committed and there's no assimilation\nThis is an invasion and imbedded within this refugee flow George is an element of fifth wave if you will that is a terrorist army\nSome of the statistics I've seen up to Seventy five percent of the refugees\nAre adult age males\nWho appear to have just come out of either the Olympic program or infantry training using our boss and in shape\nYeah it is very strange version of Asian\nYou it's a covert invasion of a cultural group that is antagonistic to the west\nAnd it's and Benjamin because within that there are probably some decent people who are homeless in need to get on board they are that's the sad part of all of this\nWell there's no doubt that there's innocent children that their families and that there's civilians\nAnd I've lived in the Arab world I Lived in a Palestinian neighborhood I've got personal friends that are Arabs Jordanians Palestinians Egyptian and these are close friends of mine because I went to graduate school in the middle east mhm and George I got to tell you\nThe idea that there is this a large a secular Arab population that is that there's no way radicalized simply false\nSimply false\nEven the young kids I'm Talking teenage girls are very much supportive of radicalized Islamic agendas\nWhite male and they took a poll it would be overwhelming with what's going on with it with ISIS primarily\nOh absolutely and you know this has never per trade and the American press the European press you turn on a news and he was seen pictures of\nGermans giving cooking is too small Syrian children and who doesn't want to help small children they don't show you the terrorists element this behind this but this is part of the grand strategy of inserting a terrorist\nWing into Western Europe in into the United states and we've already seen their actions one of the terrorists in the Paris attack\nWas an immigrant and refugee\nYes so we've already got proof that there is a terrorist element of\nWorking I mean in terms of the infiltration it's a really in scheme on their part isn't it\n[noise] it's genius and when you look inside\nThe strategy that the enemies of America have developed and have been implementing and the amazing thing is George this has been going on since the Nineteen thirties now the strategy has been evolving of course over the last eight years\nBut they've really fine tune their game plan and we are well down the road to World War and this latest incident with the massive outflow refugees from the middle east is just one more movement of the chess pieces on the chessboard\nHere's my concern to bet you that if we enter into this World War where we've always said you know nothing's really happened here on our land other than the tragedy of course that we saw the nine eleven but what happens if all these militants\nYet their arms and the result rifles and so while the war is going on elsewhere make crop up here to\nWell they no doubt are here in in in ... even more serious threat is what if they are equipped with weapons of\nMass destruction well that would have to have access to bioweapons or suitcase sized nuclear weapons or ... or you don't\nWant her to small nuclear devices to change our world forever yup\nNo question about that no question so when you went through biblical prophecy you picked up these events I mean ... ... ... most of it is it in cold is how do you decipher\nWell Bible prophecy is definitely in to some degree symbolic and you have to use the Bible to interpret the Bible but the correct or the proper interpretation of the scriptures is not as difficult as it seems\nUh you have to understand the central elements of Bible prophecy which are contained in the ... the writing of the profit Daniel and they involve the identity of mystery Babylon which are the panic kingdoms of this world in opposition to God\nAnd there were four of them that rose in power\nBefore the first coming of Jesus Christ and they were pictured in the dream of king Debbie condemns or what he witnessed a great statue with a had a goal arms of silver than fire of brass in the legs of fire and representing\nThat had a gold battleground itself the silver king the media Persia which followed Babylon\nThe brightest kingdom Greece thunder Alexander and then the legs of Rome elected by representing the the empire of Rome Daniel in chapter seven was given a vision of four kingdoms that would rise in power at the end of the age\nAnd they are perfect type in the shadow of the force superpowers that ruled the earth before the first coming up the lord\nAnd do the kingdom's were pictured as first a lion out of which came eagles wings or the lion is aimed to lift and the eagles is America it's not a hard stretch next was picture to bear\nIt was in the position of media Persia and that's the Russian\n... revolution communist Russia is the bare\n... hold on Benjamin I Want to talk with you about Russia and the beer when we come back on the coast to\nCoast they on ... website is no conveniently optimized ... if you're a ... you can listen to live in these Jews run on your phone just lose it goes to ... your iPhone or Android browsers\nThey were the authors and publishers of a book called the protocols of The Elders of Zion I remember that just pure propaganda\nAnd it out it presents the Israeli and\nJewish people is behind a world's conspiracy to create a new world order and and bring all of Christian them under the control of the anti Christ as if it's all being orchestrated from Tel Aviv and that the United states of America is just a puppet of Israel\nThe man on the street in the Arab world\nThis propaganda is acceptable to him\nAnd so you know it fanned the flames of of the hatred of Israel and and the hatred of the United states and and so the Russians were able to\nBasically shape and direct the various Arab terrorist organizations most and most of the leadership of al ... was trained by KGB ISIS today has military officers in it that are KGB officials\nAnd of course ... was a former KGB guy\nYeah exactly I mean ... who is Vladimir putting food is a creation not a creator and he's a product of the KGB and he was created is\nBasically the new face of Russia they do this all the time George they they present their their latest new president as a a moderate who loves western movies right\nIn his favorite film as the godfather or something like that and it's all designed to create an image has not real but there are experts in it\nWhen you look yeah just war this third world war you have a timetable in mind\n[noise] well if you consider the the\nProduction schedules for the manufacture of the the newest fifth generation weapons that the Russians are are building in in arming themselves with what I'm Talking about their new ATM system the s five hundred\nA and also the new armada of the tea fourteen Ahmad a tank\nOf these are state of the art weapons this armada tank can defeat anything we can put on the battlefield and it can be operated by remote control it's the equivalent of a tiger cat\nYou can defeat anything we can put on the battlefield and it can be operated by remote control it's the equivalent of a tiger tank in World War two the German tiger up against a Sherman tank and the Germans were just simply out gun so the tea fourteen will how gun am a one Abrams\nThe as five hundred ... anti ballistic missile system is scheduled to be the production run will be completed by some time in twenty Seventeen so if you were to presume that the Russians want a complete all of their current military preparations\nThen you would say the war is somewhere out past twenty seven teams but events on the ground might accelerate things and in Russia is in a position even today\nA to do incredible damage it in fact could destroy the United states as a super power in less than one hour and\nYou know the vulnerability of our country Georgia's just it's an alarming it's it's it's unbelievable because the Americans have a an image that you know we are the world's lone superpower and\nYou know we demonstrated our shock and awe in Iraq you know as we destroyed a third world army using antiquated I'm old Russian equipment and then of course we fought a useless war in Afghanistan for a decade bombing mountains looking for a couple of guys hiding in a cave with a cell phone\nAnd but we've never faced another world class army and the problem with today's military balance of power as the technologies have advanced to such a level where you're talking about hyper sonic weapons\nLaunched cruise missiles at Russia's got the blindness got it everybody's got it now\nYeah the vulnerability for the guy who's you know sleeping and who is his first is just\nYou can't really recover from a devastating nuclear strike and what we don't American people don't understand the balance of power because there's nothing that's relevant information that's ever in our news\nI mean we get the Confederate flag crisis we get the latest police shooting we get the latest presidential death by one of our goofball candidates but there's never any real relevant information disseminated through the news media it's just designed to keep people in the dark and so they are in the dark\nUntil a tragedy occurred and then everybody panics\nAnd then we get some political spin designed to push an agenda like disarmed the public before the police exactly exactly but the truth is the Russians have been building fifth generation weapons for the last twenty\nYears she was more Russia than China in terms of doing this under the table\nWell I think Russia has the more high tech\nWeapons uh China has the manpower they are definitely working together as allies I don't think the Russians by themselves would dare try to attack the United states they would continue to try to weaken us through surrogate means\nI'm going to need the Chinese if they wanted to go to\nDirect war against America but before they actually start a direct war with the United states\nThey're going to continue to pursue their war by style you know the attack of the Arab terrorists against western interests the the use of you know political propaganda to try to do\nThe Arab terrorists against western interests\nThe the use of you know political propaganda to try to discredit us part of the war is a propaganda war sure and to be quite candid who is winning and bronco bone in my own way and yet he may have ... you'll find Americans\nToday who will tell you they have more confidence in poodle than they do Obama\nWell this obsession let me ask you this Benjamin this obsession that we have with trying to get Assad out of Syria why what is the what's going on\n[noise] well if we could remove Assad that would isolate Iran and we will be in a position to remove the religious extremists that rule Iran at that point we would be able to insert pro western puppet governments and we would have a lock on the middle east\nWell look what happened though in Iraq and Afghanistan and every place we go he falls apart when we get in there\nYeah that great plan of bringing democracy to the middle east George Bush is great\nDoesn't work um [noise] yeah it it was a disaster from the get go so and in his ... in the Arabic language they don't have a word for liberty\nNo they don't so we take out Assad who's not a boy scout but he was much better than his father if we take him out are we going to have another collapse of another country\nAbsolutely and now the daddy that agenda of the United states was to create these pro western democracies I remember I was listening to a expert from one of the think tanks\nAddress a bunch of the elite out on the west coast and\nAnd explained that the Bush strategy of creating pro western democracies in place of these dictators that we were overthrowing was you know for your ... sophomore I can is thinking and\nI remember everybody went around the dinner table commenting about you know how foolish stupid the Bush administration was I was the last person to speak and\nAnd I said I don't think Bush is foolish stupid at all it just pursuing another agenda and they've been lying to you know who should ministry she knew this plan would never work\nGeorge they stabilize Middle East for a reason\nWell then let me ask you this too much\nI mean when you try to get democracy into these countries Libya Iraq Syria yet we leave Jordan alone Saudi Arabia Kuwait was clean the Emirates we don't touch them and there's much dictatorship is the other countries\nThat's correct but do they play the game with us right there's only one reason why we support those dictators oil and the fact that they are willing to enforce the Petro dollar yup that's right that is it's all about the projection of economic power\nWhich allows us to continue to project military power if they wanted to change the least is control of oil you control of oil is control of the world's economy\nIf they wanted to change the Petro dollars to something else they wouldn't be there anymore\nI'll know that'd be gone and twenty four hours before we would attempt to replace them because without the Petro dollar George we cannot run our military we can't run anything well that's that's right the United states is for all practical purposes bankrupt or I should say in solved that\nWe can never pay back our debt we can't even pay interest on our debt George we have to say [laughter] federal that is something\nA card debt we can't even pay interest on our debt George we have to say [laughter]\nFederal that is something let's just rounded off to twenty trillion it'll be there next year at five percent interest that's a trillion a year of debt service\nToday with interest near zero we pay three hundred billion if interest rates go back to five percent the federal budget goes seven hundred

will be vaporized and so we'll all the other remaining military assets of this country it's toast\nThe United states is going to be defeated but the American people will survive and following the defeat of the United states which is described in Bible prophecy in is he killed chapter thirty eight we are told and I'll I'll read you the scripture let me just\nTurn to log on to get into scripture review near oh you don't me to read it just give us a paraphrase\nOkay to paraphrase at the at the time of the end a great power from the north along with many nations will attack Israel which will have been re gather\nBack to its land and they will also attack another nation that is also a nation of immigrants a nation of great wealth who citizens dwell securely with no defense is no walls around any of their city's no wall on their border with Mexico\nAnd that nation to will also be attack at the same time Israel's attacks\nThe communists in Arab allies is going to attack Israel and they're going to attack the United states and they're going to take out the U.S has a superpower and they're in occupy the middle east they're going to grab the oil they're going to grab control the oil reserves and they're going to eliminate the United states has a balance against their power\nAnd there'll be in a position to dictate terms to the Europeans who will stand in their way they want to see it at the table to run the new world order George\nAnd they're going to make their move most likely within the next three years\nAnd then what happens to Israel\nAccording to scripture Israel will be protected they no doubt we'll use their nuclear arsenal and the Israelis have a Web surprising people there are very bold militarily they are not afraid to use their capabilities and I mean once they realize World War is underway\nIsrael will forget about the political correctness of measured response in Israel will execute the stamps and strategy\nWhich is basically they will eliminate their enemies Israel is also a nuclear power and that they will prevail and then there'll be substantial loss of life the Arab major Arab city is no doubt will be hit the United states will be hit Russia will be hit\nThe world will suffer population loss of products one point five billion people would be my estimate and out of the ashes of this war a one world government will rise in power and the anti Christ which is the figure who will head up the final world government\nHe will come to power and the earth will go into the final period of human history which Bible indicates will last for seven years\n\nThis is a scary world\nWar three and this cannot be changed\nNo sir but what can be changes what happens in in my life\nWhat happens to the American people can be changed what's going to happen in human history cannot\nSo there is good news to what I mean we are facing a World War one world wars have happened before there were people living in Europe that we're facing the Nazis some of them survived some didn't but wars happen we the history of our planet has a history of warfare\nThat era of peace and prosperity which the world has witnessed in the last two hundred years particularly the peace and prosperity of the United states of America is and then um only if you look at the six thousand years of recorded history\nHere and eat and and the absolute I mean the mayhem of ... of the violence of humanity has been the norm\nAnd so we're going back to a period of time you know the seasons of of our of our earth very much parallel the seasons of history\nAnd we're entering into a time of winter and we're entering into a time of you know it's a return of the dark ages if you will Elton John captured it perfectly in a in a recent hit song that he wrote\nWhere he said turn around and said good morning to the night there is a new day coming only this day will be called the night and it is not up behind all of us and we're about to turn around and say good morning to the new day that is coming into the darkness\nBut there is hope there is hope for the people\nWhat kind of non life so it would be Benjamin people pardon me what kind of life would be for people who are less\nWell for the Americans to survive there's going to be according to scripture there's going to be a great\nI I guess you'd call it a renaissance\nThat the American people that they survive the war are going to resist turning to the cultural roots of our country\nPeople are going to become um religious they're going to become Christian they're going to stop all of this materialism there's going to be a return to family there's going to be a return to God there's going to be a return to the truth\nAnd for the rest of the world they're going to be given over to the darkness of the anti Christ so\nIn many ways this war that's coming on our soil is in effect a blessing because of the world is turned over to the golf courses of the apocalypse the survivors in America are going to have a renaissance of righteousness it's actually going to work out better for the United states than any other country on the earth accept Israel\nBut he's ... very high price\nWell you know what we are approaching you know seven billion people on the planet maybe nine in other years ... billion to do was nothing\nTo these global puppet masters it is nothing and you know when you take all of the variables into consideration George\nAnd there's a lot of variables this is a complex analysis 'cause we're talking about the direction of human history\nOne of the variables is really it often ignored is a scarcity of resources and I knew the price of oil is down at president because of supply and demand imbalances in the market and because of the recession the global\nDepression is continuing to weaken demand\nAnd we've had a bit of a surge of oil production out of the the ... region for example but the truth is the matter is we're running out of inexpensive oil reserves and more important than that we're running out of water if you look at the main aqua fires underneath that our our agricultural\nAnd more important than that we're running out of all water if you look at the main aqua fires underneath that our our agricultural production regions in this country every year we we think the pumps deeper the same things happening in China we're running out of fresh water\nWe're running out of the available resources to\nSatisfy the demand for growth the world's economic system George is built on evaluation metric that requires continued growth if we don't keep growing we have a recession which throws the whole system into chaos\nAnd the ability to continue to grow the economic system the population in the standard of living is predicated on in\nA never ending supply of cheap raw materials available resources but the resources of our planet or fix\nTheir that incident and so if you look at the projection for economic growth in China and India and the other third world countries that are industrialized and\nThey're talking about adding two hundred million more vehicles to the road in the next Twenty years that would take aggregate petroleum demand from eighty five million barrels a day which is roughly today's production and demand levels\nTo a hundred and twenty million barrels per day we're that production coming from and when you look at the production data on the super oil fields in Saudi Arabia the Guam field being the largest which produces about six million barrels per day which is you know roughly eight percent of the world's petroleum production\nThe law has been produces the Nineteen fifties\nAt first they just put a straw in the ground and the oil came up without even any need to pump it because of the\nInherent pressure and the underground reservoir but by the early Nineteen sixties\nThey begin to experience problems with the pressure within the field they began natural gas re injections\nBy the early seventies that stopped working they went to injection of salt water and they lined the work field with injection was the beginning to pump eight million barrels of salt water into the rational for every day in the Nineteen seventies this is going on for over forty years\nAnd the underground geology has been changing the field is watering in and all the perimeter wells are being shot in because of water recovered rates are\nProgram that will be resisted in various regions will have something similar to the civil war occurring we may see several states attempt to secede from the union the dollar will begin to waver our ability to project to economic and military power will begin to road\nAnd then the war will come\nAnd then the final phases George there's going to be a period known as great terror in which there will be a flurry of terrorist incidents in a two to three maybe four week window of time\nThat will culminate in attacks against our communications infrastructure satellite up links will be disrupted the phones to go down the TV won't work the power will be out and it's not going to come back on for several days\nThat your final warning people but the ICBMs are ready to fly to get ready but\nBack to the gym for the lord George it's such a huge topic can\nYou know men have been writing and talking and you know giving their bad gas about Bible prophecy ever since the first prophetic books were written\nAnd yet the prophecies were sealed until the end of time we're told that in the book of Daniel so how would you ever on you of the book\nIt has to be revealed in order for the to answer to be unsealed and how would you know the scripture says at the time at the end men of when we come forth out of the wilderness\nTo give understanding to the many how would you know how would you discern the people who got the true insight into these matters\nFrom the seven thousand counterfeiters who record gestures in the palaces of Babylon well they will be authenticated there'll be evidence let me share one little story of authentication ... after the book came out I spoke all over the country\nAnd in one instance I went up myself without the help of God and the crowd was laughing at me and it was mostly young people in their twenties\nAnd the girls were giggling and I'm fumbling around George because this is a big subject a lot of elements to what's coming upon our country [noise]\nAnd after a few minutes to basically losing the audience God spoke at me and said I'll take the conversation from here and the subject changed now I began to speak with authority and I told this crowd\nI spoke to me and said I'll take the conversation from here and the subject changed now I began to speak with authority and I told this crowd\nThe first four judgments are ready to begin and they're ready to come forth upon you even now and I walked into the audience George and grab this young man by the upper arm and I sit in the Fort judgments\nAre going to come forth Charles like on your arm and I'm poking him in the arm pretty hard to while I'm saying this he stands up and runs out of there and the someone chased after him I just kept talking\nThe man who chased him comes running back in five minutes interrupts me how did you know about his arm I said I I don't even know what you're talking about I couldn't remember saying this he said well you said it would be just like his arm and that point I remembered I said well I did say that but I don't know anything about his arm\nWill be sitting in his car so scared he can't drive\nWhen he ran I said listen I don't know anything well he had a cat two of the Fort horsemen revelation on his army or lose all of the first four judgments at that point that crowd that have been laughing at me suddenly stop laughing\nAnd they talk about Trump it's during the times yes they sounded\nA no not in my opinion I Believe the seals are opening the rider on the white horse the first horsemen ... has been writing for some time and he wears a crown\nAny where's all white and yet it goes forth to conquer the earth but he appears to be a good power he fights for peace and democracy and he's wearing a crowd because the nations of the earth\nViewed this empire at one time as the legitimate leader of the nations of the world and the rider on the white horse coincidentally also lives in a White House\nWill be rolling out the one world government of the beast you know the policies that we pursued in the middle east could never have achieved their stated objective it was impossible\nWell I'm the leaders of our country no these things\nThe propaganda they tell the people does it make any sense if you understand the realities of the true issues we're dealing with but that doesn't stop them from using the propaganda because George the American people there\nDancing with the stars and they're watching their favorite and that for a limb NFL football team on Sunday and their understanding of any of the issues confronting our country it was about thirty second steep\nPast thirty seconds they've changed subjects they've been conditioned to think and Fifteen and thirty second impulses and what issue can be understood in thirty seconds\nNothing only propaganda can be injustice and so the American people are clueless\nIs the Russians would say they're not serious\nPeople now there's always been aware minority the listeners of your show people that are taking the time to stay awake and listen to coast to coast people that are looking to alternative media people that are asking the kind of questions you ask on this program these are the people that are alert and aware and they're like some things going on here we are not being told the truth\nGeorge I think that's kind of obvious everybody was thinking right\nExactly exactly so let's get into climate change\nYeah there is a great example of where we're not being told the truth about climate change we're we're being told that man kind this production and consumption of fossil fuels his filling the atmosphere with carbon residue which is\nOption in consumption of fossil fuels is filling the atmosphere with carbon residue which is altering the climate and in order to save the earth we need to impose restrictions\nEven new taxes on carbon consumption fuel consumption\nThey need to strangle the economy further is there any truth to that at all know the science is the opposite those particles actually a reflective in her having the opposite effect so what is really driving climate change the climate is clearly changing right\nOh huge I mean I'm In St Louis right now we've had four days just started to stop torrential rain I'm not talking about sprinkles torrential rain or the worse they say since flooding of Nineteen Ninety three\nOr were they had a five hundred year flood but I mean it's just truly unbelievable forty three people died in tornadoes in slugs already in the Midwest forty three people\nAnd it's practically springtime weather on the east coast\nIt's weird I mean do we we are in winter now is this is this change though is a ... process sea change what is it\nWell the Bible said that besides in the earth and climate change is one of the side there's a couple of dimensions to what's going on [noise] first there is a technology of whether warfare and\nThere's actual laws that have been passed making it a federal offense to export any weather modification technology outside of the country because whether warfare is a very effective way to wage war\nWhich you can stop the weather wars and who can really blame you I mean who really knows who is manipulating the weather right George Wright hard to prove that\nWon the harp antenna versus another modified the ionosphere and redirected these wind currents\nAnd you create droughts you can just about kill your crops assume your opponent you can do anything you can make your water supply dwindled away\nOh yeah you can destroy a nation by changing\nI'm Wondering if somebody's doing that to the west coast right now and they're still ... question\nThat the Bible said there'd be wars and rumors of war and the weather warfare technology\nExists I mean I've seen the legislation where it's as I mentioned\nIn a fence to export the technology that law wouldn't be on the books if the technology didn't exist but so clearly there is a whether warfare occurring that involves projecting microwave energy and think about a hurricane it's a big spinning top right\nAnd it's a it's a thermal exchange\nSystem\nThat is transferring heat energy into wind and that circular wind is like a spinning top and you remember when we were all young we used to play with those spinning\nTops ... loved them all you had to do is just happened on the side and what happened to the the spinning top it knocked over ... you know well maybe it didn't fall over it started in a new path\nMine always felt it was maybe an incident at fast enough\nFor you kept it a little too hard may be too hard you needed a soft\nTouch but if you take these hurricanes they're huge spinning top what do you think would happen if we being more microwave heat energy into the center of the hurricane\nWas right and pushed it\nWe would accelerate that he transmission and increase wind speed what if what\nTo the center of the hurricane was pushed it\nWe would accelerate that he transmission and increase wind speed what if we start adding energy along one the edge of the hurricane and we started beaming a projected microwave at the edge of the storm we skip it like skimming it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "15"}
