from a twisted sister we're not gonna take\nIt [laughter] yeah but we do people feel that way right\nExactly it it's not right George but nobody has ever gone after the Federal Trade commission for

here with people not mix trends earlier in the show you said or one problem yet as is the Bush name and the to your Jews who were presidents\nI Would like you to say to us in your opinion you said that um there are a problem for him ... what is it the those two Georgia's what as president has what did they do so wrong\nWell [laughter]\nIn in my opinion a before we got into the position where [noise]\nUh we started getting addicted to migration as a growth industry we got into the business of making lots of money in the arms industry\nUh there were not ah to the best of my knowledge weapons of mass destruction I think we got into Iraq on\nA questionable pre taxed uh I think that uh the way Congress hasn't been systematically ignored in terms of war making powers from Clinton well going all the way back to Vietnam on\nA we have we have been ignoring the the right role of Congress in the promotion and funding of wars\nOr I don't think that a ... going back to what I said about a lobbyist I don't believe the bushes work anymore immune to the effects of the Washington law firms and lobbyist\nThen was the Clinton Administration nor the Obama admitted\nStandpoint they're they're virtually identical except in the window dressing\nExplain\nWe'll take something like a U.S Middle East policy [noise] the the background of us Middle East policy or was that the ... the Clinton Administration [noise]\nUh was running a somewhat balanced approach a to things like the Palestinian problem\nAt it as it was called at the time\nAnd along came the project for new American Century and the notion of regime change started making the rounds and this was adopted and uh was taken up as the right way to sort things out in the middle east\nUh we started attempting to change government and so far our success record in affecting regime change\nHas been that where we've where we've gone in and actually done it\nWe haven't really reaped any particular benefit and in fact\nA we have caused some of our own problems of today or even the Obama administration's policies with a Libya for one example uh have have yet to yield uh any net positive effect that I can see\nNext up Tom in

probably did it he was boasting a few days ago that they had one is this guy that dangerous or you just insane\n[noise] oh God can I pick a little from column a and a little ... [laughter] right right now by the way the U.S a stock futures are down a little bit that looks like it's going to open a down about a hundred tomorrow morning\nI'm at that will change about an hour before the up and because the ATP a jobs numbers will come out but um yeah\nI I mean we're in this period where um my cycles and my view of the markets has been suggesting that we would have a let down or some time between the first of December and the first February a and that would ah that the markets way down\nAnd uh we had the first issue of that drop on the China declined Monday\nSo this should finish up this move down as the uh the guy in North Korea or the fear about Korea worked through the marketplace where whether he's not\nA I think anybody who build said comic weapons has to be looked at as little suspect\nYou know it's not exactly the the warm friendly physique kind of relationship builder that I like but on the other hand ah when you've been raised in a culture of paranoia and everybody in the country is a a oriented toward hating the west over long enough for you to\nIn a culture of paranoia and everybody in the country is a a oriented toward hating the west over long enough period of time [noise] uh this is what we get and it's really [noise] I hate to say it but it's great for the uh the world's defense industry because it's huge\nAnd and see that's what people forget when when they read news stories they don't they don't sit back and go well if this guy lights often H bomb what does that really mean there was an article uh speaking of the U.S lack of success in regime change\nThere was an article in the air force magazine Monday about how we're out of bombs not entirely but getting very close to the point of rationing\nSo you know the war on I saw ice is a is really turning into a a major cash cow we don't have an incentive to quickly and words\nVia strategic moves because they are what his keeping the global economy alive the problem with democracy or the democracy and capitalism as we uh have built it in America\nIs we absolutely depend on having continuous growth and we had without growth of some kind of inevitably we have a collapse of debt and that takes with it a collapse of savings\nAnd so in order to maintain the wealth of the people I hate to say it but we got to have growth in order to have growth where do you get it you get it from migration\nDo you get it from environmental works I mean that's really what the the uh global warming issue is it's not really so much about global warming gets about extending government control and coming up with a new environment tax\nAt a global level and that in turn can be followed by the megalomaniac at the top into the world government so it all really fits together it's not a big mystery but when people read singular headlines they don't sit back and go well let's see if this happens then this has to happen\nAnd if that happens then we'll have to bump up our troop levels in South Korea and if we bump up our troop levels in South Korea what does that do to our ongoing presence we're looking at a semi permanent force in Afghanistan\nAnd what does that do to our force commitments in places like NATO and in the middle east so there there's there's a huge ripple on effect and as I said before the real left wing or left a field a possibility\nIs that North Korea with an H bomb will partner up with somebody in the middle east and now we really\nGot our hands full that's right let's go to Tom in Concord, California now you have to hit a\nA thank you very much um I

the ex urban phenomena that's one of the reasons that uh we're still out here in the back of east Texas\nBecause it's one of the few places that is still relatively inexpensive and it's a big day when

of what happened where they were\nIn the cases where someone's been killed one what's the percentage of your involvement but you find that person the dead person and to the killer\n[noise] so that you know there's so many factors in that I'm ... and I'm I'm not one that knows how everything works on the other side of life and death\nAnd there's timing there's different aspects but if I worker case and I say I'm going out the odds are pretty high percentage pretty high that I'll I'll make the location\nAnd you got to remember taking my other tools with me too so if I can get in a in a general area of search and I can get the biggest thing is is going on the legal end and you have to have permission to search\nOkay you can't just waltz on somebody's property you know\nSo when you go through the process of how you get a sense where the body is and then maybe the shore\n[noise] well there's several things they do mostly my focus first on the body because there's still that possibility of evidence\nI'm ... and I you know I'm One of those people that feels here see I get it all all I'm just a whole gamut I get it all sometimes it's kinda dumped all on me and it's just the whole everything disappears like a TV in front of me and I begin to see the seen play out\nAs to what happened [noise] um the other way is I Do it by called blind drive in a blind drive is I go to where

it's like your own personal DNA\nEvery person feels differently [laughter] so if I can go there and I can pick that up I can follow that I can tell you if it's getting stronger or weaker should I go to another direction and I searched them out by doing that\nAll right so when when you see the victim do you reenact or she took the crime itself\nI frequently see the crime itself as it actually played out um they'll I can turn it off\nOr you are like the victim when you see it [noise]\nUm [noise] you know a lot of people ask me that but no I I it's more like I'm watching it play out but you still feel the same emotions as you're watching something like that happen\nBut you can be specific until law enforcement what happen\nPretty much most of it\nYou know how do you go about finding the

this other person I'm saying why are these children's connected with this but I Can't feel them right they're they're gone but I'm feeling this other person who is with them that's\nGot to be the killer so I began following that vibration\nTook me two states away I drove there\nYou you you know have you ever been confronted by the killer directly\nUm oh yeah I got um I got an email one day what it is a firm and this was really really I I'm reading in the mail like I Do I get hundreds of emails then it said would you help me find\nMy wife and when I hit that point all of a sudden I just
