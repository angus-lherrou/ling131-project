from a previous marriage and I have two children from a previous marriage\nAnd we are currently on baby step number two and we just have a few thousand dollars left to go before we're able to catch our debt goodbye uh-huh and\nThey're too and we just have a few thousand dollars left to go before we're able to kiss our debt goodbye mhm and so we are planning on a\nYou know helping our children are calling as much as we can mhm and with five of them we realize that could be a significant extent\nAnd all five children currently have five twenty nine plans that had been funded by cash gifts and things I've received from their grandparents over the years good I'm\nInto his boys are are significantly further in math and my girls are my girls are quite a bit younger but we just kind of want maybe\nAround about estimate on what we should\nPlan for each child or how to help each child through college because I feel like it could be such an enormous amount of money with five of them but we also want to help them out as much as they can sell\nOkay there's a couple of ways you can calculate it um as far as your target them out and if you know your target amounts you're wise to ask for that then you can back into how much you need to be doing\nDuring the ones that got a little bit of a head start 'em they may be a little bit older are so it might come out fairly even I don't know spends on how much of a head start there is and it also depends on where you're thinking about going to school so if I were in your shoes it doesn't sound like what's your household income\nLeah I'm a

out of higher bucks we budget for the month we're just trying to kind of ... we got more nimble test infantry is late with us real fast is his wallet was basically his bank account he had no bank account yet\nI'm what I'm wanting to know is how do we kind of go along and do the envelope system with budgeting has money and putting money away and try to help and\nFigure out what to do with all his actual\nOkay well I think you teach them how to do a budget and that's where every dollar has a name before the month begins right yeah it sounds like it's a fairly primitive easy budget\nYeah there's not much that there are and they all like Thirteen hundred dollars only are\nYou know and let's get the car paid off and build up an emergency fund and skill that went out um that'll make sense\nBut but um you know we teaching these basic things that you and I both know about apparently you been doing this stuff that we talk about for a while and see how we're going to be on a budget we're going to avoid that we're going to build up an emergency savings and begin long term investing okay we're going to be generous with some of the money and a show\nThe whole thing that you get when you got someone that's living in a fairly primitive situation like this meeting no bank account\nYou know he's a young young guy getting started is that\nIt's real easy for all that money to just disappear yeah and the egg thing you've got to get him doing is being intentional with every dollar\nOkay I'm a I'm In the world she said yes we start out with um\nI well I get a bank account going like you're talking about or a debit card for that\nThen you know I I think he just lay it out and say okay you know where do you want to be in five years in the lord of the steps that are going to get you there and so you know how much are you going to spend on entertainment how much are you going to spend on what's your take to keep your car running gas wise and your insurance and your car payment\nAnd then just just take this income and give every dollar a name ride down the page I mean this is a one page budget you can do in about eight minutes you know yeah there's not there's not a lot to this deal is not like it's complicated\nOkay yeah we got some level or set up for like um ... should find in a car like a car like emergency fine are you close your car stuff yeah I mean ... we do have famous corn about ten percent of marine home we put in societies wife\nWell no I I Would I Would work the baby steps I may not sort of housing dollars Assad is ... and then after that I got

better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well I have a question about an inheritance [laughter] um my husband and I are small business owners and we have\nA significant amount of debt with the business end our personal which is a lot due to the business for ... years during the recession and by several years ago that we have a twenty nine thousand dollar inheritance that we [noise] um [noise]\nMy husband had hoped that we could use for the kids' college I have one daughter that's in her freshman year of college now and another one that will be starting next fall and then two other teenagers and a baby so I'm\nSo this business of making money\nIt's struggling that it it makes many now but we still have a good bit of debt from how much time in my closet\nUm profit [noise] uh\n[noise]\nGosh probably well I have to say probably doesn't make enough to support us over the past few years but I'm\nGoing to live in this mythology\n[laughter] um I don't know we every time he has said okay I Need to go find a job somewhere it's like that door closes and the business doors stays open and um [noise]\nBusiness doors not open it's not making enough to support your family\nAnd so we need to sit down on this business and give it a deadline that in the next six months it's going to start supporting our family after all these years and making enough to start getting rid of some of his dad or we're going to close it and get a job because I don't think you're making any money\n[noise] I'm\n[noise] well\nI mean we pay ourselves from the business and was bringing home I'm about a hundred thousand a year\nWhere you know you're you're taking a hundred thousand dollars out of business yep well that'd be called profit okay you can't live on a hundred thousand dollars\nWell we can we have a lot of how much that if you're doing the business has got fit about fifty two K. and we personally have about um Ninety six K\nWere you in the business doesn't have any that your son personally for it okay so we're always got to learn a little dollars in debt and you have a hundred a hundred and forty thousand dollars in debt you make a hundred thousand dollars a year is that all you makes a hundred thousand or the that's what you're pulling out and then you make a profit to\nNo that's all we make that's what I mean\nWe are happening all income when you do your taxes is a ...\nIt has been to meet with an accountant to adjust some things there so that we're taking distribution instead all profit and that doesn't change it right but that's how much we're ... we're paying ourselves from the business okay a year so\nYou need to find out what the president if you don't know\nWhat can you get back you can be three different answers so you need to find out if you make if your business is making a hundred thousand dollars a year and you guys can live on a desert here you got other problems\nRight and you could pay off that making a hundred thousand dollars a year and work your way through it and know the twenty nine thousand dollars does not need to go the kids' college fund it needs to go to clean up his dad gummed ...\nOkay but I don't ... the only way that makes sense is if you have a system in a plan where you actually know if the business is making a profit and if it is making a profit what the property is and it's all\nSo mental plan where you actually know if the businesses making a profit and if it is making a profit what the property is and it's all coming home to pay off these debts or if you want to pay off the fifty two thousand at the business and call that business that I don't care but we need to be reducing debt\nRight quickly and aggressively and if you're making a hundred thousand dollars you young people do that but you guys aren't living on a plan to businesses not planning your personal lives on a plant I can tell by talking to you\nYeah I Know and we just got the ... in the mail today and what did it start at ... ... that's a\nGood start and and I'm going to send your company the book entree leadership on the business side so uh because here's the thing you need to be going no no I'm not going to quit making a hundred thousand dollars a year that's a great business\nAin't gonna quit that but what we are saying then is is that when you did fine tune and give a I think you're good at making money I don't think you're as good at managing it\nAnd so when you to fine tune our systems at the business the profit and loss statements the budgets at the business and so we knew exactly where every dollar at the businesses going\nAnd exactly where it's coming from\nAnd then exactly what's coming home and what is taxable income and then lay out a game plan to pay off a hundred and forty two thousand dollars worth of that between these two different sets of debt and work your way through it you can do both and use the twenty nine thousand towards that go\nIf you don't do that and you throw the twenty nine thousand that the goal and then you never pay off the debt it was kind of wasted wasn't it so I'm\nAsking you to blindly throw it at the ... just don't get to that and I thought that ... and throwing a system at your business in the system in detail budget at your home and all of that applied directly on this problem solved the problem is those away and the twenty nine thousand as part of the solution to that\nBut the biggest part of the solution is really getting detailed and organized\nAnd work on I'm going to give me a copy of the book entree leadership is is is that I've

you got those two numbers mhm if those two were invested in just rent round numbers just to make this easier if it was ten percent that'd be sixty five thousand dollars a year she doesn't get to keep the land\nHouse in that scenario does she know camp for service for half a million dollar debt with sixty five thousand our income and raise kids right yes\nOkay so you're under insured if your goal

may not do it but my my strong advice to you is to pay off the debt and saving emergency five three to six months of expenses above that\nSave your down payment and then by and when you buy a home and when you move in the house and there's ten thousand dollar stealing your emergency fund after you move in\nAnd you have no payments but the house payment that houses a blessing when you buy a home where he got eleven thousand dollars in debt and you have no money left in your savings account cause you cleaned it out trying to beat BMI and you move in a house broken in debt Murphy\nAnd a sixty eight years old Twenty years ago they bought a universal life policy which are the type of cash value policy a portion of your premium folks when you're having universal policy goes to\nValue policy a portion of your premium folks when you're having universal policy goes to pay the insurance costs and the insurance is cost goes up every single year because it's based on annual renewable term\nRates and show more and more is going to insurance cost us the policy gets older less and less is going to the investment to the point that\nThey cross the line a few years ago and contacted Sharon and her husband and said oh now the premium that you're paying one hundred percent of it won't cover the insurance costs so now\nIf you want to keep the insurance not only is zero going to investments but now even more has to be paid to keep the insurance active and that's how far we got in the discussion is what I just said all correct Sharon\nYeah yeah okay and what is going to face amount of this policy eighty thousand eighty thousand dollars and how much money do you all have how much money that we have from you how much you and your for one k.'s and you're now\nWe we do have retirement account on my own and they pay total eighty four thousand mhm\nUm\nWe have a ten thousand dollar emergency fondly our debt free or have to pay for\nGood so [laughter] kind of like so you don't have\nHow much is cash value is in this market six thousand okay so and you have a pension plans as well you know okay\nAnd so you're living on Social Security and eighty thousand dollars worth of for my husband\nStill works He says I have um have thirty six thousand in income mhm anybody than Twenty one out of an infectious parity okay and that at all I I don't work\nGotcha in the face amount of this policy you said was eighty thousand dollars\n... we did look into time and sharing for him but number one it's really a lot like I said but number two he has got a cancer a couple of times\nYeah non Hodgkin's lymphoma and so basically nobody will talk yeah very difficult very difficult and we don't know we we can lower the death benefit\nSo what is the premium how much is it a year if I don't know much heavily than a month yeah OK\nSo eight hundred a year and you make thirty six thousand dollars a year\n[noise]\nOh here's here's the equation here's the way it works in your mind okay the purpose of this is to give you an extra eighty thousand dollars if he dies before you do okay\nAnd so is that war is eight hundred bucks at this stage it's there's no investment value whatsoever so when I got the only question is you know you you don't have a huge mistake or\nThat you've you've got a small mistake in the show to double it basically if he were to die would be very helpful mhm and so keeping the insurance sounds really good with that in mind\nAnd they told us that would only last about three or four years anyway and the family wanted me to\nAl ... and they're going to make you stop anyway they're going to pull the plug yeah oh yeah okay and at that point you catch it out whatever cash value isn't there\nA ban and [laughter] if I ever would like to get it out now you know all the way to get it out no way to get out now is closed policy down right which are good at\nWhich means that you would you know if he passes away you'd have the four oh one K. money the paid for how somebody living on Social Security right yeah what'd you probably can make it 'cause I gotta feeling you guys are frugal people oh yeah and so you probably could make it on that but it's not going to be a dream come true um\n[noise] so they have given you notice that\nAt I'm sixty two\n\nSo they have given you notice that\nAt I'm\nSixty two are I'm sure are Seventy three or whatever Seventy years old they're going to shut the policy down regardless\nOf like well no I guess if we can be paying enough I find that would be over two hundred a month I think we could go either ... or are we\nReally could lower than that benefit and keep it going and I felt like we could do that which is what I wanted to do it when the cash about them and they were doing nothing\nYeah there there's not a great answer OK I asked him and hauling a little bit I'm trying to think through um uh my tendency is an eight hundred bucks a year right now to keep it for a while mhm okay\nSeventy seven dollars a month even if you use the cash value you can have the cash value and begin to pay the premiums\nAnd\n... you know it's going to do is going to use up some of that a thousand dollars I'm probably going to do that and let the eight thousand dollars pay the premiums starting today and I'm probably going to leave it in place a couple of years when it starts being two hundred a month instead of Seventy seven months at that point I'm probably going to join his tribe and say let's cash it out\nAnd close it down\nBut I don't think it's going to make sense to keep this long for a long long time Republican keep a couple more years houses health\nBut then how is his health oh I'm the first time I went to the state cancer free for five years and that kind of his and cancer free for two years good\nThough I mean he goes in and get a pet and every every six months or so to make sure it's not coming back or they say aggressive a\nGood good I'm Glad to hear that ... ... ... I'm gonna\nLet the a cash value pay the premiums for the next two years and keep it open if a\nGoing to check on his health at that time in let's say that he's got another episode with cancer going at a time then you pay the premium no matter what it costs\nAnd you keep it open if he if he's the cancers come back at any stage right to keep you keep them open at that point but if he's doing really really good and everything's clean and two years from now you haven't seen a spot nothing's no problems anywhere I'm I'm probably drop and at that point\nOkay so that makes sense to me it wouldn't it wouldn't be insured so yeah\nYou know but I'm not you but but you're also not paying you know three thousand two thousand dollars a year which is what is going to be at that point yeah which is starting to be ridiculous with that kinda money you could throw money into a investments to start having some money\nAnd uh but but at this stage I I I'm I'm hesitant to cancel it it's it's obviously a bad policy so I'll be sitting in a bad thing but it's your only option you're stuck with that so that makes it hard to discuss and hard to think about but I'm going to hold it two years like the cash value pay it at the end of that time if he's healthy or\nInstill cancer free I'm dropping it otherwise I'm going to keep it if it's if it's got a health issue at that time so good question thank you for calling in and I'm Sorry you\nHad this problem solved you hear me yell and scream about cash value life insurance will live life insurance universal library but life is rip off you just experienced it you just experienced the back end what happens if you buy\nOne of those pieces of crap policy and you're sixty eight years old this is what happens\nIs because the money they put in that that stupid but policy will be three hundred grand right now in mutual funds if I had to put it into that and a good investment instead of getting ripped off by this insurance company and if she was sitting there\nThe hundred grand right now in mutual funds if I had to put it into that and a good investments that are getting ripped off by this insurance company and if she was sitting there with three hundred grand plus the other four one K. might have about four hundred thousand bucks plus their houses paid for she wouldn't even call me\nBut instead guess who's fat sassy instead of her the insurance company so\nWhen your whole life agent says I don't really agree with Dave Ramsey because your whole life I just trying to rip you off\nThat's why your whole life I just say on that and there's only two kinds of whole life agents ignorant and crooked\nBecause if you understand these numbers and that story right there and then you still sell this stuff that makes you crooked you ought to be ashamed of yourself and if you don't understand these numbers are still showing that stuff that makes you ignorant and you shouldn't be selling their stuff and by the way folks in case you didn't know\nYou'll get screwed up way more often by an enthusiast enthusiastic ignoramus than you will by a con artist so most people out there selling this crap\nAre enthusiastic ignoramus as they're not actual con artist\nSmoke with Charlie showed me this region enthusiastic ignoramus that's all uncle Charlie we just nailed him right there\nBecause he probably not a crook if he'd actually shut down and looked and realize that share your if your friend if shares brand sold her that\nHe's not afraid of my friends like that you need ...

I'm Seventy eight dollars an hour is on our home\nGood and what's your household income or just under two hundred thousand a year so nominal and how much is college\nOn our kids are about forty thousand dollars a year right now for the two of them okay good good\nAnd how much is college on our kids are about forty thousand dollars a year right now for the two of them okay good good health so giving fat\nSo my question as it currently have about seven hundred and twenty thousand dollars and our retirement account ... company doesn't have a match that we do to prevent not a problem mhm my company I'm very blessed with 'em I invest five but then they give me ten mhm [noise]\nSo that's my question is do I find a different way to invest that other Fifteen Percent or the other ten percent to make mine a Fifteen\nOr do we put that extra for about three hundred and eighty dollars a month towards our mortgage\nIs four thousand dollars a year to join matter when I hear what I mean you know you're acting like that makes a dent in your mortgage it doesn't\nMake much better day in my retirement account or a you know\nSo I I Want you to put a baby step for Fifteen Percent of your household
