office and I'll Try and give it to my wife and every time I tried to create an account is try to connect to the delays server\nYeah yeah and a lot of times when you take a a computer\nAt home from work I'm the first thing to do is to get the idea guy to to to clear it up because they've got all sorts of settings are like that and often times you don't really have access to those do you have it administrators count\nYes I Do yeah I guess is Liz straight I created a kind of horror but what I Try and get the kids are looking for a little a name for\nYeah so you need to go into the uh you need to go into the networking settings and and turn that off um\nLet me see where that would be as long as they haven't set it up because it's not unusual but sometimes businesses set up that you can't change that you know that if you give a computer to an employee you don't want them to mess with it [noise] so it's conceivable that they\nHave um set it up that\nYou know using a thing called policy editor that says the use or may not change this but\nUm if you if you I'm trying to remember where this is and maybe somebody in a chat\nRoom me crazy all day\nYeah it's somewhere in the settings um [laughter]\nAh but where and I something I don't actually deal with very often ah so I'm not sure where it is is it when there's a network\nYeah yeah [noise] change network city change optional [noise]\nSo I think if you go my my guess is if you go\nFirst thing I always do by the way is just go in the search in a system settings and search for whatever is bugging you in this case if you search for a domains you'll be able to it says go into the account settings and under the account settings there's a a entry called access work or school\nAnd you've you've almost certainly got\nIn there um\nThey set up that says you know walk into the domain you should be able to remove that\n[noise] and I don't have it here so I Can't uh you should be able to disconnect\nFrom the work computer domain and\nUh then then you want to delete delete the entry for it so that it doesn't\nLook for it anymore you did create a new account for her right yeah so yeah and everything is working otherwise everything's working fine you you can install software and all of that\nYeah I kind of a lot you know when you account so I can log in back to like Everytime I Try to get those cars just trying to connect to the\nWall because you're old account was probably set up to work with that domain right of self correct worst case and I actually recommend is whenever you get to use the computer I Would just start over if it's if it's running windows ten now you can erase it and start over that way you won't have any corporate stuff on it at all us good idea\nI mean I I that's almost always if you buy a computer used for somebody somebody gives it to you and it's easy to do you go to Microsoft and actually you can Google this you just want the uh Microsoft\nAnd if you want it basically will create a USB key I'm sure you have one line around I think he needed they give us be G again you can use the Microsoft you walk into your account download the windows ten\nI S so file and create the media it will use you may ask you first serial number just ignore that you don't have\nTo give it a serial number and downloaded well then you write it'll put it on the USB key and then booth to the USB key\nFormat race the drive and install a fresh new install windows ten that's always the best thing to do any way you don't know what kind of stuff they put on there they you know there's all sorts of stuff they have on it\n[noise] I Know [noise]\nOr you may also want to go into the bios settings we used to call the ... you know set up now and to make sure that\nThat may also be worse where it's got the domain set up to go in there and looks real settings in there and that I never thought of that yeah there's all sorts of corporate settings in there to you want to turn off what kind of computer right\nIt is an older left town that's normal in a business they often put stuff on there and just you know protect the employees and make it easier for the employees to logging into your work domain is great because that's where everything\nIs but not strip wife she didn't even know thanks for the call actually listening here I'll take my next Martin alright [laughter]\nActually
