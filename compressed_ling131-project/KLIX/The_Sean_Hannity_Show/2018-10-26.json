amplified by Fox News why Robert Deniro Sean Hannity October Fifteen that old segment blasting deniro\nOh so that's why he got a package from this lunatic Palmer because he must have heard Sean

blowing up the White House I Dream an awful lot about blowing it up\nI'm not going to stop calling pointing out calls for violence against the president imagine\nThese words used by any conservative\nDuring the Obama years or the Clinton years if you're a person of good will like I Am you deplore violence of any kind we can settle our political differences at the ballot box and eleven days\nAnd when you call out fake news for what it is that is not in any way so I Need to be clear for stupid people that want to purposely misinterpret words of people when you call them out for having an agenda for being fake and phony and fraudulent\nThat is just telling the truth that they don't wanna hear or when you point out that they spent basically every second of every minute of every hour of every day demonizing\nA president trying to legitimize a duly elected president when people say that they care about the truth first and they say they really want to get to the bottom of Trump Russia collusion\nAnd Russia collusion at all or Russian influence at all and totally and completely and utterly ignore the candidate of their choice obvious choice\nBuying Russian lives disseminating those lies to the American people in the lead up to an election that that's that's not news that is\nAnd that is it's not even opinion all it is a propaganda and misinformation you know I don't but with that said\nI'm the one that was saying and the Obama years protect the Obamas protect the president protect the first family protect all politicians we saw what happened in the Kavanaugh hearings I didn't see many Democrats on any of these fake news network saying that\nUh we need to stop spending it senators we need to allow senators to walk the halls freely without being accosted I even said that it might be a good idea that we would clear the halls of the house and Senate because things are too hot and I don't want to see anybody hurt\nOr worse you know but when you have fake news people desperate to get any attention any ratings they politicize only those things that they think benefit by benefits their political side I guess it would have been easy after ... shot and the shooting took place in the softball field\nFor me to say well that guy is a Bernie supporter Bernie Sanders encourage this he's the one responsible\nBut if I did that it would be dishonest as they are you blame the people themselves they're responsible for their own behavior and actions\nNow with that said I'm not telling anybody ever to get in anybody's face and create a crowd and to you know go after\nPeople and get them tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore with the crowd and I've been the one thing that what's happening with secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz a Henry Kissinger Mitch McConnell\nAnd now Kevin McCarthy has got to end because it's not going to end well if we don't stop this liberal confrontation\nAnd based on the orders of people like Maxine Waters Cory Booker and over the years years gone by even Obama himself you know we've watched all of this happened\nWe've observed it and I've been saying time everybody to come

he build out in the wilderness\nOr the shooter is Steve squeezed blaming Bernie Sanders to suggest any way that honest a vigorous debate and criticism\nIs the motivating force behind one fringe violent individual let me tell you what that is that is intellectual laziness\nAnd a chief attempt frankly to capitalize off a dangerous and serious incident especially in light of the fact while others on TV had been utterly silent their silence is deafening\nI haven't been to one saying something horrible is going to happen it needs to stop you know the safe CNN sucks or CNN is fake news\nThat is not to cry or an advocate of violence in it\nIt's a feeling people have\nWhen they see a few abusive Levi is news coverage if you're American whether sold is should transcend politics I deplore all violence of any kind but legitimate fair criticism of me that's fair game media criticism is fair game\nCalling out networks that have political agendas that's fair game\nWhen network spend every second minute an hour of the day Haiti on Donald Trump Donald Trump cured cancer they still hate him\nWell I'm allowed to call that out that's not hate if there's any hate their their hatred of the president that they can't seem to get over you know the bottom line is you're watching people trying to ... an attempt to exploit\nAnd politicize the actions of one unhinged lunatic and conflated with fair and wanted criticism and that for them as they're putting politics above all else and that's wrong for the country\nAnd anybody that has intimidated into stopping what they do because of this predictable attack\nI put it all up on Hannity dot com and it's called the less new low Hannity slams the media is total failure to report liberal calls for violence that we've got it all chronicled with all we we put the tape and everything you need to one place\nAnd we're going to tweet that we're going to send that out to everybody weren't Lebanon days away from an election day

a historic president and\nThe reason he's a historic president is he's not from the establishment he beat the Republican establishment he beat the national establishment he's there he's not he's not only draining the swamp but he's a threat to their very existence so it's going to happen is the presidential race is going to start right\nAfter the election on November ... where the Democrats are going to put up a big field of people who are going to be all at the president and if they get the house\nAnd Nancy Pelosi the speaker it's all about feeding Donald Trump's so this race November six it's not just about control the Congress it's really about the what the Democrats are doing to get rid of Donald Trump what the establishment is doing to get rid of Donald Trump and the sixty three

for late term abortion this isn't a moderate here this is a radical you this is a guy who is trying to pretend he is a support the president he's not going to support the president is going to support Nancy Pelosi is going to support the impeachment caucus he's going to China right in with all these democratic never shown that he has a fact\nOn his never stood up to Sheldon Silver in fact he was handpicked by Sheldon Silver for the job to get in the assembly now he's hand picked by Chuck Schumer who brags about it and Andrew Cuomo funny none of them have come\nTo the district to help him get elected but she never came to our district President Trump the first time in my home city of Utica New York\nIn Seventy years we had a sitting president ...\nWell you also had his son Eric I'm there and his daughter a bunk up there they recognize the importance of your race and that's why a mum having yawn lives and the only thing I can say is to the the people up in the ... area and northern New York in that area you this was a district that you can win ... plus a Republican\nAnd you have about thirty thousand more Republicans and Democrats in the district so you have a political edge there the key is to get the vote out because otherwise you're going to end up with a Nancy Pelosi Democrat Nancy Pelosi as speaker and that's going to be a disaster for New York I can promise you\nThat absolutely and by the way they are raising incredible amounts of money at the talking to my colleagues all across the country the amount of money they're dumping introduced racist to try to deceive voters Israeli it's outrageous to me and my opponent is star outspending may I've always been a very independent Republican I'm One of the top conservatives NPR\nOh when I served in the assembly and still you know one of the top conservatives but we have\nGot to continue to stand up for our values and be able to read these elections ready to fight the fight because we've got a ticket to Washington we gotta support the president's policies which are creating unprecedented gains even upstate New York where we have a really tough economy I mean we are actually helping or small business community or small business humidity\nIs about Ninety eight percent of my life to visit says in my region and they create most of the jobs that says the health is alive by Nancy Pelosi\nThat somehow the wealthiest said the only ones benefiting it's absolutely false we voted to make the tax cuts permanent and the reason Governor Cuomo is suing the federal government over the tax cuts it's because here's wealthy donors\nWanna leave New York because they're not getting the lifeline that they used to get there actually paying more it's all a lie coming from that side and we've got to fight it says this is a tough battle because the Democrats\nHave the money to deceive voters and fool them into thinking that if this guy is somehow a moderate he's not\nAnd I encourage everyone to support us get the vote out its most important if we can beat the wall money but we need a Republican voters to understand that a ticket out oh it's really really important\nI ride a Claudia Tenney are running in New York in unimportant seat this will tip the balance of power one of our thirty seats\nIdentified on Hannity dot com as the main\nYou know ground zero seeds that will do\nThat will literally tip the balance of power so Claudia we wish you the best things were to be with us and hopefully we'll send in your back to Congress and eleven days you deserve it and New York deserves that we don't have many good New York politicians at all um by the way just going back to direct a re what he said earlier today a they have confirmed that the\nReal and that in fact they've been able to identify least some forensic evidence including fingerprints which\nWhich to directly connected to the person that was arrested earlier today or more about that as the day unfolds here or let's get to our phones as we say Hi to Danny as in Austin, Texas Danny Hi how are you glad you called sir\nYes listening to you a lot and I have not been in\nClinical sense whatsoever but these terms are on a leave me in court to get out and vote [noise] ah the ... and you hit on it every day I listen to a and not watch it or not I\nWasn't I Hope everyone feels the same way you do this for a hundred and thirty five members of Congress every seat is important ... vote for democratic voting for policy you stay home that's a half a vote for below sea and the Senate if you stay home a half a vote for sure if you don't vote for the Republican\nThen you're basically voting for sure I mean it's really that that simple and we'll get the government we deserve\nI've been at this game a long time I've had a lot of victories I kind of loved when we shocked the world in the media you know I see three scenarios that could unfold\nBad to say the more likely scenario based on my full objective analysis it would be a split decision whether Republicans pick up houses or pick up seats in the Senate and maybe lose the house of representatives but the house of representatives as well within our power to win\nIf people identified the thirty districts we've identified on Hannity dot com and people take it seriously and get out and vote\nI mean if every Trump voter wants the success of the last two years to continue\nAnd goes to vote Republican in eleven days then that means we'll keep the house will pick up seats in the Senate and things will be a lot easier in the work will be getting done faster\nIf we don't do that then you know we get the government we deserve you know I've had many ups and downs following political races in the course of my career I wasn't exactly happy the two nights that Obama won\nEspecially thought he could have been defeated in twenty twelve alright it didn't happen and you do everything it can to stop the agenda on their side I'm prepared for whatever Nancy Pelosi an Adam Schiff of Gerald Nadler and\nMaxine Waters want to do to the country and we're not going to go away we're not going to cry we're not going to be and cry babies like they'd been for the last two years\nAnd when they try to do things that are detrimental to the country and the president and they want endless investigations were going to be there\nAs a backstop to tell the American people the truth and then some of you will probably regret that you didn't get out and vote this election season so don't wait I'm telling you what's gonna happen\nWe know they only want Obamacare we know they want to open borders they don't want to fund the wall they believe in open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states\nWe know they want their crumbs back we know they want higher taxes we know they you know they don't they don't really care they're all things hating Trump all the time not exactly in the best interest of the country to keep\nFocused on that for two years but we'll do our
