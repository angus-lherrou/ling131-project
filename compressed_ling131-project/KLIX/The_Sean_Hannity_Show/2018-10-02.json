seller the rush a hoax and David limbo his new book is out today probably the premier writer on\nOn Christianity which by the way you kind of bridges the gap between real intellectual biblical study and people like me the common man that does not have the knowledge that he has and it's called Jesus is risen poll in the early church and we have it up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and in bookstores everywhere\nA one quick thing I mean you do have that amazing talent but as I look at myself as a guy not spent my life studying the Bible um I read it now more than I ever have and you you have made this a part of your life study\nYes I just when I I really wasn't a believer when I was a young adult and I know you were incorrigible jerk like me [laughter] you know like Brett Kavanaugh at a\nNo like that or like rock Obama was part of the June gangs smoking pot and we'd and yeah and ...\nNo reason to believe in fate is beyond reason of course but it's consistent with wages so I wanted to share what are the game because I'll make this quick quick I I got on fire for the Bible in theology so I've been reading it pretty heavy on and off for Twenty years\nSo let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know floods investigation is now being the seventh from every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and\nIt seems like they're very close to probably completing their work but if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed that these four people were at the party\nNobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse in her case\nUm was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen and then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nAll the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that Mr Ramirez was calling former yell classmates and asking them if they remembered and that she wasn't sure sure herself if it was Brett Kavanaugh\nSo that should go away and this one I think is the worst of all and I I guess there's no sense\nSure sure her cells are villas Brett Kavanaugh so that should go away and this one I think is the worst of all and I I guess there's no standards at NBC News any more if they're going to put on somebody that they can't corroborate her stories whose changing or story almost you know by the hour seemingly\nOr even the Democrats um declined to fully embrace street Julie sweat next story but on the original story the Christine for a story\nI think what we're going to find and what we're already finding um is that the people who gave statements to the Senate Judiciary committee like Peter Smith and mark judge amazingly enough\nThey're telling the FBI the same thing they told Judiciary Committee which they have no memory at all\nOr to support this now I think it's probably a good thing to get additional recollections or you're not remember a Senator Whitehouse and other Democrats made a big deal with this party entry into Brett Kavanaugh calendar July first Nineteen eighty two thirty six years in three months ago by the way\nI'm very interested who is that the party and it didn't match up with a with Christine Ford's account of this but they thought this was a big deal so let's talk to those people and I think my feeling is that that I think there are three additional people calm Bernie and squeak\nOr who had not been interviewed earlier a and I think you're going to find three more people who don't know anything about a Christian for it's a allegations so\nUh I listen I I don't think this FBI thing FBI investigation is a bad thing I think that they will find out that there is no evidence to support as we did find out actual real evidence to support it than I change my mind but I don't think it's fair\nWell if you go through I I thought it was really devastating new report by Rachel Mitchell I'm now she's the independent prosecutor she prosecute sex crimes\nAnd she was hired by the Senate and I think rightly by the Republicans that they wanted to be extremely courteous and thoughtful and and take this very seriously and not make a political so they brought in an independent prosecutor to to question professor Ford who showed incredible respect to her\nBut she pointed out he said she said cases incredibly difficult to prove itself and then she goes on this cases even weaker than that\nAnd then she stopped afford identified other witnesses to the event those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them and for reasons discuss below I don't think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nAnd then she went on to list all the issues there was no consistent account and she gives the example after example of when the alleged assault happened I mean the dates keeps shifting back and forth dramatically actually\nThe failure to previously identified judge Kavanaugh as the assailant are inconsistent descriptions of the alleged assault a failure to remember the details who invited forward to the party how did you get to the party where did the party even take place how did you get home from the party\nUm and and it goes on from there but every case is similar\nIn as much as there's no corroboration they're a big holes in the stories and at some point when do we ask is this becoming a witch hunt we know that Deborah Katz says her friend sending out emails and she's a woman that went after Paula Jones and supported Al Franken so she's not exactly\nConsistent on the issue of of sexual misconduct and they're sending out letters to the deer so and so do you know anything please call us and you know those letters when ours\nRace and you know the ... case right in the time\nThey said they called they talked to thousands of people out to me that says twenty four people or more I mean that is a lot of people to look at it on all the Rachel mental thing you know she was a lot of criticism of her and um I think that the the way she approached it was not\nA really good way given the limitations of a Senate hearing where they always did she had to be interrupted every five minutes but she did\nLose a lot of information I was looking today at her questioning of a Ford about her therapist and the therapist notes and the white we even know about this because remember\nFord says it took place in the summer of Nineteen eighty two she did not tell anybody for ten twenty thirty thirty six years to two thousand twelve and she ... she says that she's in marriage therapy with her husband and she tells\nThe therapist about that and she later also tells an individual therapist about that as well and she checks the therapists notes and the therapists notes do not mention the name Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd she says as a matter of fact it's only her husband remembering that after session she brought up Brett Kavanaugh's name\nThat is the only evidence that it took place in the therapy sessions and by the way you would think such therapy sessions and the note there would be confidential but of course she gave them to the Washington Post so there's probably no longer\nA confidential so even even her account of how she finally mentioned this to someone after thirty six years raises a lot of questions\nIt really is amazing now we have the Judiciary Committee Democrats now they want to know investigate the quote ice throwing incident in college you\nKnow this is what it sounds like you're telling the truth is that is what they say well\nNow we have the Democratic hope or Hawaii senator the one that said the men to just shut up and sit down on Renault yeah Geraldo is now saying that she wants an investigation into the ice throwing instead of\nUm had a ball game and on top of that now they're questioning the veracity about was he truthful about is drinking he said he ... he liked to drink beer then he likes to drink beer now he said yeah there were plenty of times like a lot of college and high school kids I drink too much beer\nBut they're saying well he must have blacked out in this event um nobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said to somebody I blacked out correct\nSo this is a fishing expedition this is now a destroy Kavanaugh expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him so here you know ... question mhm go ahead we're told us\nThat things have changed yeah I'm from an emphasis on the the sex misconduct allegations too was he truthful about his drinking and I think that's a reflection of the fact\nThat there really isn't any evidence to support the sex or allegations\nAnd now they're talking about whether he told the truth about drinking although he mentioned many times\nIn his testimony that he did um in fact drink today rocks published an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single word of his testimony about his drinking trick is mischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nAre they going to let it go there thank you so much Byron York uh with us actually on the Washington Examiner eight hundred nine four one showing us our toll free telephone numbers we continue from Washington DC we'll get

speaking like they sneak for all women they don't they absolutely do not end when the press in the media and the the leftist obsessed about women this um\nThis cycle we're just not going to sit back and take it we're the ones\nFor sixty since the Nineteen sixties women have the deciding vote women were the ones that don't like that Donald Trump's women are the ones that are going to decide what happens in the Senate turns and we're going to be the ones that decide what happened and twenty twenty and conservative women are kind\nOf that together and we're pushing back on all of this and said they don't speak for us and we stand with Brett Kavanaugh I mean we're not going to back down and let and let them win this absolutely no way\nWell it's going to be up to three senators probably Jeff Flake snowflake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and then it's gonna be whether or not the whether or not I'd look the Senate's going to hold a vote and I think Lindsey Graham has a point\nUm we haven't really heard from Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski on the issue\nWhat is it ... the the convinces them he's not qualified for the job you know the guy admits that he drank he liked to drink you drink beer still like to drink beer sometimes drink more beer that he should have drink\nAnd then people say what he must have blacked out we know that he's a liar he's a perjure right and now they want to investigate an ice throwing incident at some game you know back thirty five years ago this is how absurd this has gotten\nWell I Can't tell you what I was doing thirty six years ago but I could tell you what we're doing in two days and that\nIs we're having a win for Trump or first ever conference here in Washington DC it's limited for America first killed on us off and women from across the country are coming together and we're going to spend three or four days together and talk about why we love this country and we're going to be bold at our support of the president\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh and on Thursday or taking a little trip to the U.S Capitol while the others are camped out at their most conservatives are working but we're going to take a truck and visit some of the senators and let them do how we feel about it and encourage them to vote 'em\nTo support to confirm Kavanaugh we need to do this and I'm hoping that Mitch McConnell brings us on Thursday it we're having our first event Thursday night and it would be great to be able to celebrate the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh um women for Trump at our complex\nSo I Want to see what happens we'll know a lot more by the end of the week we may even no I'm I'm hearing rumors that the FBI may be very close to finishing their report and when that happens maybe it'll happen for tonight\nNo I'm I'm hearing rumors that the FBI may be very close to finishing their report\nAnd when that happens maybe a lab for tonight when that gets an ounce will senators will get to read it and then the cloture vote will be called and we'll have an up or down vote mostly where people come down on this shouldn't be that difficult to read the FBI doesn't reach conclusions they don't make recommendations they just say interviewed person a\nB C D E F G and but in every case there is no corroboration in every single case\nAfter case there's inconsistencies and every single case is very problematic\nAnd all I'm saying is is if this is the excess full we will never ever get good people ever in this kind of ... like do want to do anything publicly why should de\nSean I completely agree it's a political ... job and we need to stand up and make sure Republicans\nDo the right thing and confirmed hands so glad the Lindsey Graham staying with us with the president and fight back for a change instead of playing on the terms that the Democrats that so and I hope that they keep up this fight and confirm Kavanaugh weekend anybody that's out there that wants to join us this weekend we'd love to have\nThem and I just keep up the fight\nAll right thank you so much for being with us we are\nVery proud of collie is now part of the Sean Hannity show and she's the one that's answering everybody's calls as you're doing
