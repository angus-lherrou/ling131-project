Semitism\nIn oh Sarah Sanders pointing out is there any tragedy the Washington Post won't exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who

I mean the way things are being patch on Fox and the and a pro Trump or right wing media is dangerous and it's destructive so I think we need to call it what it is\nA ...

was targeted and why agree with the condemnation of what Fox has done in terms of Jennings off this anger over the caravan I think that this is a much more widespread problem\nWell it is more widespread than I have had far more instances that I'm willing to talk about a real credible threats towards me and my family including the one that I did share last week with white powder\nPurported to be anthrax sent to a my office and one of my employees having to spend an entire day in isolation scared\nOut of our mind and it's been worse but obviously these people are not listening to what

believed in my entire life and career a strong military security for the American people a strong stand against evil in our time\nIt's not that complicated\nI Know what the democratic agenda is if they win it's gonna be okay we want to impeach Trump endless investigations they said they want their crumbs\nBack we know they support sanctuary cities open borders and the elimination of ice\nAnd they think Obamacare works and it doesn't you know you had an MSNBC you know literally pressing the Israeli ambassador germ or the blame Trump for the synagogue attack that's how sick it's gotten\nYou know ABC Trump is at the center of all the political loans no he's not\n\nBut I guess it's an easy blame game so now we've taken the predictable every two four years Republicans were racist and sexist a massage therapist and Xena phobic Islamic phobic homophobic and they weren't dirty air and water and they want children to die and they want granny thrown over the cliff\nAnd now it's that they are somehow inciting violence in the country no they're not\nIt's not true it's never been true and it's not any conservative I Would ever support and then the case of this guy that shot up the synagogue\nIt was a very ill and anti Semite who also hated Donald Trump but that doesn't stop them from saying and literally advancing\nThat narrative\nKnow this is you know watch watching the Washington Post the loan\nIf it van seeing that narrative\nYou know this is you know ... watching the Washington Post alone is unbelievable Fox does or their headlights Fox News and the rest of the

something when the media lives twenty four seven and they get called out that's too bad\nThat is not a call for violence unbelievable the times that we're living in now here is um where we are the

barely hanging on to a lead in New Jersey by three now do I think both of those races are gonna be won by Republicans ah\nMaybe West Virginia New Jersey is hard for possible people in New Jersey

that the way the media wants to believe that we're a nation divided but we're not we're a nation or a community like this one like any other\nYeah that's right and and Sean ... are enticed to people right now certainly the fifth thousands of volunteers that are out there and knock on doors and distributing voter education literature for our organization is thick nor the polls ignore the press ignore the pundits do your job get the ... and everybody\nTells me you know I make a living for people not ignoring I saw\nYour except it okay\nTo everybody I think you're right though because the polls are so often so wrong I mean let's go back two years Donald Trump lost every state according to the exit polls five Fifteen on election day\nWell that's exactly right and I mean look when I was state party chairman in Georgia where we elected the first Republican governor and that stayed in a hundred and thirty four years\nThe last published poll in a midterm election showed him trailing by Thirteen she won by five they were only off by a team points and particularly in a midterm election work turnout is everything it's all a matter of who does a better job of getting their voters to the polls and Sean\nI talked to a friend of mine who's helping to run independent expenditures and every target it's been in the house race in the country he told me that in some of these house races dessert\nAnd he was helping to run independent expenditures and every target it's been in the house race in the country\nHe told me that in some of these house races dirt down to as few as twenty three hundred are undecided voters in an entire\nCongressional district everybody's got their uniforms on everybody's blocking and tackling and everybody's going to the polls and the good news is we've got the ability to identify twenty six million voters as eater evangelicals are pro life Catholics way of\nPhone numbers on forty five percent of them we've got emails on about half of them are we we have the ability to get directly to them and we know nightly whether they voted or not and then we can follow up with more phone or email us more tax and worked or not\nWhere do you see because I'm looking at six races believe it or not in Southern California that matter for the house there's there's races in New York house races that could turn tipped the balance of power and New Jersey can tip the balance of power and Minnesota has house races that can tip the balance of power\nBut then I say that and I'm thinking well there were four hundred and thirty five races going on a in a daze in any one of them could tip the balance of power and while you use the poles and it's somewhat helpful it's much harder to decide and get a feel for how the house is going to go\nLook right now we really see the houses on the bus all we think it's plus or minus five or ten feet and we think when you're dealing with probably right now\nA hundred seats in clay and probably half of those are tied again it's all about turnout and and look you remember the special election in Georgia sex when they had all of a you know two three four five and he lost by four it's all a matter of\nWho does the best job at the ground game and the good news Sean is the power brokers and the media and no longer get to control who wins or who loses we've got the ability to communicate to voters directly on line\nOn their cell phone at their doors wherever they work play and live and if we do our job and get our bowed out we're going to have the potential to have a shocking\nAn election night to the to the dominant media as we had two years ago\nI mean that's what I keep reminding people you can shocked the world again we can go against history nobody thought Trump would win I mean the networks were literally what I read the exit polls of five Fifteen I was doing radio at the time and and the at that moment reading the eggs opposed Trump lost Florida he'd lost North Carolina he lost Pennsylvania\nHe lost Ohio he loves Michigan the last was constantly wants that all new id barely won state according to the exit polls the same thing happened in two thousand and for the exit polls the five Fifteen election day show John Kerry was president so you're right not to pay attention to the polls but more importantly\nHow do you get all these people involved that they're really spending the time making phone calls getting on you know getting the boat out and sending out these emails and letters and tax what are you doing\nI have to be honest with the Sean I got to give credit\nWhere the creditors do first of all a to President Trump for providing the banner of the positions on the issues that have got these people so excited and secondly to the Democrats for during the cabinet nominations trying to air and destroy a good man and his family\nAnd we saw a noticeable inflection point in this cycle when they tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh it's a reminder of why people turned out in sixteen\nAnd we've got thirty nine field offices and Nineteen states we have a team's operating in every state in the country\nThere overseeing walking teams that are going ... neighborhood we had a woman the other day that was verbally accosted a ... a guy got in his car and followed her all the way down the block screaming obscenity at her or she sent me an email later and said not only am I not\nThat church she said I'm now going to walk\nAnd the block screaming obscenities at her or she sent me an email later and said not only am I not that church she said I'm now going to walk every neighborhood in my town and knock on every door it's that kind of intensity that\nKind of commitment or our country you know at at times like this Sean when people wonder you know if that kind of decency in character still alive in this country the answer is a ... yeah it is it's in the heartland of the country it's at the grassroots it's alive and well\nWell I think grassroots politics works grassroots works and I think it works from the beginning one of the things though I think Obama lead the way but Trump and the Republicans did some catch up and we saw the benefit of their working twenty sixteen and that is the use of social media I don't think anybody has a more powerful platform on social media than President Trump\nI think that's right I think ah you know a rock Obama was the first\nSocial media Internet president in the same way that FDR was the first radio president and the same way that John F. Kennedy was the first president to master television but if Obama was the pioneer I assure you Trump's has mastered\nIt or not only in his use of social media platform but also the thing is that his campaign did in twenty sixteen\nTo catch up with what the Obama campaign did and we for example a Sean when we took our Christian voter file and matched it up against social media platforms Seventy two percent of\nThe voters were seeking to contact or on Twitter or Facebook or another social media platform and we're broadcasting out thirty two million videos\nGet out the vote messages and other targeted messages directly to those people and again I Want to stress the minute they vote they get dropped out of the turnout universe and all the videos we've been pushing to their social media accounts then begin to go elsewhere\nSo I agree look anything is possible I ... I don't take things for granted\nI'm I was one of the few that really believe that Donald Trump could when I saw something happening because I was out on the road\nI also see it happening this time anecdotally\nYou know I can see it in ratings every single night it's a you know Fox is audiences enthusiastic 'em and you could see CNN fake news and and MS that they're just desperate then they're like not doing well they seem almost the audience seems depressed but\nThere are three virtual outcomes here one is we shock the world Republicans picked up Senate seats hold the\nHouse that would be the best case scenario then there's a split decision where Republican seats in the Senate ... become speaker and then there's a worst case scenario you wake up you know ten nine days from now when you find out as speaker elect below sea and Senate majority elects Schumer and\nIt's really up to the people which decision which outcome they want but we'll get the government we deserve you stay home well that's a half of Oprah below sea and Schumer if you don't vote for the Republican you're basically voting for ...\nYeah and I and I really believe showing that the intensity gap in the enthusiasm gap that wants to separate the two sides has closed significantly since the cabinet nominations you know you see different polls would Democrats\nWith a high enthusiasm maybe Seventy two percent of them Republicans maybe sixty eight to Seventy percent but anecdotally I'm telling you I'm seeing stuff out there that I saw on twenty sixteen I was in Des Moines Iowa last\nWeek at an event with the

really getting sicker and ... uh like demeanor Trump so I think they just they just want to silence and they're going to just vote Republican\nLeaning I I Am a realist and I try to look at things as I study these numbers more than you know if the election were held today I think we'd lose the house by about five seats boy\nIf the election were held with the Senate today\nWhere we would hold

the best case scenario or it's going to be a split decision they pick up seats in the Senate but lose the house\nOr it's going to be a disaster and that's you know speaker elect Nancy Pelosi Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer\nFrankly as you I can see any one of those three scenarios unfolding with a third one the least likely so you know I'd rather go full for the gusto and when it all one of the big problems for the Republicans as they've had forty five retirements that's forty five unknowns on the ballot\nAnd the Democrats you know they're getting all of this money poured into these

it but that's the absolute truth\nAre the polls latest numbers show uh in the district\nSo you're voting for ... they're just not saying that\nThey're not saying it but that's the absolute truth\nOne of the polls latest numbers show uh in the district\nTwo points back where the latest poll shows that were to back to back well within the margin of error and we're in we're gaining momentum uh we've we've debated several times\nI've been hearing every debate she will not to agree to any additional debates I'll record her actually listen to this we caught her in the debates talking about supporting open borders and she correct herself and say no no no I support a strong southern border twice she said that in the last debate which completely makes sense because during the primary she was ... running on about\nEyes open borders but now we're getting the general election they're trying to credit and I work at it and we're gonna exposure for what she really is\nWell this is really important race a now Mardi no Stein is running for the seventh district of\nPennsylvania this Lehigh Valley district Lehigh Valley county in Pennsylvania\nA it's a dead even race it's all going to come down to turn out Democrats are spending a fortune Republican sadly of not spent as much and they should be meeting these guys dollar for dollar but I Hope people in the seventh district I Know we have a lot of listeners there are paying attention and and get out and vote early voting goes on in Pennsylvania right so people can vote soon\nYes and then we're seeing and talking to our election board you know this is a mini presidential election is what they told me what the amount of absentee ballot requests and what is being turned it so people are really really engage the really engaged\nAnd he's getting any orders feedback as though you know what's coming back Republican versus Democrat\nI haven't been getting any any feedback but I can just tell you that people who have been meeting and the people who aren't going to be here to vote have been asking for absentee ballots and they're making sure they're getting their votes and I\nHave a good sense that there's going to be a lot of people showing up at the polls and it'd be laws and there's gonna be a lot of people supporting Trump's agenda [noise]\nYou know we're in the middle of the great American come back\nThe last two years have given a lot of people hope in this country more jobs lower taxes\nSafer communities or do they want to uh uh have Nancy Pelosi take charge and have more welfare higher taxes open borders and sanctuary cities the voters are smarter than that Sean they one pops they went freedom and liberty they one opportunity that's what we want that's what we have and we must continue it\nWishes the best Marty all the best of and I know you'll bring that great training as an athlete to the hard work you do for the seventh district to Pennsylvania and Lehigh County uh we'll be following the race ... a week from tomorrow and uh I Hope you're able to sneak this out\nYes sir thank you thank you for having me on the show\nEight hundred nine four one ... listen you gotta understand this is now well how close it is it's all coming down to get getting out the vote\nIt's one point here two points there it makes all the difference there are enough people in his audience that if everybody just made a commitment wherever you live on six hundred stations now and you made a decision that you're going to get out and you're going to vote\nAnd you're not going to stay home and you had to put in the effort and you're not going to give a half a vote to ... below zero half a vote to Schumer it could be you know shocked the world again kind of night ... stay home than\nIt's you know maybe we split split the baby in the sense that you know it's\nOkay we said we saved the Senate and get extra seats there but we lose the house it'd be a lot easier and better for the country if you want to continue progress to win both houses\nAs of today eight days out I can see any one of those scenarios unfolding any one of them All right let's get to our busy telephones ah let's say Hi to Catherine is in palm bay Florida next on the Sean Hannity show\nHey Sean I Can't I'm telling you how much my husband and I just\nAbsolutely I think you are the greatest not because it's just what you inform us because of your courage and the hearts and prayers go out to the people in Pittsburgh it is devastating I Can't believe Americans have forgotten the history and the genocide that went on to\nGo out to the people in Pittsburgh it is devastating I Can't believe Americans have forgotten this history and the genocide that went on during ... during the Holocaust I don't understand it but with that said our hearts and prayers are with them I have a point to make about courage\nAnd by the way you are right up there with President Trump and his entire family and those that stand by and I want the conservatives in this country to take part\nIn some shared risk and stand up not in a violent way not in the vulgar way but maintain your credibility by being civil and stand up\nTo all these bullies and oppression and and the violence and the hatred that they're stealing and the lie they're telling about our give president I'm comparing him to Hitler and style in which are just atrocities I Can't stand to listen to\nBut the problem is we've got to a lot of a lot of very frightened people I think President Trump as the most famous whistle blower in the nation because he's he's taken the curtain back\nAnd all the corruption in Washington and then something I'm I'm a whistle blower myself unemployed nurse practitioner who at the heart surgeon five years ago and I'm Still fighting it today that's that's fine but I just wanted to say if if the conservatives had some shared risk and stood together and consolidated\nGotta let me tell you why are we are now I mean we're now at a point where there's a there's a group of so called conservatives never Trump or conservatives again that they're just angry they've been so wrong Ben Sasse\nWas one of them Bill Kristol is another one of them Jennifer Rubin another one of them you know that if there's if Trump cured cancer they would be mad\nBecause oh it was Donald Trump that that it doesn't matter that he's transformed the economy on all things that they said that they use conservatives would ever want in terms of cap tax cuts deregulation or energy independence a peace through strength trust but verify\nSecuring America's borders all of these things it doesn't they hated all because Trump is doing that which they advocated for but they wanted somebody to do it in a way that that that's set everything the way they wanted to say it but the problem is the old\nEstablishment way of doing things get nothing done you know I agree he can be incendiary he breaks things he throws dishes and breaks them in Washington and he exposes the swamp but he fights hard\nBut we're getting the results in the benefit of that hard fight you know they're they're the type of Republicans the basically wanna just sit in power in the corner and and act like they can be friends with people that are saying publicly to kick you and I don't want to be civil\nThat are running you out of restaurants and screaming at the top of their lungs are you\nSo I you know it's it is what it is a the only thing I really want at this point I Want results I Want the forgotten men and women to be taken care of I Want as much prosperity as we could ever create for\nEvery American and I want to take care of Americans first and then we'll work on helping the rest of the world develop the same system in paradigm that we built that\nHas benefited our population and then I Want security in a world full of radical Islam is and people that that want to wipe America off the map and chant death to America I Want to make sure that we have the meanest toughest bad US military and we can handle any threat to the world throws at us\nAnd we can do if necessary we can protect the world against evil when evil you know raises it's ugly head because it's happened before and it's going to happen again history has proven in the meanwhile it's you know basically you know temper tantrum politics\nOf never Trump or is there there's still mad they got it wrong you know we wouldn't have to Supreme Court justices that are conservative\nWe wouldn't have had the tax cuts we wouldn't have the regulations to roll back\nWe wouldn't have America on a path towards energy independence\nWe wouldn't have had you know all the record numbers of jobs we currently have or the big GDP Growth we have or consumer confidence that we have that's why in eight days when people go out and vote this all matters a major question people have to ask is are you're better off than you were two years ago\nIn terms of the economy peace and prosperity Dr elections and if you want this prosperity this growth to continue if you want America to remain a leader on the world stage if you're not afraid to have a president\nThat is willing to be a tough negotiator on your behalf be a trade or NATO or Kim Jong un we didn't give anything that Kim Jong un nothing and look at what we've gotten back\nA shot at peace and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula you know if you want to president that says he's going to respect our constitution the rule of law are our laws on borders and security and respect our sovereignty first and demand that people respect our sovereignty first then you know where to vote this year", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "29"}
