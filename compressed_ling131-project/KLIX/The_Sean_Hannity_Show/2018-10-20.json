would be dumb because they're going to sell the car after they've repossessed it and uh they're anal\nRepossession lot and then they're going to sue you for the difference if you don't pay them the difference of media\nAnd you don't have the different she goes you're broke so I don't know that would be a dumb idea we're not going to do that [noise] um what we are going to do is find out two pieces of information one is called the car fleece company that you are paying the ... to ...\nAnd find out what the early buyout on the car is now the early buyout is different than the total of your

all the interest from the time that the ... from keeping alone the whole time\nShow the early buyout as your hourly pay off now now that was what strikes by the car off and get the title in your hand then you compare that\nTo KB dot com Kelley Blue book dot com private say what the car is actually worse and I'll just make up some numbers let's pretend that the early buyout\nIs twenty thousand and then you look it up in the car is actually worse sixteen thousand that would leave you four thousand dollars on the whole ... probably not far off of what you're going to find\n... four thousand dollars in the hall mange you sell the car for Shakespeare again you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer and so um you have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able to come\nWanted to get the title for the buyer and so\nUm you have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able to cover the whole richer and the amount that you are upside down in the way you would do that is obviously alone and so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank and you get a loan lined\nUp for the amount that you're upside down and you put the car up for sale and you sell the car for as much as you can possibly get for which is more than they will sell it for on the report lot said bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the differences greater and you do more damage to your life at least more control\nOf your life by doing a repercussion and so you cover the difference cover their mouth that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather be four thousand dollars\nIn debt than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the

prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... never for some reason I heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically [noise] um\nThe people who sell investment based on your whole life or permanent\nLive or portfolio or universal or anything where there is an investment going into insurance are not happy\nWith me they don't like me and so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business\nBecause they say oh crap crap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing when you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return regardless of what they call chew after\nThey take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to four years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out and fees even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been in a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money and that's where you should be when you die\nWith cash value permanent portfolio universal indexed universal life insurance\nThey pay only the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone so you have a savings account for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you about ready to return and when you die they keep it all this is a bad savings account\nBad investment for over\nThe pay the the life insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in older that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap and that's what they Ramsey is always at four twenty five years here on the air upset it for twenty five\nYears is all I've owned myself I have never owned while this show is operating any kind\nOf whole life or investment based life insurance of any kind ever now I did get a horrible northwestern mutual whole life grotesque old school more than ... ...\nI've ... when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Britain they it was a guy\nMy wife knew from college came around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from it had it

little more ... and I want to hear what your thoughts were on that okay um I think it's X\nA real estate gives you a better return than the stock market will give you but it's a higher hassle factor and it's you know you put my mutual fund and they don't bother you you know but you you put put a winner in\nHouse they go on you [laughter] and so there's a ... you know you got the hassle of buying it you got to pay the taxes you got to pay the insurance I mean they're dealing with managing real estate all the aspects of it is a national fact I've got a bunch of it I'm not by saw her\nMore in real estate than I Do in the stock market um got a lot in both but a real estate will give you a better rate of return but it requires\nManagement by you or someone else and even if you have somebody else do you got to manage the manager you cannot ignore it and so my real estate with an internal right of return which is the tax benefit the the you know that appreciation schedule in other words

right of return I are are\nNot casual cash is about ten okay or a little less and some other okay but\nOur total what the increases in value and other stuff so I'm making more on that\nI Am on the ...

with a half a trillion dollars in student loan debt we have an entire department within our company called Ramsey education\nThat puts a curriculum and the high schools and into colleges across America One now and forty percent of the high schools teaching high schoolers\nThis common some stuff of staying out of that and being on a budget and learning to save money and all of that kind of thing and what happens from time to time as the schools can't afford the basic resources and so someone will come a long shot in the community a business or an entity of some kind\nAnd we'll pay for that high school to have\nFoundations in personal finance curriculum from the Ramsey organization\nIs that we've had about four million students go through one of the coolest things has happened lately is the University of Wyoming has decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have\nThis curriculum and they're sponsoring it in paying for it dang dang touchdown baby that's how that happens the college university says we're going to take care of these high schoolers in our state and make sure they learn about money\nAnd of course University of Wyoming is the best cost alternative in the Wyoming area to go to college so this all works out really really good now Tyler Moore is with me on the line and\nTitle is from the University of Wyoming usually associated

minutes but I Will get them to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh\nAbout this campaign and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nSome of that our our campaign is called the world need more cowboys we're we're not talking about guys and cowboy hats that ride off into the sunset but we are talking about a state with a long heritage and a university mascot and a cowboy that can be\nAnyone from any gender any background but we're talking about that enters here we're talking about a curiosity independence of boldness\nAt pursuit that adventure and we're talking about someone who changes landscapes and and look for opportunities to make differences in the world we are talking about trailblazers and people ... by the spirit of the underdog\nYou know it's not a cowboy isn't\nWhat you are but it's who you are\nYeah well and you guys are the cowboys I mean so it's a play on words obviously I mean if you're a mascot right that's\nCorrect your football team your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like my University of Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right as as as good I play on words but you you guys got though to you got to the table first where this way to go\nIt it's a great motto or does it says so much in unjust are so few words very very cool well we're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and you guys sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is going to have\nAs a coming up soon the the high school curriculum because the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool guile thank you man\nWe're happy to be happy to be a partner we we are we are state that is very practical were state that very much um applicable in terms of being smart with our money we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out opportunity to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment in your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation in the state of Wyoming through the Ramsey education product\nWell it's one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're\nYou know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this and they're doing in their ... we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that I'm In the winter is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboys right in front of every high school student and remind them that's where they go to college because sometimes people do silly things like wander across the state line\nI've talked to a lot of probe us around the country I'm\nMy own chancellor and vice chancellor the emergence of Tennessee and it's a constant thing and then ... the state is trying to woo their own residence to their own university and it's become a saying you gotta you gotta go after it don't you\nSir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who need to know that there are opportunities even out of state that you have to be\nSmart and you have to do your due diligence in that process of searching for higher education in addition to being the lowest cost but resident tuition if a doctoral renting institution you're near the very lowest for non residents to come to Wyoming so we have a lot to offer not just here in the grave\nOr renting institution here near the very lowest for non residents to come to Wyoming so we have a lot to offer not just here in the great state of Wyoming but from coast to coast north or south\nWe can be a solution that provide students and incredible opportunity for education and we're going to be very very good at making sure that we are\nHelping a student be successful not just students success and part of that is not racking up a lot of debt at the end of their degree completion I meant so how many students on your campus we have\nWe had a little over or twelve thousand so twelve thousand a little over four hundred students here that are called himself cowboys\nNow that's a good size school that's not too big and not too
