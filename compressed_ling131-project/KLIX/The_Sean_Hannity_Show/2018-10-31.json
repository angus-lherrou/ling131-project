percent on securing the border\nAnd what I'm hearing on the ground is we have to keep\nThe prosperity going the economy going the way it is we have two point five percent unemployment rate in Iowa Sean\nAnd correcting the record with these lies and it's textbook cookie cutter messages from Nancy Pelosi across the country and that is scaring seniors regarding Social Security Medicare\nNobody's acted to cut that and then lying about their ... they're not being any protections for those with preexisting conditions and we had those protections for layers of it in our Republican health care bill\n... a lot of pent listen lying is just a part of it the playbook of the Democrats as always the same I even think it's gotten worse and I look at this this horrible terrorist attack in the shooting took place in those Pittsburgh synagogue and\nWhat does the media but I don't they're blaming Donald Trump port and meanwhile the the guy responsible for the shooting hated Trump in large part because of his\nStrong support for Israel including moving the capital to Jerusalem were blown up well it's interesting I was so what is your take I mean how are people reacting I'm I assume you're getting a fortune\nOf negative ads thrown at you and how are the people of Iowa reacting to\nOh yeah I'm getting out and about four to one for my opponent and Nancy Pelosi and the superPACs out there so it's a message versus money my opponent all her money is coming from from the east and the left the and the west coast a message over money and results right\nResults look all we have done with this economy on the national international stages well with the president when it comes to sitting down with North Korea\nHeading for denuclearization or we would help or making sure that yeah we did move that embassy from Tel Aviv Israel promises kept and being a\nShining light on the hill or were there was a lot of dark is for a long time still is for these shining brighter we lead in the world others for follow a more prosperity and peace uh you'd want to go backwards that's how important this election is right now\nThink it's a lot of things I get a vote him look I take a vote for any Democrat in any district for four hundred and thirty five house seats up for grabs his vote for below sea because your opponent will vote for Nancy Pelosi and vote with her\nI'm sure Ninety eight percent of the time just like in the Senate if you vote for any Democrat you're voting for sure um to me a lot of it is you know look at the limitation of due process presumption of innocence during the Kavanaugh hearings a look at the the agenda Democrats is it's it's out there\nThey want their crumbs back because they want the taxes the tax cuts that are putting a lot of money in the pockets of middle class Americans they want it back\nThey want to limit their eyes open borders they want to keep Obamacare and how they're running on health care is just the definition of just on that city considering they look how many there are counties I read in Iowa that had seen two hundred percent increases in their premiums\nCassidy considering they look how many there are counties I read in Iowa that is seen two hundred percent increases in their premiums people lost their doctors and plans and they have one health care option that's it one provider that's\nIt yeah and and those that are paying it are paying twenty to thirty thousand dollars a year for their premiums their deductibles are so high\nThey can't even if they just risk and don't even go to a doctor but you're exactly right my opponent we had three opportunities to distance herself from Nancy Pelosi and she said she couldn't think of a an issue where they could be separated so what's that mean she's a rubber stamp\nFor hopefully not a Speaker Pelosi but increasing taxes open borders doubling down on government run health care\nAnd of course what they've tried to keep under the rug shot and you do this and our listeners now this impeachment\nMhm now that an endless investigation but not into the deep state\nUm which of course you know we've seen massive abuses of power not rank and file FBI agents not rank and file a Justice Department and intelligence people but\nThey do their job every day but just a few abusing power at the highest levels the upper echelon well listen this is an important race it's on our\nTop thirty we have the top Seventy races if you want to go to our interactive map at ... dot com and the most important house races that will tip the balance of power six days from now and one week from today we'll be talking about those results certainly David Young Iowa's third district is one of those important races we wish you the best in this race\nWe can't take anything for granted go to David Young for Iowa dot com to volunteer and help us make sure we keep the majority thank you Sean for all you do you\nBet welcome a hope all the best to you and six days ah it's tough out there\nNobody can predict what certain say but I Will tell you they don't I just there's something about um some things not clicking with me and I never you never really have a feel for how the house is going to go up twenty ten might be an exception\nWhere I mean it was a massive landslide and you could see it coming same thing I Would argue when Bill Clinton became president Nineteen Ninety four remember Republicans had been out of power for forty years that Newt Gingrich became the speaker of the house\nAnd also if you look at history and this is what Republicans are up against that forty five retirements and a headwind of history that usually the the party in power loses a lot of seats in the first midterm rather than like in the case of Bill Clinton\nIt was Newt Gingrich in many ways Newt saving of Clinton because things got better because Newt Gingrich\nForce Clinton into what led to balance budgets and and serious reforms in Washington and I think the same thing you know if you go to a bomb I mean it was just a white powder and twenty ten\nAm specially after Obamacare and ... you know the fact that Democrats are their that's their main talking point now\nI'm this is really fascinating tell you this press means some poll out today I had to go back\nAnd double check it showing that African American support for the president has now hit an all time high of forty percent\nI mean that's a five hundred percent improvement if you go back to election day twenty sixteen when he got eight percent of the African American vote in the country in the same survey\nTrump's approval rating stay is at its highest at this point in the fifty percent plus range and I think the highest level of support for any Republican going back to at least Dwight Eisenhower if not before and and all the media likes to go after asked me to say I don't know why he's a great guy\nDwight Eisenhower if not before and\nAnd all the media likes to go after asked me so I don't know why he's a great guy in a smart poster but you know they say oh you are right wing polling operation but I Do remind you that rats me was the was the most accurate polling twenty sixteen so if that is even close to forty percent that could have\nA profound impact on the midterm elections but again it's all up to now the interesting developments as relates to the issue of the caravan\nUm and I think some people have been over the top and what they've been saying about it it's a lot of distance between here and where they started at the southern border of Mexico and uh now you have and I\nLook this is how I see most people that come into this country illegally I think that most people come here\nBecause we are a land of milk and honey hope an opportunity and the American dream\nAnd when you live in poverty and countries that have little to zero opportunity and freedom it's very appealing to come to America now we're only asking that you do it legally only asking that you respect our laws are sovereignty our borders and I'd venture a guess\nThat Ninety nine point eight percent of the people and I care of and want a better life\nAnd that they've been told that they're going to be able to get into America that's not going to happen the president's been very clear\nI'm left this meteor pushing a narrative that the thousands of of migrants and from Central America and elsewhere are fleeing violence in their homeland but in an interview with national\nPublic radio on Monday the Mexican ambassador to the U. S. describes some of the people some probably a tiny tiny percentage they declare point two percent\nOr you know less source our quarter reporting a cheap identified MS Thirteen members because of their tattoos that would give that they give away\nUm but actually the Mexican ambassador the U. S. describes some I'm sure a tiny percentage is very violent now nobody can vouch for any one person that wants to cross the border we're\nAsking that people come here legally if we had a border wall we wouldn't have a risk of thousands of people at once coming across the border the president has sent fifty two hundred troops down there\nAnd he's not going to let them in North Canton he because there'll be thousands and thousands behind them we don't have room to take it everybody we our right as a country we have sovereignty\nOr nation built on a on a constitutional republic system the rule of law and we have border laws\nAnd we asked the people respect our borders and our sovereignty and just come in legally\nAnd we have an opportunity to vet them and make sure that they are coming for the right reasons they can sustain themselves and they don't want to bring harm to our citizens that are already here I'm nearly according to one border officials telling the Washington Examiner three

the Sean Hannity show what Speaker Gingrich Harry oh\nI'm great how are you guys doing a reading book greetings from Colorado I'm I shot a Mr Speaker I actually wanted to take a minute and talk to the

any interest in voting\nWe as parents and grandparents cannot be complacent if these are adult children or grandchildren are not showing any interest in voting\nUm we need to do all we can do to educate them on the importance and the seriousness of this election and all that is at stake and Sean I've been using your talking points to convince my adult children that every single vote is important and what's at risk if they don't vote and here in our house we turn to boats into three to five\nAnd then possibly even more because our kids took the message to their friends their college classmates\nAnd some of them ended up voting as well so I'm a couple of weeks ago I spent three hours on the road driving a mail in ballots semi adult child who's a student at the University of Colorado just to make sure that that one single vote is cast and counted so\nEverybody do whatever it takes to get their vote in um offered to drive them to vote in person and pay for their overpay for FedEx to mail that absence here a mail in ballot to be two in to make sure that it gets counted and trust me the future of them will take us\nWell thanks for the call the bigger picture every oh sure every parent who's not serious\nOr you can choose to children and making sure who can understand the issues are going to be voting on it that's what that's a great state confuses me\nAppreciate the call thank you we go to Arkansas Mary Beth I'm Sean Hannity show which Speaker Gingrich how are you\nI'm great thank for taking my call what's going on her you Hi I Am a grandmother and I you know this caravan coming over what bothers me is they just let people go in and they never make their their court dates and my grandson was sent home because his inoculation a\nRecord was not brought up today did they just let these people in without any inoculations I mean why didn't the CDC or somebody gr and upset about this\nWhat will listen I I Want to be very clear 'cause I think a lot of people of um I I think that's almost been used as like a scare tactic they are people let me tell you what I think Mr Speaker see if you agree with those\nYou know I think the Ninety nine percent of people that were in a caravan they see America as the land of milk and honey and opportunity which we kind of take for granted sometimes as Americans\nAnd I'm sure that Ninety nine point eight percent of them are probably good people just want a better life um we can't vouch for any of those people in terms of other enemies of America that are mixed themselves into that group\nThe idea that we're going to have five seven fourteen thousand whatever the numbers are different estimates room everybody just get to our border and charge across\nA there is no respect for American law our constitution our sovereignty or we don't know we need to be able to vet people I Believe in a border wall with the door because uh we just want to make sure the people that come to this country can sustain themselves\nAnd secondly I Want to make sure that they're not enemies of those countries and we can let them that's all it's for the safety and security of everyone that is a citizen here\nYou know I think that's basically right and I think people feel to realize the\nDegree just short period of American relations will truly be to be extraordinary country than we are the period began um when I was on welfare state to people who came to America came to America expecting to work and we came to monitor expecting to learn English\nAnd uh I take good there's the welfare state grew in those ... grow

so\nIncredibly different than what we're enjoying right now with with President Trump\nSo it's just in my eyes are so important to get that younger voter out to vote and vote for their future\nWell I it's hard to get that through the young people to be very blunt about it and young people have a very different perspective in politics is usually not their first love uh I think uh I was a bit of an

I was a kid you know I'm not really you know employers in person Stewart [laughter] ... [laughter] and where will result\nNervous because I didn't know what you were talking about but John I talked to a couple of days before the inauguration and I don't know if you remember but I told you that you inspired me to sit in my pickup truck every night and you're like wow what kind of inspiration is that can I tell you what you inspired me to do\nWith I'd love to told me I Love inspiring people\nOkay so I ran around telling everybody that I got on your show and everybody was like were you nervous or you're afraid and and I thought no but what I realized was when we're talking about the young and how are we going to get people to tune into conservative talk radio\nI left went out to Willa to North Dakota right worked in the oil field and now in the evening I came in after scrubbing toilets I certainly on cleaning business out there I had a cleaning and catering business right yeah so\nI come in at night and I would say in my truck because that's where I could contain audio and I created the bell at the end zone show and it was created for people that don't normally listening to talk radio so the silent majority Eighteen year old rough neck sixty year old black liberals women were listening to my showing at the highlight\nOf it I had a following of like twenty thirty something thousand\nDraw also internationally as well yeah that's good for you well let me ask you this\nI'm back here in Minneapolis and it might actually go read and do the job that we need to do improve to Trump that we a hundred percent hundred and fifty percent support\nHim because it's mass of this Trump train and ... and stuff that sin Newberg has closed the gap for Clovis shower ward low is Thirteen percent higher than Allison there's some really good science here for going

like Southern California it's interesting New York New Jersey\nOr places like Minnesota Wisconsin Michigan California state you wouldn't expect that's where a lot of these tossup races that I keep talking about our um look let\nMe ask you when you move to North Dakota and you're going to do this radio show and you started your own business did you make a lot more money\nUm yeah I mean here I mean we were in such a bad recession in Minneapolis and when I moved out there I mean the excitement and all the jobs are not going to say I want to give us out to the oil fields because contradictory\n[laughter] it's been it's been my mom has spent two to one at this point are being outspent ... to wander the good news people know me that helps and so you know the lives that they tell really are putting the narrative\nBut we're all male and state every all ballots have been out for ... for a week and a half now and so every day's election day every day is election day\nI got the most left wing opponent I've ever had a you know she she woke up a day after Hillary law and decided that she needed to be a member of Congress and this march and more angry protests in Seattle and creates and the district\nAnd thinks it hating the president's somehow a qualification to be a member of Congress Sean I think we're all hoping for more than that aren't we\nDo you get it well of course we are we want to help the forgotten men and women and we have a trajectory of success or that I think has been unparalleled or as quick as any politician is Thomas stuff and then make those promises happen\n[noise] yeah it's it's it's just ridiculous that's that's essentially what she's running on and uh and so we're we've been doing everything from going door to door I think over a thousand houses personally I'm a second pair of shoes\nOr when people become make phone calls doorbell with a volunteer contribute you know Dino Rossi dot com come help\nYeah what uh what do you think you get a day by day return in terms of a Republican Democrat or do they not give that information out there\nThat we don't register by party in our state so it's only based on what we've I deed and uh and our people are\nEarlier in the ... we really got to get a meal and I doubt anybody listening to us right now you have a senator but I'll do it now get your family to do it all your friends get it in because of the sooner comes in the same or cake after list a heartless and we can get to the heart cases who may or may not for us we talked to him\nWell she's just writing running basically on hate as you said so that's the main difference she wants Obamacare let me guess she wants to impeach the president Xi wants open borders she wants to crumbs back anything else that's any different from the rest of the checklist of every other Democrat running\nFor that is a checklist we have a few other things that are that we're in the hat obviously we we're we don't have a state income tax or state she favorites that has been turned down nine times by the public here but she's she's still on that bandwagon\nOr you know and she's actually our time for a for not being a fan of Obamacare when Obamacare came in I lost their health care myself my wife and my my four children and I ended up with a lousy plan to cast two and a half times as much\nAs they can cover things I Want coverage covers I didn't want covered the twelve thousand dollar family deductible on top of that you know my goal is to have as many health insurance companies chasing people around for their disappear possibly get\nSo you can decide what's your plan or some bureaucratic politician decided for you it's called freedom\nWell listen we wish you the best Dino Rossi a that is the difference in this\nBetween Republicans and a conservative agenda or the radical left agenda Nancy Pelosi I keep reminding people vote for any Democrat anywhere in the country has a vote for her and it is because they'll electro
