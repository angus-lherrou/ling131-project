twenty third year on the Fox news channel\n[noise] well uh you know I'm I'm In a political\nThis deteriorating I think what you saw today somebody step forward to maybe say that the biggest winner of the speeches the judiciary because here's a wholesale attack on the independence of the judiciary\nOne at all costs what you saw that day was a person embracing the rule of law not the role of the mob what you saw today was a woman\nNot being intimidated what she saw today was a good man Brett Kavanaugh being save a strong woman which he saw today was everything good about the Senate good about the country and I'll have my differences with Susan Collins Collins going forward but this is as close to McCarthyism\nAlive and if anybody turned it around it was senator Collins\nOr you know senator you had a moment in this process to and and that moment came\nWhen they were going the hardest after judge Kavanaugh I don't think any of us will forget anytime soon the things that this man was accused of and and and I saw the outrage even with Susan Collins that\nRemember the accusation by Julie sweating it was that well it's almost on a weekend basis that that judge Kavanaugh and others were routinely\nDrug in girls lining up in halls gang raping numb and it happens\nFrequently and I know that some people brought up the issue of the judges temperament he addressed it in his Wall Street journal article that came out last night how was one supposed to act if you're innocent\nTo the charge of drugging teenage girls\nAnd participating in gang rapes of teenage girls I don't know what the appropriate reaction is but I Would think if you're innocent it is one of deep anger and and the frustration Eighteen days ago nobody thought any of those the judge Kavanaugh\n[noise] well yeah I think I think most Americans saw a man who was fighting for his family his reputation his life I did not do this went through a logical explanation of based on a calendar that very few people in the world Cape except him and his dad\nAnd just a wanted everybody to know this is not may you're trying to ruin my life\nI'm not evil and I I think he reacted consistently been innocent but let me tell you a pivotal moment here when the sweat Nick allegation came out\nIt was breaking news allegation number three at a very new and evil level right so I thought I read it and I said it made no sense to me from the very beginning that a person would go to one party\nOr where people were drugged and raped and go to my left hand that made no sense ... and she said this sounds bad and I said yeah\nSays and it's going to be this way for a while to come read it here's my take on it or been in the law for most of my life prosecutor defense attorney and a judge this doesn't have the ring of truth she said you know that makes sense followed anybody keep going back and putting themselves in that situation and the friends\nNot tell anybody and you've got to remember is ...\nAnd she worked through the process you took ... allegation on its own she went to all the major decisions have judge Kavanaugh and spent a lot of time talking to him and this is a ... every I think they should be in every civics class in the country every high school student should probably have to listen to senator Collins\nExplanation of why she voted the way she did and what the rule of law is all about\nYou know I Am we have an election and thirty two days\nTo me senator a look\nAt your when Senator or I I Know how close you are to Senator McCain right and who recently passed away and I I've always admired him for being a war hero and I even said I've never regretted not a day not a second supporting him for president in oh wait over Brock\nObama it was the right decision then and and I stand by the day\nI had a lot of disagreements when he came back and voted no on the health care repeal I was frustrated\nThen I remember he said that how would these people on radio and TV and you know I understood Senator McCain that's you know he kind of had that side of him and I knew it really well\nUm but he also talked in that speech to about civility I don't know if there is not consequences for what has just gone on in the last the team\nAnd on the ballot box I mean so here the consequences a party that will do anything to maintain power should probably never habits are the best thing you can do to stop this and the futures deny them their goal of having more Senate seats more house seats they won't power to bed and what it says and say\nListen I you know went through the record the allegations don't hold water in terms of him being some kind of gang rape the serial sexual predator\nHe is a very reason logical judge I looked at everything they said about him\nI compared it to the facts and I'm voting yes here's what I Want the voters to do\nOn the voters to remember what the Democratic Party will do to get power and that they're being driven by people who would assume somebody guilty simply because they don't like their judicial philosophy remember this America\nDo you really want these people in charge of your government\n[noise] [noise] well I think that's a great question you

to tell you Sean\nI grew up on a ... down in Alabama\nI grew up a born and grew up under the Jim Crow laws or remember black\nAnd white size only when I voted at Eighteen I voted for the Democratic party all those three are\nGrowing up on a plantation living under Jim Crow laws that I was actually a Democrat ever crashed All right for you to help\nFree thought they don't lie for you to take care of yourself they lie to you about the Republican Party edited especially with the a straight white conservative Christian male they're always calling them races and they use those words to brainwash you\nIn order to enslave view and the beauty of all if there is it a beauty and death about what's happening with the judge and a hatred and anger and accusations far south of gays without proof that if we have seen over the last couple of weeks a month or so even longer than that even\nTo think about the Democratic party and they're starting to realize especially in the crisis they're starting to realize maybe they are involved with Rob party and that the party the Democratic party is not like the party that they joined many many years ago and I think a lot of folks have been affected by this\nYou know see O'Brien I remember correctly where are you part of the N. double ACP for a number of years\nSean I'm a two term president at the end up on the Garland, Texas\nAnd the way you may not know and I'm I'm a life member I became a life member I was not an event in Atlanta and I it just so happens I said please the next time take politics out of a man like Clarence Thomas is an advanced ...\nAnd is exceeding at the highest level please please support him I said that when I when I pay when I paid my membership in the party or somewhere\nAbsolutely right Sean and what we're seeing now are the fake activist who are hitting the street I remember when I was president ah there and I'm going to disclose that said there were times when we would load up and buses full of activists\nBy simply giving him ten dollars and a tuna fish sandwich\nAnd a drink to get on the bus to go protest something that they had no clue what it was that they were going to protest and that's what you're saying\nOn the streets now and that is fake it is something that will not stop freedomworks the organization that I Am a with we have grass roots activist who are in the capital right now who are checking on their congressmen or senators\nTo make certain that they ride herd on this particular vote we want cabin ought to come through last week freedomworks we had two thousand people on the Capitol Grounds pushing through not only Jim Jordan who I can be the next speaker of the house\nBut also we wanted those elected officials who should be responsible to the American people for the opposite they old to make sure\nThat they go and do the job that we sent them to do it's a long way from when I was president of the N. double ACP twenty seven years ago to where I Am now and that plantation that revenue Peterson was talking about the Jesse Lee was talking about by the way Jesse leaves in my movie runaway slave or just the lead on\nWhy am I not in your movie what's up with a\n... do you and I have to make the next film together Sean we have to make the next\n... I'm just wondering why you picked Jesse you didn't pick your best friend Sean Hannity\nYou're Good Friday you got to come on the show real soon what that plantation was real I grew up in Louisiana during that same Jim Crow era it's very real but many of us have run away from it and we encourage many more at this point in time in America and the president is giving us\nAll the cupboard that's necessary to run away from that type of enslavement\nThat this nation that following up on ... you know to\nAdd to that and the beauty of what President Trump has died is that\nBecause the lack fear he's put country first he's not afraid to really deal with the people he's not afraid to use social media\nTo put the truth out there and just try to encourage a lot of men and women if those are good to stand up and speak up fight for their country fight for what is right and when they saw this attack on judge Kavanaugh his wife\nHis daughters while they're saying that they care about women they care about children we have to love and compassion for the judge and his wife his children to God I have to deal with these allegations\nIn this whole thing has to now we've got to get through the vote tomorrow and I am cautiously optimistic that judge Kavanaugh gets to be on the court that he deserves to be on what if we don't deal with the these tactics the willingness to tear down\nTroy men families kids are obviously impacted by it if if they can't even have the most simple as the civility on these issues\nYou know the American people need to see you know it get it understand it in brace what they would be voting for it's horrible you know destroying people it's horrible how many more people have to go through a Clarence Thomas judge Kavanaugh Robert Bork", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "05"}
