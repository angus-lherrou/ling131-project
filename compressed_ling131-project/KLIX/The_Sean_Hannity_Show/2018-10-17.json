like to learn more about the fact that the cake and the extent to which the Russian may have shot him out\nBut it's very dangerous when government officials with security clearances or providing um

enough call for the media are firing here\nThey have one state representative Sarah Anderson is her name and plumbing is in Minnesota campaigning Sunday saw man kicking heard yard signs a daunting her into one thing other GOP candidates and she said please stop he refused things an anarchist could do whatever they want\nSo the politician do what every red blooded American would do she tried to catch the incident on video\nAnd then the assailant was having none of that cursing at are backing or into the street and tell her to go kill yourself then walk to a nearby BP presumably to stop stock up on\nYou know whatever she does a mountain dew whatever it happens to be the go to source or whatever but Anderson gave chase in her car\nThe man charged her again leaning through the window punching her\nYou know I I mean it's unbelievable and that's fine incident came two days after another House Republican candidate Shane McClellan was punched in the face in St George township

the middle class the man we can only\nSome describe the conversation as Amy a bowl until the guy literally and invoke the hallowed name of the middle class the man we can only assume didn't wish to

stores restaurants then I wanted anywhere anymore\nAnthony Scaramucci is with us by next week he's got a great book I've been reading it I got an early copy it's phenomenal\nAnd it's called the Trump the blue collar president uh I Know that it's too early to talk about the book but you tell some amazing stories about who really Donald Trump is where he came from and and his background and you know a whole story that the media is never told about him and I learned a lot reading it how are you my front\nUm you know Sean I'm doing great but you know you're you're you're mentioning a lot of very interesting things and one thing I always remember that the president he may hit hardest Sean a buddy always hits second any often hits last I've never seen him unilaterally come after anybody it's only after they attack him\nThat he doubles down and starts to counter punch you know so Elizabeth Warren attacking him he's ignoring her and then bam Pocahontas or a Republican candidate in the primary tacky and then he fires off the nickname\nWas sort of the point being is that like he is actually a very civil guy until you start shooting at him then once you start shooting at him he's gonna hit you were ... or ...\nI just said is a very important distinction between what's going on between the Democrats\nLet me tell you you know I mean it's so funny because I remember a conversation once I had with the president and and you were at the White House for a pretty short period of time and he he talked about you which is very interesting to me and he talked about well this Harvard Anthony and then there's the kid in the street heads\nAnd a and I know both I mean\nYou know you know he held at me he yelled at me after the curse and you've got to remember like\nThe the guy Ryan Lizz have legs are total liar she basically faded me into the call but then he was asking me to do a profile with them and then that's when I have responded with the expert but you know what\nThat is what it is but but what the the president yelled at me he said hey man I Need less street Anthony I Need more Harvard Anthony but you know what John what makes you grade on the radio and and uh and the reason why we're so close to that we both have a little bit of that and I only when you were busing\nOr when I was just washing dishes bussing tables I was a cook yeah that's right but you know something a little bit and I wouldn't trade that experience in life for anything or the years I spent in construction which was two decades of my life\nAnd I don't know I mean I I I think a lot of us and that are blessed and lucky and successful I met too many people that forget where they come from and I'm not going to forget where I came from and I'm just style and so it's not in ...\nThat's the point though that's the point in the books on I really do try to explain\nThat your story or my story is a classical American story a while where we were in these aspirational working class families and our parents wanted us to do better and they were fully bought into as where our grandparents\nInto the American dream and so uh what the president is trying to do what you try to do every day what I tried to do in my small way to see if we can make that happen for people\nThat were similarly situated or currently similar similarly situated the way we were in the Nineteen sixties and seventies growing up and so that's one of the reasons why despite getting far from the White House I never broke ranks of never broke my loyalty from the president because I really do believe this horse\nReasons why despite getting far from the White House I never broke ranks of never broke my loyalty from the president because I really do believe his heart's in the right place and I really believe that uh you know she is the right\nWay without televised in line the proof is in the party I mean when when you go to Robert ... eight years adding Thirteen million more Americans to food stamps eight million more in poverty\nYou can't get three they only president never to get three percent GDP Growth\nThe worst recovery since the forties and all of a sudden we got four point two percent for the second quarter of the GDP Growth projections are way over four percent for the third quarter you know that we have four million more Americans working eight million out of all for food stamps and out of poverty\nI'm thinking okay finally the forgotten men and women are the young Scaramucci's Hannity's are now doing better why ... why would we want to stop that\nI you know not not and I agree and it's going to get better because he's continuing to de layer the process of regulation\nOr he's continuing to find ways to incentivize corporations large and small to move their money back on shore of the United states I Know you talk a lot of that uh the re engineered now after the U.S MCA now uh Shaun I'd gone through that you know I'm trained as an economist and I'm running an eleven and a half billion dollars on that I found it\nA that is going to have monumental positive benefits to middle and lower middle class families the re engineering of that trade agreement because it's just the configuration of the cars just the uh the\nManufacturing points and the price on ... uh that's been agreed to in those agreements is going to need more disposable income for working

clothes that's like the Clintons deducting they're used the underwear as a s that's all true they did it as a tax deduction by the way I don't think anybody wants their old underwear\nAnd they put a value to it you know I've always said this Jeff that basically liberals are generous only with other people's money that we had the latest numbers from twenty sixteen come out and the bottom fifty percent of taxpayers in this country they ought to pay three percent of the bill just three we have\nRedistribution ten percent pay forty percent of the bill you know I mean so I mean I don't know

her rhetoric actually is dangerous in when Republicans wanted to fix health care make it actually affordable about a year ago she was the one that said the Republicans want blood money from the American\nPeople know this is right after congressman ... had been shot by that Bernie Sanders supporters so you know she really doesn't seem to be able to temper her rhetoric whatsoever and I think if you saw on Monday after\nThe backlash of putting that video out a and she got a lot of backlash around the country including Democrats like David ... even as critical uh she went on a twenty six I Believe tweet a rant about Donald Trump just obsessed with Donald Trump and has no focus\nAt whatsoever on Massachusetts and what's important here whereas you know I've been a legislator here for eight years I'd actually put ... billion dollars in tax cuts back in people's pockets and they know it and\nWe've been campaigning pretty strongly I think that again you're going to be pleasantly surprised in November sex with what happens\nIs that I Hope so are you may not notice about my background but I live five years in Rhode Island\nAh in Warren Rhode Island not far from the ... borders with Massachusetts and you know it's been a lot of time to sit by the way when it was the greatest NBA time in history with magic versus Larry Bird and\nAnd parish McHale and DJ and Danny Ainge I mean was probably one of the best teams in one of the best rivalries ever in sports I'm ... annual hall then up by bend the post and lots of beautiful city but I Will tell you that you know if the people of Massachusetts don't see through those I don't know what to tell them\nWhat looks to grow in the former quarterback probably around the time you were there is a enjoy my race to Curt Schilling is indoors but most importantly\nAnyway rarely home already he needs to indoors you [laughter] and we need to get that ...\nIs the most hated man except for New England he's the most hated man in football number one because he's a phenomenal football player and they just don't like the fact that he wins that much and they don't like the fact that they as you know a pretty wide who used to be a model they just hate import\nPrices will look at you know showing a lot has changed since you've been here unemployment now at the lowest we've seen in New England and Massachusetts\nSince Nineteen sixty nine that's that's for the whole country the Massachusetts\nIs even lower it said three point five percent right now or he wants to repeal the tax cuts of two thousand Seventeen that have given our state's more money as far as new jobs wage increases our states collected over one point two billion dollars in unanticipated revenue because of that she called the crumbs just like\nA Nancy Pelosi and she if she had her way would undo that\nAnd raise your taxes I think she said fifty percent with either baselines and she's not sure if she had Ninety percent might be too much when she was on ah MSNBC a\nFew weeks ago Ninety percent maybe too much but at least fifty percent and then of course she wants to make it fully government run health care which as we know has a thirty two point six trillion dollar\nPrice tag attached to it and of course that puts a bureaucrat between you and your doctor or if you like government run health care that you love having\nA you know to wait for a hip replacement Canadians do or dialysis like uh people\nI think so many Canadians come to the United states when they need heart surgery because they get better care that they're willing to pay for here that's why\nRight government has to ration health care if they take it over and by the way there is no incentive to drive down costs ones government becomes the guaranteed pay or just like student loans you know it was about foreign complains about the cost of college course she charged three hundred and fifty thousand dollars to teach one course at Harvard or but you know the fact\nIs when government becomes the ... of the loans or whether it's a student defaults or not doesn't matter those\nColleges get their money and so they drive the costs\nGovernment gets involved and takes the free market out of it as competitiveness and that's when costs become completely out of control for us the average Americans\nWell I Wish you the best in this race and I hope our friends of Massachusetts in Boston and everywhere in between ... pay attention to\nYou know the big lie of Elizabeth Warren and understand what a real true ambitions are here for her to become president you got to re elect her and Jeff deal is offering a better economic vision and better security for the people of Massachusetts and I wish you willing eraser\nThanks Sean if people want to get involved it's

midterms or do you think about getting a Trump to address to the Chevy televised address that way the fake news can't block anything showing all of his accomplishments on TV\nI Love I Love the idea I'll tell you what would happen is the media will uncover the media now\nThey're they're trying to blackout all of the Trump literally put a ban on all the Trump or rallies that are going on and by the way they do it to their own detriment because people want to watch them now I mean ... is Ron Ron none of them we can't you know run every single one\nUh but uh I I Will tell you that that's pretty popular TV for a lot of people and there's a lot of fun and I think you know the fact that he's talking about positive results and that we're better off than we were two years ago it's a pretty
