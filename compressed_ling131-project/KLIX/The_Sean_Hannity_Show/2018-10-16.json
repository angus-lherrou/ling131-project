stormy loses in court or cases thrown out she has to pay legal fees but Donald Trump and you don't hear a word about it\nA first we're going to get into the issue of health care how bad has Obamacare which Democrats want to keep\nHow bad as it banned and what is the alternative\nIn terms of a solution will get to all of that listen to all of us here on the Sean Hannity show we love the dollar shave club dot com\nSlash Hannity and you don't pay to be a member but it has everything you need everything I Need to look feels smell my best your best and when I Love even more is the fact you know what I I I hate going to stores I really do especially you try and buy a razor and it's like a you know an an act\nOf Fort Knox for crying out loud to find somebody with the right key to open up the shaver box that they have half the time dollar shave club will deliver everything you knew your door\nThe executive blade is far superior to any blade you'll ever buy in any store amber and it's about a third of the price delivered to your house they've got everything you need doesn't matter what you're getting ready for your hair they cover you had to tell your skin your face you name it they have a doctor Carver shave butter\nBut it shows up right at your front door you only pay for what you order they even now have toothpaste and toothbrushes and then you order what you want and you know you pay less and it's a better product and you have the convenience of never going to store again you can try one of those starter kits no obligation like their oral care kid or you can read\nWho choose not to elect to pay for what your neighbor needs it was one big redistribution scheme now if you deal with direct primary care direct access to doctors and we've talked about health savings accounts and we've also talked about\nAtlas MD Dr Josh amber and Dr Lee s gross this model now has been duplicated around the country and what happens is there's no pre existing conditions prejudice at all if you can afford a cell phone you can pretty much afford a a direct\nAccess to your doctor no insurance no problem you pay for what you need fifty dollars a month for an adult ten dollars a month per child they negotiate directly with the pharmaceuticals so they have Ninety to Ninety five percent reduction if you have high blood pressure if you have a cholesterol problem you walk out of the doctor's office with the medicine\nAddict greatly reduced rate than you'd ever pay at any drug store it's actually it's now been implemented in his working in over five hundred practices around the country it was pioneered by my friend Dr Josh ... joins us now atlas empty and Dr Lee as gross president of doctors were patient care\nI'm I Am I pretty much explaining it right is there anything I'm missing and I would call this concierge care for every American\nI the only problem is Sean every time you talk about it our phones will start bringing and we've got regular patients to tell you have a lot of them too right we have a you know a A R over and over there and yeah we're fulltime families additions but no you nailed it [noise]\nI mean so and you have all these pace now the bottom line is I think most people like me and I have friends\nVisions but no you nailed it\nWell I mean so and you have all these ... now the bottom line is I think most people like me\nAnd I have friends of mine that are doctors or you know and friends of mine that will take care of me friends of mine that will take a call at three AM if I'm not feeling well or which has happened it occasionally in my life\nAnd these guys you know I ... I mean I pay them and they take my insurance does but they do it as a more of a friendship but this is something every American can have access to\nAbsolutely\nYeah and ... plain how you're making it work there and how it works for your team exactly\nUh you know I think this is like a lot of things um Silicon Valley style or Netflix or Amazon Prime uh people are being be over there they want a better product faster cheaper easier and and that's what Dr gross and I have done with our respective clinics\nIs just decrease the paperwork that headache the hassle of the middle man so that now medicines are pity pill now you can call ticks email your doctor now health care with your own private doctors cheaper than a cell phone\nI said this is now they implement how many places did you get this finally up and running around the country I don't think you're explaining detail enough here explain exactly what this service does and how this can be implemented for every American\nSure there's over a thousand doctors doing the direct care model across the country and\nIt's a flat membership rate based on age it's insurance free for unlimited home visits work visits offices it's free tale of medicine so you can call tax email your doctor we have no co pay for anything any procedure we can do it in the office is free of charge\nStitches biopsies joined injections ultrasound heart monitors lung monitors um and then wholesale medications in labs for up to Ninety five percent savings\nI mean this is a grassroots movement and patients just need to get out and let their doctors know that this is a better way to get health care and they support it and and that's why I think we've seen this gross so much in the last several years\nAnd then what's missing is the fact that it can be duplicated now I don't know the exact complications that might exist in say a big city like New York city you know nine million people or Los Angeles and San Francisco but in small towns and smaller cities it is working Dr gross that's the point\nYet it's working everyone I think you know people really need to understand is that you know this is not a decision between you know\nThe Affordable CARE Act I mean we want to go down there to try to take us on the path of socialized total government controlled health care you know at a time where people are able to choose their health care decision was based upon their individual DNA or going to take a one size fits all approach to health care it doesn't make any sense and\nYou know Democrats don't want their healthcare chosen by Donald Trump any more than Republicans Wachter healthcare chosen by Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi so you know why are we inserting the politicians into health care with it but the government control health care system when you can have a better way through a direct primary care relationship\nNot we leave this is the failure of Obamacare you spend billions and billions more\nAnd you get part in theory or care because it never really was about the patient really was always about\nRedistribution of wealth and you know I can go over like I did yesterday all the top not we already have redistribution of wealth in America you have the top three percent of taxpayers paying the majority of income one percent pays almost forty percent the top fifty percent of wage earners\nPay Ninety seven percent so what they've tried to do is ... ... for example they forced the young and generally healthy American\nAnd that they didn't need and couldn't afford and then penalize them if they didn't get the plan when they would have been better off paying from one check up a year right out of their own pocket\nAnd also getting a catastrophic plan if God Forbid they had the accident or got cancer are at a young age which rarely happens had a heart attack right Dr amber\nYep this is a one size fits all model um it's too expensive for young healthy people and it doesn't provide the service that older adults need in an affordable timely way and so we need to streamline the whole system the problem is that politicians have always tried to\nEnsure everything but now we're to the point of ensuring you medicines that cost a penny a pill I can get a thousand ... blood pressure medicine for four dollars and Ninety cents so the big box retailers will show you Ninety pills for ten dollars is highway robbery we\nKnew cancer or for for six dollars a month in some cases\nThe fact is now we just need less insurance that means health insurance is can compete on quality and and lower the price just like your Fifteen minutes we'll save your Fifteen Percent on car insurance we need to get back\nTo a competitive model for the patients are in control and cares affordable and insurance is just for the big stuff but the rare stuff\nAnd where are you with Congress though in other words these are solutions no insurance no bureaucrats you know doctors being able to do what they do they are the innovators in this upfront pricing lower costs no government mentally All right well that's true\nHow do you get Congress how many people are in Congress that are supporting your model I Know for example Rand Paul and I think Lindsey Graham or two people say well block grant the money and then let the states determine how to do it themselves which would that would I think open a path for people like you to expand I didn't even greater level\nHealth care's local I mean that's the important thing you know the health care should be between you and your doctors and one thing that's clear is a calorie is not coming from Washington to say now if we wait for ... from Washington it's not coming we need doctors and patients to get the other fix this problem themselves\nAnd that's exactly what this loop and the movement does is it eliminates any it asking for permission from from Washington to take care of our patients yeah\nWell look I Hope that these people in Washington and here you but it's it is interesting that the one look every American worried about their health care rightly so every American has been burned by broken promises you know in the fact that the Democrats have this perception that somehow they're the great\nThe great solution the healthcare after the Obamacare debacle is laughable to me but unfortunately with voters three weeks out of an election that's how some of them feel as I read these polls\nSo uh anyway I really appreciate both of you being with us Dr Josh ... grows the probably one of the defining issues that caused people make people think that Democrats are actually going to help them and it's not a we appreciate your time eight hundred nine four one shown as a toll free telephone number\nIf you want to be a part of the program I Will take

you I think the fact that you're you've had two things the fact that they have no agenda is part of it the second thing is is that they're catering to a mob mentality and we saw that in the cabin on

I'd always gotten ... from the beginning I'm kind of it these are street fighter um but I think what especially during the Kavanaugh hearings with Julie sweating egg\nI mean it was was pretty outrageous 'cause she was claiming almost on a weekend basis you know that Brett Kavanaugh was that these parties and they were drug in these young girls need boys were lining up in the hall and and gang raping these girls as a matter of adult almost a weekly thing\nDidn't have it on his ... if I Would pick a fairly smart guy right\nAnd and to listen to that story and say I'm going to go to that with this I'm going to say that a girl who was two three years removed from high school repeatedly went back to parties were gang rapes were going on she knew they were going on and she's still kept going back and oh I won't be able to actually find anybody\nThat can corroborate the stories at least no one can independently find anybody\nThat was list I think NBC was saying yeah we tried to find the for people that Julie sweating except we're at those parties one's dead or to wouldn't returned our calls at one didn't know who actually sweating to watch so now Democrats who used to hell ... and the media obviously and others around with everybody that hunting on it\nBut in the process they gave up any semblance of core values that everyone believes it and that's due process and the presumption of innocence that's where they lost that\nAnd opening up bad Warren building pipelines and saving the coal industry those are saving jobs so you know the ... look it's I'm I'm just telling everybody three weeks from tonight you're going to turn on your TV set and you're going to watch the coverage\nAnd you're either going to be you know maybe it maybe it'll be a mixed bag maybe the Republicans gained a couple seats in the Senate when\nMaybe they lose the house you lose the house then all you're going to see for two years is never ending non stop obsessive compulsive Trump paint and investigations and possible impeachment\nThat's the agenda that's it there's nothing to improve the lives of the American people ... you know there's a lot of states\n[noise] the Democrats rely on people of low information they rely on propaganda and putting things out there and can be used in people that's the way it is\nA let me tell you what it is that they got one play book they're the party of smear slander mismanagement\nRacist sexist massage in is seeing a phobic homophobic Islamophobia dirty air water kill children skill grandma it's the same playbook it's never changed on Thirty years in radio it's never gonna change\nWhen they did get power for eight years with Obama you saw what they did with it it didn't improve the lives of anybody\nIt left many Americans behind the worst of the economy in modern times was Brock Obama's so you know it's amazing that they don't want to talk about well the the tax cuts I'm working now they want the crumbs back\nAnd do well healthcare never worked out for anybody but they want to keep it they haven't made a ... but are there focuses the hate Trump investigating Trump nonstop All right um but I got on the other side of I'll be blunt\nYou know if three weeks from tomorrow it come on the air and say well you know we're going to be stuck with dancing policy you didn't get out you didn't vote\nYou know we'll we'll survive it will fight we're not going to stop but\nIt would be so much better and so much easier for all of us and especially the forgotten men and women they're just getting a foothold now in terms of jobs and opportunities for themselves and their families you know it's going to be you know a battle\nEvery day non-stop accusations non stop fighting\nHad that for two years since Trump for president that's supposedly coming to an end\nAn stop accusations non stop fighting we've had that for two years since Trump for president that's supposedly coming to an end but we'll just pick up and we'll fight back that's what we do you don't give up you know given you just stay on it you know you have to win these political battles matter\nYou get the government ultimately you deserve America\nDeserves better than what the Democratic Party is offering but that's going to be up to you my vote here in New York's was meaningless in this whole case just not going to help I Can't help you in this election\nUm except tell you the truth I'm telling you the truth and I'm saying all of these races are infinitely winnable right now there's ... there's been a change Democrats\nHave overreached they've they miscalculated\nAnd the American people are good fair minded people they're figuring this out pretty quick they watch the judge Kavanaugh\nThey see these mobs they hear these you know these incitement this these marching orders if you will by radicals that are Congress men and women and senators and let's get to Don and Detroit's why John James is like the greatest candidate\nHe doesn't he's doing better in the polls he's down in single digits I I Wish the people of Michigan gets the outbreak this guy is it'd be ... he's that's a long shot for us but wow he'd be amazing\nIt is a long shot for us Sean thanks for taking my call that I'd rather have it at all campaign like your enthusiasm away this man deserves a\nVote oh no no not at all where we're going to the this'll be one of my first campaign rallies or Senate ah for a Senate um killed it a long time it's going to have kid rock there is going to have 'em\nDonald Trump junior and Kimberly guilt while there tomorrow night is that going tomorrow night where I'm On the Michigan from six tonight I I don't remember exactly the venue but people can look it up at John Jay ... Senate dot com\nLet me tell you something that this man is beyond impressive he has all these\nLeaders in the army at the same at the same time as him that he provided air cover for me I was a flight medic provided a lot of air cover for me when I was there is an awesome awesome awesome man yeah well\nI you know I look at his background and his experience and he just you know some people just have it whatever it is they ... habit they own it and um I I just think he's a natural leader and I hope the people millions pay attention to him\n... Kevin McCarthy and Paul Ryan a couple of weeks ago came out they they\nDangle this care in front of us and they've done it every year every two years the thing was carried out in front of us called ... border security and that they'll fund the entire wall\nRight only if they went in two thousand Eighteen we had a fight where we were bloodied whenever we attended a Trump rally we were bloodied up\nAnd the reason Donald Trump was elected one of the big reasons was because he was going to build the wall the reason he won the election was because he said he was going to build the wall the reason we maintain\nThe majority in Congress for the past eight years and especially in two thousand sixteen was because the Republicans were finally going to find the wall and when Kevin McCarthy came out who I have a lot of respect for came out a couple of weeks ago and Dingell that carrot in front of the voters faces\nI was screaming at my TV saying you've had the opportunity to present Donald Trump with no less than three spending bills and neither of those bills get it have any appropriations for a border wall\n... why you have had the majority in Congress for eight years he won an election not two thousand Fifteen\nFor building a border wall\nThey act like they're losers they don't know how to they don't know how to act like\nDo but he has been more critical than me I mean I I Know I have a news the ad\nThey act like they're losers they don't know how to they don't know how to act like they will say oh but he's been more critical than me I mean I I Know I have a news\nThe adjectives spineless gutless needing a backup bone hey look at this point it's too important we've actually gotten a real lot done the president what he's done in terms of ISIS degrading and and the feeding them at a level nobody anticipated\nNorth Korea everybody thought we were headed for real tragedy there and you know which sole thirty million people their lives at risk no more rockets being fired over Japan were not dropping pallets of cash cargo planes of cash and other currency to Iranian mall as\nA as we see what's happening on the economic front for point two percent GDP\nWe we watched an economy go from losing jobs to creating four million plus jobs at this time eight million fewer Americans in poverty and on fat and food stamps\nI'm we see the pipelines are being built and more is opened up um we spent three billion three and a half billion on the new law we need the full funding you're right the twenty five million\nA but we're making progress to original is on the Supreme Court great judges on the lower courts\nAnd I I just see in America that's transforming before our eyes based on every measure consumer confidence everything in between uh yeah I Wish they would have worked faster\nThey would have kept their promises better there's still a lot of work to do but the alternative is nonexistent there is no alternative if you vote for a Democrat you're voting for Nancy Pelosi in the house bill for a Democrat for the Senate voting for Chuck Schumer\nUm that's it if you you know if you save the house and Senate we can get a lot done we get these additional seats in Indiana North Dakota Montana if we you know hold in Nevada and we pick up with Martha mix Sally in Arizona I mean and we Claire McCaskill gets sent packing\nAnd Rick Scott wins in Florida it'll be amazing holding the house\nIs key if it even if you don't particularly love your Republican congressmen it's not going to be an impeachment investigation vote that the Democrat is offering you so for that reason alone I mean it's important to me\nWill survive it I'm not saying we wouldn't not going to come on here the day after election day whining complain I'm going to just dig my hills in and do what I always do after elections and fight for what I Believe in\nWhat we see so much easier if we just did it on election day anyway I appreciate your call I'm Dana\nIs in
