I'm looking for is dependability and how much life is left and it was a cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin how are you\nSure what's up I'm Seventeen years ago and I cook a senior I've got about three thousand dollars and like I mean the count out donating shut eye in that I knew what China and you're going to college yeah\nAnd that olive tree okay she only got two years and years and then ending on how the program ... maybe ... served five of the Caribbean I keep a community college of either and you know or course now you know\nI Will be true if you get some search someone certifications and stuff and I have a four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that\nOkay so that's what you want to do you won't be programmer or you want to be an hour or whatever mhm okay uh and the community college is paid for as long as you keep an eye plus um you can invest it ah\nHere's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm\nI'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am more than you have an investment a mutual fund like on a scale of one to ten and a nine point nine finish college and all your education was the road that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money\nTo finish your schooling and that's much much you dust and as a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\n... field of study that you can you know really make some good money and and the\nYou know getting that level of education is really going to cause your income to go be a lot a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so um\nYou know you're the best investment we can make much better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds and I you know maybe I'll talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement account at this stage uh with this amount of money in your situation because again my\nMain goal for you is your friend is for you to get your degree\nIn your field of study whether it's a two year where the certifications in the tech field or or whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools in your belt the educational tools in your belt for you to be able to live your dream without any that and that three thousand dollar spent on\nIs more important than but then the mutual fund so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out and use it for college if you're going to go that route [noise] if you need to thanks for calling open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago and Mike how are you\nOn Gray Davis it's an honor to speak with you you too sir what's up in your world\nFilm my wife and I are currently on baby step forward in time for retirement and we're using the excess in our budget to pay off our mortgage early and we're both teachers and the state run pension take nine percent of our gross take all of our dilemma is when we have an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that and I felt that we already contribute\nWe don't have much left over from August of coloration so when we save the thicker than we're able to save a lot for a mortgage to tell ration or is it okay to do that oil recommend saving their twenty four\nPercent now they they mandatory amount that you're putting in are you ... are you vested in that as a a ... choosing an investment for that or is a pension\nGet the answer is no options yeah it's it's mandatory its pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you collect I have to wait till I'm sixty seven uh okay uh innocent nine percent nine percent\nOkay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct correct okay I probably would split the difference because I don't like the pension we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you\nBecause I don't like the pinch and we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run through it's probably run state and now we're better than all those guys [laughter]\nOh yeah no thank you so\nBut what I count some of it yeah ... some of it\nI'm not going to count it as a whole new line what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we can all of those are for then that means we need to put it in ten percent right you got a million that\nYou don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it\nI don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some odd but I mean like Louie it as I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension in Illinois it's just horribly wrong and if it was ever going to fail anywhere be there you know so um that that that's the truth and you know that show a given\nThat let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit or so and goes round numbers let's put it in ten percent instead of putting in Fifteen Percent on top or something like that and I are celebrate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but it's you know a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction show um\n[noise] um\nYou know go do it that that's

past couple of years okay if you um\nI mean it it's a matter of choice for you I I personally wouldn't put my kid into bed I Would rather pay get them through school debt free and then work on the rental ... is there a reason they plan doesn't sound good\nNo it it does but I just I guess I just needed to hear a because he's got two younger brothers that are going to be going to college tutor lectured years\nWell ... maybe ... for five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement fathers kids' college what you want or cash flowing in this case and ah the Sixers payoffs mortgages how are you know rentals in the house and so forth a but really um\nYou know in your case you're going to really is you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a censure borrowing on student loan debt to pay on your mortgage is\nWhich is stupid in an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo I just think a lot of our consumer debt we should go save up a a three maybe four month emergency fund that land yep\nAnd then and then I stopped taking Austin\nSame with the other day and then but if you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids if there is money above that then we started throwing it at your either your mortgage or your rentals one or two but it sounded like a rentals are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece or not huge but they're they're still there\nIn houses time then and then there has been with your house mortgage must be small\nIt's about about fifty sixty Seventy thousand a piece okay a\nFifty 'cause you said to Fifteen\nYeah yeah and for what is the only one of the only twenty five dollars and I like them a check like a year from now allows a feel good and my son is still either take out a loan\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental okay I knew there was one in there somewhere to make that amount of work I uh yeah still I'm just going to play along on those minimums and take your college without that first\nOnce we got college without that then we find money we throw it at the at the public will knock out a little twenty five one out and then among next knock my house out 'cause it's pretty even with the other ones\nAnd then how about getting back in the four oh one K. or not\nBut I get back in the four one K. a Fifteen Percent now\nNow okay yeah well no says you get your emergency fund right yeah emergency fund this baby step three and then by bishops floors Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement\nThen we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it at the rentals in the house that's your order of attack maybe steps four five six in order actually three four five six 'cause you're finishing up the emergency phone in order right\nBut it's not like about four or five and six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent\nWere taking care of college and then if there's money left we keep going down the list in the next thing on the list is mortgages ... is that there's so there's still a power is Asian even though it simultaneously that logical\nYeah I guess I'll just trying to jump ahead that for ... for two and three I guess technically years given five are skipping five I mean\nYeah yeah yeah and you had any skip three to yeah [laughter] yeah so what are the ways in which you're back in order that's all we did you can do it good plan man thanks for calling in a lease is with us in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Hi Lisa how are you\nHi Mr ... the it's an honor\nTo talk to you how can I don't quite often for you [laughter] okay\nUm we had our house currently on the market right now the listed it in July for two teams [noise] um [noise] I Know there is not an ill in our area [noise] um we just lowered it down to one Ninety nine nine [noise]\nWe've had only one going we've had hundreds of heads on line [noise] um [noise] who are struggling with here we paid one fifty for the house\nThe average stays on the market in my area as three hundred and sixty nine good\nLord what does rural area\nWell it sort of a weird situation it's well I'm Pennsylvania we have like an elite area about Fifteen miles from us and those houses are selling for about a half a million [noise] um and then ... and set out to the Haitian because it's on lake we're\nOn water on a on a dream but I'm a military than at our house is kind of out of the local market so we're waiting on a vacation\nOr you know you're not in higher in Harrisburg proper then no no I'm In like northeast yesterday a near up near New York border but so your biggest problem is you have a very limited market yes or\nA dummy three sixty nine days on the market is unbelievably long in this current environment that we're in\nThis is you're in a very rural setting\nUm and it's not true resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff right and you just have a limited market I don't know what to tell your other than a is there anyone in the\nResort area if you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe or is or is there is a a a realtor up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that usually there are signs\nEverywhere the kind of specializes in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want to quite pony up for that area but one of the house stepped down they knew you were there\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our relatives are that are not not purchasing\nI'm Talking about your the real estate agent in that area is or someone who dominates resort area\n[noise] the higher end stuff\nUm [noise] not really honestly I mean we kind of stepped out through our nearest town they get a kind of a high ... I mean we had a professional photographer [noise] it look gorgeous\nOn line it's not you know these rural it's kind of like everybody's second job [noise] so why are you moving [noise]\nWell you need to get it or we have an hour drive to work we can't can't do it anymore you know okay three kids you know well number four hours a day and my husband didn't know how how significant like we just say oh well\nI don't think I don't think prices your problem of\nAh you got a marketing problem you know what I mean by looking at they're looking at it on line there's workers or not they're not clients are lurking they just like the picture flip through them and their allies where it was I walked away they were not client's location Gillum was not the house and it was not surprised\nBecause our neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor um same set up as ours his own for one eighty nine half the size of our house but double the law you know\nBut a pound a buyer for us to I mean you just don't have any potential buyers much and that's what I'm trying to do is fix the marketing side of this this is a this is a really tough one\nI mean do I pick another real yes\nAnd that's what I was trying to get you to do to go up there and look at the resort area who's moving those half million dollar houses that when someone going to look at that ... million dollar house and it says gulp I really can't afford it but I Love this area they go oh I got this place down there in the fringe at under two hundred and it's the sweetest little house and you got to see it\nAnd that's who your sexual yourself after your realtor is\nThe person that can do that this that the people that are gathering the leads in the upper area and they can some of them down the you know the people that don't want to spend enough to be in the other area\nAnd that's your best shot you just need more potential buyers you and that a good potential buyers\nAnd it's probably not your real first of all they probably just don't want this area\nA central Meyer stores you need it it's a very unique\n... situation\nThis is the day Ramsey show\nIdentity theft has become an epidemic data breaches are being recorded every day and hundreds of millions of people have had their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy now I've seen firsthand when people are stressed\nAnd freaked out when they

payment on [noise]\nUm in fact now I Need to start on my ... got some collection which was about seven thousand dollars mhm [noise] and I've already received a lot of like settlements in the mail mhm last like I had a federal king hundred dollar a barrel that they're there\nFor me to take seven hundred for a friend of mine was telling me that that thousand dollars that were given mhm that I have to pay taxes on that like the end of the year and I was just wondering if you click true\nThat is true definitely given us except on a mortgage on your home is a taxable income and they likely will send you a ten Ninety nine for the amount that day for gays oh\nSo what's your household income\n[noise] um [noise] it it's very very ... about how about forty five thousand is here\nOkay let's say let's say you're a ... percent tax bracket as an example okay let's pretend if you were in a twenty percent tax bracket and you had a thousand dollars in forgiveness\nBracket as an example okay let's pretend if you were in a twenty percent tax bracket and you had a thousand dollars in forgiveness that didn't cost you a thousand dollars and only costs you two hundred dollars\nRight and I still a good deal\nBut your yeah your I have about two hundred dollars per thousand for that is forgiven that'll hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you if they don't\nYou have no obligation to list it and I would just wait until you know they do that as I follow through on that but in the larger the forgiveness is the more likely they will follow through with a ten Ninety\nNine and send you that but as you get that then you will do the taxes so yeah I'd I'd get ready for some taxes at tax time\nThat I'm by April ... you know that you may have and in addition to that now if you had a large return coming because you're over withholding\nWell then in that case so you're just going to lower your return because you need to change your withholding anyway so good question thank you for joining U.S
