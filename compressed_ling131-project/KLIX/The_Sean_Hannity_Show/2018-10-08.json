owners or managers can you share examples of some of these initiatives\nBusinesses or expanding leave and benefit policies to include elder care and offering flexibility to address things such as child care and transportation also wages are increasing as well including raises in sign on bonuses\nSo it really sounds like a job seekers market right now what else can you share\nCompanies are

Chinese Chinese re militarization of the end of their mom administrators and just one metric take take politics out of it for a second we had sixty five million refugees in the world that's more than we had\nAt the end of World War two\nTrip the world is the most dangerous place now that's over thanks to Donald Trump now we have a commander in chief who believes that evil exists read his wall so speech listen to what he says about ISIS about what the Chinese are doing what he said at the un\nLine yes absolutely absolutely so that's why I wrote why we fight but but you're absolutely correct we have domestic issues here even exist not just outside of our borders look what they did to that godly man Brett Kavanaugh in the last fourteen days a man who\nHad the probably the cleanest most spotless record\nIn an American public life goes from being a stand up standing federal judge to amass rapist they will use every tool because they lost the election and that's why the next thirty days are so important showing\nIt means ah everything and then look everything's riding on this I don't know if you want to ask me three weeks ago I Would have leaned in on the side that history would would win out because the party that wins the White House\nUsually ends up losing seats in a midterm election they totally not happened three times only only picked up seats three times in the last hundred years the last was after two thousand and one an attack by a number eleven September eleventh\nUm but there's so much at stake here and that\nIs what ... literally jumps off the page as I'm reading through your book that we better defeat America's enemies and we'd better do without apologies the tactic orca we don't get to do that if we're not in power right\nWe we have to take very seriously this concept of the left so the left has been taken over by the radicals thinking about the fight but JFK would not be allowed into the Democrat Party today a hardcore anti communist stronger national security he wouldn't be allowed into the DNC what do we have\nWe have the crazies we have the that Ocasio Cortez is we have the Maxine Waters in control who have made a pact with the devil may have said very simply the ends justify the means we want power and we will use any tool well guess who used our philosophy in the past about philosophy drives to the labor\nCamps to drive to the ... and Dr death camps whether you are right wing extremist whether you're a fascist or whether you're a communist vast the philosophy and we've got to stop that shall we have to stay true to the principles of the republic\nYou talk it in a book about the a will to win and and again the title why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies and here's what we can't have any more and you talk about the will to when you talk about will\nIs if you go back to Vietnam we lost fifty eight thousand brave Americans and we allow that war to become politicized yes and we pulled out you know in Iraq and Afghanistan we pull\nOut leaving it dates of our withdrawal and we lost nearly six thousand kids in the end so many others come back without their arms and legs in their in their faces his figured\nFighting for their country we cannot commit American troops ever again\nUnless we are willing to win the war if we're not willing to do what it takes to win the war than we are not get involved ever period unless we have to have to win these wars or else don't start to be involved in them\nSo my book is about two things is about all the threats we face as a country so whether it's ISIS Russia or China but the second part is much more important is is the one who hitting on\nIt do we have the will to defeat our enemies because Vietnam is a great example we were the most powerful nation in the world and a bunch of guys with the wooden sticks and Ross the rifles defeat us how's that possible because we lost the war at home because we allow the left\nAnd at one of the most important things is the individual real to win in addition to the malice Caesar the threats I have full vignettes of American heroes I go back to the Bobby was two hundred years ago I talk about uh Korea hero a trustee pulled her I talk about a man\nWho spent six and a half years as a naval aviator in the Hanoi Hilton but the last story is very\nVery important for what we are seeing right now and it's wicked chambers most kids have no idea who would occur James is this is a man who was cabin old before Kavanaugh was born in Nineteen forty eight the first live televised Senate hearing\nWas the man who would occur chambers who have been a communist agent of the Soviets who went\nOn record saying hey I no longer communist but I Need America to know where the communist oh\nIn the government including algae his he was a guy who was working for the Soviets what happened to this man who stood up for the truth they accused him of everything cheating on his wife ... of of the death of being responsible for the death of his brother none of it was true but what did he do\nHe had the will to fight he stood out for the truth justice justice Kavanaugh will have the social and he's a he's a he's a little bit about his the scary thing the Democrats have done this before\nDon't be surprised at what they did to Capitol they've done it so ... years ago\nA day of done at every election in my lifetime they play the race card the jet rye are they you know they divided America old versus young rich versus poor black versus white this is the identity politics which which they have
