taxes would have not filed you return the IRS will get you they can take your property take you to court even put you in jail with one call to wall you'll never need to talk to the IRS again our average\nIt was in the Eighteen hundreds in February of two thousand sixteen when again we had a second revised signal so I mean they were fantastic opportunities but but they don't come along every day opportunities like that don't come along every day\nSo um I mean even people that dollar cost average money into the market in two thousand Eighteen at the at the lowest level we've seen\nThey were still in the twenty six hundred area the lowest closing level we've seen in two thousand Eighteen was only in the twenty six hundred area no big deal we're in the twenty eight hundreds\nSo those kinds of opportunities that we saw in September of two thousand eleven with the S. and pay five hundred trading and the level of loving hundreds wow that's a buying opportunity big time\nUh any kind of opportunity we saw in February of two thousand six team with the S. and P. five hundred trading in the Eighteen hundreds well\nThat was a terrific buying opportunity for certain but you know when you're talking about what's happened in two thousand Eighteen yeah there was a ten percent pulled back in the S. and P. five hundred but you know how long that lasted\nNine days that entire ten percent correction in two thousand Eighteen back in\nJanuary February it lasted a total of nine days so a very long at All right now\nThe total of nine days so a very long at All right not very deep at all so these things vary tremendously over time but I Would take a dollar cost averaging approach on a schedule you're comfortable with given the fact that we've had\nA an incredible run really historic run in this market\nMarty's on the line listening to the great K. C. M. O. radio Kansas City Marty it's your turn\nEither side you very much ... in your last newsletter you were talking about the inverted yield curve and you're saying to measure that\nBy a federal funds rate versus the ten year treasury note Iran another article that that youth or some other author that uses the two year no versus the tenure notes\nAnd that I read yet another article that said we can't use a two year versus the ten year because of current international money flows I saved quite iMac was that a lot of foreign buyers of treasury notes are skewing that\nAt a relationship\nOr if you look at the two year versus the ten year it's pretty close I mean they're getting pretty close but if you use that use the federal funds rate versus the ten year they're not that close at all so I Would like to hear your comments on it that's the one my\nWell I Can't comment on the others that you quote but I Will certainly speak for myself that there was a\nReason there was a reason a really good reason that we mentioned in the um uh the August investment letter that we used the um we like to use the federal funds rate\nCompared to the ten year treasury do you remember what we said there\nI'm not sure exactly what you're referring to but I did read it [laughter]\nWell I'll read that paragraph axle from the I'll read the paragraph from the August investment letter\nAnd a level shed light on it let me read it word for word because I'm an only take a short time\nThe interest rates spread is one of the ten components of the leading economic index compiled by the conference board monthly\nThis component measures the difference between the ten year treasury yield and the federal funds rate I'll read that portion of the paragraph\nAnd ask you if that she has any light on why I have a focus on that particular metric\nOf so okay so if we get our converted yield curve with a two year of the ten year no we don't see the\nEnd it's not what I said ... well no that's that's not what I was talking about I was telling me about\nThe question you asked which was why did I use the federal funds rate versus the ten year treasury yields\nAnd as I said in the investment letter in August\nThe interest rates spread which is what you're talking about is one of the ten components of the leading economic index\nCompiled by the conference board monthly and this component measures the difference between the ten year treasury and the federal funds rate does that answer the question you had about why I selected that particular comparison\nI'm somewhat but uh so if there was a negative view of her with it\nThey just elected that particular comparison\nI'm somewhat but uh so if there was a negative view of what's there to here on the ten year that would typically like Oreo\nI don't want to see a negative view curve anywhere I don't want to see a negative yield curve anywhere but my focus would be right now on the short term rate the federal funds rate versus the ten year\nAnd the reason I like to focus on that is that that is a component in the leading economic index\nActs like it very much for your time\nThank you for calling now the bottom line that all of\nThis is ... and we always get the same crowd this same\nCrowd comes out of the woodwork every little time this happens they come out of the woodwork every single time this happens and they say oh this time it's different uh this time it doesn't matter because ABC indie\nWell let me be clear I think it matters\nI think the yield curve is important you know I think the yield curve is very important and so if you get into a situation where you get an inverted yield curve for example between the leading economic index yield curve\nMethod which is the federal funds rate versus the ten year treasury I think that's a big deal and there are a lot of other factors that come into play then such as\nLead times lead times on ... on the inversion become very important at that point and there's a lot more in addition to that but if we're talking about the basics to yield curve inversions matter yeah I think they matter\nIs there a way that measures yield curve inversions that is consistent with the leading economic index yeah there is federal funds versus ten years\n\nWe're taking your calls when the toll free line one eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one

ah\nInflation expectations which is really a market factor of Federal Reserve monetary policy is you know they're on a dual track right now raising rates in the quantitative type thing along with it that's certainly a factor\nAnd I would say those would be the major factors what is the Federal Reserve doing but when you look at federal policies in response to what's going on\nAnd so that's where the inflation expectations become very very important\nAs inflation expectations increase the Federal Reserve tends to further tightening monetary policy [noise] do you have that going on as well but with the fed on a dual track right now we're in uncharted waters on fed policy this really never occurred\nBefore okay thank you very much thank you Don yeah and I think that um\nIs that the fed they are focusing on the core personal consumption expenditure index and that has been very very close to the target level established by the Federal Reserve that target level is two percent to point out\nWell it's been like right in the one point nine percent area recently and based on the er estimates that are out there are some people expect to get up to the two percent level\nWhen ah when the data is released on the revised gross domestic product a this coming week there will be the revised ... number one data there'll be revised number two data coming up months later\nAnd so that's just quarterly data though that's not the import all important near every year number\nSo when we take a look at the fed policy we have to consider okay they're raising rates okay they're throwing debt onto the market and the former the quantitative tightening program as they remove it from their balance sheet and very large numbers\nTrillions actually over time\nAnd so all of these factors come into play and ah that's why it's really important what the fed chair says about what's going on with inflation and what are you saying right now is he is not especially exercised about the rate of inflation\nAs because he's focusing on the fact that we've had this personal consumption expenditures core inflation right in that one point nine percent area perhaps to go to ... percent soon\nWhile he's OK with that because that was the level that the federal open market committee established as its target back when figures were lower\nAnd the reason and this comes up all the time the reason they don't want to go below two percent is because they rarely fear deflation and the eyes of the fed one of the worst things that can happen is deflation\nBecause when you get deflation than the opposite of inflation happens what happens with inflation\nWith inflation you're paying back your debt with the pre she aged money and that works in your favor against your debt payment that applies both to the interest and the principal\nWas deeply and you're paying back your debts and increasing cost because the value of your money is going down\n[noise] and so that increases the cost of your desk [noise] you're\nThe value of your money is critical\nIn this case [noise] have you had the PlayStation [noise] your debts become more expensive and your interests on your desk become more expensive the opposite effect of the places [noise] years after ten years [noise] ... stay with us [noise] right here on Monday his money so [noise]\nIt's a national debt is now we're ... trillion dollars what happens next rising inflation drops in the dollars I some experts say and other crashes kind of ... you can fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins an IRA from Augusta precious metals coal eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and learn how an IRA backed\nBy physical gold and silver can hedge against inflation calling us are precious metals right now at eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and get a free gold Irish guy call eight five eight five eight five eight oh seven\nIn about four years so you have to be a aware of that as well\nAnd so uh I think I Want to have some diversity in that portfolio of by that I mean I Want to have some liquid assets some liquidity I mean in a portfolio\nOr at least by the time we get to the point where we're writing commission checked we can't make four year for cash so in the market at least I can I don't have a four year forecast on the market\nUh so uh you know you have to consider it if you made a four year forecast on the market in Nineteen Ninety eight it probably would not have been asking the five hundred being an eight hundred right because it was in the mid teens there when we got around year two thousand\nSo making a four year for kids do more of the market's going to be as as a ... a activity but uh certainly I think at this point you have some time here\nWhere you should be able to um to hopefully benefit from having some money and the total stock market index in that account and uh\nI I Would just be sensitive to the fact that you don't want to get to the point where I let me ask you would you be writing tuition checks out of this account yes\nThen you want to see that's what I'm Talking about you want to manage that account and such a way that uh you're not going to get caught in the bear market at a time when you're writing tuition check she don't want to go there so you want to provide some liquidity provision in that account this going\nYeah they'll look for tuition without having to sell out of a bear market hypothetically if one were to occur at the time ... years down the road where you need to death for quantity and I think that would be the most important point lawn checking in from the gate great Kenyan us radio in the ... high city of Denver\nColorado\nLet's get Jim on the line and ... Gen it's your turn\nTo a high above and first of all I Want to thank you for your your ah not sharing your knowledge uh with everyone it's like I Can't tell you how much it's appreciated [noise] ah my my question is I Want to transfer the owner of a balance my portfolio to right around fifty fifty\nAnd uh that means I've got to move over from\nA non Ira ... uh I I have a total stock market non Ira total stock market into a bond fund\nAnd I'm concerned about possible tax consequences the ... and it's about three hundred and fifty thousand dollars so but I have to pay do\nI have to pay taxes first of all and would I of have to pay taxes from the time I started that fun or on today in today's current him out or how would that work\nAll right well let's talk about this account now what type of the only count is this three hundred and fifty thousand in right now\nIt's in the I'm not total bond market okay which is another issue I well I'm sure with you because you've suggested or a short term and my phone company recommends ass vanguard they recommend that I don't do that\nYeah well a lot like where\nThey are they're they're not going to agree with everything I say and I'm not going to agree with everything they say you can take that that the bank um so you have three hundred and fifty thousand dollars right now invested in the total bond market how long has that been invested their\nNo I I Want to transfer over three hundred and ... it's been in there for a least a couple of years\nOr let's start this over one type as an account is this a both are non Ira accounts so this is a personal ... this is personal money yes okay so you have\nA three hundred and fifty though you have the three to fifty thousand dollars in personal money is that right\n[noise] right I Want to transfer it over a well\nLet me just let me just go step baby steps here so I can get this straight so we had three hundred and fifty thousand dollars in personal money where's that money right now\nIt's at a it's into a a total stock market\n\nDoes that what you mean more so this is stunning Doc Martin yes and how long has it been there\nOh here's a year's a year I'd say okay so you're going to Fifteen Twenty years since\nThe on usually don't extreme ...\nI'm Sorry so it's done extremely well you have a low cost basis on yes it's really done well\nWell if you sell any shares now have you use the average cost basis or have you used a specific costs basis\nI'm not familiar with well when you want to share that you buy them all at once yes okay well then a nut case that the by definition that is specific cost basis because you only made one purchased how much money did you put in do you remember\nNo I don't but I'm not saying I guess it was somewhere around oh I'd have to say somewhere around seven hundred thousand and now it's up to about a whole a one point seven five million so I Want to take\nBeing a portion of that uh yeah I'm taking a maybe a third or thereabouts a little bit more uh\nSo uh well three fifty out a one and three quarters would be a be a lot less than a third it'd be maybe twenty percent something like that so I'm here's the deal\nSeveral ... many years ago you put approximately you could look it up 'cause you're guessing seven hundred thousand and the total stock market index is that right\nYes okay yes and uh\nAnd some very well screw into one point seven five now all this time that you've owned that fund which I guess is the vanguard till the stock market index correct right I Know around ... you know I own a fun I Know the ... I've owned a fun for a long long time so you've received\nDividends on that fun on a quarterly basis and in some cases overtime capital appreciation what has happened to those distributions that they've paid out to the shareholders\nI keep I just keep that in that fun OK you reinvest them I reinvest okay\nThen in that case your costs basis is not as simple as that would have been because by reinvest thing you have created new cost bases each time you've reinvest it so what you might want to do is um\nShe if you could develop a new might help you at the fun family she if you could develop or maybe they've already provided you with an average cost basis is that the case I don't really know if you're going to have to know you're going to have to know because when you make transactions gym and a personal account\nYou're going to be subject in your case to federal and state taxation on the game\nAnd uh your maximum currently under current law your maximum federal tax liability and the highest bracket would be twenty three point eight percent of any money that you take out\nOn the game for twenty percent ... well that's just federal I didn't get to your state yet but twenty three point eight percent would be the highest rate you would have to pay if you're in the top bracket\nUh on any games that could be less if you're in lower brackets it could be less than that but then on top of that you're going to have to pay state tax on any gain you take out now in the state you live in the ... the top bracket would be about forty one percent\nAnd I'm In the lower ... probably know among the lowest uh\nThat's going to help you as going to bring it way down because if you're in the minimal brackets you can get down to very very low percentages you want to figure this out with your tax preparation expert or your enrolled agent or your CPA [noise] to find out what kind of a tax liability and we're going to have 'cause you want to reserve that money because you're into to pay that money out\nTo a Washington at the end Sacramento in the form of taxes\nBy if you take these games this year you'll have to make those payments by a while of as part of you as part of your tax payments that you're making on your two thousand Eighteen return you don't have to file your return to the next year but you may have to make estimates famous depending on how large the numbers are that's between you and your account and\nOr your enrolled agent or a CPA but whatever I think bottom line here you might have some tax liability I think if you do take three hundred and fifty out\nI think it will have some tax liability 'cause your money has a well more than doubled while you've added in there and by the way even taking the average cost in most of your cost is going to be based on your initial expense of approximately seven hundred thousand dollars so I Would and I would ask you to go through all of that as far as the other\nIt looks Spence of approximately seven hundred thousand dollars so I wouldn't I Would ask you to go through all of that as far as the other a part of it going into the total market no I Would not do that\nYou mentioned short a short duration vons bond\nFund yeah yeah and you know if you don't want to if you don't want to do that there's a really simple way for you to do it you can do a a a letter\nOf the three six nine twelve months CDs equal amounts you in that case you could spread it out roughly close to Ninety thousand and three months six months nine months twelve month when a three month comes through your will ... will mutt that keeps your three six nine well she went intact\nYou're fully FDIC insured when you do this I wouldn't do it any other way fully FDIC insured", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "14"}
