hundred million on Sean good news polling operation Rasmussen\nAh by the way they had the best accuracy record in twenty sixteen and the presidential election when so many others were wrong now saying that Republicans are tied with Democrats on the twenty Eighteen generic ballot latest raspy recent survey forty five percent of likely voters would choose a democratic candidate of the elections for Congress were held today\nAnother forty five percent off for the Republicans three percent prefer another candidate that's a a five point recent improvement for the G O P but if you go back at this time in twenty four\nNon presidential a year congressional election Democrats at a forty one thirty nine lead but Republicans went on to win nine Senate seats and increase their majority in the house what that means if I can interpret for you it means that\nIn twenty seven days we the people have the opportunity to shock the world again and not reward the outrageous behavior\nOf the entire

poll shows that sixty two percent of Republicans are more likely to vote because of what the Democrats did the judge Kavanaugh compared to fifty four percent of Democrats\nOr that is a good sign for twenty seven days and on top of that Democrats keep Everytime they open their mouth and they expose what they're real agenda is its investigation\nIt's impeachment age take their crumbs back and eliminate the the tax cuts that have been helping the economy so much and of course they want to keep Obamacare and actually quote strengthen it\nThat's where it's going to be entering in a couple of hours they're going to be seen with a hundred hundred and twenty miles an hour and got in there I mean that that's phenomenal because you've got to understand folks as powerful as these things are when they get inland friction all effects or it's almost like if you if you're running a nine one\nA sprint nine one one hundred yard dash if you tweak your hamstring if you can't run that fast if you really pull it you can't run at all these things are perfect machines but once they get inland fractional affects the fact that they're moving away from the source of energy the water they ... they wind down but we're talking about a relative windy got\nHow many times as a bus the Georgia get when sitting here hurricane force from a storm that hit all the way down or close to three hundred miles or two hundred and fifty miles\nFrom the south west but the torn addict activity yeah make sure we cover for that eastern eastern Georgia eastern South Carolina eastern North Carolina and these tornados as as a storm winds down in the lower levels still very strong in the upper levels so what happens is that discrepancy creates these border see these ones and twos\nAnd so you get these higher costs with that and you have tornadoes it wouldn't be surprising if there are a couple of dozen tornadoes tonight into tomorrow in the area south east and and so so the rainfall I'm Sorry I'm I'm you know just found this information now it's like there's so much coming in and I can't\nCan't get it out here are the rainfall three to six locally twelve inches a from a from where we are in Georgia as far in Georgia now but through South Carolina to North Carolina and a lot of that area that was devastated by Florence other coastal areas\nProbably aren't going to get it as bad they are going to get pretty strong wind gust in there but this is just the inland until we get to Elizabeth City and you folks in tide water\nVery late tomorrow night and on friday morning you're going to get north winds coming in their sixty ... Seventy miles an hour right down Chesapeake Bay because there's this reaches the coast and those same professional effects I'm Talking about overland diminish\nThe storm all wrapped back up again and then go out to sea and stay ... there'll be a nor'easter from a DC to to Boston\nTell me because I really what ... what are the areas that that may have a tornado activity exactly so people can make preparations and be ready\nWell south in ... as south and east of a path let's say from Columbus, Georgia or to Greenville Spartanburg I think\nAh to Raleigh Durham to the Thai border of Virginia you live south of needs to that path and the further south east to go the more the more you have to watch out for that you're going to see tornado watches and warnings\nBe put into effect in those areas and ah over the next several hours I Believe they'll start putting that out of putting that out there if they haven't already I'm sure this tornado watches up now I'm just trying to look at the forecast map going forward to tomorrow and on into fought it\nYeah All right now I Want to just go through this very very slowly it's about thirty miles inland now as it is that pounded hard the the panhandle of Florida and it's now moving northeast\nAnd as it moves north east is going to burst hit Macon Georgia hundred hundred and twenty mile an hour winds possible for their uh through a hundred\nHundred mile a hundred hundred and twenty southwest Georgia making eighty to a hundred in\nThat had regulatory guts and then then making its way through Augusta and then it'll go up the the north east coast or to the Carolinas I guess through the tip Columbia through uh the rest of the coastal South Carolina area and then into North Carolina\nRight and there'll be near Elizabeth City two AM in the morning on friday and then about a hundred miles east of Norfolk in the morning or seven AM eight AM and then on out to sea and a glance\nEarning on friday and then about a hundred miles east and North Africa in the morning or seven AM eight AM and then on out to sea and a glancing blow a a you know ... like a nor'easter for three to six maybe eight hours or New Jersey on in the southeast doing land out of this\nAnd this is the last this is the last one showing so you don't have to\nWorry I didn't know was the last one not all that fascinates me that you said it's the last one this isn't going to happen for the rest of the year\nWhile we knew back in September that we're going to have one come up out of the Caribbean because it's the overall patterns\nAnd I'll tell you what folks you ... and he says is two thousand and two all over again except slowly slowly which was the big hurricane in the Gulf hit a little bit earlier in Louisiana and October but we had all the warm weather in September and October\nThis is pointing the way believe it or not this is the pattern recognition toward the winter season which I think it's going to be a big winter for much of the United states this year there's certain types of patterns is set up so it's going to get much much cooler across the eastern part of the United states in the wake of this storm\nThat will then establish it we may see something that tries to develop but stay or most likely stay offshore before it's all said and done but an impact storms on the United states this is the last one in my opinion\nJob of starting you're helping to save people's lives and uh you help every day you nailed this with the exact pinpoint perfection an accuracy\nWhich is so vital for pay people to make proper decisions about whether to stay or go ah thank you for being with us we really appreciate we'll get back to you later Oh thank you for having me showing alright eight hundred ... Sean if you want to be a part of the program there is a really disturbing piece on\nThe law and crime website it's than Abrams website That's a sister Web sites of media I ate and ate chronicled the FBI directors testifying today on Capitol Hill and he was asked by Senator Rand Paul\nWhether President Trump was still being wiretapped by any government intelligence agency now you would think the answer is Oh absolutely not but that's not the answer his answer was not exactly\nReassuring now the FBI Director Chris Wray declined to actually answer that question as to whether or not the FBI the national Security Agency is currently collecting\nPhone conversations with President Trump and during a Senate committee hearing on national security issues Senator Paul asked do you think it's possible\nThat the president's conversations with international leaders remember when he was first in office they were leaking conversations with the president of Mexico the prime minister of Australia I mean that's never happened before anyway was asking whether it was possible that the president's conversations with the international leaders are\nYou know in the foreign intelligence surveillance a Surveillance Act database and raise response was well I'm not sure there's anything I can speak to\nIn this city well then Senator Paul continued\nDo you think it's possible that Congress members of Congress or in the ... database of we talked to international leaders and then re deflected again is that well senator I'm quite confident that we're conducting ourselves in a manner consistent with the law in the constitution\nA that's a subject to extensive oversight I don't know that I can speak to every hypothetical about whether there have been such situations and then Rand Paul as director re whether journalists conversations were being possibly scooped up\nBy the intelligence communities vast spying apparatus simply because they write stories about people with say a ... name and the\nAnd re declined the answer again I Can't speak to specific hypothetical\nCut the FBI Director often said the answer is yes and as his time with ray was drawing to a close he spoke about the potential abuse within the Pfizer system and Rand Paul is absolutely right he said\nYou've had people bringing their politics to work the concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data is\nAs James Madison said men are not angels that's why we have\nThe constitution that is why we asked\nYou to get a warrant the information you gathered in foreign database is not constitutional and the sense that has gathered with no bar there is no warrant there is no constitutional matter\nTo that data and yet you're going to use it on a domestic crime that has been our complaint for years and years and years and I got to admit after nine eleven I thought ... was a great idea never having any any belief that it was possible\nAs naive as I guess I was\nThat we would have government officials at the top upper echelons within the intel community the FBI and the the OJ that would literally be weaponized sing the powerful tools of intelligence that we give them to protect we the people\nAnd that I never in my lifetime thought that a political candidate him put together a flimsy top CIA with Russian sources and it becomes the basis for Pfizer warrant application but not one for the original application and three subsequent applications\nAnd that the bulk of the information was bought and paid for by one political candidate\nTo use against another candidate and that it was never verified corroborated but still present it to a ... court and they purposely don't tell the ... the court judges\nThat the other candidate paid for this and that they never verified it bites wearing you know the ... will get into this you know with chairman a Mark Meadows the Freedom Caucus and Jim Jordan later\nI mean think about that this is what we do we have a constitution for a reason there's a reason why you need a warrant there's a reason why you have\nTo present credible evidence to a court to get a warrant the bar is even higher when it comes to a

[noise] I don't remember the great achievements of beginning to shift\nThe American judges back to people who believe in the constitution and who believe in America\nThere's only effective if Mitch McConnell the leader I mean the key is done this year work at President Trump is truly historic and all of them and it's not just the Supreme Court justice although obviously will thrilled\nThat we were able to finally a have a success and she even a victory last week but that that doesn't that's just the beginning\nOf the just the fact is\nThat the president and the Senate majority leader at work together to move almost one out of every four federal judges\nTowards a law constitutional more conservative more American interpretation of of of the law and this is a remarkable achievement\nIf the Democrats would let us know what I said it would cost less complicated when you've got quite a sin running in Tennessee saying oh I'm really a lot or well who's going to vote for it's not up for some\nOr not he prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name\nAnd I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness as you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty him not coming tomorrow indicates\nThat there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a the OJ to on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nBut I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one\nAnd I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measure I tell you who's not measured at this particular point uh you you've got\nRod Rosenstein believing that he can hide behind the fact that he's the number two at the O. J. I could tell you got to people on the phone today Jim Jordan Mark Meadows who are not going to let that happen\nOkay Jim Jordan why is this even an issue why isn't you you have the power to subpoena Rod Rosenstein who you're not and bring them in and put them under oath\nYeah I mean this is why that's it happened and I hope I hope chairman Goodlatte will do that we've already subpoena the Medicaid memos and the kitten was or what the New York times cited that said there were people in that room with Rod Rosenstein who said drivers if I was talking about recording the president the United\nStates so we have the FBI former chief counsel a council maker saying he took that as seriously when he was told about that\nTalking about recording the commander in chief for this great country and we have in the Cape metals that reinforce that we've subpoenaed that McCain memos and we've asked Mr burgers time to come in and answer a question neither one of those things that happen\nSo that that you know Mr Rogers is leading that you played Shawn he talked about trend he he talked about facts and and the here and it is our our our ... our justice system works well one of the hallmarks\nOf our justice system is transparency show what the document give us there was the case then most and more importantly comments or questions that's what bothers both of us\nWell why would the committee allow him to pull out of this\nWell I can tell you that the committee has shown weak leadership and I'm I I hate to criticize the anybody\nBut we've had two weeks I can tell you this the speaker of the house\nThe majority leader of the house a Jim Jordan I with chairman Goodlatte in the room and and two or three other staffers we all agree that what we would do is move expeditiously to have\nHim come into a transcribe interview and if they did not if rod did not because I suspected that he wouldn't come in a that we would subpoena him and compel him to do that and I can tell you that ah it's it's more skew says on why he should not be transparent and and I for one I'm tired of\nSo we're basically saying Republicans that have the power ... and could literally force him to come and testify under oath and answer these really important questions if there was a plot a scheme a planned now you've got three people corroborating Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and now James Baker\nAll saying that he talked about taping the president of the United states\nIn the hopes that it would provide materials that they could invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment he says no no no I didn't say I was just joking about it I don't see what's so funny about it and said sarcastically I don't I don't even see any sarcasm and that and they are saying that they all believe he was saying it seriously\nYes that that that is accurate and even if he was joking you ... that the guy who was in effect running Justice Department should not be joking with support it's about\nRecording the commander in chief of the United states that ... that even if it's a joke that's not something you do that particularly at the time that this was happening remembers not this is back in May of twenty Seventeen when the whole darn cities in an uproar because on a night the president fires Jim Comey on may seventeenth brought Rosenstein they lower the special counsel\nThere there is one of the here's your email\nIt happened in between there\nRemember Lisa Page set up to that point they never had any evidence of Trump Russia collusion but there was little mania leaks strategy\nSo that they were creating an atmosphere where people were thinking there was some type of a reason to appoint a special counsel which now gets back to what the insurance policy was the page and struck we're talking about and it seems we got our answer now\nWell you're right I think not only are they leaking arid of gyms exactly right you know there's a whole lot that has gone into this you know where we've got actually a memos that have been subpoenaed testimony that there\nAre a narrative that was put out there by the department of justice and FBI and yet they knew that many of the things that they were putting out in the media could not be substantiated I\nI Would go even further than this you know you you did the lead in I'm not even sure that Rod Rosenstein read the five the application\nAny side you know when you start to look and here's some of the testimony is chilling the amount of documents that they failed to read and I I'm not so sure that Rod Rosenstein even well\nDidn't they will read them do we know they failed to read them or they didn't care I mean there's two different possibilities\nAnd Rod Rosenstein even well\nDidn't they will read them do we know they failed to read them or they didn't care I\nMean there's two different possibilities here I'm One of the big problems with all of this is every single item we're discussing here and the Grassley Graham memo pointed it out the Nunes memo pointed out that the bulk of information used to obtain the Pfizer warrants\nThat that they were literally committing fraud on the size of court they never substantiated they never verified they never corroborated any of the steel ... of this is Christopher steals you know dot CA\nAnd as a result was used as the bulk of information or pain the warrants and the problem is not even steal agrees that there's any truth in what he wrote\nWell they they that's correct that not even a steel and Simpson believe all the things that were given to Bruce or but here's the other problem\nIs is even Bruce or knew that some of the things that he was writing there were not accurate and and yet somehow they get put in a a three oh two and they get used as a justification to actually\nA further investigation in terms of the president United States it's just sickening it truly is sick me\nAll right so what's the next step why isn't good latte and Gowdy demanding that that Rod Rosenstein appeared tomorrow\nUnder oath and answer these questions whether or not he talked about several viciously taping the president of the United states for the purposes of of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment we need an answer to that\nYes we do and the American people need an answer and that's what we'll be pushing a chairman gets to do he indicated that he would do that so now is the time obviously to get that done and that sure Mr Rosenstein gets in there to answer these important questions now that we know that there's there's actual documents that talk about what took place in that meeting back\nBetween may ninth and may seventeenth of twenty Seventeen or he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a ... individual who's come forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McKay became right from that meeting so look we've got a subpoena we've got to bring them in so we ask the questions\nI Will take a quick break more with congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio and more on the latest why won't Rod Rosenstein answer these questions

Seventy five but they're going to be ... to eighty Ninety a hundred miles an hour at Lana you will escaped the worst of this but I guess it's probably going to come right over Augusta\nVery close to Columbia South Carolina that's just north of Fayetteville by this time tomorrow when we're talking and then we'll move off the mid Atlantic Coast between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk, Virginia very late Thursday night\nOn out to sea to the south of New England just be a glancing blowing the I Ninety five quarter in the meantime for you folks in the Carolinas\nAll right you you're not going to have the kind of a kind of cold long siege but in a six to twelve hour period for much of the interior Caroline is\nThey're going to be wind gust into forty fifty sixty miles an hour that's going to cost power outages\nThree to six locally twelve inches of rain will aggravate flooding situations in areas that were devastated by foreign so I'm I'm Sorry to say that we've got to call it like it is as this comes through tomorrow into tomorrow night so it's a multifaceted storm\nWith this park showing as you can definitely say it's all it's a when a storm surge there's tremendous brains right now I pray to God that nobody stayed in the path that this\n... this whole thing I don't know if anybody ever read what happened in Camille in sixty nine\nWhere they where they they try to get these people to evacuate past Chris Sean\nAnd the ... the storm leveled at three Ford apartment pill so I'm praying that people that you know got out of there in a heated the warnings you know the president\nHas been awesome what this FEMA has been absolutely spectacular in this rough period we've been going for over the past couple of years and if you if they listen while you come back and rebuild later\nAll the Ford apartment pills so I I'm praying that people that you know cut out of there in a heated the warnings you know the president has been awesome with this FEMA has been absolutely spectacular and disrupt period we've been gone for over the past couple of years and if you if they listen you come back and rebuild later\nBut ah you know I I fear for people who stay in the way of\nWell I Do too that's why I always tell people just just listen to authorities I Know people have said because I'm I'm looking and seeing on line and and various media sites social sites people are literally live streaming the hurricane and there's some of them are even on the beach for crying out loud meaning that\nThey're ... they're showing that probably live streaming away from the center because I don't think anybody's live streaming where this this thing's a bulldozer about twenty miles wide bulldozers wherever it's coming in directly it looks like Panama City was on the west side of the wall\nAnd I guess this court say porch saint Joe it's going to be you know I I fear for that area and there it\nIs hard they're perfectly said Panama City was ground zero it was and you also talked about the direction of the storm would hit you are right about that which as you predicted yesterday and and the day before and ... Sunday that the angle at which this storm was coming in and made it that much more devastating\nYeah again it's different from a different from Florence Florence did not come in at her peak this came in all kinds of placing as far as intensity goes\nAnd it's one of these cases where everything came together but you can see it coming together even back on Saturday and Sunday as you do I don't know if I send that email out saying if you're playing the show and see what's going to go on this week I've got some good news for you we're not going to be talking about a more hurricanes this year hitting the United states wants we're done with this one\nJust got to be the last one of the season uh last\nImpacts doormen our coasts yes I Believe you know\nWhy it's so important that we put you on and you have this incredible encyclopedic knowledge of every hurricane that's ever hit the United states for crying out loud but more importantly with the knowledge that you have\nYou can impart that knowledge to our audience and you can save people's lives because you know think about you know the years before media ... we had meteorologist and the ability satellite imaging for example and the ability to actually track and follow these storms\nAnd all of a sudden people will wake up and they're in a category four or five hurricane and they had no idea where it came from um ...\nThirty eight hurricane you know you live that Long Island is legendary their those people had no idea what was coming you\nMight Joan I'm old but I'm not at all I wasn't there for the thirty eight hurricane in Long Island Ohio's in here\nIt's legendary out there\nAnd you're at it in Ireland to\nWell I saw a hurricane Gloria destroy my sister's house so I did watch that and ah it hit pretty hard back in the day but our job of study whether bell dot com or will have the very latest he'll be joining us tonight on Hannity or as we get updates uh let not your heartbeat troubled I Know a lot of you are going to have a lot of damage\nYou're going to be in need of food and water medicine baby formula cuts blankets or I Know that like in past hurricanes that the government has gotten their act together they pre positioned a lot of the supplies that you will be needing\nA I Know a lot of you are going to be very devastated by the loss of of their homes et cetera but I'm the American people the most generous on earth and any help we can give you I Know that will be available as soon as this thing passes I pay attention\nThose that are in Augusta heading up to Columbia South Carolina because that's going to be in your area tomorrow with eighty to a hundred mile per hour winds that's pretty devastating uh All right let's get to our busy telephones here\nBecause that's going to be in your area tomorrow with eighty to a hundred miles per hour winds that's pretty devastating are All right let's get to our busy telephones here as we say Hi to resist in Charleston South Carolina race Hi how are you glad you called\nThank you sir thank you for taking my call I'll be brief out which is calling it I'm Wondering what the possibility of getting the president to\nEither director suggested the OJ that we go after these false accusers whether it be the DNC Hillary Mrs Ford if not for a criminal part but for the civil part and the cost of the wild goose chase is they were sent on\nUh trying to investigate these things from size and and so on and so forth and then strengthen the laws against false accusations 'cause they ruin people's lives\nOh I you know I I never said this but you really think about it\nAll of that information was disseminated to the American people to lie to the American people to feed them propaganda misinformation so that they'd vote a certain way but more importantly then after the election that they lost in spite of all of these efforts all of the line that kind of always takes place\nWhen and that's what the Democratic party does every two and four years\nIn spite of all that then they use this phony information\nAgain and again and again\nHave a media elite strategy feeding information from one source to multiple sources to seem like it's a real story when it was a concocted story of a scam if you will and that creates an atmosphere where everybody calls for a special counsel and now we're discovering that people were talking about\nWell to some and the FBI now admitting that they had no evidence of Russian collusion at all that's why they disseminated the information that's why they leaked it to their friends and the media that we're willing you know accomplices and all of this\nAnd then they talk about undoing a presidential election Sarah tissue just going out and recording the president unbeknownst to him so that they get and then in both the twenty Fifth Amendment and then I guess the whole insurance policy is in place done and finished I mean that's what happened here\nYes sir and all these things are again being being paid for by the tax payer and we're basically taking it in the rear end to every time they do this\nAll true there's and unfortunately\nYou know when I say this is the biggest abuse of power scandal corruption in American history I Am a thousand percent right and we still haven't gotten it right there's a reason Rod Rosenstein does not wanna testify have the information recorded or do it under oath\nBecause he knows he's up to his eyeballs in every aspect of all of this\nAnd yet he's the guy that has all the power I mean it's amazing isn't the literally the well the eye of the hurricane if you will I reach thank you appreciate it I'm let us go to James in Cleveland James how are you glad you called\nI Am fantastic Sohn thinks he's asking\n'em for small like to get my thoughts and prayers ... going through the hard times down there\nHopefully uh everybody has the right thing and a place of safety and got out there I was saved by the reason I called actually is because I wanted to tell you that uh I was a a never Trump or back in two thousand six Jean and I'm completely changed my whole point of view on that\nI didn't think he was electable and I didn't think he was conservative back then and I was wrong in fact I lost a hundred dollar bet with a fellow actually from mine over it paid him up the next day pretty much since day one I have been defending his actions are the president's done a fantastic job is help my family\nAnd myself so much I remember three things in my entire life\nThat I've noticed the federal government actually do for me\nAnd now this fabulous come from other junior Pete and Trump this time around has so much money in my pocket you know the other thing that affected me\nWas when my Cadillac plan was canceled because ISI and Obama Karen's costs me nine thousand dollars out of pocket since my company dumped are Cadillac plan well thank you non grounds for that\nAnd things you Republicans for more money in my pocket\nYou know I'm Glad you said all of that because there are a lot of people out there that are still the never Trump our land\nAnd they won't recognize it look I can understand that they don't like the president's style\nUm it's maybe that there is at odds with how they would manage things but you cannot argue that he's governing as a strong conservative that gets results and I'll take results over rhetoric any day", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "10"}
