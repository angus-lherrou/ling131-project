for Republicans have the clear a path to a majority but it is a treacherous want Republicans are favored in Iowa Colorado for example but not by much if Democrats eked out victories in those states and picked up the seat and Kansas they can control fifty seats\nAnd keep their majority Democrats also pick up seats from the G O P in Georgia Kentucky Republican gains in Arkansas Louisiana are probable\nBut barred from certain relatively modest errors in the right states would do tricks for the Democrats anyway that Republicans picked up nine Donald Trump didn't win a single state according to the polls John Kerry was going to be president because of the polls now I don't have\nA crystal ball and I just know when we're in the fight and I just you know I have a natural gut instinct to always wanna play like I'm behind play hard\nAnd the way you play hard in this case\nIs you make a decision now that you're going to vote for the Republican congressmen in your district check out my

rightful capital of Israel owe that to move it from Tel Aviv Israel then they never do it because they never have the courage to do it on a Donald Trump is getting all these calls from other countries in the region and they said no I'm doing it I made a promise I'm keeping my word\nOh why don't we have a little bit more of that\nThat is one thing that Donald Trump if he gives his word is going to he's fighting for it we see it now happening on the immigration fight or the president and Lindsey Graham of teamed up to and birthright citizenship other words if you enter the country illegally and

Allen\nLet's see if I can pull this story up here is a tweeting out that special counsel former FBI Director Mueller is accused of\nSome type of sexual impropriety against women and the FBI now is looking into it that it's a false stories so I Want to give you both sides of it daily news as of a very different take on it\nAnd they're headline is FBI asked to investigate allegations that women were offered cash to accuse Robert Mueller\nOf sexual assault I Know for a fact that a tape exists\nOr where there is a very prominent person on the tape on about Mueller very prominent person on the tape\nOffering money to somebody to make allegations against Donald Trump why this tape has never been made public I don't know but it does exist\nAnd I'm not going to go any further than that at this point so this type of thing does happen\nAnd I think like every other case I mean I'm not a fan of the\nTeam that Robert Mueller put together I you know I'm always torn because I never want to credit you I'm I'm very fond of law enforcement I just hate the people that he hired in this witch hunt how we ever got off into things like\nYou know bank loan applications when it was supposed to be about

Harvard how many years did you serve the country\nI was active duty for five years in a U.S navy\nYou know I'm you know I look at Florida they had a little bit of a red tide problem is that something that happens sickle ugly over long periods of time occasionally\nIt 'cause it's natural I think the issue we've had is with Lake Okeechobee the Army Corps of engineers discharges feminist polluted water into the rivers and so I ... who's the director goes into the area where you where you live in southwest Florida\nAnd I think what happened with some of those nutrients mixed with the red tide\nAnd exacerbated so we we got it bad ... got a really really bad at so I'm committed to making sure that we're batting that\nStopping the discharges bet in order to do that you gotta work constructively with the Trump Administration because a lot of that state federal partnerships I'll be able to do that much to impeach track so I don't know how the hell is going to be able to work with him on any of that so I think any of those problems we have ...\nUnderstand it's gotten a lot better sense of it so I guess the early part of the spring and summer of their share a lot of it's gone away right\nSince I'm not quite frankly Michael washed I'm a bit um\nYou know out and so it's not as bad as it was for sure but it really got that too much stretch there in South Florida where people were just getting hammered and within that each stature fish kill it hurt our economy and tourism so I Will do whatever we can get a lot of it is your fault you know the federal government for discharging you know all these leaders water under the river\nA round descent as his running for governor the great state of Florida Rick Scott running for senator down there a it is one of the most important states as Florida always is I'm a forty percent business tax by Andrew Gillum would be a disaster economically but Florida\nI Hope people are waking up to that fact um and you are ... you're in the middle of early voting now and absentee voting obviously goes on and a one week from today we'll find out hopefully that you're the next governor of Florida\nOtherwise I think among packing up my bags and I'm going to pull out of Florida and I'll go looking at Texas no offense to my friends I'm\nAnd that puts you at a decided disadvantaged now I kind of believe in freedom of speech and spending ones money the way they want is freedom of speech but why Michael Bloomberg former New York city mayor is so obsessed with California's congressional races\nAre obviously he doesn't like Donald Trump\n[laughter] why I think that's probably the reason but he's also looking at districts that he thinks he can uh he can do something there uh this is this has been a held by Republicans for very long time and uh we're going to win the seat\nBut ah yeah there's a it's an unbelievable amount of money that's coming in here it's it's gotten to a saturation point now and people are just so upset\nI think people get wet up with it and they tune it out like I Do I mean they they're not going to listen to it any more\nThey go from their mailbox to the trash can and then they bring their if their bills and there are other male old I'm ... and it's it's just so much out here right now you can't turn on your TV or your mailbox or anything [noise]\nNow do you have enough money yourself to fight back on who you are\nYou know we're putting out our message we're putting on her message on what I've done and how we accomplished thanks for this district and people like that so that's that's what we're gonna continue to do and\nHow do you have these other races Duncan Hunter Rohrabacher ISIS old seat the other you know Southern California districts that targeting how do you feel about those six because that could be the tipping point one week from today\nWell I tell people all the time you know Southern California is a\nIs a hot spot right now and it's it's because uh you know the two people that are looking to be speaker\nOr in the next session are from California and uh so they're looking at the seats but I I actually think we're going to do well I really do I think maybe he's doing well I think Dan is doing well um it's it's going to come down to the candidate though that's going to have to pull it through for themselves a lot of money\nAppreciate all the help [noise] but the candidates really got to pull it through [noise]\nAll right well we wish all the best and your race a Congressman Steve night again if you're in Southern California if you're in the\nUh it you know seamy valley area if you're in the Fresno area the Bakersfield area\nYou know we've been out there are a number of times those are all important seats and uh that could tip the balance of power in DC and that's why all that money is being flooded into their ah anyway we'll watch your race very closely or Steve night California's twenty fifth district thanks for being one of those\nHave shown appreciate it\nLet's get to our busy phones eight hundred nine four one Sean our number you want to be a part of the program right Andrew is in Albany New York WG why Andrew Hi how are you and by the way Albany is like a sewer onto its own in terms of\nEvery single high powered Albany politician\n... every friend of theirs ends up getting indicted I've never seen anything like it in my life\n[laughter] so corrupt Sean each side so corrupt\nThese calls and I'm One of the times website there live calling I don't think that it by us I think that it's cute based on who's you know answering the phone don't want to Pennsylvania one on my computer right now don't hardly trained in a district first of all ...\nThere's no one answer is no one else as all skewed towards down close to Philadelphia I think it's Africans that writes\nI I'm not sure exactly what you're say explain that again you think are inaccurate I agree OK\nYeah and I think it it's just started her that's her 'cause a lot of the stripper as the first is a most Republican vote there is a little lower the structure northeast section right on the\nBorder with New York right\nRight I Want to answer the phone up there it's all screwed up towards the bottom towards Philadelphia\nOh that's a big mistake I think on the Pennsylvania Republican parties part um we had a congressman on earlier this week from Lehigh Valley and you know look at every ... here's the bottom line it doesn't matter where you live I we are putting some importance on some of these New York races Minnesota raises California races\nBut the bottom line is all four hundred and thirty five members of Congress are up for reelection\nWell we need a majority it doesn't have to be a big majority but if you can win the majority and pick up the Senate seats I think we can pick up\nHold the Senate seats that need to be held\nThen it could be a very good night one week from now but I Am telling everybody if in my opinion right now Republicans are plus three for the Senate they add three senators but I also would say that in the house I'd say it's probably on paper looking at poll paper\nAnd I'm hesitant to say this but just analyzing\nThe races analyzing all of the new candidates you know forty five retirements in this time I'm ... I Would say it's ... it's it's probably plus five maybe ten Democrat with the pulse ups because right now the Democrats have two hundred and five locked in\nRaces for the house the Republicans two hundred and now the problem is the toss ups are almost all Republicans so you're gonna have to run the table on those\nWe put all that information the most important the top thirty that we picked then identified it's easily you know you can find it easily at Hannity dot com\nSo I don't know I'm looking at it I made like a toss up right now Michael shit I'm of a toss up that I mean I have it with a toss ups on Ninety three low key one Ninety two but a lot of all ... seats\nToss up that I've I have it with a toss up one Ninety three looking one Ninety two for a lot of all ... seats Shawn\nYeah look let me give you one anecdotal piece of evidence we know in twenty sixteen at the exit polls show\nAnd all the polls leading up to the election show Donald Trump wasn't gonna win and the exit polls came out of five Fifteen and it said he lost everything Florida gun North Carolina gone Ohio Pennsylvania and Michigan\nOr Wisconsin gone and the same thing happened to two thousand and four five Fifteen the media was ready to declare John Kerry the next president thank God that didn't happen\nOr in a midterm if we go back remember twenty fourteen it was for cast as a close Senate race\nBut the GOP one nine Senate seats I mean they were wrong so I'm I say this with caution caution you know probably the best thing people could do is realize\nThat if you don't want to answer your pillow see speaker if you don't want Chuck Schumer to be the Senate majority leader then just go vote and do all you can do and your power\nAt the end of the day will deal with whatever mess if we get one that we're gonna have to deal with\nYou know there are three outcomes on Tuesday night one week from today one of those Republicans gained seats in the Senate hold the house that's the best case scenario one is a split decision they gained seats in the Senate they lose the house Nancy Pelosi speaker\nThe worst case scenario it Speaker Pelosi Senate majority leader Schumer\nSo you know we have the power to make that not\nHappen right now the ... they ate all matters whether or not you're going to motivate your friends whether you're going to get to the polls whether you liked the progress do you think you're better off than you or two years ago\nAll the important issues we talk about you know what it matters or going to have two years of endless investigations possible impeachment\nWe're going to have the rescinding of our tax\nCuts by the Democrats or we're going to have open borders sanctuary cities eliminate ice a and keep Obama carry everybody as I mentioned earlier is running against running on health care on the Democratic side I'm like you're the same people that ruined the health care system\nWith three big allies keep your doctor keep your plan and pay less\nSo my advice is you know let's go out there and everybody fight hard if everybody does their part if everybody listening to my voice goes out and vote and if you understand the vote for any House Democrats to vote for ... below sea\nAny Democratic Senate voted to vote for Schumer\nThen we should have a pretty good night a week from now but the best part is that we live in a country where you get to decide that where every American now has the power to decide anyway I um I Hope that's helpful eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the

so we're we're going to release another one tomorrow\nIs it have to do with the U.S Senate again\nWhen it's wise to do with the Senate and the governor's race and uh and as I mean we're going to Florida [laughter] you know after you do have to find out tomorrow you\nAre you laughing because I'm right or you're laughing because I'm intuitive and smart\nYou you're you're you're ... maybe ... maybe all of the above\nMaybe maybe all of the above a well listen I think these are having a big impact clearly the local markets don't pick it up and all these cases um and when you think of suing when there's a libel made against you\n[noise] I that's that's a decision that my lawyers are are talking about because this is getting out of control of fraud I'm a criminal\nAh when if you look at history people have done this everywhere all of the time and won Pulitzer is and and it's done by everyone over the last hundred years I I have to figure out what I'm going to do here I think at some point there is going to be a change people are getting used to these techniques and we're going to live in a society where it's more\nFor being so supportive of Israel let's not let facts get in a way of a good propaganda lie in an election year anyway Republicans now\nAre beginning to listen and not only are they listening to the fact that repeal has to happen but also direct primary care what I call concierge care for every American at that this is now gaining momentum and I've had conversations with numerous members\nOf Congress in the Senate as we move forward and there are a couple of plans that are percolating one would be block granting money to states so that they can become\nYou know the fifty outlet suburb of new innovative medicine and they'll turn over every penny because their political futures will be dependent on it which would be a good thing Gavin Newsom wants universal free care for\nEveryone he gets X number of dollars good luck with that but in states red states with smart governors or it can be a lot different and a lot better you know we we often go to the case of health care savings accounts\nAnd that would be your only count you manage every year and set of eyes yearly checkup and your younger years you're building up money it's your money\nBut when you get older if you really get sick that money that account is built up a fortune and you couple that with catastrophic care fairly inexpensive\nDepending on what your doctor bowl is you know you could pay as low as a hundred bucks a year and get a great catastrophic plan if you have a heart attack cancer\nOr have a bad accident but anyway the health\nCare cooperatives of Dr Josh ... has been a pet project on this program of ours now for years\nAnd he joined us atlas empty Wichita, Kansas he joined us with Dr Lee as gross and he's the president for doctors for patient care foundation a thank you both for being with us a doctor I'm just to remind people I I Lived in Wichita I could walk into your office pay you fifty bucks a month I get unlimited care twenty four seven\nI get a Ninety five percent reduction in all of my prescription medicine costs and my kids get unlimited care for ten bucks a month is that true\nThat for every American could have confidence level of direct care just like you and how important people like Sean Hannity I'm here I don't think people under than just how important this election is um we see how divisive DC is we see how much infighting there is ... and we don't want those people managing our health care\nAffordable Care and the direct care model cars manager for a penny a pill labs for two or three dollars unlimited visits no co pays free procedures\nWe to fix this we can um work with employers and redesign insurance plans to decrease saving yea or previews by thirty to sixty percent we can do that but we need Republicans in office\nAllowing the free market to function because if we go back or judge or an Affordable Care act dial a Medicare for all it would decrease our ability to really you know innovate in a way that is meaningful\nFor patient and more importantly shot you know we're looking at a vision right now we have two completely different visions on healthcare future one is a completely government controlled\nSocialized medicine or you're going to inserts a government between patients and their doctors or do you think of the cabin are here you know that's how the ... at the same government that's going to control your health care or you have a another position that his health care freedom and these are the freedom of choice between you and your physician a word that your decisions are not being made by the ...\nBy the government and so in a while direct primary care isn't is not a partisan solution it is a solution that has been graced by most Republicans that are running including a fantasy is running for governor in the state of Florida he is a race that is Newt Gingrich has put this in his you know to primary care and his platform\nOr so this is definitely a platform that Republicans are supporting so if you want freedom is is definitely a division for you\nI mean the thing is it's almost mind numbing to me and you you know what you're right Dr Josh I have friends of mine that are doctors and because it's not because I pay them to be on it but I could pay them I mean I I Do pay them in other ways and thanked them when they do favors for me but\nUm I I Will tell you that I can make a call at three o'clock in the morning any day and get a doctor's care\nAnd get a doctor's recommendation and then and you know what if every American white a white only a few Americans deserve that or they ended up going to the dock in the box places that are not downplaying I'm like I'm sure they play a vital role in certain towns and communities\nBut I don't think it's ideal because I think most people pick a doctor because they like and trust that individual and know that that person knows who they are and knows their medical background that's important to\nYou and everybody should be able to choose that and I think that goes back to what Dr gross is saying about this is a referendum on freedom\nAnd we want freedom in our schools in our homes and and all that kind of important decisions we make but then we we've been missing that level of freedom when it comes to the most important decisions in health care so this really is a crucial step in history\nWhere we can say look the free market can do this better than the government's been doing it people aren't happy with health care system now and that's our ten dollars a pill we we we want freedom and health care we want choice the direct care model allows you know every man woman and child preexisting conditions or not\nTo get incredibly high quality care in an affordable way I'm Sean ... are you know it shouldn't be a\nPart of it you know in our practice we have not raised our prices in eight years we've heard sixty dollars a month for eight years\nFor unlimited primary care services are X rays are twenty five dollars are MRI's or two hundred and twenty dollars these are all affordable so at a pre existing no pre existing condition the question is can you actually afford to get the care you need by the doctor you need when you need a\nAnd these direct care solutions getting the government out of the middle of this relationship can actually do that so you need to embrace you know the people that are running for office that support for freedom in health care\nYou know it seems that you know it's so simple and so basic and so fundamental and this is where I got frustrated with the Republicans because they had promised repeal replays and they weren't ready for the moment there's no doubt about it now to the president's credit he got rid of the individual mandate but that's only a first step in if every Democrat is\nWe're gonna have better health care options for the American people but in many cases that the very same people that gave us the failure of Obamacare when you're offering a health care cooperative model you've duplicated down how many practices across the country doctor remember\nWe've helped over five hundred and fifty practices get lost because over a thousand growing every day I'm you know we had a twenty practices started last month alone that's a new practice every business day\nOr the ... and then you have any direct access at every individual twenty four seven direct access to a doctor\nThere are no pre existing condition prejudice at all these practices exactly have you can afford a cell phone you can afford direct patient care primary care there is no insurance except he probably would want a couple the direct care with like a catastrophic plan which is fairly inexpensive\nLeaders you had car insurance for the big stuff but I think you know a point that goes unmentioned is the fact that these insurance premiums are going up twenty thirty percent every year when Dr Lee and I never raised our prices is is killing the economy it's killing jobs it's taking\n... trying to be known as the but are you making at fifty bucks a patient I'm I I I make a month you making any money\nFrom that so what do you want me to that hasn't been acquired yeah yeah this has not been acquired by the big boxes\nYou know we're able to keep the practices afloat or able to drive interest in primary care were able to treat people in the rural communities these practices are in inner cities are in critical access hospitals are critical access communities in suburban and urban setting a and it's worked out\nVery quickly and same poor people in America people we defined as poor or lower income they can pay fifty bucks a month and they can get a hold are you twenty four seven and if they needed Z pack they're gonna walk out with a Z pack and pay above the Z pack\nWhereas you know ... ... yeah they should be able to get that if you think about it\nThe poor and sick or you are the more you need a mall Alexis MIT did a study on Oregon's Medicaid system in only twenty cents on the dollar got to the recipient\nDon't believe you need to have a a functioning car and car insurance and gas money to get to the doctor if you're a poor you can texture doctor you can email you can call them you don't have to leave the house necessarily because the doctors are and how many patients have\nA we have about six or seven hundred productive\nOkay so I'm a liberal the highway and all those practices and probably most of your patients like me I really don't want to see you unless I really need you unless I'm saying hello or you know saying let's go fishing together hum\nBecause most people drink but there's probably at least ten patients of every practice where they're calling me every day I'm assuming\nWe we have our high utilizes\nAnd our last last year we had her high we have our high utilize there's a we have a few pains and they asked it never stopped 'cause I Know that you know we factored that in um on the part\nOf the program we have doctors coming from a three hundred and fifty doctors from forty one states descending on our land or this weekend to attend the conference to learn how to set up their practices after that so and there were a thousand practices nationwide already practice and when the director model our looking increase that just by thirty percent with one conference alone or the interest as massive\nWill keep growing and as long as we could policies in place at the state and federal level that continue to allow these practice to to grow\nAnd blossom or you'll see this movement leaving all across the country are getting better access better care for the cost\nA sudden I got to tell you any Democrat that is telling you anything about health care that's out now is they're talking point we're offering health care\nA ... and Republicans will take you take care of preexisting conditions that line ...
