stop putting my money and the balanced index fund and open up the\nA total stock market\nThey have an asset allocation that is really about sixty percent bonds or other and only about thirty five percent inequities what I Would do a\nAnd you have the investment letter so it's easy for you to do is I Would look at page eight at the balance portfolio model three\nWhich basically is if you look at the percentage columnists a fifty fifty balanced portfolio\nBased on the percentage of occasions and that would be my top recommendation for how to be invested at this point\nBetween the stock market and the fixed income and when you when you look it's a fixed income you're going to notice we have a very short average duration and in fact the average duration in our income portfolio on page seven\nIs less than one year and it's very similar for the fixed income portion of model three so\nThat would be the approach that I Would take and the reason would be as you said I really am not a fan right now having the longer the rations and I think if you look at the performance of the longer the ration bond funds they really had been dragged uh they've really been ...\nHad a drag on those on their performance and that drag has been what's happened to interest rates I mean after all it was only two years ago that the ten year treasury was one and three eight percent\nJust two years ago in the summer of sixteen\nThe ten year treasury was building one and three eight percent now shielding two and seven eight percent so it has more than doubled in yield\nOver the last two years and I think that has really been a drag on funds that have had longer bonds into portfolio and let me say welcome to money talk always great to hear from Nashville\nTennessee or toll free line one eight

be involved you have at this juncture when in fact the market has reached an all time high with they\nLet me up and let me ask you let me ask you a question uh now that you mentioned age are you thinking in terms of a retirement at anytime armored time been retired to you as\nWell and let's start out by saying I Am way more comfortable way more comfortable at that point of having a a balanced portfolio which which started out basically with a fifty fifty allegations so you're allocation would be different than the allocation I Would choose\nIn that situation\nEven though I'm at ... ... I Believe thirty with the mutual funds and whatever\nYou're you're you said you were Seventy percent equities I think is that right\n[laughter] no no no no I'm I'm Seventy percent mutual Mosul mutual follows [noise]\nOkay well are are you are you talking about mutual funds of stocks\nNo snow so a mutual funds of asking the five hundred or whatever the case may be which\nPart of that without at least that would be stocks or what percentage of your portfolio is in the stock market or stock market mutual funds\nOr say about forty five percent\nIt's a fifty fifty right now Yes sir I okay yeah I don't have a problem with are investing in exchange traded funds as an alternate the mutual funds I said this is sometimes our listeners will say you know I'd rather\nHave an exchange traded mutual fund than an overload pond and of course there no load anyway but they're they're they're trading during the day so there seems traded funds\nThey trade like stocks I don't have any problem for those that want to use an alternate for example let me give you a um specific example of what I'm Talking about\nSometimes we'll talk to a money talks caller and we'll say the total stock market index ripe and then they'll say well why I'd rather invested in exchange traded funds\nAnd then will say well we'll go with Victor tango India right the TI that's an exchange traded mutual fund for the total stock market index\nAnd so that's fine I don't have a problem with that if a if a personal preference\nIs to invest in Victor tango India the TI exchange traded shares instead of a total stock market index or I don't have any problem with that at all so I'm comfortable\nPerfectly comfortable with using a ... an alternate exchange traded mutual fund for a specific no fun I keep in mind not all ... funds have\nAn older than that exchange traded mutual fund but it's certainly there's an example in the case of the total stock market and the case of ESP five hundred or a good example is a\nIs SBY\nThe SBY shares despise years again and exchange ... upon which invests in the as the five hundred index in that case just like the ... funds that invest in ESP five hundred index you generally get very very low expense ratio is if you're dealing with the right firms in these areas\nMargaret is ah on the line listening to the great Kate and us radio Denver Margaret welcome\nHigh powered so happy to hear your voice [noise] now how involving I tried to call your last week and now I don't have the whole name at this instrument I wanted to talk to you about\nThat it's been called at

certainly what a real estate investment trust is yes\nAnd how about a ... hour where trust\nWell I Would need more information than just a Delaware trust\nYeah okay\nSo I'll tell you what to do here's what to do when you get the full information on what the name of the uh trust is give us a call back and we'll see if we can take a look at it at that point\nWhen we have a clarity on exactly a witch instrument you're referring to Margaret thank you for checking in from the mile I said hey how about those Rockies or those Rockies on fire or what\nIt's good to see always like to see that\nLet's get you in on the line listening to the mighty WLS Chicago Joanne welcome to money talks\nThank you and I have a question I'm about I'm already retired I'm sixty two and I'm Single\nI'm I have I guess my home and and so I have three hundred thousand dollars that I'm not sure what to do with a ...\nUm [noise] save heard you talk about you know not putting putting a lot of time right now our dollar cost averaging we asked I never really quite sure how much\nUh you know not putting everything into a lump sum right now our dollar cost averaging weakness I never really quite sure how much money and the market or where the markets at which actually determines weakness I Know it changes but I'm not sure how\nTo take a look let's take a look at whether that's even appropriate in your situation a okay you have do you have an investment portfolio right now\nI Do and let me tell you after listening to your show for years I should be doing a lot better but I wasn't\nAlways doing what you said to do so I Am for my friend said listen carefully and do as you say so um I Do I mean your model portfolios three right now and I have\nUm [noise]\nWell I ... home in Florida out of that so now I have two hundred and twenty seven thousand at that and then I had that three hundred thousand in my bank from the sale of my home\nAll right we're limited by and for where did you buy an Florida oh I bought the south of Clearwater\nOh yeah I've been a you know um what do you plan to do down there in Florida moved there\nWell I Am planning on moving there since I saw my home but it does seem like people over there where I live it's beautiful place they use it as a layover style or for their vacation so I'm going to Europe and I'll come back when the hurricane season soccer\nYeah not a bad idea there at all [laughter] specially especially on the Gulf Coast in that area so you think you'll do you think you'll live there fulltime\nI think I well I'm I'll be back in Chicago because I Love it here and summer's are beautiful here yes so um yeah I'll be back and forth I'm not quite certain I'm retired so I figure I can do whatever I Want but yes I Do plan on for money purposes right now to be living there yeah when you sold\nYour ... your soldier home so you would have to make some other living arrangement to come back to Chicago and through your house settles right\nYes right now my brother and sister in law seemed delighted to have me here so I could do also like an air BNB when I come back or um and that's what I might do and years to come\nNow do you have any debt any a debt outstanding\nI Know that good for you good for you\nSo you have to ... your two hundred twenty seven thousand right now invested in mobile portfolio three which is we've described is a balanced portfolio you have two hundred twenty seven thousand there and you have this three hundred thousand that you've just taken it as a result of the sale the\nProperty correct now\nDo you have any sort of a a contingency or emergency fund set up for yourself the case you have an unexpected expenses have you done anything in that regard\nI used to but I use some of that money plus money um and that I had in the stock market to buy my home so in the bank right now you got I probably have I don't know what do I have probably about a factor my three um\n[noise] uh probably about eight twenty thousand dollars\nSo that might be enough for emergency fund for you are okay I Would just say I would just say that uh and looking at the three hundred\nIf you want to you could take a portion of that and add that to your contingency reserve funds so that you always have the peace of mind knowing that if an unexpected expense or arises you have the money sitting there and I would use something like uh\nThe um my favorite place right now for short term money\nIs the vanguard prime money markets and the ... let me tell you the reason I like the the injured prime money market uh first of all children over two percent which is a very generous yielded today\nAnd let me tell you the reason I like the the injured prime money market uh first of all shielding over two percent which is a very generous shield at today's uh today's world for a for short term money and\nI'm ... and the second thing is is liquid which means that you ask them for a checkbook\nYou get a check book on the account and you can write checks two hundred and fifty dollars or more you can even pay bills two hundred and fifty dollars or more but more importantly you have a check writing ability a tour of fifty dollars or more in all cases you a check writing ability and that's a great way\nTo have a money market account with liquidity with check writing so that's my favorite way to invest short term money and if you're making less than that right now wherever you're keeping the money\nI certainly would give that some consideration for a great\nChance to tell you one other thing I forgot to mention fairly important sure and another one of your favorite topics I Do happen to be a product of a Illinois kicker Ken ... is not what\nThe what kind of a pension is that what kind of a pension does that produce\nThat produces

hundred million\nAnd a that was even higher than the projection of the congressional budget office\nSo the fiscal year to date gap now is six hundred eighty four billion we saw August and September to add to that and for the first ten months of the fiscal year\nThe federal deficit is up twenty point eight percent on a year over year basis and I'm the office of management and budget is now projecting\nA budget deficit for the fiscal year ending September of eight hundred forty nine billion dollars yes this is during an economic recovery that yes this is\nWhat is normally called good times for the economy this will be the largest fiscal year deficit since two thousand twelve\nAnd if you take a look at the last twelve months the last twelve months deficit of seven hundred eighty four billion is three point nine percent of gross domestic product\nAnd we've talked for many many years about deficits and sustainability of deficits and are generally agreed upon number and the economic community is three percent\nThat it's okay to finance a deficit up to three percent of gross domestic product we are higher than that we are right now it's three point nine and rising by the way that's the biggest number since two thousand Thirteen\nOver the past twelve months federal spending has risen four percent\nWhile income has risen four tenths of one percent federal income revenue whatever you want to call it\nSo we are now outspending the increase in revenue by a multiple of ten increase in spending four point oh increase in revenue is zero\nPoint for on a year over year basis where is this coming from\nA January Bob\nUh well it's a ironic if you had started investing in a fund in January of two thousand Seventeen you would have had the opposite question absolutely yeah yeah you would have called it and you you would have said\nI've noticed this fund is doing very well how much of how well it's doing is because of currency and I was told you the dollar has been getting rocked because it got rocked in two thousand Seventeen went down substantially and that flowed through to the benefit\nOf an international fund that that is dealing in local currencies and now the opposite is true the dollar has been rebounding and it has the opposite effect on\nInternational funds and uh the dollar fluctuates it goes up because down it goes sideways from the standpoint of international investing the currency factor is most positive when the dollar is weak\nUm it is kind of neutral when the dollar is flat against foreign currencies\nBut when the dollar is rising as it has been in recent months against foreign currencies\nThen it's definitely had went and you should use certainly should see that in that fun Hank I appreciate the call let's get out to Charlotte North Carolina jets it is your return welcome\nHi, Bob thanks for taking my call all time list or a subscriber want to thank you for all your work or one of the book that you recommended a highly recommended reading list or seven where John Bogle so little book on an index funds a fascinating reading of fear\nFor for every body appreciate that recommendation\nI had a question about uh the standard deduction itemized deductions we've always itemized and we've always been able to do that because of our our ... our um our mortgage interest in in other um you know money we'd give it a charity and other things this year it looks like we're going to be shot\nOf being able to itemize with a thick it's doubled that way for thousands of for a married it has to do\nMuch of what what is the rate on your mortgage it's four to eight and the call that you had earlier five got one who will truly that maybe\nThat's not a bad idea anymore because you know because we wouldn't be getting that you know we wouldn't be getting that additional of the you know\nUm is is that somewhere to put some money as as a way to kind of power in ... like you said it's guaranteed that low risk is that something to look at\nPens on the race doesn't it yeah\nNow his right Warner the high his fist rate was four point six five which is a in today's world is a fairly elevated interest rate um but a year and for the nays are but you're right it is a guaranteed risk free return when you're ... more than ... percent loan\nOr if you don't have tax adaptability because of the changes in the tax code than the only other thing you have going for you was inflation now would be fair for you to say well\nThe loan has cost me in the last year the lowest cost me for and they bought you're paying back dollars that have ah been affected by inflation of two point nine\nIt would be right for you to it would therefore be fair for you to say that that it will cost the money for you over the last year has been one only two so in other words inflation is a friend in the inflation is your friend\nIn terms of discounting the real cost\nGot it so that God has attracted the\nWell uh you are paying back the pre she aided dollars by definition as a result of inflation and a well let me give me an example if inflation was was born and have it would be free money\nRight\nBecause the money you're paying back to the lender will not by what had bought a year ago that's the reason\nI got it very good they okay much\nYou appreciate it preceded Jeff\nOne eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one that's why the rate on the mortgage is so important when you make a determination whether you want to prepay mortgage take out a mortgage or do anything with a mortgage the rate that you're paying or no money is a key element\nTo tucked ability is certainly a factor inflation is certainly a factor Don's on the line in Illinois done it's your turn\nYou off ... who I call imam portfolio three in the non taxable accounts I end the joint taxable account with my wife I I'm In\nFor the total stock market and the prime money market would you add the ear to bond funds to the fixed position\nOr for model three\nFrom model three right in and they are ... account\nYou don't have the ability to uh put your fixed income investments in attacks ...\n[noise] uh no longer I'm a I have no ah earned income\nYou have any tax privileged accounts that you're currently managing\nTo yes for a wife and my own and they're and they're all they're essentially and portfolio three\nYeah I Do like the idea of putting a fixed income funds in tax privileged accounts because you don't have to pay its current tax on the interest\nBut they this is this is a known attacks privileges of the joint chap stick out see I'm I'm retired and the only other investments I can make are\nTaking pension buddy and putting it into the tax bill account because when you're ... you know in or if you're gonna put your marginal tax bracket a Fifteen Percent well I don't want to five percent excuse me are\nUh yes it does a but I'm I'm a the the country and as a teacher's French and so I don't pay on the patch

I'm already in the primary market with ya\nI I Would be OK using at the twenty five percent bracket rate uh I Would be OK using a yes because um you're still keeping most of that money\nI see a and if the if the river lowered it even better the tax rate to zero zero would be good to be good [noise] because I'm located effective tax rate and it's you know not paying twenty five percent\nNo I'm not looking at the effective tax rate I'm looking at the marginal\n... twenty five percent yeah\nBecause that's what you're going to pay an additional income that you make that why marginal mattered a that's why marginal matters for this decision effective really doesn't matter for this decision it's all about marginal the ... of the ... is all about the next dollar you make what will you pay on the next dollar you make but yes I Am comfortable with it ah\nAnd um you know I think at twenty five percent I Would go ahead with that I Do appreciate the call thank you for joining us good to hear

which I expect in September ... September\nFederal open market committee meeting so that's kind of baked into cake if the economy continues to grow we consider that faked indicate that rates continue to rise in the short term but what about longer term ridge\nWhat about the ten year rate I mentioned to ten year rate has more than doubled in the last two years from one in three days to two and seven eighths what happens to longer rates like ten year rates going forward well\n\nLonger rates rise\nThat certainly would make sense given the fact that if you combine real GDP Growth with inflation right now you could justify a four point eight percent ten year there's certainly a ... percent plus ten year at least right\nAnd the way we get that is by adding together the growth rate in real GDP the and we don't just take one month or one quarter we take annual rage that if we take the last twelve months through June these are numbers we have in hand right now the last twelve months through June\nReal gross domestic product role is to point eight percent so we have that number and we also have\nInflation over the last year and for this purpose we would use the personal consumption expenditures core index which is one point nine and so if we add together the uh one point nine as a two point eight week at four point seven and that would\nAnd a\nLittle odd that we have to southern A's so were considerably below four and a fraction\nForeign any fraction were still considerably below a two and seven eight so\nIf rates do rise that would be a normalization and that would make economic sense but what if we just don't go up much or don't go up at all from this love what happens then when the federal funds rate and the Ninety One day tea bill rate continue to rise\nTo the fed policy but you could run the risk down the road not right now\nBut you could run the risk down the road where the yield curve would invert we're short rates would exceed longer rates well if that were to happen that would be one of the preconditions and it would be unimportant precondition\nThat we would then have in place for a recession outlook\nSomething to keep in mind\nIf we don't see an increase in the longer term rates\nAnd if the short term rates keep rising due to fed policy we run the risk\nOf an inversion and that's where the catch twenty two analogy comes into play\nOn the one hand it would make common sense economically speaking for the ten year rate to move higher\nBut on the other hand if it doesn't move higher and the short term rates keeps going up that's where you get into the catch twenty two inversion interesting thought was certainly going to be fascinating to watch a as we say\nWe show no this in the fullness of time let's get Richard on the line in Lincoln, Nebraska Richard welcome\nHi, Bob [noise] um [noise] my daughter when she was to inherited a I don't know fifty or sixty thousand I put it all in in a a\nVanguard [noise] and the five hundred index and uh she's Eighteen now and as you know that's done very well [noise] um [noise] my question is I'm thinking about putting it all in the ah vanguard total stock market index\nJust kinda spread her risk out and [noise] terrible tell her to leave it alone and ah she should be doing All right [noise] um [noise]\nAs time goes by what ... what are you what's your thought of that should I a dollar cost averaging or can I just [noise]\nThrow it in their [noise] well\nWhat what was it would there be tax consequences on his [noise]\nUm I don't think so 'cause [noise] and they had you know I've just taken it out of ah [noise]\nTaking it out of the five hundred and putting in a coma stock markets and accidents inherited money so I don't I don't think so but I guess I don't know that for sure\nIs a personal money is it her personal money is it as as as a ... type of a special account what's the deal it's her personal money that sounds like a taxable event to me well\nI'm Glad I called you then um\nYeah I Would suspect uh what what do you think is the average cost on the money that she has their um BS in peace at twenty eight fifty what would your guess be would be the average us and the cost of that money\nI\nTwenty eight fifty what would your guess be would be the average us and the cost of that money\n\nOn a I don't understand the question how many years how many years of the few invested in the sixties and did it all go in at the beginning yep All right so sixteen or is two thousand two right\nSo the costs on this thing could be eight or nine hundred versus the twenty eight fifty you might have a triple on your hands as this thing triple\nYeah yeah that's a taxable gain\nOkay [laughter] well I'm Glad I called you that I I think I'll just leave it in there and\nYou know the money that came in and dividends yeah the money that came in and this and the dividends every year that was taxable every year you know that right\nBut the capital appreciation on the shares the two originally purchase that have looks like they've tripled in value basically right that is that is a long term capital gain and that is a potentially a taxable event depending on uh her bracket so what'd you need to do\nIs you need to talk to a tax preparation expert\nAnd enrolled agent a CPA someone with with tax a moderate that can answer that question for you because it will also depend on her level of income and any tax bracket that she might be in and it will also apply to the state of Nebraska Richard\nIf she's in Nebraska so\nYou have some questions to ask but I'm Glad you called one eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one that is our contact number one eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one clear is on the line\nIn Delaware clear it's your turn welcome\nCan you hear me okay first call\nYeah you sound great clear thank you\nGreat I have a question um I Am a stay at home mom I have a son and I I had been out of work I raised my children since two thousand and one so it's my husband's income has the opportunity now to switch over to a while to\nGet a chore off for one odd have fifty eight I don't know it makes sense for\nSeven years extra I'm Sorry kittens seven or eight years next job or you know we if we did I miss\nThe lower income network taxed on now ... percent away so we would lose that however we get a tax free in the end\nI don't know what's the better it is to me now\nWhat is your current tax breakfast bracket that benefits to when you put it in the pre tax contributions what is your current and you have to include Delaware in there what's your current marginal rate\nYou know I I don't know with the way the at the lower maybe Fifteen thousand because by the time we\nPut away his what we want to bring in our income down probably around sixty thousand and then by the time you take out the the children adoption than the standard adoption latest things I think it's down around it so I think\nSo you're you're thinking that the money that you're the pre tax money that you're contributing there's really not give you much of a benefit at all\nI guess it does because if not let's say that\nYou know we're being taxed one eighty thousand income\nInstead of maybe a I don't know let's say we put away Fifteen thousand\nInstead of maybe a I don't know let's say we put away Fifteen thousand a year I don't know maybe it isn't what I look when you put it that way maybe we aren't getting that much of a benefit out of it\nWell it would be interesting to see the numbers and you want to throw Delaware in there too because you have a state income tax in Delaware as well\nUm I Know these things 'cause I was born and raised in Philadelphia not far from where you are so I Would say that um you want to check out the numbers and see how they work but I Would say this with with reference to any additional money you're you're putting in the\n... you want to see whether you're getting a benefit from the additional money you put in", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "07"}
