statements what else can the FBI do\nWell three that people should they don't remain that not judge has denied it we know that my ...\nWhat else can we ... we do beyond interview these people who are ready for the would be committing perjury if they changed their story what else is left for them to do\nA peanut at Safeway implanted records and figure out what trying to exactly that my ... to try and try and\nGet should we be disappointing looking into the rape allegations of Bill Clinton\nShy Juanita Roberts Lee is only up to food was given the\nI'm asking should we do know God's law enforcement and the FBI investigate the rape allegation of Bill Clinton\nMade it brought a product of allegations were already in this together by this hour on by the\nTime you may not by the FBI should we should the FBI now investigate them if this is the new standard Jonathan\nNo because that's our authority that those are local crimes that happened now the case of winning Broderick they'll however um he would that would have been a state matter because that the time or Bill Clinton was the attorney general\nYou know and so but here's the thing is that you keep saying and and Daniel well have you been here's what you keep missing and so many people that are emotionally involved with this if you take the emotion out of it I Know that's difficult because people are very passionate\nBut if you take the emotion out of it and you look at the investigative facts there are none\nAnd there is not going to be any because it doesn't matter uh who you question the very people that uh the the the alleged victim claims were the closest to the to the electric crime don't know anything\nAnd so as you go out in a perimeter away from the people who the victim says was was there and you interview other people that may have heard somebody say something or heard here say it becomes here say you know that from being in court that when you have\nA just eight minutes with no corroborating evidence that case quickly falls to the side\nAnd I certainly agree with Jonathan totally right and the problem is that and then also the fact that the FBI is being used outside of their authority for political matter and that scares me as a former FBI agent that scares me because that is the that's the thing that totalitarian I'm a governments do\nLook look I agree I I think that one thing that's important got back to this was a standard here this is not a criminal investigation uh this is an investigation than to conduct that may or may not have beer in a way that somebody gets a lifetime appointment um and I\nUnderstand and I agree that this is the kind of extreme like political and extremely emotional and I think that's probably the ...\nQuestion do you have any corroborating witness for any corroborating evidence at all you can say right now\nAnd it's an on the question that as an I. C. O. really\nI got an unfair question Jonathan I don't think it's unfair to them\n... well I I think when we say fair or unfair I think what it is is orange intimate question I'll tell you why didn't you know because people are so again angry and people are saying I Believe her I Believe him but in this case there's just no other witnesses there's no other evidence and so when you're asked\nIf you feel this passionate about something that somebody says one other information do you have\nThat's legitimate question because there is not in the FBI who was secrete it into this investigation has come up with non either and I can guarantee you if anybody would of could of it would be them right\nGreat evidence as to where the judge was on any given day with the he was there and I ... I think people are emotional for anybody\nActually has a copy of is summer calendar that year but we don't have that exact day anyway so right right and you know what you're saying is that you know he has to prove his innocence or is the innocent before proven to be ... haven't been proven guilty what ... what do you believe in\nA media hysteria that that's why to the extent that people can literally destroy other people within you window falls uncorroborated claims a shocking to me they did it to Robert Bork they did it took Clarence Thomas they've been doing it to Brett Kavanaugh\nThey do it to Republicans conservatives every two and four years they're racist or sexist they want grandma to die all the things that that come out as a matter of of course because that's their play book I don't know I um I\nI some house at some point we may need to examine libel laws at some point we may need to say if you're going to make these girl is accusations against individuals you better be able to prove it because if he can't prove it then you ought to be held financially\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung teenage girls and systematically raping them on an almost weekly basis\nI don't know what the appropriate response is but I think if I was innocent and somebody said about me I'd be pretty pissed off and I want people to know I Want people to see\nThe righteous indignation in in me that I did not do this and the passion\nThat that that is behind that those words that I Am speaking that's not me that's not who I've ever been that's not who I Would ever be\nI'm not that person I never did that how do you say that in a way I mean these posts to say it like no I'm a minister of these charges nobody's going to believe that most\nHuman beings as I felt the judge Kavanaugh's denials was role\nI bet you he's never been that\nAngry and emotional in his life but the circumstances warranted it based on the seriousness of the allegations against him I don't know any other way that a human being would otherwise react\nAbsolutely I call that righteous indignation that are quite believe the ...
