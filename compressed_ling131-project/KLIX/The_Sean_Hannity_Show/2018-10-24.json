wants to see a movie leave her alone\nIf secretary Nielsen has them eating a private dinner and groups of people are running no matter the restaurants I don't want that either\nI don't want a

uh he has\nPenned a piece on them migrant caravan he is the elected secretary of state of Kansas an expert in immigration and uh by them\nThe piece on them migrant caravan e as the elected secretary of state of Kansas an expert in immigration and uh by the way it's been very successful and he's doing and uh and uh I\nFully support your your victory there in Kansas who was a big win that you're pulled out in the primary and I hope the people of\nKansas are smart enough to put you in that position I Know you've been a great governor um look I I don't know if we're going to get to this point this caravans growing Mexico seems incapacitated unwilling to do the job of securing their own borders which they usually do a pretty good job of they either put people in jail or throw them out immediately\nUm but if they in four weeks or whatever and make it to our southern border\nUm and if anybody is to cross that border or if they rush as across that border as in as one\nWe don't have any problem of choice we will have to arrest them that will be a crisis precipitated by people not respecting our laws I don't want anybody to get hurt if we had a wall up right now Kris Kobach we wouldn't have a problem\nWe wouldn't have a problem and also if we had\nMore states denying welfare benefits to illegal aliens so we give a hundred and thirty four billion dollars a year\nMost of those are state public benefits to illegal aliens you know meanwhile you got governors ah like a Governor Brown out in California giving more benefits so if if a federal and state response or the ... states have to stop panning out the goodies\nWhich gives the illegal aliens assurance that if they can get in that it can come in and start getting welfare benefits so while they're looking for a job\nSean Spicer a U.S quite a lot of incendiary rhetoric thrown in your direction we'll get to that in a minute but let's talk about what the options are here I Would think that is the role of the Mexican government\nThat they should be turning these this caravan back they seem unwilling are capable of doing so uh what should America's response be\nWell I think America's response and the fact that the president has talked about which is making sure that we protect our borders our sovereignty and our citizens and that means ensuring that we know who's coming into our country why they're coming in a and that they not coming in with either nefarious reasons\nOr to either harm is are they say you know but there's a writing the bottom line is the number one job of any president of any elected elected official is\nTo protect his people and the president's made very clear and and the one thing I said that the other day they don't want China I Want to be clear your great with me I Know\nChrist will agree as well don't temp Donald Trump don't temp temp\nBecause he's warning that government is warned Guatemala he's told them that this is unacceptable they need to do their job stop this from happening um and I I guess I I think that if anything people have seen over the last year when he gives you a warning he means that there will be action afterwards if you don't reverse ...\nLet me be very clear I I'm just going to assume I really believe\nThat probably Ninety nine percent of the people in this caravan of good people people that don't have a lot of opportunity and their own communities countries they want a better life for themselves and their families I Believe a lot of the age we give to many many countries is abused and it doesn't get to the people as it should\nUm with that said we have a legal process of doing so but on the other hand let's say it's only a small fraction of the many that are coming\nThat have nefarious intentions for this country we don't know there's not one person that can vouch for anybody in that care of him nobody can vouch for anybody and it would be unfair and a massive risk to the American people\nTo allow people in on vetted no idea what their their point of view of world view happens to be whether or not they have good or bad intentions for the United states and I say that Kris Kobach assuming Ninety nine percent of of the people coming just want a better life\nGood or bad intentions for the United states and I say that Kris Kobach assuming Ninety nine percent of of the people coming just want a better life\nAnd that's that's a very good point you know and the leaders\nAbundant evidence of terrorists using the traffic flow of illegal immigration across our southern border to get into the United states going all the way back to before nine eleven ah people from countries where al ... was active allow countries where I suspect active\nHave used this this flow as Margaret close to blend in there's no question that that will be the case again you know the only thing Sean that I I wanted to point out is I think the Democrats have lost their grip on reality here there and the third stage of open borders psychosis just all of this for a moment in the nineties\nThe Democrats are were pro enforcement Bill Clinton signed the immigration reform act\nOf ... of Nineteen Ninety six and they agreed with Republicans that we need to deport those here legally then in the two thousands they became pro amnesty and they no longer want it to deport they wanted to grant amnesty ... million plus year\nNow they're taking the position that we weren't there cheering for illegal aliens before they even get here they want them to come in and be part of the American society it's it's gotten ridiculous fair churn people before they're even here to become unlawfully present to the United states\nAnd when you play what I played earlier it's amazing how all these politicians leaders of the Democratic party not not that long ago sounded a lot like Donald Trump\n... let me switch gears to these packages the president said um he spoke out about these despicable acts of terror\nHe said no expense will be spared whoever's responsible for sending these packages that appears in some cases pipe bombs in powder that they will be tracked down and the and the full force of the government will be coming down upon them which is the right thing to say and do\n'em ... before that Shawn we've seen a lot leading up to this\nAnd wondering what have we seen we've been witnessing says yeah\nWell one quick point before and they cause I think you're making an excellent point but one last thing it only takes one and that that leads into what we're talking about today you you can have\nNinety nine point nine percent it'd be be be doing the right thing but it only takes one to do the wrong thing and I think that's what we need to remember to this whole process and we saw that today one person or however many we don't now is now frightening and terrorizing\nThousands and thousands of people [noise]\nUm and and you know I'm not making any cash but while I'm at the point of making it it doesn't mean you can get Ninety nine point nine percent of the people through or safely but if we don't protect the ... get a hundred percent right people can be threatened her and then that's the thing that we have to make sure that we're clear on\nI Will tell you I went to take a quick break on this will come back on the other side and talk about the president's comments he they will hunt down those people that have been sending these suspicious packages\nAnd powder and potential pipe bombs are two very politicians one to CNN or this is not new I've lived through this myself\nOut of

wrong for me to go Under Cover and record these folks then how wrong is it for them to mislead the voters if it's ... it's not fraud for me to record people but it's certainly approaches fraud for her to misrepresent in such a awful way\nAnd and thank you Claire McCaskill for doing that an asking for me to be prosecuted because now every TV station and misery every single one\nHas covered these videos and I think the same things that happen in North Dakota this week yeah\nI think well it shouldn't happen in North Dakota I mean if she's planning to be a super liberal I think the people in North Dakota and fairness to them they need to know 'em why can't you do it in Pennsylvania and twelve other states\nThere's twelve states that prohibit what they call to party consent laws and I think that these laws basically means that you know is if you're if you're talking to someone you cannot record them without their permission whereas an ... like in New York and DC in North Dakota and

go after women and children in restaurants or like we've been witnessing when we don't listen to the rhetoric of people like Maxine Waters to get in their face creator crowd\nFollow people and to the grocery store gas station department store and say you're not wanted or anywhere anymore which is what she said oh Spartacus getting their face or Obama saying getting their face and we'll have missed the bird just tear up Sean Hannity\nAnd all the other incendiary rhetoric or Eric Holder kick up more Hillary you can't be several Rand Paul was right something's gonna happen thank God we have the best law enforcement in New York and elsewhere that have been able to stop potential tragedies from happening\nMaybe now the Democrats will speak out about members of their own party and the horrific rhetoric they've had\nA back to my point Brendan struck a is a now a conservative and he's leading this movement which is hash tag walk away from the Democratic party or he joins us as well as ... Paterson who remember he carried the nuclear football under the Clinton Administration\nWrote the book Darryl ... dereliction of duty a welcome both of you Brandon tell me your story what made you decide you worry I guess pretty laughter a Democrat and you\nPretty uh welcome both of you Brandon tell me your story what made you decide you worry I guess pretty left and a Democrat and you started this campaign in this whole thing for you is gone absolutely viral what happened\n[laughter] so I'm a great Sean thank you\nUm so I you know my whole life I consider myself a liberal and my whole adult life I consider myself I was a Democratic Party voter I always voted Democrat um and\nThat was true even in two thousand sixteen I went and voted for Hillary Clinton and I was one of these people who was devastated by the results of the election for numerous reasons first of all the media had been telling me for months and months at a Donald Trump didn't have more than a three percent chance of winning and\nThey also had been telling me for months and months that he was a racist and if they get and homophobia and a monster and basically the second coming of Hitler and that his followers were no better and\nYou know they I think that the liberal media did for me as they did for millions of others are very effective job\nScaring people making people believe these stories in this narrative that they're trying to push so when Trump got elected I was terrified and I was one of these people going on social media\nRanting you know screaming sometimes crying you know what I'm saying you know I'll never understand how people could vote for for this monster and on one particular day I had posted about um you know I\nI'll never be able to understand how people could vote for a man who stood before a cheering crowd and mocked her reporters disability and it was on that day in January of two thousand Seventeen that somebody reached out to me after reading my Facebook posts and said listen I'm just asking\nHave you seen this and what she sent me privately was linked to a Youtube video which was entitled debunking the Trump mocked the disabled reporter and for anybody who hasn't seen this as a compilation of footage I'm much of it is on the campaign trail but some of it even goes back\nTen years ago of Donald Trump doing that exact same voice in that exact same gesture as he did that day when he was quote unquote mocking the disabled reporter but what's clear when you watch this compilation is that this is a voice in a bit but Donald Trump does when he's imitating someone who was caught in a lie or doing something shady or grumbling\nBecause they've been caught doing something dishonest and I\nI Know some stupid now ... but it's like it was the first time in my entire life that I really realized that the media was capable of creating a completely false narrative and then isolating a moment out of contact to push that merits if it had nothing to do with news or the truth brand\nAnd let me ask you something now once your eyes are open and once you become aware of their bias and it's like you you you ask yourself ... myself but it's even worse than it's ever been how did you not see it before do you ever say that the yourself\n... yeah yeah it's absolutely the kind of thing that wants to see it you can't see it and what you just said is actually kind of the next part of the story because then I went back\nTo the beginning of the campaign and revisited all of those other moments like Trump calls all Mexicans rapists Trump advocates for the sexual assault of all women and you know I went back and revisit those moments and found the same thing time and again that's not what happened\nThat is not what happened but they made a decision after he won that primary or it was clear that he was going to win the Republican primary that it wasn't funny anymore that he was running suddenly it was scary and that they had to turn this man into the the scariest candidate that the world it ever seen so\nMay I ask you this when I when I tell my audience\nTo expect and I showed a lot of the ads that are out last night and I've been I've been showing these instances people that are in the public eye that are conservative more support the president you know they're being run out of restaurants and I'm Talking about women and children good luck to anybody wants to try and run me out of a restaurant I'd be giving your best shot\nYou know I noticed that it either happens to a guy with his wife\nLook to anybody wants to try and run me out of a restaurant I'll be giving your best shot you know I noticed that it either happens to a guy with his wife or or an older person or women\nYou know what when they're a bunch of cowards the when they do that because I'd never treat anybody that way but you know this is a narrative every two and four years in elections in America that Republicans are racist or sexist massage in is that there\nAre homophobic Xena phobic Islamophobia that they weren't dirty air and water Obama use those actual words\nThat they want children to die and they'll have some commercial with the Paul Ryan look alike throwing granny over the cliff because they want to kill your grandmother that's what they do that to their play book we're watching it unfold today even Thirteen Days out of the election um do you see now\nThat all of that is not true there's not one thing that is true about that look at the stakes for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce um the lowest unemployment levels ever recorded for these demographics ever\nDo an absolutely seeing that now and in fact I think a lot of others are starting to see it as well which is resulting in what you just said that even I think the most\nAh these minority groups in particular that I think the Democratic party for so long has taken for granted that this oh these are just automatic vote well that's not the case anymore I mean people really are starting to wake up and they're starting to walk away because they're seen so called\nHim at how many people have joined your movement\nSo that the movement began on Facebook and in that are rich in that\nFirst initial Facebook group we now have over two hundred and five thousand poverty on ...\nOn social media platforms we have about four hundred thousand it to be clear for anyone who doesn't know this is a testimonial campaign so these are just people who are going on social media clicking follower clicking like they're telling their stories about why they are walking away so I mean they're they're making videos they're writing these stories\nDown I mean people are there this was forming like a network of support and people are\nLeaving are walking away from the left\nOf uh let me bring in bus Patterson as we bend around the block of time or to a new around the Clintons a lot a Hillary queen we can't be civil with with people we disagree with something like okay you know if you don't want to be\nYou know I ran into what's that that the senator from that we ran into Linda when we were in Washington Blumenthal I ran into him on
