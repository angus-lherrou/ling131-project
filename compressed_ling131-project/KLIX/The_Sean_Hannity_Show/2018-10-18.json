Beach Florida Today I Want to go to this issue of this this reporter this guy with the Washington Post is not an American\nCitizen lived for a long time in Saudi Arabia and it looks like you walked\nInto the Saudi ... council a in a consulate in in Istanbul\nAnd it looks like he was murdered now my compound was asking the president\nTo give the Saudis a couple of days they say they're going to get to the bottom of it but I don't really have any doubt that this guy was murdered and murdered by the Saudis and I doubt it happened without the crown prince and other top people in Saudi Arabia knowing if that's the case you know I Know Democrats want to\nPressure Donald Trump into doing whatever they want to do and making this the biggest litmus test but let me remind people that Hillary\nClinton was in the Clinton Foundation kill millions from the Saudis she never brought up their hair ripping treatment of women killing gays and lesbians she never brought up one time\nSaudis she never brought up their horrific treatment\nOf women killing gays and lesbians she never brought up one time the persecution of Christians and Jews in Saudi Arabia um and the same would go for a look at how they treated Benghazi but with that said we already know the double standard exist what do you what do you think that's\nWhy I think I mean I think first of all that the president is right to be cautious or do indicate clothes that we don't necessarily know all the things that are going on in that I I think there will be very foolish\nFor us to a break a relationship with Saudi Arabia which is the key to containing Iran or what but I think we have to get to the bottom of the plumbing also point out to folks\nOh I'm just now of working on a novel for next year called collusion and watch the Russians are decide they want to poison the U.S Senate\nOr if I were writing a novel about a Saudi journalist being killed and the circumstances are just strange ... they're going to kill him in the Saudi consulate\nIn Istanbul knowing that the Turkish intelligence services monitor them all the time\nThey're going to do it with a team of Fifteen people um it's almost like\nIf they did do it and I'm not saying they didn't I mean clearly something terrible happened and and clearly\nInvade them on their sloppy and stupid and you know a ... it's unbelievable the position they put any of their allies and you're right we have this unprecedented alliance against Iranian had Gemini with the Saudis Israelis Emirates\nJordanians and Egyptians and you know now that creates massive complications\nPlowing but if you look at it you know we've said pretty clearly we're not going to tolerate the Russians poisoning people in Great Britain and to lead to very specific sanctions or I couldn't imagine a circumstance\nWhere if we do in fact decide that the evidence is overwhelming and there's the Saudis have at least promised secretary of state compared to what they are going to give him the full report out again or they may well be lying but if any and all we discovered that there\nAre key people in Saudi Arabia involved I suspect there'll be sanctions but that's different is one thing they have sanctions\nIs another thing you know to go wild and break up the the alliance and the relationship and the Israelis have been very clear that they regard Saudi Arabia has such an important a defense against Iran or do they have urged us to be very careful\nAnd this process\nWe got to go but um this is ... uh it does complicate things but people do remember that our arch enemy are aligned with U.S Russia the former Soviet Union to beat Nazi as a\nCenter right and I think sometimes you just said\nYou know we have taken steps against Russia\nIn concert with the British over killings trying to poison several people but we didn't we didn't go ... I think we may have to take significant steps here and sanctioned some people and blocks and people from coming to the U.S and I think frankly a the crown prince had better clean this up\nThose six hundred and forty two thousand crimes I mentioned included yeah murder in some cases\nHow many parents angel moms have we put on this program and angel dads\nOn this program and they tell the stories about illegal immigrants that were in the justice system that were let out\nOn the street because they were in a sanctuary city how the sanctuary state of California with a with a sanctuary state free health care for all legal or illegal candidate Gavin Newsom out there\nIn California they talk about ...
