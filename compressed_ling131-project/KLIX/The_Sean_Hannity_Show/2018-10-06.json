I was going to refuse for the last seven years we paid off over a hundred thousand dollars good for him and would have been in bankruptcy had a had we not gone through a few wow so ... to my question because this is a wonderful then it's fixing that happened\nOr we were my family my parents have received an inheritance a mineral rights in West Texas a large portion\nAnd uh haven't struck oil a lot of oil we've had it for a hundred years and had a fuel oil wells but not not a time\nMhm uh speculators are wanting to sell a or by our rights for a large sum of money\n[laughter] or over a million dollars [laughter] and we're deciding whether or not we should sell mhm and cash out or\nHopefully you know we're being told don't sell because there's going to be a boom and we want them out you know large nice inheritance and I want to make sure it's managed properly mhm\n[noise] well there's only a boom if it's not a dry hole and there's only a boom if after it's not a dry hole there is an actual uh oil prices that sustain\nA drilling a and and that's one reason west Texas is struggling run our prices are so far down that there's no boom\nOkay I mean when the gas the five dollars a gallon or the boom baby him again but uh and could that come back yeah I just probably depends on you know what OPEC does on turning on or off the faucet on the supply demand that's the issue all of that to say I'm no expert on the oil business I don't know much about it at all they get just about\nEverything I Know just in a\n[noise] but um and so the way I asked myself that question if I'm In your shoes and\nYou might answer the question differently than I Would because you might know more or your family might know more uh uh let me ask you this you have to sell all of them you have to sell all the way it was an all or none\nNo it's not an all or none are what are you it's it's simply a they're looking at a three million for all and uh and uh or you know obviously one point five for half okay so you just add\n... yeah and my biggest concern is a risk yeah we are not oil people\nYeah I think the only thing I'm asking is women I'm ... so you're only talking about selling your house\n[noise] we're deciding on how much does el\nAl ... like if I were in your shoes I don't know much about the oil business and if someone asked me if I had a pile of money in the middle of my kitchen table this debris million dollars on it when I go by oil rights with it my answer would quickly be no\nMainly because I don't like that much risk and I don't know much about\nOkay those two things would take it off the table for me I Would\nBuy something else with it that I that I Know a little bit more about like real estate\nAnd it's a little bit more predictable and less risk personally okay but that's the way you ask yourself the question if I had three million dollars in the middle kitchen table when I go go by our rights in West Texas where this is the answer is no then it's time to sell for the same reason I say you know that you wouldn't die and I was actually\nAnd that's that's what I agree with his getting the family to understand that you know we're we're afraid the stock market might crash\nWell it might but I ... I got to tell you start getting less rock markets less risk than growing\nTo understand the you know roar afraid the stock market crash yeah well it might but I got to tell you start in Las Vegas less risk than growing holes yeah\nWe're hundred percent sure that you don't walk around since tells you that you don't have to be a person to know that now uh so what I Would do a ... the family has to do these are family owned\nAnd so you can't just sell like yours off\n[noise] uh no this is I'm I'm helping my mother and father and I could have said oh I see so it's a just shut down they can make the decision for the whole thing or not yeah\nAll right then if I were in their shoes I Would at least to sell Seventy five percent of it\nAnd\nI probably would sell at all but on the off chance that they are just dying to be a little bit in their own business and they're scared to death so phone mo you know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and uh you know so that that you know if it struck out right after I sold it I regret it the rest of my life\nYou know those kinds of statements then maybe keep twenty five percent of it and sell Seventy five percent and then let's buy some real estate or by some mutual funds or something that's a whole\nSet of families entire portfolio\nThree million dollar network reach out of um\nNatural so I knew that I Would say no\nThis is that I ...

currently have a three vehicles two of them\nOn line that I use for work they're both paid off um I use a truck and then I also have a commuter car that I use regularly on most days of the week but

just didn't know since the car loan or they're ... percent interest should we just sell it to you know get rid of some of the dead or Shibley I'm should we keep it because it's ... percent of\nThe

three of these cars worth\n[noise] um the truck is probably worth about Fifteen my car's probably also worth about Fifteen her car we think we can probably sell it for about ten\nOkay cause one rule of thumb is you don't want vehicles things with motors in them totaled up being more than about half your annual income because then you've got too much stuff going down\nValue OK okay not violating that social were good on the second rule of thumb I use is can you be out of debt everything but your house in two years so what's your household income\n[noise] uh about a hundred and forty thousand good and how much\nDebt other than eleven thousand dollar car do you have not counting your mortgage\nOr we have about Ninety thousand\nOkay that that that includes the car the without a car and what is the Ninety thousand on [noise] mostly student loans or we have some tax stuff a medical bills\nOkay so can you pay off forty five year making one forty in the debt free in two years my answer would

the only income right now [laughter] um so I wanted to keep you know a good portion of that set aside and just cash and then kind of want to know what to do with the rats shut shut draw towards my how he owns a little bit every year or\nShould I put it someplace else\nWe teach Taylor is a process we call the baby steps it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial plan and as you lay the foundation that as you build a house and you put the roof on your financial planet tells you each time what to do and what to do first second and so forth\nSo I'm the baby steps one is styles dollars you've done that too was dead free but the home you've done that story is an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses um that's gonna be mandating\nA ... and so uh twenty thousand dollar emergency fund is adequate\nAs adjusted emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps four or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is putting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans now uh what do you make\n'em so a lot of the year\nIs the household income yeah okay All right and uh do you have a four one K. at work\nYou know I have a tension um that I put a about a hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks into it um so I didn't know how that played in the card as well\nOkay is that mandatory okay alright I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I published and we put Fifteen Percent aside Fifteen Percent of Seventy thousands and thousand five hundred\nOkay and that would be um around eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something do you have a four one K. available at work you don't\nKnow I Am very I currently have just opened up a rock or re ... with a better man which is on a kind of a bubble and high hundred for me I'm\nFamiliar with what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a ... a person that as an advisor today a\nOr coming there they're they're doing pretty good\nBut none of them are strong enough yet that\nI'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money and all those at this stage of the game there'll be a time and a place that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do with some or you know in certain situations and so forth but what I Would just go to mark bastard die Ramsey dot com click on the smart vest or pro\nLink and it'll drop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the ... business so I don't care what you do okay in fact my income at all but I people have always asked me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you you and your argument you you're married\nMarried um and have a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each uh\nUnless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you there and fifty five hundred as eleven thousand and that'd be fully fund and ... and I would have those in gross stock mutual funds I spread Mayan personal investments across four types of growth stock mutual funds that's also what I recommend and\nPut forth in growth in income uh fourth and growth a fourth and aggressive growth and a fourth in international now once you're doing that and you have the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that with you've already dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine\nAnd you've got it in mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine okay I just be watching that you could you could review that with a smart rest or pro and see if you know if they teach you anything that makes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is as fine there's no issue there um and then everything above that\nThat's maybe step three is ... by babysit for Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement five is addressed kids' college and it's different being there and you don't know how many kids how old they are and that kinda thing so we don't have a mouse on that but you're addressing it\nAny more or putting your to Roth IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent above that everything I can find in my budget uh\nAny extra money I come into I'll throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's maybe step six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last baby step and that's max out all retirement and I invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy\nSpecially when you get rid of your house payment so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house and then I'm going to set up those two Roth IRAs and any other money I'll find and my budget almost keep jumping around that\nHouse you're probably gonna that house paid off in three or four years at this right that's what it sounds like to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nI Do I'm great how are you don't or better than I deserve what's up\nAlready so I have a currently two hundred and twenty three thousand ain't that a hundred and Ninety three thousand is pretty normal it's currently with U.S Department of treasury um it as a result of having been additional from a service academy at three years ago\nAnd the remaining thirty case like a pretty normal debt I'm obviously a much smaller so my question is I'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I followed you for a while um should I continue\nPaying off the smallest at first or should I I'm just kind of start to save rapidly for the hundred Ninety three thousand of reason I ask is I Believe it's going to go actually I Know for a fact that will eventually end up any collections account if I'm not able to pay the amounts and fall um\nYeah um and what is your income now\nSo it varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be his year at least a about a hundred and a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year my also\nWow so you learn to you guys are on the side and so what I'm going to just put this on or Ninety three in the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can give you got wonderful income you'll be dead for two years\nSo I go into collections okay\nWhen you start to on top thirty thousand bucks this thing or if it's going to go away really really fast you make a lot of money you have to get on a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I Am never heard of this I'm curious I'm about to learn something\nYou went to a service academy one of the military academies got this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nRates are so yeah a little known fact that you're just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year either after serve through in the service or you're assigned\nTo the recruitment and death um and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it's if it's not a day it goes over to the U.S treasury\nSo you have the option of serving\nAs an enlisted person if you get this enroll for a period of time in its forgiven\nA yes or however my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge half the pay back\nSo like West Point as an example you can get hammered with fish I did not know that you have to learn something while well the only good news and there's a story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly\nTheme around airs teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be

have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nWrite I actually last January took myself off of her checking because\nHardware ... gotten my boyfriend is obviously not a bright boy so um\nHe was doing drugs you know and and so he wasn't in his right mind I rest\nMy case you got shut up [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to participate in her healing financially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom to this baby and have a good life\nAnd make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independence a mom of eventually my if you can get her back I\nWant you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and not be perpetual but to do that it was yeah I've been out but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn\nThat was yeah I've been out but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of his seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go to the seat again\nBut you like during the last time not because she was healthy but because she was on healthy yeah\nAnd I'd like to get her up and running and healthy\nYou know we got the meds worked out we got the counseling it's to the rest of her life she's got to balance that stuff but I don't know if she doesn't she don't hit the bridge every time man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially\nHere we are again borrow couldn't you know and and it's just I'm ... but the good news is I I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating for the people that habit\nAnd those that love them but the good news is I have seen a innumerable number of people that was a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper\nMedication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one\nOf them now she only for the Medicaid if it is she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not Medicaid\nAnd others you you don't want him just in a in a fall the rest of their life is\nI mean they add controlled or she'd only war to the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen yeah uh as as as him I really mentally ill and she says she's not on a couple of different minutes she does well her\n... her only shopping as what we're talking about but our goal is this girl to be forty four and all this to be a memory\n\nCan happen\nYeah and it happens to people all the time the what did she say right now when they call her on and so you get nothing so she does take up the phone\nAnd you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them because you just you know 'cause there I'm just I don't\nThink I should be talking she should\nBe telling them to be either one of the American long conversation it's I got nothing you get nothing because all they're going to badger her and that's not ... the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs go and then we start negotiating and trying to work our way through the death right\nWell my husband thinks that if this goes on a year or two and they will eventually come back and want to negotiate and\nI are going to negotiate after two months oh really yeah okay I think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months out there they're going our pliable\nToday but she's got no money and you're not giving or any no so they get nothing\nThey get nothing today now\nSix months from now she's balanced on her meds taking care of the baby working still living under your roof and give her the emotional support you can put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people go collectors\nAnd so let's say I mean she'll she'll I'm a little bit here Thirteen entered their eight under there does she say look it can we work at a deal yeah or you know are they\nAre you ... if you've ever seen any money in

Seventy five years old still works He works in a steel plant makes about four fifty to six fifty a week um [noise] about couple\nOf years ago he got sick I found out that he hadn't paid he's behind\nOn a lot of his bills and a somehow that got a\nFifty thousand dollar loan from the bank and ah he doesn't have them attention he gets about\nFifteen hundred and Social Security and I'm I'm just wondering what what what can I Do at this stage\nFor him um I Do provide him so I took over all the bills and I do provide him with about five hundred dollars a week on like a debit card that\nFor him to buy food and what are you doing with the rest of the gas it I'm Sorry what are you doing with the rest of the money oh I'm paying all on paying all his bills he still has about a\nFifteen K left on the equity loan ... two thousand on a credit card mhm eight thousand on a car and eight thousand on the house and there's so much are you able to put on the edge [noise] I'm putting everything wants to turn out to do everything on on the much\nMoney does that amount to\nWhat is it\nA month [noise] mhm\nI think it amounts to about a thousand a month\nThat's pretty good okay so he's got Fifteen and eight and two did I get the right\nIf any aid on the car eight on the house and she didn't want to credit card\nPoker and do you know if you divide that about four thousand a month I think you're done and the year okay I'm In your first goal would be to get him debt free you're done with a better year right here where I go get him to free 'cause he's Seventy five\nYears old and a show or does she plans I don't understand that right yeah so there's going to come a moment and it will come suddenly does he just can't do that and what I'm afraid of ...\nThey had a bank now and I'm someone at his age and the K and uh you know four and a and it can be paid off in twenty forty three now and back\nIn ... made that law\nWell two reasons one is they're stupid and the second reason is is that are counting on the house I've got to lean against the house right now that staff\nAnd some of the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on it upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral as part of it and so that's part of the equation the other part of the equation is is you know asking a bank or if you should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry\nI mean they'll they'll loan anybody this worry that are not breathing money you know what I'm trying\nThe lending has gotten completely out of control and stupid so there's nothing you know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing and ...\nAnd so the industry is just stupid is what it amounts to but uh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes people go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and it's like no they would've offered a dog that credit card so I\nMean and dead people get credit card offers show and you know it doesn't mean anything doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and doesn't mean you're alive\nIf you've got a credit card offer you could be a dead dog and get a credit card offer it can happen\nSo I mean you could be that low on the deal so that that's what you got to think through and\nJust be you've got to take care of him and you are you're doing a really good job congratulations Tom is with us in Dayton, Ohio I tell him how are you\nOn the umpires have I got to require retirement OK\nI'm here about a year ... and um I have a mental health before we came off of what he good mhm I click here at fifty two it'd be better to file for Social Security and we ... we have for\nThe whole time and\nYou can run the math out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four one K. on the mutual fund that money is growing at a faster rate than your\nSocial Security check will grow if you delay it and that's the way you're comparing it say how much of your weight from sixty three sixty five to start receiving it\nWill you know what is the rate of return\nYou know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more than a mutual fund generally sponsor um and then the other question comes up you know even if I don't need it should I take it um and I you know if you're willing to live on less than you make in in a sense invest some or all of it\nUm by not taking out your four one K. or by some other things that then usually comes out better to take it earlier uh\nBut but you know there's a lot of different parts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation\nOh that would definitely\nSay that [laughter] yeah so you got you had a kind of gas and you got to say you know average death age of a male and the U.S is Seventy six averaged as a death I drove a female in the U.S is Seventy eight but once you've lived to be sixty it's higher than that\nBecause that and those numbers included infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old you got real shot at Ninety according to the stat tables right now and so\nThat that's what you've gotta walk through and think through in the process so good question man thank you for joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five\nAnd the answer I taught how are you I'm doing pretty good how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nUm I Wish I spoke to the lady she said I can ask your question and I just got the starter pack off of your website for myself for my for my daughter who's thirty one I'm fifty two and\nUm I've been a dream or I guess for a free spirit as you would say from listening to your show addict away now for the last two weeks [laughter]\nI Know who you were before that it's All right but um my wife and I sat down and we've never been able to agree on money um she's the shaver um the spender and just I don't you know I don't know what the money situation is where I go and spend it [laughter]\nAnd I'm five we've set aside step one we've got a thousand now we've put aside to the shaving she wants to save more than that but [noise]\nShe I'm she's always ran the show and I've been kind of just kind of go along with her at this point um [noise] we paid off to credit cards\nAnd we paid off another credit card my question is is\nBy doing so many things right now I'm In the only thing I'm concerned me is about down the road is my retirement and I worked for a company with Fifteen Years and I've got about\n... eldest daughter pack was the total money make over both in their\nYes it is I started to read that I haven't read it\nYou know what I make over has every detail about the seven baby steps as the seven baby steps on steroids and so it's going to walk you through first thing you do just have a thousand dollars you get on\nA written plan you and your wife or an agreement and we're gonna we're in agreement there we're going to work this plan together okay and want you to do that then you're first goal was to squeeze out of your budget as you say that I was in dollars if you've already got money saved\nThen we would save only a thousand dollars of
