Saudi Arabia immediately\nTo discuss what's been going on here\nAnd it gets almost more bizarre by the sec and now the allegation has banned that the Saudi ... crown prince ordered the killing of this guy Jamal ... now he's a Saudi national who's been critical of the Saudi royal families Washington Post contributor\nAnd he's a U.S resident but he's not a citizen he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey October the second he hasn't been seen by anybody since that day the Turkish government had suggested that ... was killed by a Fifteen member Saudi his team\nWho then dismembered his body and smuggled out and\nOf the consulate in pieces to an unknown destination but so far the evidence supporting that up to today has been heroes some reports claiming that show these murder was recorded but to date no audiotape know videotape not even the Turkish government which is no great friend of America is currently feuding with Saudi Arabia over other issues\nSaying an absolute saying it's absolutely sure could show he was killed by anyone they can't say it let alone the Saudis now there's just began to break moments ago\nAnd are reports of now surface that Saudi Arabia is preparing a report in which in fact they will admit Jamal 'cause show gave this is the Washington Post columnist now this is a very dangerous we start seeing journalists killed\nWent missing earlier this month was killed by interrogation gone wrong um when he entered the I guess the Saudi consulate in Istanbul right here to talk about it we have Morgan Ortega's is with us national security global affairs analysts former U.S treasury attached Shay\nTo Saudi Arabia lived in Saudi Arabia two years\nAh she along with dam bond Gino former Secret Service agent author as well as the now best selling book a Spygate thank you both for being with us um Oregon you lived in Saudi Arabia two years this just breaking there's been a mystery up until like an hour ago what do you think\nHe I guess when I Lived there for ... fountain pen in Iraq that\nI needed something like this striking and the reason I get it because when the president that this morning and he's sending secretary I'm here to Saudi Arabia that meet the secretary of state when it is these people in the world certainly in the government has canceled on plans to try halfway around the world um I I Do think\nUh we're we're going to be under tremendous pressure to come clean with whatever it is so if there were purchased people believe and we're still going to have to just if if the records are out there as what what comes out or is that the Saudis are claiming some sort of responsibility for this looks like they're not going to they're they're going to claim the senior leadership was not involved\nBut that people are in charge of it who ordered it would be held accountable there's a lot\nTo learn how was that there is no until now because it shows how would they not know until now or what had happened in their consulate in Istanbul\nThat doesn't have to question and I think the big takeaway that I\nHeard from this report we'll see what happens with secretary on pay me to them all at the readout as it does not only need to to come clean on this end and satisfy\nPresident Trump the secretary compel you know they have an audience and and the Congress and the Senate that they are also accountable to mind you this massive arms deal is a memorandum of understanding it has not been signed by the president has bipartisan consensus for sanctions people like Rand Paul have actually\nBeen very vocally among supportive of the relationship I don't agree with Senator Paul for a number of reasons that I could go into\nWhy I think the relationship it is important but the Saudis need to understand how serious that says we need to know who's going to be held accountable and I think that they're going to continue to see massive a\nMovement away from their big finance arm is just a few weeks secretary Mnuchin supposed to be there we saw the Dow fell off this afternoon as reports\nAnd they were threatening to take care yeah well they were threatening you know maybe even using the power of their oil of impact any\nOf the there was a price to pay or any retribution from the U.S dam bond you know I mean it's getting more bizarre buy them in and out of somebody in this particular case walk into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never get seen again\n[noise] [noise] yeah that that's highly unlikely show they're really two aggravating factor is year one year already brought up the fact that this happened I'm In a conflict of a diplomatic facility that that I mean that breaks every single a protocol moral ethical role imaginable\nSecondly Sean uh aggravating as well and you know aggravating is is probably enormous enormous understatement here is that he was a member of the media not that this has ever permissible please I'm not saying I'm just suggesting that this makes it even worse on the scale of Savage reads the fact that this individual off your so he was a member of the media makes it even worse\nNow how could it happen in a diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing\nIt's highly unlikely but having said that you know there's there's two sides of this there's the side that said way back let's see let's get the facts looks like some of the facts are starting to come out now but we do need the Saudis\nThere's this is not a ... as simple as a black and white situation we do need the Saudis the relationship with the Israelis are starting to improve we need them were on a razors edge with the Iranians of their nuclear program so this has\nTo be viewed that way and I do think Trump get one more thing or shall I I think the Saudis did screw up big time when they seemingly tried to make these veil threats that they were going to respond you know we were supposed to be responded to there was no you can't just let this go so that was a bad move\nYeah they're ... to ... and just\nTo say that the thing that not only the threats that worries me that Dan just said\nIt seemingly the Saudis need to answer why they lied to the president unless you know the president came out and said that they came and ... among the crown prince I've called Jared Kushner who's working on the scale unless there's something that we don't know about it looks like they have like the president and I think that they need that there's a lot of explaining to be done there\nWell I think they're going to try and pass it on to an underlying that was in the consulate in in Istanbul and say oh we didn't know but I mean I I Can't imagine for a second that they don't have cameras all over the consulate in Istanbul you spent two years in the in the in Saudi Arabia\nFor a second that they don't have cameras all over the consulate in Istanbul\nYou spent two years in the in the in Saudi Arabia and well okay you're going to happen I mean ... there's been

I'm sure you had to cover up of you left if you went out and public anywhere and what was life life like for you as a woman living under the sharia there\nYou know this is such an excellent point that

already we've had\nEight years of this and the fact that we're our memories or that short it's frightening at times to me All right back to our busy phones as we say\nHi to skip is in Utah skip Hi how are you glad you called\n... thanks so thanks for taking my call um I was listening to the users you ask the question what are these people run on the thing that I see the most ... for the most is they seem to be running on a hatred for America I'm a you know I don't put up with everything that America stands for is just seems to be being destroyed by these\nI don't want to wait until the broad brushing say luminal left the left hates America I think there is a a a significant even at times portion\nOf the radical left in this country that literally they hate American exceptionalism America's role in the world\nUm they don't like our economic system they believe in they don't believe in capitalism they support socialism they bought redistribution they don't want freedom um and you see an anger that has emerged cause I think they are now focused all of their anger on Donald Trump in all things Trump\nAnd you know it's just it's just pouring out of his own you know we've tried a lot of these policies we've tried apologizing we'd try bribing dictators under Obama we tried redistribution under Obama we've tried socialized medicine under Obama\nAnd he's the first president never to reach three percent GDP Growth in the history of the country\nYou know we know the disaster of Obamacare nope millions lost their doctors their plans and they paid twice three times the amount they weren't paying in spite of promises\nA we know that at the end of his eight years we had Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps and eight million more in poverty you know numbers means something and frankly to go back\nTo these failed policies now look Obama might even be considered moderate compared to where the Democratic party is in the house in the Senate today\nObama might even be considered moderate compared to where the Democratic party is in the house and the Senate today\nYou know you have one moderate that Joe Manchin that's it and the rest of 'em are all pretty radical left and they don't apologize for their quote socialist beliefs that is the emerging Democratic Party", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Twin
