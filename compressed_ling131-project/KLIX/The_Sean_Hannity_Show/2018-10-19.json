were going to win because they had the media in their pocket and still do\nThen they said you know what we got to abandon um the free market place we have to now going assassinate people and this is very similar what happened in Germany and bringing it back to the\nLast thing that you you know it's funny I saw some press you're not saying that they that that people today are like Nazis killing people what you're saying is that there are similar lying ... propaganda mishaps elation demonization very different from saying that they're a death camps\nYeah I mean this is look that can't happen in America thank God because our structure is still in place to prevent anything like that happening but I'll tell you what antifa no different than the essay George Soros behind the scenes with tens of millions of dollars\nTwo agencies that are bent on destroying human beings and we talked about this last time I was on a program what happened to Brett Kavanaugh\nEvery American should pay attention to that because of that guy can go down on uncorroborated are uncorroborated than anybody in this country can\nAnd as you rightly pointed out to try to with Trump on the Russian collusion that's collapsing all over the place the fusion GPS guy put out a dicey a ... taking the Fifth Amendment now won't testify what does that tell you okay so\nYou know we're living in a dangerous time\nLet's let me in children's zoo this you're I'm agreeing with you that that what really got exposed to me that scares me a lot and there's two things one is we ever do justice system we don't have equal justice\nOr equal application of our laws these me look at Hillary Clinton she ... the biggest obstruction of justice slam dunk case ever but the problem here is we had one party literally before the American people you mentioned Kavanaugh abandon all principle constitutional law\nAnd the and and literally core values that have served us so well which are due process the presumption of innocence the Republican for the first time in their life that something right\nThey handled it with the seriousness the topic deserves they would thorough they did it right and at the end of the day there was no corroboration\nTo the allegations being made and now we see people like what Eric Holder kicked come we can't be civil Hillary Clinton getting their face Cory Booker or Maxine\nWaters you see these cabinet people you get a crowd and you follow them into a grocery stores department stores gas stations and you tell them we don't want them nowhere anymore that's what he said nowhere\nElse for you it's amusing that you ran down the list in a way we could add ten more and then Trump goes to Montana and makes a joke a joke about the Republican candidate for Senate they're um slam dunk ... reporter [laughter] you know\nAnd it was obviously said ingest and no press goes wild crazy yet all the things that you pointed out are somehow over look\nAnd not overlooked it they they do to Harris\nYeah yeah well because now they're in concert there the the American media is in concert\nWith the Democratic party and that's I don't think that's ever happened before in this republic where the the eighty percent of the media now is promoting a political party so it's going to be fascinating to see the backlash in the election coming up in November I Do believe there will be one\nI don't know the extent of it\nI don't think anybody does anything anyone that says they know a doesn't know I don't think a lot of people saw what happened on twenty sixteen I said it's absolutely possible that Donald Trump is going to win then ... then the the five\nDays of on the factor five days before he was going to win because people didn't like Hillary Clinton and they're they're even going to stay home or vote against her and that's exactly what happened but I Want to I just want to reinforce just because I Know you can't say it on your TV and radio show but what\nYou're going to you saying then they're going to attribute it to me and then I got an ally and had a lot so rightly say the stuff he won't get it right you have\nNo idea what I'm going to talk about it because nobody ever does and nobody tells\nMe I don't even think can you or me either no what we're going to save a car before comes flying out of our mouths now\nBut what would you do every day I mean you're you're

talk about it yeah right you know I Hope you have you done how many lives on right on and the conservative commentators are all\nIn danger and and this is you know to me I'm I'm saying to myself just got to be exposed number one and it's got to stop number two and you can't have people at telling a emotionally disturbed individuals hey surround them when they're in a restaurant\nI mean that should
