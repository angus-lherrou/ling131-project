know what at the end of the day individuals are responsible for their own behavior although it does sound\nLike the orders have been sent\nOut to get in people's faces and confront them and tell

Sebastian Gorka just mentioned a skull east\nNobody match skull lease yesterday an attempted assassination of the United states congressman on that Virginia ball fields company's talked about that you\nKnow why do I know that they don't hire about it I mean the only reason those guys are alive today and this goes to something I Know this is near and dear to your heart is because you had to Capitol police officers that did what probably their training told them not to do\nAnd that is they walk in an open field with pistols\nGoing up against a rifle a and a guy hidden behind a barrier now that basically is is is a suicide mission to save someone else's life that's how brain was\nShot listen they these men and women do it all the time it's just like the men and women to be a joint terrorism task force now or the FBI the New York city police this New York state police\nOr they're going to go out there a risk their lives to five person responsible for these devices now I I Want to practice that is that the prices are real uh I don't know I I'm I'm starting to have a a a real and claimed that\nThese may not be real devices I'm ... and if that's true um where a lot better off nobody's going to get hurt\nBut I find it really suspicious that you've at eight or nine of these things so far in usually the trigger mechanism for these devices is the actual opening of the package while there's been several open and none of them have\nDetonated which tells me\nThere is some sort of problem so I'm hoping they're not real I'm and I'm hoping that the authorities find them sooner than later I think\nThe ... billion in cuts search go because they have so much now forensic evidence here I'm assuming you know we we talk about this yesterday that it looked none of this is easy but I'm I'm assuming by now they probably have their eyes on somebody\nAbsolutely absolutely I said yesterday you'll have you know probably twenty four to Seventy two hours a day in and I stand by that\nThere's not nor nor nor much some enormous amount of evidence that they've been able to capture because these things to knock that day and I think we'll see something soon\nOr a doctor Gorka we give you the last word today\nThe bottom line is we run these people to ground we released the plot how we throw the book of them but it doesn't matter what side you're on the the responsibility for the normalization of violence\nAs started on the left when you have an a former attorney general who work for President Obama say when they're down you kick them when you have Hillary Clinton say we're going to be civil often we win the election nobody on the rise says that it's the left responsible if you put the ...\nShe said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the issue of the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast\nIn America between two candidates and the more people were hearing about that the better off we are and I basically have help serve as a bridge to President Trump's really strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate\nAnd so that's one of the president's coming very strongly behind me she knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today a I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nWhile he votes with them when they count so you know I don't like the Taliban are naming of post offices a procedural vote\nFor him I Do not have a ... well let's talk about the votes where he Donald Trump really could have you on his boat healthcare being one\nWell that's right so Joe mansion said no to getting rid of Obamacare\nAnd having a really high quality affordable health care options in the mountains state Sean in West Virginia premiums have risen over a hundred and sixty percent in four years and matching said no to fixing getting rid of Obamacare\nAnd I think the west Virginians didn't like that they also didn't like the fact that Joe mansion\nFixing getting rid of Obamacare\nAnd I think that West Virginians didn't like that\nThey also didn't like the fact that Joe mansion said no to the Trump tax\nCuts that are really giving a big left to our state providing economic opportunity better jobs Joe Manchin has\nTo side with Chuck Schumer the leadership on every issue when it matters Manson says no one even on ... where people say oh he ended up voting for capping off the reality is he waited he actually left the Senate\nA vote in chamber and waited until Susan Collins cast a vote and then and only then to Joe Manchin step out because he knew if he didn't do that it was politically death\nIs toe so I you know I kind of used a lot of those votes as you know election conversion year votes and that's the point of the vote for the tax cuts um and you know maybe not as extreme as as everyone else in his party but the reality is is that he's going to vote for Chuck Schumer to be the majority leader\nAnd I don't think Chuck Schumer can get ... votes in West Virginia which makes mansion out of touch with the people in West Virginia and wish I would say I was an important issues like tax cuts regulation energy those are three main fundamental issues\nThat that affect an impact the economy in West Virginia also I Know West Virginia like a lot of places have struggled with the opioid issues and we do with the president did yesterday and what he's been doing since he became president\nWell that's one of the big issues in this race that Joanne since first vote will be for Chuck Schumer\nAnd Chuck Schumer is made no bones about the fact that she's going to head out the obstruction resistance impeachment caucus and if you're part of that Schumer leadership team and Joe mansion is and you're empowering these liberals the folks that really created all the luck destroying the Kavanaugh hearings\nThen you're part of the problems so that's why people were so focused on Joe mansions first vote because they know he's not going to be with West Virginia and he's going to be part of a team that's tearing down the president West Virginians don't want that\nAnd that's why we're gaining so much momentum in our campaign\nHow much money is the Democratic party putting into West Virginia sick to try and keep in other words how much ... company and below sea and company or are they investing in the negative ads about you\n[noise] well they put a fortune and I'd say by a what by all accounts they're going to probably be up over twenty four twenty five million dollars and this is West Virginia this is not New York California or Florida they'll probably end up spending about ... million more\nWe're going to look at the final couch and that's what happened on you mentioned earlier you know if you get pounded for months on end of that and you can't respond it makes it difficult but now the president came back twice he's actually our side we think is going to come back again\nAnd we start to combat twelve to ten eight six to or to to you know to even\nAnd that's because President Trump has made this a top priority\nWhen this early voting began in West Virginia as it started your\nEarly yeah early voting started yesterday\nAnd so we're starting to look at the numbers one thing we see is that the Republicans have\nA lot of energy and people know that the future of the Senate could really be at stake what this election and\nThat there's a clear choice so we're feeling good about it or not cocky but we're going out worked Joe mansion that people are gonna know on the conservative fighter will help the President Joe mansion he's a dishonest Washington did liberal and he's never there when you need 'em\nAll right we're watching the race now put this in the top ... column a where we once thought it was a leaning Democrat now the state of West Virginia and play attorney general Patrick Morrisey would support the president\nYou should know sadly would vote for Chuck Schumer said anyway it's a deadline and race at this point and uh with early voting a there is a very good shot that that could change hands that would help a future endeavors in the U.S Senate and we wish all the best

from the left it's been ignored by most in the media has been very little coverage I forgot to mention the severed head of a president they didn't seem to outraged about that most people\nAnd now there again there's a selective moral outrage being about Russia\nOr being about sexual assault or allegations of such or about you know vitriolic rhetoric for actions I mean you have people threatening to beat up the president destroy the president bomb the White House and I didn't see the type of outrage we're now hearing from the left\nHaitian you know I think this is happening on both sides and I think there's no excuse for it you know I listened to evict cut the plate and people are hard at work I doing the same thing that we have to be like she asked about the extent to which the president is also a ... threat and it talked about violence\nAnd out of the I ask you when he was and what you do is you give me this the predictable liberal talking point I asked you very very specifically\nAbout all of the rhetoric that has led up to where we are we've now in the last month watch woman after woman after woman being run out of a restaurant by left wing mobs and the same left wing media didn't have anything to say\nAnd every one of those rich as a matter of at the new CNN wouldn't let their anchors use the word\nMob well because that's a ... for the whole point it's a reality you know when you know you don't have those things are mobs going after those people I Do I'm not going to defend it I don't think it's right is it a mob to be able to sign it looks like a month to me I also\nHad anything to prevent any talent police officers in Long Island ... when I get in the back at a paddy wagon [laughter] you know calling the media the enemy of the people because you and I both know that for the most part journalists from across the political spectrum I just people trying to you know\nThey don't respect I don't see that I see a media that has been corrupted and complicit in advancing conspiracy theories lies and pure hatred of all things Donald Trump what do you see Jonathan\n[noise] will tell you one thing uh I I I Will say that I don't think it's a mob I think it is organized gangs\nAnd that's a big difference in a mob a mob or people that may or may not have the same interests that gather a to do a certain thing but in this case these people have organization they don't just show up somewhere\nA ... wants these people show up again and again and again that's a very important thing that we need to look at um [noise] uh\nIt is to the the way the conversation is going over the past couple of days though I I Want to show and I think everybody needs to look at one thing or all that rhetoric that you played at the beginning of this\nWas very specific about violence very specific about who to target and when\nI look at it at the response which you had which I've seen from other people are when Brock Obama was an office I'm In the case of the shooter that shot a um the mystery squeeze 'em what you saw where people not blaming Bernie Sanders\nBut what you see here and I find this so hard is that uh these devices have been put out there that somebody went the distance to to put these things together to ah to carry out a plan\nCovertly to put the things in place all at once and none of them went off and immediately the rhetoric starts in a way\nThat is organized\nAnd now I'm not saying they have something to do with whoever put these out there but the organization of their rhetoric is so disgusting legal low on the political chain that it it does make one pause and asked um was this rhetoric\nThey're very alarming thing\nWas that I got Daniel\n[noise] you know I just I just want to make it really clear I'm not blaming the president's today I think that there is playing the light across the entire political spectrum and what I think regular people like me see if\nI go out and the world I deal with people who don't necessarily agree with I get my job's done I said I I Would hide and somehow I managed to get around the world around this country get around my city\nInflaming tensions and the people around me and I just don't understand what is wrong with politicians that I cannot get their job is done without this kind of planetary rhetoric\nJonathan the way I look at it as this is now gone on two years of vitriol hatred lies conspiracy theories on a level we've never seen before and what's worse is you know when the president says the fake news\nA lot of it has been fake news it's not even news all of his political commentary called up as news and it's not news at all there are these are not news channels these are opinion channels\nYou know I don't see much real reporting from fake news CNN or or even NBC ABC or CBS anymore they're all run by liberal activists George Stephanopoulos has an agenda\nHe's a he's been Clinton through in through his entire life and he hasn't changed one bit and it's not any different on CBS or NBC or any of the two cable channels\nAnd you know it's interesting I say I'm a talk show host part of my job is to give opinion but I also reports straight news we do investigative reporting we've been doing it for example we've added Obama when no one else would we ... the deep state more deeply than anybody else in the media\nAnd so that's part of what we do giving opinion is part of what we do well like the whole newspaper they say they're only the news part of the newspaper but they're really the opinion part\nYou know Sean I I've been on your TV show on the radio show I've been around you for five years now and one thing that I can truly say whether it be you or anybody else on Fox News and and a lot of these other networks out there is that when\nWhen something like this happens\nAnd all these Democrats are having these devices deliver to them you're not going to see what else on NBC today where they have the the uh down below where they have the headline a bullet with a reporter and it says that Trump opposition is getting devices delivered to their to their addresses Trump opposition\nThat that's the way that they're they're playing this so they're automatically putting suspect on Trump just by the way that they are labeled the lower half of the screen\nI mean it it is it's it's it's such political um this tasteful rhetoric\nThat when you couple that with the things like McDonald's said with the things that are these politicians are are instigating people to go out and carry out these things Trump never it never has said anything that inflammatory and by and large\nThe reason his words or so or inflamed it's not because of him it's because of CNN and MSNBC and these leftist politician that go out and pump it up to something that he never made it to be\nWe're going to have to leave it there are Jonathan Gillum author or she no more thank you Danielle McLaughlin attorney\nA and a soon to be a mom for I Believe
