he did something that nobody else did they actually took the time to actually look at Donald Trump's real background railroads his family his father and you know you tell a lot of gripping stories in a book about how well the mean horrible landlords\nActually weren't so mean after all when people came on hard times they would work with people and help people\nThat's absolutely true story that's actually the Carol want a family in thirty forty your friends and stuff\nAnd I wanted to relate that story you know an auto it quickly or Fred Trump showing up to collect rent with is twenty six year old son Donald J truck in in there walking through the uh the garden apartments knocking on doors Carolina family cannot pay the rent the father as lost the job is a blue collar worker\nFred and it's sort of looking at him saying okay no problem are very on guy\nLet's wait a month let's see what happens I suspect you'll get a job low and behold a sixty short days later a he gets a job pays the rent that he was old\nAnd it's just a wonderful story that their family never\nBe going to be told by the mainstream media above people talk about what does the president has compassion for these people does the president of empathy\nAnd the answer is yes he learnt that at the riding shotgun with his father was he was either building these buildings helping to build these buildings are collecting rent from blue collar people that were living shot so so I wanted I did a ton of research on the book\nI wanted to tell the story arc of the Trump family which is a great American success in many ways the additive family is also an American success story the arts are different uh and the generational transfers are different are but they're all part of America that both part of fabric of America\nYou know the the generations that built this country and I know you're Scaramucci Hannity Trump it doesn't matter\nBut the generations I built this country are just amazing people the immigrants that built this country by grandparents all for coming from Ireland uh anyway the book is called the Trump the blue collar president Anthony Scaramucci it's up on Hannity dot com Amazon dot com and\nFrom Ireland uh anyway the book is called the Trump the blue collar president Anthony Scaramucci chip on Hannity dot com Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere Anthony good to see we're going to see on TV this week we look forward to my friend and all the best in your book tour and I hope people will run out and get a copy of it because it's worthwhile reading\nAt San when I when we heard this I I couldn't believe it I mean I was deployed on nine eleven or the Taliban Herbert al ... who came and killed three thousand Americans since then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops to include truthful I was deployed over there\nI've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nOr we would you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them in our a tan but oftentimes ah you know the ... the the firefighters happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on\nA taxi way as the ... the flag draped casket would come through and there was a silence there and everyone is saluting giving our final salute to these American heroes\nWho perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates and for her to be able to say that she's OK with an American going to join the Taliban to fight against us\nI mean that in and of itself should have had her suspend her campaign and Arizona\nTo not vote for ... this is really personal for those of us who served and was shot at by the Taliban and and saw Americans perished over this\nUh you know I hear the emotion in your voice and understandably so I mean you said six deployments that's amazing\nYeah well and again it was an absolute honor there's so many Americans who have done that and more\nAre both on the ground in the air and I see I mean this is this is you know why we fight or to protect our way of life and our freedoms and our liberties are in it you know this and it is you know in addition to this a comment saying it's okay for an American to join the Taliban to basically commit trees and she also was protesting right after\nNine eleven protesting our troops in a pink to to a flyers handed out at protests that she led depicting our troops as skeletons in saying stop the U.S terror\nIn the middle east so this isn't just a one off for her uh this is the pattern she advocated is shut down Luke air force base\nI hosted the president President Trump at Luke air force base on friday to see what an amazing national security treasure it is she's trying to cover up or tracks and with George Soros Chuck Schumer and the millions of dollars that are flowing in to you know cover\nTheir tracks and Turner into something that she's not in the greatest political cover up in Arizona history a lot of people think she's moderate a lot of people think she's right of center a and it's just not true and we\nGot only coming out on a three weeks before the election I mean it's almost on a daily basis it's like the you know a a deep dive dump has been made but I Would think that has is common knowledge or had to have been common knowledge about her I mean I I wouldn't underestimate remember the allegations against the blind shakes attorney that she invited\nTo Arizona State university I mean that's another slap in the race to people\nActually look at you know we are sort of joke that the Democrat Party should have done better in internal opposition research on her before they add Herbie Chuck Schumer top recruit for them to try to flip the Senate majority we knew about her radical\nCats uh we've been telling people about it in Arizona every single day uh and that and the last few weeks or right some some videos and and things are coming out every single day but unless you're on conservative radio conservative TV Fox\nOr another and social media you're not finding out about this and so we still have enough a number of independents and Republicans whoever's not tuning it unfortunately that need to know every time we have to put up and add to put some of these statements and like you just played at cost us about seven hundred thousand dollars\nTo make sure the message gets out to the voters as they are voting every single day right now\nAnd she's had so much money jumping into her you know and if people do on a supporter of course they can go to make Sally for Senate dot com 'cause we really do need to have to make sure Arizona they're aware\nOf Arizona are aware of all of this they will never vote for her if they're aware of your heroic background they absolutely will vote for you\nUm I've only gotten to get to know you in in recent months and I got to tell you I'm more impressed every single time I talk to you and I think it would be a great senator from the state of Arizona I Hope you're not going to turn into Ben Sasse and run away from me after you get elected but a mess up and more than willing to honor\nYou know it's on you may not remember but back when I was a major in the air force I took out in the Pentagon because they were making our\nService women wear ... when they were in Saudi Arabia and I put my career on the line and I actually sued the department of defense\nOr fought for eight years and got legislation passed to overturn this and I actually went on the Hannity income show during that whole thing ah to talk about how important it was to protect our religious liberties and not say\nIt was a very you know that that was that was a good move I mean I I don't like the idea of American Soldiers are are on foreign soil and were there to protect them and help them which is usually the case\nTo go by their customs were Americans we get to follow her own customs or else you want us there and then you don't want us there\nExactly that's exactly the way we were there it was a it was a U.S military policy it was ridiculous I stood up for it I thought for it took me eight years but I finally got legislation passed as a citizen or to overturn it and make sure that our values are that were set up for it yeah\nWell I really I was going to be with you and hear an ... Martin Luther king Dolly if you're not paying attention to this race in Arizona you need to pay attention of course in cinema you know supporting radicals like the Taliban while Martha ... doing her six tour of duty twenty eight years serving our country ah she's got one of those crazy pink hats on\nYou know talking down our troops and accusing them than she accused him of torture as well\nAs she was a line with a radical uh anti border patrol a group down at the border trying to help uh you know help with illegal immigration and that group ah accused the border patrol of torture yes it was a ... again radical extreme group that she was very much involved in a in the inner path\nWhat do you think the president needs to do with the seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border if they make it to the border what's the best ... playing for the president\nOr this is absolutely ridiculous we have got to\nStop them from coming in the president needs to use all elements of power that he has shown we're seeing little mini caravans coming in every single day though because they're taking advantage of our loopholes in the law\nUh I work very closely that President Trump are often called the good that bill that was also the Knicks Sally bill that would provide thirty eight billion dollars for the border wall to secure our border and close the loop holes at the cartels\nAre taken advantage of it has to stop every single day right now there's people coming in and ...\nUh and that's a sector that is being overrun right now all they do have a lot on there many times they don't they released into the interior of and I said sixteen thousand five hundred family member units in September the highest ever recorded this is not certain President Trump's fault it's a Democrat's fault for obstructing a closing these loopholes and securing the border\nAnd the president as frustrated as the eye and you need to use everything he's got enough to to get to to put pressure on Mexico and\nThen they usually don't win funding or and fully funding all yes\nAnd you have voted our belt thirty eight billion dollars including building a wall yes or\nWould you vote to repeal Obamacare the both of John McCain decided to change his mind on\nWell San I did vote to repeal and replace Obamacare on a house bill I'm getting my asking for it right now because it's being misconstrued by the Democrats they're trying to uh you know invoke fear in people who have family\nMember wait a minute and I know Arizona didn't how many Arizona's lost their plans lost their doctors and are paying infinitely higher rates because of Obamacare\nYes Obamacare as they held in Arizona there's only one choice in fourteen of counties because no choice people lost their health\nCare coverage where people right now it's resisting conditions who can't get access to health insurance because of the failures of Obamacare So I worked hard to make sure that we were moving away from that uh and and towards something that gives more choice people more flexibility at the state level more free market get the\nFederal government you know to not be doing this one size fits all top down penalties taxes and mandate it's failed and so we you know I voted yes again I've got millions of dollars attacking me right now misconstrue ring that vote\nI voted to protect people with preexisting conditions oh that's good intentions but their policies are wrong we need more conservative policies to bring the cost down and provide\nMore options for people to get access to insurance\nA ... a really a rock star a hero who served their country unimportant race for the Republicans as the not only want to maintain control of the U.S Senate but also to build their majority in the Senate\nAn important race for the Republicans as they not only want to maintain control of the U.S Senate but also to build their majority in the Senate and they'll make votes for Supreme Court justice was a lot easier\nGoing up against the very radical leftist in the name of Chris and send them a thank you so much a Martha McSally for all you've done for your country and and the positions you take and ah you should win this race\nFar and wide when the people of Arizona fully understand the record the background and the radical views of Christ and send them a thank you for being with us Martha McSally\nThanks I appreciate you signing a flashlight on that and an advocacy and if people want to how they can go to Nick Sally for Senate dot com you need your support and how and donations weaken my nesting and some I\nThink you rod is in Florida crushed view on the Sean Hannity show how are you right\nOr left CERN resolution on your show dedicated listener concerns my concern is the Supreme Court list that the president\nAt actually a presented when he was Ron Paul is okay and the reason why my concern is is is because magic close is already a put the news out there that they do smear campaigns\nAnd they've done continuously they want us out of transparency and so we've given trance parents like open up our playbook so they can actually investigate every person on that list so whoever President Trump actually nominates they've already got a team investigating that specific personal attack on a smear campaign", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city":
