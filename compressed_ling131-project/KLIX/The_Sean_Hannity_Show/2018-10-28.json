miles yeah does that does that manifest itself in pain yes okay and that's been since you\nHaven't been pretty much you know okay in the hormone thing that that concerns me quite a bit of hormone you said their own issues and she on medication\nUm yeah yet some damage from the yesterday and stuff like that because cats are better for us that she okay yes from different medications which could affect that\nAbsolutely not only could probably do I mean there's a lot to it and the reason why I wanted to kind of hear that stuff um because those\nAre those things you you need to see a medical doctor and see how this plays and she's got a\nUh have interest in doing that because she's going to have to play a big part um script surely the reason why we can go straight to scripture because\n... I can tell there was something underline there's some other concerns or as well but uh I Would encourage you to read first Corinthians chapter seven and goes through the concept of um the principles for married life and\nI'm One of those things uh inverse five talks about not depriving one another\nOr of sex when you're married um you should never deprive each other of sex except for times of prayer andme inspiration period so I'm ... and I know sometimes people have headaches where it doesn't matter coming together and having that time to be together is very important for both men and women and\nIt's healthy so it sounds to me like this is beyond just celibacy\nOr her not being interested uh and it sounds like a ... beyond just the spiritual needs and the and the things that I mentioned and first Corinthians seven is a that there's some medical issues that need to be addressed and I'm the only\nThing about sex or when you were married there's a a partnership that\nScott is something that you've built along with your wife and you build it up and you say you're you're good looking man I'm sure she's a beautiful woman and and those are the things that that first\nDifferent things in each other and it's exciting and um you engage in this there's a\nWonderful God given union a\nThat is a is only for you guys you know it it's intimate and\nIts connective and it's beautiful and all those things but outside of the picture it's like a watching 'em you know people dance without music it looks silly\nAnd if people thought about what they were doing when they when they dance it becomes silly but when you're just feeling and music and letting yourself go it's wonderful so similarly uh so as sex in marriage that when you let yourself go and you are so connected then you just ... act\nAnd you do and you enjoy\nBut if you start to parse it or intellectual lies it or make\nToo much out of it it becomes awkward and weird so when there's a space of time of any kind let alone three or four years or re engaging that part of your life will be strange and not it is exciting like when you were first married strange\nWhere you're learning about each other's bodies and wants and desires and things like that it becomes\nA new type of strange because\nWhether you believe it or not or whether you're good looking she's good looking whether you've been with people in your past her she's been with the it doesn't matter there's still that that does that desire to be accepted by your partner and in the back of your head the thought well that I Do something\nTo make her not want me or a\nHer thinking well you know I've gone through you know hormone issues and medical issues and and\nI don't know maybe she has scars or doesn't our bodies are body has changed and there's a new awkwardness that comes to a ... it comes to play in the situation and and so you know it it's going to be awkward and I think in order to bring that back\nOne I think sharing times of intimacy and scripture and prayer and things like that is a great start to um to get into some counseling possibly with the pastor um to help guide you guys back into that part of your lives and three ah and very important is to\nGo see a seek medical help and sit down with a doctor in really go not just for the aches and pains of for the things she's going through but you go in with her and talk about the fact that you guys aren't having a sex that you guys aren't coming together and\nI'm having that part of your life because the resentment is already going to be wedged in there at this point no matter how kind you are no matter how kind she is and it's going to take a little bit kind of break that\nAnd not feel weird about it and just make it natural in normal again and part of your relationship which is where it should be in needs to be\nUm if you you know get to that point it can be a huge problem in a relationship and you know a God Bless you for for standing by her and not taking the easy way out looking for um\nYou know other sexual partners and and so on the world would say oh yeah you deserve it go do it you got it and partially or she is abandoning the marriage and I get that but to stand firm and\nA strong in your convictions convictions and look at this as an opportunity of growth and newness and the relationship can be very wonderful and exciting it's just going to need some outside help to get you to that point so you read the home\nAnd newness and the relationship can be very wonderful and exciting it's just going to need some outside help to get you to that point so you read the homework that I gave in first grade in chapter seven are preying on what your next step is you pray with your wife\nUh you find pastoral counseling or somebody that can help bring those issues together about reigniting that and you find medical help uh to to figure out what is going on and how some of the medications or the women balance or imbalance or these types of things are affecting a\nHer desire to uh to be with you sexually\n\nJesus Christ moving in a moment to be part of a show\nUncles for alerts and offers me automatic tax message missed interests me

all the time and uh\nYeah we still we still enjoy Dennis ... thank you for continuing delicious we do appreciate your listenership\nOut here a lot about retirement on there now and I'm On I'm getting close to a ... a couple of years and we've saved about we got about a million and a quarter and some of the money seven hundred of it is before tax money and the other is after tax\nAnd I'll have a pinch and I hope I'm about fifty seven thousand a year and we don't we don't need a lot to live on everything's paid for and I'm curious what would be your recommendation on\nA which way which money to take first the tax money or the non tax stuff that we've already pay tax on and then my last question I guess on that what you know he took the four percent like you talk about how many years will outlast with average returns on what's left [noise]\nWell I think that ah it's helpful to understand how we get to the four percent number\nAnd that will give you a better picture of how long it will last as you know I recommend having a year in advance set aside so you're never pressured into raising money in a downturn to take out your four percent\nWithdrawal if you say your head I think that's helpful in that regard also take a look at how the money is\nConfigured when we look at at four percent first of all we're looking at the total amount when we look at that so we would be looking at on the one and a quarter you have would be looking at the protests\nWell years I think you can do it just based on your evidence and interest I don't think you'd have to do a whole lot of share liquidation to get to three percent because he was a way we do it we do it based on\nThe total return now the total return consists of a four components first component is the interest because obviously as you know I Would be in a balanced portfolio posture\nAnd the kind of a lifestyle you're talking about so the first thing I'm doing some generating interest on the income portion of the balanced portfolio so I have my interest income so I have that to add\nSo then my second component is going to be my dividends which are going to comment as a result of my for example a mutual fund holdings and then the third component which is going to happen in some years would be capital gains distributions\nAnd then to fourth component only if necessary because the other three are already taxable even in the personal accounts [noise]\nThe other three are already taxable your interest your dividends capital gains your fourth component is going to be only if you have to share liquidation and I'll tell you what I think if you go to a three percent withdrawal\nGiven your hefty pension income and you're a you're a modest lifestyle I think it's ... percent withdrawal rate with all of the interest and dividends and capital gains accumulating\nYou may find that that would be something that would uh almost never require you to liquidate\nOkay great it kind of the area in good shape there are\nWell it's uh I'll tell you the most important thing to do when you get there in my opinion decide before you go there what you're going to do I get very very important to decide in advance\nAnd you may have to make some changes along the way after you do it but to have some ideas some decent idea before you do it a lot of what you're going to do with your with your time I think that's extremely helpful they're all kinds of things you can do\nWith your time and I just think it makes sense to think about it I don't think it's a good idea to just go home on the last day and a sit down and turn on the TV that's not going to work now that's not going to work get specially especially given the content of what is on the boat to these days\nSo uh I I think as far as your other question where to take the money first I Do lean to allowing your tax deferred money to grow until you get into our empty\nAges and the reason is a reason is that the first attacks\nOK okay wire said Bob and the like I said hopefully it'll I I've been told that the hardest thing is spending money when you're tired you're afraid to you don't have a check coming in and everything you know so yeah there are a lot of people well I uh and\nI well I have good news for you Dennis and that is you've already done the hard part actually you've done the hard part which is I mean you are at the land a critical mass based on what you talked about so that's the hard part getting to the land a critical mass from here on Iran cruise control Dennis\nOkay thanks a lot of pressure alright Joe great to hear from you\nYou can't straight money talk on your computer and download to your smartphone ... dog on demand that way you listened wherever you go whenever you like to like so many people do actually all over the world we have money talks on demand subscribers that are able to listen to our broadcast on her own schedule in their own time zone as well as\nSo you can sign up right there at Bob breaker dot com that the money talk on demand logo\nAnd of course we we used terminology here on the program that you don't often hear and I understand that and if you're a new ... we're not trying to lead you astray when we talk about the land a critical mass where simply talking about having enough money in your investment portfolio combined with any pension income you may have\nWhere you can do whatever you want with your time you own your time because you can live from your investment income and your other income other income being for example pension income\nSo in the case of Dennis ... pension income and then combining his\nUh money that you would take from is investment portfolio we talk about an annual rate of withdraw in his case in Dennis this case it was a really conservative three percent\nBecause he's he's not a heavy spender and certainly doesn't sound like he's going to turn into one in addition to that he's got fifty seven thousand dollar pension that he has earned through his hard work to his lifetime\nAnd so if he takes another three percent if he rakes off another three percent which is going to be mostly are almost entirely interest dividends and capital gains at that low withdraw rate he's going to have an annual income or a Ninety five thousand dollars a year is going and he said he'll be a net saver\nBecause that's more than he is making now and he's a living comfortably now so um when we talk about critical mass that's what we're talking about\nLet's be honest we have usurped the expression critical mass from our brothers and sisters and their nuclear community\nAnd we have given it a financial life sustainability element of financial critical mass I mean after all that's what it's all about think about it that's the point isn't it\nThe point at which you have an investment portfolio where you can live off of the income for the rest of your life comfortably by properly diversifying you're holding\nThen you're there that's why you throw the alarm clocks out because you don't need 'em anymore\nBecause nobody else owns your time but you know if you want to set alarm clock to go fishing at four in the morning that's your business we're not talking about that we're talking about setting an alarm clock to get up to serve the man or whomever\n[noise] pulling your soul to the companies or you know the whole thing the whole nine yards from ice\nRink and this is money talks [noise] this is the money to [noise]\nTo national debt is now over twenty million dollars what happens next rising inflation drops in the dollars have some experts say another crashes kind of like you can fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins and an IRA from Augusta precious metals call eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and learn how an IRA backed\nBy physical gold and silver can hedge against inflation calling us too precious metals right now at eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and get a free gold Irish guy call eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven\nWhere the money that comes in in interest from interest bearing and dividends from did it end paying all of that money\nWould be directly placed into a the the vanguard prime money market I Would recommend the vanguard prime money market the symbol is um is a Victor\nA\nM M as sex that would be Victor Amazon money ... money Sierra X ray\nAnd would you be able to do is you direct all of the money coming in that way ended a money market so that it would be available\nIn liquid form for any withdrawals that you make now I Would only do this if you're planning on making withdrawals out of that account now remember any any withdrawals that you make a prior to your ... your um mandated required minimum distribution\nAny withdrawals that you make or voluntary and therefore you're voluntarily taking money out to pay tax on it\nAnd you have to ask yourself if you want to do that\nOr the other way I can take money out of it if I don't have the evidence is being sent to the money market is to sell shares correct\nYeah but uh yeah but I mean that's another thing you can do by the way it's not a big deal but a\nMatter is fired rather do it the other way I'd rather collect interest and dividends on the money\nBut that way that's what I intend to do as long as that meets my income these per month and if I needed additional income for what money locked up yet then I Would liquid and yet the logic\nYeah and that's yeah okay I think you've answered my question that's a and I and they do support that ... they they will put those dividends into a money market form\nI Believe that I Believe that that will I Will be the I think that'll be a simple matter of coding of coding your account appropriately\nYes I Believe that's correct All right Bob thank you very much for it since you mentioned that go great to hear from Douglas welcome\nHi, Bob my question concerns utility stocks since November two thousand Seventeen the standard Poor's five hundred has advanced but since then utilities stock and a utility ATF have declined\nAnd like my question is can you see an insight as it related to they they they treasury interest rate\nAbsolutely a it is normal for rising interest rates to cause problems for utility stocks and other interest sensitive investments that is a normal occurrence that is something that should be expected\nI read I also plot your ah the vanguard of it and growth fry and and that that would end paying companies and they are not as sensitive to ah changes and interest rate\nAbsolutely not because first of all those are not going to be portfolios that are going to be dominated by utility stocks second of all the growth and the stock market has totally overshadowed any other considerations and those portfolios have done fine\nI I understand that can I gave you some feedback concerning compound interest for younger listeners\nSure forty years ago I bought twenty shares of utility [noise] and I never paid I've never bought any more shares but I reinvest it does does it end now twenty shares have grown to seven hundred shares\nJust to the compound interest by re in that thing they did at the end all those years\nNow how many years are we talking here agree or forty three years Yes sir\nNow how much did you initially invest\nInitially invested six hundred dollars and those\nSeven hundred shares are worth five\nThousand greater than twenty five thousand today\nYeah well you know what we call it and it's been called this many times compounding return is the eighth wonder of the world and Douglas you just provided more evidence\nAnd I think that's really important for young or listeners that they should have permission to just like you preach and the stock market\nYou are so right Douglas and you know I really appreciate you're bringing this up and I'll tell you why\nYou know I think we will encounter over the course of time we we encounter various ah advertisements and one of the advertisements that just drives me batty\nIs advertisements today treat advertisements to constantly go in and out of the market these these are so damaging Douglas so damaging day by the way they are the opposite of what\nAre so damaging Douglas so damaging day by the way they are the opposite of what you're talking about\nI agree with you and thank you so much for taking my call\nThat you do a great talking with you checking in from\nSouth portrays oh Indiana and then some of you know back in the

list now I put this together over a period of many many years and\nIn my opinion if you take advantage of the works on the recommended reading list you will materially enhance your investment knowledge and your ability to become your own personal financial manager\nA lot of the most outstanding works on that recommended reading list by the late Peter Bernstein who guessed that on our program on multiple occasions when he was still with us against the gods the remarkable story of risk this one this work will walk you through many different aspects\nNot really are not yet I'm not there yet on whether you're yet but I'm learning what's the percentage on your mortgage\nOr you're not going to like this is two point eight seven five\nOh I like it very much I like it very very much that's an extremely attractive loan or how long does it have to run\nA probably till bond payroll additional at but I'm probably chill twenty twenty five [noise] so you have about seven years ago and I bought a hundred and thirty on it\nAnd was it worth a seven hundred plus\nWhen I was going to be a hard sell for me or for you to convince me to do that you've got a really hard sell because I'm the truth the matter is I mean if you're a lender finds out you're even thinking about this\nThey're going to send to your door the longest stretch limousine and the state of Washington to make sure you get safely uncomfortably to their offices [laughter] pay off there's also a loan from their point of view that they may do you the last thing in the world to any bank wants is a two and seven eight percent mortgage or they have no interest in that at all\nBecause uh uh it's not a good long for them it's great loan for you or\nI don't I don't really understand this and here's one reason I don't understand that is because well look at it first of all you should be able to itemize your interest right\nRight\nSo you get a tax benefit there and you're also paying back cheaper dollars every year even if you use to present life in your ... your banking paying back keeper dollars every year interest you're paying that is in in in devalued money because of two percent of ... or whatever the number\nOne seems to me that a at a two and seventies rate I'm getting a tax deduction and I'm paying back cheaper dollars this is free money\nRight right I Know you're going to say that I just had to had to find out [noise]\nYeah I mean I just uh I don't I don't know what a ... exactly what you're feeling we you're feeling pressure uh you've got a eighty percent equity in your home\nAnd you have a free money or if you do the accounting where's the pressure\n[noise] well it's all about four percent thing and and find their you know with the withdrawal I just want to get myself set up so I just don't have any of these loose sense you know what I mean [noise] so no\nUh uh I don't know what what is the a monthly payment on this\nUm with taxes like twenty two hundred bucks there seven hundred bucks and that's\nHow I mean well well yeah well you're going to pay the taxes anyway if you can try and live there so a Fifteen hundred dollars raised what you're saying and you're getting a tax deduction you're paying back secret dollars and what's your net worth\nUm about three point four [laughter]\nSo that does it does it I have no interest in this whatsoever you are on your own my friend your on your own\nOr I was not very much\nFat you Brett\nI'm not going to do it now or three point four million two and seven eight percent loan was seven years to go eighty percent equity in a home I'm not ... that alone with your money\nLet alone mine no way no way in the world not going to happen forget about\nForget about\nUs get Jeremy on the line I Know Jeremy\nHowever Bob thanks very much for taking my call and I'm just calling I I've been reading articles of tensions in other states being under funded and one in in one instance surveyed about ... um the pins and went from people adding\nA fifty thousand a year to twenty five thousand a year\nAnd I'm Wondering how that could even be possible that someone could take away some of those pension\nI'm to that degree and if you see\nUh the the pension for other states continuing on down that line\nWondering if you first saw that happening nationwide and um it's so to what degree [noise] um I'm a federal government employee myself and I have a a very small portion of my retirement and pension [noise] um and I don't know if that would affect um\n[noise] a federal pensions\nWell let's talk about the difference okay first of all let's talk about the state pension is All right [noise] I don't think it follows that just because Illinois has had problems\nAnd just because other states may have had problems I don't think it follows that all fifty states are going to have the same problems and I'll tell you why because\nThere's something about this country that it takes a while to appreciate it takes experience in time to appreciate and that is that you have to you have to countries in the United states you have the United states of America which is the federal government you work for\nThat one country but then separate from that you have fifty countries which are the fifty states right yes I\nThink about it they have their own um motor vehicle departments they have their own tax laws\nThey have their own set of laws we have fifty countries fifty separate countries represented by the fifty states that make up the totality of the United states so we have one country in the United states\nIn that sense although sometimes it's hard to it's hard to find that when you look at at the risk to send a division there's one country in that sense but they're also fifty countries out there known as states do you agree Yes sir\nThey all have the all of those fifty states have their own fiscal\nPeculiarities if you will some of them are strong some of those fifty states are very well run and their AAA rated some of them\nSome of them are really badly run in fact you just named one of them so uh what about one year ... at one you mentioned uh by the way I think as as how to add a parade of governors go to the big house if I'm not mistaken [noise]\nSo um the bottom line and all of this is you have a lot of differences here and I do not believe that all fifty states have to go to financial ruin even though some of already led the way I agree with you some of over the lead the way so I Would not be concerned that every single state is going to go down the drain\nFrom a financial standpoint that doesn't even matter to you here's your pension is a federal pension right\nYes sir I only get three\nStandpoint that doesn't even matter to you because your pension is a federal pension right\nYes sir I only get thirty percent and the Seventy percent based off the a P S P for savings Frank\nBut it's all federal ... but it's not state it's all federal\nYes I understand where you're coming from ... to each each state being this basically but its own country so if if the state or the country's poli ran in\nThe pension plan could be possibly a poorly ran and then a could result when something like uh Illinois [noise]\nYeah I mean that's the way that's the way I look at it now I recognized we have the United states of America and that's one country\nBut I also recognize the obvious which is we have fifty countries represented by each state and they all have their own motor vehicle department and they all have their own pension plan you all have their own laws in fact some of them are the\nSome of them have thrown out the federal laws and put in their own laws like look at these states that have made um recreational marijuana legal that's against the federal law right but I'd say they put in their own law\nAnd if the federal government decides not to pursue it then there you go that we see this today and the number of states around the country\nSo the bottom line than all of this is that you have a federal pension\nSo that your pension dollars are going to be a function of the willingness the ability and also the willingness\nOf the federal government to pay your pension out so far we have not seen federal pensions in jeopardy and there is a reason and that differentiates them from the other fifty state pension plans and that is\nThey have a printing press the fifty states don't have one the federal government has a printing press the one country printing press US dollar they can print them and they do\nAnd as long as they can print them you're probably going to be okay with your federal bench\nThat does not apply to anybody's state and tension sunny talk is about getting yourself into a position to manage your own personal finance [noise] that's what it's really all about [noise]\nThis is the money to [noise]\nTo national debt is now over twenty train dollars what happens next rising inflation drops in the dollars I some experts say another crashes comic you can fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins and an IRA from Augusta precious metals call eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and learn how an IRA backed\nBy physical golden silver can hedge against inflation calling us too precious metals right now at eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and get a free gold Irish guy call eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven\nTo the insurance limit and I and I think that that's what makes your situation different because in the case of pension benefit guarantee you there are a lot of people who have only received a portion of their pension because their pension that they earned was greater than what pension benefit guarantee pays out so that's the difference\nGot it so for what they pay out for what they pay out the percentage or the amount that they do pay out on the get attention they're good for\nI Believe that uh I Believe that if I were in that position I Would expect them to pay out okay you've answered my question I\nYou're a ... call great to hear from Lincoln I knew someone\nWho um had a family member and immediate family member who earned a very very nice pension working for a company for many many years in the company went bankrupt and when the company went bankrupt the pension obligation was turned over to the pension benefits guarantee corporation\nAnd I was told that the amount of money that was received was different less than the amount that would have been paid under the original pension obligation of the company that went bankrupt so these things do happen\nAnd a these are corporate pensions now the difference of course when you start telling you about federal pensions as I mentioned earlier we had a caller on that\nAnd in that case in federal pension they do have the printing press standing behind their obligations and\nThey're not bashful about using it so that's a plus if you have a federal pension if you have a state pension they don't have a printing press\nSoviet state pension you are dependent on the ability of that state to manage their affairs in such a way that they can pay the pension obligations now keep in mind that one of the important aspects of a state paying off pensions is cash flow\nAnd that one of the important aspects of a state paying off pensions as cash flow that depends on taxpayers paying taxes in the state coffers\nSo it's important for states to remain a a viable and to have a healthy relationship with their tax payers\nSo they can collect those revenues going forward the last thing in the world you want this was the last thing in the world you want make a note on this one put a marker on this one the last thing you want to have a high level of state pension obligations and liabilities\nAnd has taxpayers leaving your state\n\nThat is the makings\nOf a fiscal train wreck state has high touch has a hype pension liabilities high future pension payouts\nAnd has a population that on net is leaving the state that's a disaster new making right there Ellen's on the line in Illinois hello Ellen\nAnd how much are accepting NASCAR I don't think they ever get straight answers\nWhat I did that when the rates were very high I bought individual guinea nays and they're at seven point five and eight percent\nNow they're small amounts of like three thousand six thousand seven thousand laughed and they think that we're sending may but every time interest rates go up the market value goes down do I keep them devise out\nHow much do have invested in these\nAbout twenty thousand or thirty ...\nAnd what is your network it what does your net worth about ... million\nI'd twenty to thirty thousand or the million dollar network in this situation keep in mind that you are collecting interest at a high rate on a regular basis correct correct for that reason I Would simply hold on to these\nAnd they they expire in twenty twenty eight\nWell here's the reality they're paying you a very very high level of interest correct correct and if you do sell them you're going to have to reinvest that money at much much lower interest rates are going to be get way lower rates correct\nCorrect what's the point of that\nWell see I didn't know what the market value it's going to join and I couldn't get history\nWell the market the market value on these is going to de grade as interest rates go up just as it has been at the same time if you sell these which you can do you're then going to have to uh reinvest that money and you're going to get a really low interest rate of today's race\nThat got it now I Do so in other words in other words for you\nYou can hold on to them and look at him on a total returned basis you're getting ridiculously high rates of interest\nWhy anybody would hold onto a mortgage at eight percent or seven and a half percent the only reason they would do it is because they don't have the money to pay it off that's
