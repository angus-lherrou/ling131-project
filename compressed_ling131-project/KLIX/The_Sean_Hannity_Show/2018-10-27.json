estimates are badly because once you've ... battle with it for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months you're kind of guessing at what it's going to cost you in a year right\nRight and you just put that in his budget item so let's just make up a number okay if you're a doctor but was six thousand and you're going to run into your six thousand other duck double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month if it's three thousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know\nA\nA whatever a line in your budget for medical expands on the winning phonic medical and just call your call chronic or whatever just give it a name and out\nOf money you set aside for that so

relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go there we're going to retire from our jobs and ... and Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat\nCamp for officers that are just need a place to go and and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\n[noise]\nCamp will be a the the operations of the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is\nOn will be rented or we currently own that property currently on that property and we'll be living on it also\nTurns to him and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry law journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be your non profit and in the nonprofit you would shut down and talk about what kind of a\nYou know you need to get with the insurance broker and what kind of insurance is appropriate then for a a a camp setting a\nOf building will be the main thing I'll be concerned\nUh that if somebody fell hurt themselves or something like that who are they going to say well they could show the\nLandlord or they go all the time they could show the the nonprofit or you either one and show on a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property or\nThey they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the nonprofit let company would carry\nOr or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures mark homeowner's insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure 'em things that they don't own you don't have\nAnd and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure 'em things that they don't own you don't have an insured interest and I\nI really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit uh\nI'll keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with a nonprofit you're not you know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do so well let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land\nYou know you got mess on your hands of the land is owned by the nonprofit you see what I'm saying yeah they keep that separates a and so trait that you know the landlord had can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liability associated with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenant for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords house you see what I'm saying as a treat these things separately and your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the type of insurance people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal and for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go\nTo state farming in an airplane insurance okay then we'll salad or they might but you wouldn't want by there even if they did so huge that you would go to an insurance broker and they shot five different companies that Ruy airplane insurance and then they come back and tell you what how\nLiability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash what would happen in the same thing here they would find five different companies that ride\nCamp insurance for for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means an insurance were they find somebody that a ride your policy or two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing\nAnd it costs this much and this kind of a company coverage the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and it costs as much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\n'cause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the farm plus a few cabins you know almost like a that kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can\nYou know go into that a lot of little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in your shoes as my main thing you want to ... do do hold harmless agreements or carry any weight in any of this um no I ... yeah they carry weight but I'm\nThe is\nAre no agreements that keep someone from ... you cannot contract away liability\nOkay so let's say that a floor was rotten and one of the cabins okay and um that's a liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless I think you you are liable for that uh you're standing in my building if you slip and fall and\nAnd because we didn't you know properly and stole the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a hold on just before he walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called that's those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk but a\nHarmless is it what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts occasionally people honest right it's like do you know you are you walking across\nYeah you know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any the insurance companies lawyers going to call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case to not have to write him a check but you need the backup in case you were to lose that\nAnd it'd be proven that you are liable regardless of the whole harmless but I I I Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and have an attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you sound these two page documents they're off on Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable they're still awful [laughter]\n... so I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you and thanks for the call I appreciate your joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five at two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money\nAnd a\nJump in and we'll

Christian and I'm a new American I Apologize to this is something that you've touched on our why I'm so I'm new to the baby step and I know that number one of the thousand dollar ah American they find\nMy question is do you ever suggest saving more than that and and the reason I asked my husband works\nIn oil and gas industry in getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing to happen mhm um and I stay at home with a kid mhm and just wondering how you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get better baby step three but here's what I Would dare okay he's in on a stable environment where there's job is what you're saying and I agree with you\nOK but um\nThat's one level of quote worry I'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile\nIf we get wind that he's really going to get laid off how much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off\n[noise] um [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years I enter never happened we really lucky we'll never been laid off he goes in and they get sent home pretty quick I mean within a\nCouple of weeks she'd have a couple of weeks to do something and he's going to\nSomething to do when he comes home and they didn't get laid off so\nIf he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I was\nA little baby step thing and just pile of cash or just generally worried about it you know generally worried about it as we all have and that's why we\nOf the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth

going to talk to you Martin is with us in Los Angeles I Martin welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave how what is that while I was a one of your opinion\nOn regards to um to whether I just fell my rental property to pay off my primary residence or in any other dead also that I have\nOh how much of that if you got\nTo cars I'm at credit card debt but I paid pretty much about Fifteen thousand in the life that will take three or four months\nTo get your your debt free but two cars and the two houses right okay how much do you own your cars\nI'm fifty thousand on balls each or total on both total okay wow and what's your household income [noise] ah one thirty okay you know a lot of car and um\nSo what do you own your primary and what are you all on the rental\nMy primary to fix the and it's worth about five fifty\nMhm and the rental\nAnd um my rental Ohio one fix the end is worth about I Would say or thirty for a look at work to be but I if I'm at a little bit less\nSo I mean the two ways to do it is usually income to clear up the mess or use the rental to clean up the mess right [noise] right and so on you know if we stay taken say um you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these callers paid off and so they're going to be paid off and well under a year\nAnd then once they're paid off a then I'm going to decide I'm going to pay all the the little house or the rental for probably go ahead and pay off the rental um my pal files first I don't know either one's fine but um you know you start doing what forty fifty grand a year and that\nStuff let's see here we got three four uh\nFour twenty so you got about five to ten you got about seven to ten years to clean up those two things after the euro paying off your car um or you can show the rental now and be done\nRight I mean that's what I really had in classroom whether to to do that and and how much the pretty much tell the rent on ... pretty much all my dad\nOn it but I also have in mind as far as that like I have a son who's about to well I Would say in in two years she's going to go to college so I don't\nHow to house by managing cash while they're right okay good no doubt no the only way this makes sense is if you don't borrow money anymore right now my credit card check that out there and they told me Gary by a car\nYeah pay cash for it I'm All right you never know money again on anything if you do this because otherwise it doesn't make sense\nRight that's that's the planet you can to get on track\nYeah you can't sort or ride this out of debt horse it doesn't work you can't shorter routed me gotta ride him or not\nAnd so if you're gonna ride him it makes a lot of sense and I think it makes sense I Would sell the rental and pay off everything cash flow college and I'd say about my mission where the rentals with cash or go along out there in the future and I think ten years from today you'll be in a better place by having done that if you stay on budget and you don't keep you know you don't spend money that you don't have\nI'm going to go back out there and borrow money and all that kind of stuff but you got to stop it you got to break the cycle and if you broke into cycling yeah dumped a rental and pay off the cars would pay off the house um and it does look like you've got enough to do both I'm\nBarely close very close but you need to be a hundred percent that free a slap build your emergency fund\nAnd then start building George junior college fund and then once you got junior college covered um\nBy just don't want to just on the same as ... as a junior college junior dollar just throw it in their build it up build it up build it up build it up and work your way right through it and then I'm a ... then once that's done then you just start saving up and paying cash for rentals or doing other kinds of investing along the way but we're\nWorking the baby step share the only thing is we're just short short getting everything by the ...\nI Would I Love rental property but I Love being there for a more and so I don't borrow money in life is good when I don't have any payments any where life is good it's awesome\nI thanks

on\nBaby wine on and on and I'm David ... to ... we're getting a life insurance on everything from uh\nI'm not that I missed it by his dad took out at ... I had a full term are they on hand um when he was younger and he wants to and then three pack that over and make the payments um I don't know when that as time but we didn't have\nFor Ken I'm not exactly sure\nWhat the best thing to do if I'm not the beneficiary combat it or how to handle it\nMhm okay so he took the shot when your husband was a child yeah okay this is not a term policy it's a whole life life insurance policy\nAnd it's close to a million dollars\nWow it should be canceled okay because her whole life life insurance policy about ... million dollars is a very expensive\nRight and yeah and like in my main thing that you know we found out the beneficiary and I do I mean he's a great guy I'm not worried about you know that it's\nI don't know I'm like oh here's a guy doesn't matter if I had a good guy that's it's it's really weird that it's continued to have the parents are the beneficiary and this is a grown man with family of four with four kids\nYeah there was a movie and like going out on a wild one but it's strange how long have you been married for a long you been married five years or five years they've not address this issue that strange ... ...\nIt really I mean they should you should address the issue it they should not be the beneficiaries anymore you should be and really the policy ought to just be canceled because I Would not want to pick up the ... I Would not want to pick up the premiums on and a half a million dollar policy on this is a whole lot policy because it's new at twenty times more expensive than term\nTo create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a poor widow overturned that when you die they keep your money\nSo that whole life insurance is I have a ball financial product and so what if you just called me up and you just owned a half a million dollars of whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you got your term in ... but you're not paying for it today anyway so today you get your term insurance in places properly on you and your husband\nAnd I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and said that uh I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now I Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nGreat yeah that's a ... like I don't want to be paying for something that you know not only that but you have all the time so\nIt's not only nah needed because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan plan has now changed yeah 'cause you know he made a decision as as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve\nHow are you how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nOh God I have a question regarding up part of my retirement savings comes I call the ...\nI'm a question uh regarding out part of my retirement savings said comes here's a thing called ... from my company and that overall the bad guy eight percent of my total as ... or\n... or ...\n[noise] well it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a project that retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be about eight percent of my total as happy and [noise] and\nAnd the question is why they're good at it as a lump sum yes or ... okay yes\nHere's why okay if you die or not we if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all going to die [laughter] okay when you die a that money's gone\n'cause it's a ... and you get your ... and you have a survivor benefit or something there it may it may go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there's a survivor benefits the money's gone it's gone and if you live I or\nAs long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market so it's as if you had\nAnd the investment advisor said okay stay we got an account for you over here two hundred Ninety five thousand you can invest it you can make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you can take that two hundred Ninety five thousand you can rolling into some mutual funds and a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family well that'd be a better deal right\nYeah I guess [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah others who was a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity but\nIt's still you know if you die then yeah you got survivorship on it but when both of you know the same concept applies so the bottom line is it's\nGot a decent ... low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you die makes this a bad deal and so you always take\nPension lumps on almost always type engine lumps arms enroll them to IRAs and invest them and good roast I've mutual fund so it sounds like you're networks in excess of ... million\nA year it's a closer to close that and that's probably about four oh well yeah total total network to assets house and so forth\nYeah well ... congratulations [laughter] how old are ya I'm sixty two white ago how much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um\nProbably somewhere in a three to four hundred range from both\nMy ah my family and my wife pay more for\nYou a millionaire or that was before that happened\n\nA a millionaire or my wife's mother passed away you as a when my mom my my parents I Will uh typically young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar network because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nA holding pattern is because it is the amount of heritage is is maybe ten percent maybe ... percent\nBesides the lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool is I'm a I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now that's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has\nTwenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [noise] [noise]\nWell I certainly got a ... well below you mean as long as they got a modest lifestyle which we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I was you people do stupid things I buy the stupid things I think you can limit\nA stupid thing to do or die in a way that's good I like that\nBecause every every everybody listening right now yeah he has\nDone or will do stupid things but then you can minimize those new name was along the way and we have a modest lifestyle live below your means ... yeah Lloyd\nSo do you think there will be done to not twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if you're listening to me right now\nBut he is probably a probably even higher is a state minimize the stupid that maybe I get minimize or as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir man you're done very very well so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way at survive shoe and the ... all the math on that works to your benefit a at a Wal alive and you better than Mitchell funds and upon death\nFor short you come out three hundred grand\nI thank you for joining us and thanks for letting me interview you for a minute\nIs always good for people here how to
