you don't want and I'm just guessing you don't want people that are exiting New York New Jersey Illinois California in droves\nBecause they got out of high taxes\nAnd bringing the liberal policies with them and destroying your good state um after they've already destroyed one state now that I understand that but that had to say\nA conservative I'm believe me I'm I'm voting conservatively in your state and you should be very proud to be a Senator Lindsey Graham who I think has has risen to the occasion more than it is\nConservatively in your state and you should be very proud to be a Senator Lindsey Graham who I think has has risen to the occasion more than at any point in his career deserves a lot of credit for his outspokenness and his important time\nWell we all our and our friends have has and now I'm very well and\nAnd he's he's really surprised us in in his Sam standing up like this and we're very ... said he than south and while I wanted to say that I wanted also thank you for continuing strong background boy for\nAll of that I I don't consider a forgotten I consider as totally ignored men and women of America and ... down on leaving appreciate it\nWhile you're very welcome damaged or all spokes in a wheel and we're trying to get the country moving in the best direction possible and we want the best economy we want the best security we want the best opportunity and futures for kids and grandkids is not complicated but politicians that wind power may get complicated\nWell that's exactly right and I don't understand why why the the other side just doesn't want the same thing that doesn't make any sense\nOr I currently you hold on the ship until I got an opportunity to be back down there in Charleston to say Hi to everybody thank you so much for being with us a can is in palm coast Florida next on the Sean Hannity show Ken how are you welcome to the sewer swamp known as your nation's capital\nSean I used to live in Arizona\nActually lived up in a town called snowflake and it's funny how you call just snowflake but that is a real town in ... wow yeah it it it's a two two members that started the town or something snow in something flake and they named the town snowflake in uh\nWhen I Lived up there and I live in Arizona I had the had the vote for\nBoth flake and John McCain and I used to call in I live back there and I would tell them all the time I had to hold my nose to vote for you\nAnd it's up to you to hold your nose to vote for you know what I was ... whatever's going on at the time and now I'm saying the same thing that Jeff Flake I did help him get elected and I would wish he would just hold his nose and support the president he doesn't have to like what do you know the president which we all know he doesn't\nBut he should at least support the people that elected him and they're not well butler landlord\nHe said it remember what he said it was sixty minutes on Sunday night he said well what he was asked would you be able to vote this way if you are facing the voters these Scott absolutely not which means I'm only at doing this because I don't have to face the\nVoters again otherwise I Would just do what was politically expedient so now I'll do what I Want to do that's basically what he said\nYeah but when he was even in back then when when he was you know this is I've been out of a couple of years key he missed major votes that we needed him on one was when he was home with his daughter at some dance recital\nAnd another one he went through his son's wedding and he said that you know the heat plant this was planned a long time ago and he wasn't going to miss it sounds wedding well who in the Senate would say okay if you're going to get married get married wire in session and he he he didn't have a chance I probably\nI had a hard time even in I call him in and really hard time being polite I always was played for the people I talked to how we wish them a good weekend but he he had been a disappointment for years and years and years he's he's just a\nIt's a good thing is going away hopefully I think the only thing he had to do is run at a Democrat and you might see that happening\nI Will tell you the Arizona's have a choice I'm very impressed with this woman\nAnd she's a war hero and it's it's interesting she's going up against somebody that apparently is a bit of a resistor and\nAnd most outspoken against the war the late Sally was out there fighting so that's going to be an important race Arizona is a pretty polish state right now and but I Will tell you it's going to make a difference of Republicans win that seat\nIf Dean Heller can hang on and Nevada and if Joe Donnelly is gone and Heidi Heitkamp is gone and Claire McCaskill is gone and and Joe Manchin and Bill Nelson are all gone I mean it won't be any problem with future Supreme Court\nNominees President Trump and the next two years old and we might not be able to get a lot more things done altogether but
