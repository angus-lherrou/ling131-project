to the south of New England\nNo problem in the north east from it\nBut it is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas\nOr because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to

sixty mile an hour winds maybe guts to hurricane force along the outer banks and forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Columbia uh Augusta places like that as it moves so but it's going to

mile an hour winds there was a bad storm it was spread out this is this is much more of a hey make or other kind of thing where\nIt's a knockout punch it with a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty mile an hour when I look folks you can see what's going on with this\nYou saw with foreign Saturday I kept trying to organize couldn't quite do it you see it on the clock photographed the eyes getting

English at CSI also\n\n\nWe've got so much more to get to will get a hold over break Jared and John Solomon into the next out one other thing that we've got to get to an all of this we have now other revelations that have come out with everything that's been going on with Brett Kavanaugh that the FBI ... make it more clear now than ever before that Hillary Clinton\nReally through what is just she's up to our eyeballs and everything being the sole instigator of the entire Russia gate scandal that only paying for the dot CA and there was a great piece by John Solomon last week and investors business daily also laying out all the evidence\nA chilling indictment of how this political criminal not only managed to escape indictment but was somehow able to weaponize the FBI and the deal Jay all to destroy your duly elected president President Trump\nAnd last week the ... of course we have the FBI general counsel Baker reporting directly to former FBI Director called me telling congressional investigators that an attorney from Perkins ... law firms\nRight Jared you've got a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was Hillary Clinton Russian collusion two people\nAre on her payroll to British by Christopher Steele to compose is a totally fabricated phony document\nBased on suppose Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch the investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now\nA second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Saltsman or who is passing it along\nComputer storage data as well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection and conspiracy to use phony opposition research to defeat her political opponent when that failed\nThey doubled down and they continue to spy on an associate of the Trump campaign and to launch a special counsel Bob Mueller\nTo drive Trump from office why haven't Andrew McCabe the memos evidence scenes is soft coup attempt by Rod Rosenstein being given to Congress they've been given to of all people Robert Mueller Rosenstein is Mueller's\nBoss if Mueller is going to be investigating Rosenstein\nListed activity he can't how we must still the boss in this case\nAnd the timing of this tells us everything ... was revenge for the firing James Comey this is part of the illicit scheme differing Donald Trump good title for a book I guess that's why it's number one I've done Solomon I Want\nYou to weigh in on this and I'm sure miss some details here but I I'm given the best summary I can it sounds complicated but it's not\nIt's really not complicated and Greg does such a good job of cutting through all the block certain BS in Washington and get right down to the point the FBI and the Justice Department were misused for a political opposition research project to a stop Donald Trump from becoming president and when that failed face the same investigation that was designed\nTo hamper his early presidency and that's what the overwhelming evidence now chosen and there's another important part the Baker developed in the middle of my story if I Want to apply to the south because many times\nI've heard you and I've heard Greg say the media has been complicit in this well sky a Baker gave us an unbelievable anecdote of complicity in November right after the election right after Trump wins the reporter David Corn of Mother Jones\nGives a new version of the ... copied it's different from the one the FBI has from steel and gives it to Baker and then Baker turns it on to the a counter intelligence people why is that important first off it's not a job a reporter to be giving evidence the FBI which we're supposed to report facts not become snitches but more importantly the timing\nOf it is so important the FBI just fired Christopher Steele for leaking um ah the existence of the investigation and all that dirty hat on Trump just before the election he gets fired they televise the court they're no longer using them and here it becomes a backdoor a journalist becomes a backdoor\nTo continue to receive information for Christopher Steele this is not\nHow the price of process is supposed to work and I think it's another key revelation I mean I I think they ... give us several key revelations I Won the challenges the credibility of roses team\nWon that shows the media uh uh being complicit in in the effort to unseat Trump and three as a direct involvement of the Democratic National Committee lawyer and turning on evidence pressuring\nThe FBI think of what happened in that time front Christopher Steele July fifth twenty sixteen walks into the FBI in Europe he gets turned down they don't act\nOn 'em right away they is that if they're not excited about it a few days later he goes to Bruce or the number four official in the Justice Department Bruce or puts pressure on the FBI department by reaching out and doing it a month later you've got a the the ... lawyer coming into the FBI again\nPutting pressure on the system there was an enormous amount of political pressure to get the FBI to find something uncomfortable for election day and I think when we look back at this we should all be alarmed take Donald Trump out of this\nAny candidate any American who had been treated this way it really raises civil liberties concerns that really raises abuse of power concerns and we should all be concerned by the body of evidence that mellow firms right Greg Jared has written in his book\nIt is so scary that when you put it all together and now the pieces seemed to be ... literally it but\nFor those the puzzles together usually start on the outside and you get all the square parts on the outside and then you start feeling in the pieces of the puzzle then the next thing you have a tree then you have the grass and you have the sun and slowly but surely it seems like we now understand a lot more and that is\nThat we had a group of people\nThat literally set up an entire phony Russia investigation the very people that exonerated Hillary long before they investigated her the very people that literally signed off on warrants that are based on information she had provided by committing fraud to Pfizer courts\nLiterally signed off on warrants that based on information she had provided by committing fraud to Pfizer courts and the very same people that after they lost at an insurance policy and now we know what the insurance policy is by any means necessary\nWe're going to get Donald Trump and the way we're going to do it as a we're going to eat secretly recorded them and we're going to surreptitiously get him to say something that we think we could use against them on top of a phony investigation that they've\nThey initiated through a media release strategy again of the\n... you know one of the things that really kept me off if there was a plot\nTo frame Donald Trump again the title of my book is I went through meticulously the FBI guidelines and the department of justice regulations on winning how you can launch a counterintelligence investigation of an American citizen and what I discovered\nIs that the FBI violated every single solitary provision of their own guidelines they had no\nCredible evidence of crimes no plausible intelligence to justify a counterintelligence probe importantly they had no probable cause and yet on July thirty first two thousand and sixteen they officially a launch this investigation Peter Struck\nSigned the papers he had just finished meeting with Christopher Steele and in fact the same day that James Comey cleared Hillary Clinton twisting the long run toward the facts his FBI was meeting for the first time in Europe in a building with Christopher Steele\nWho had compose this\nPhony don't see that the FBI was never able to verify and yet they ran\nWith this guy a leading investigation to damage Trump and then they violated other federal regulations that say you may never use on verified information to gain a fight so wiretap warrant on an American citizen\nAnd they never had it verified Rosenstein signed off on the final renewal application and he had no new evidence no\nIt ... because it does the I I Will take a quick break we'll come back more Greg Jared Sean Solomon\nAnd your calls later in the program eight
