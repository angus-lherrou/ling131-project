the other um Mr Speaker thirty six days is election day and I will tell you there's something I've never ever in a lotta years now witness the anger and the level of anger that they exist\nOn behalf of the Republicans and conservatives in the base over all these tactics against Brett Kavanaugh um is that enough for Republicans to win I Would I'd love to see a contract with America and promises made by these Republicans to insure people they're not wasting their vote\nYeah look I think there there are\nThree Claire steps here one is to communicate as\nYou just did that this is about America this is the most important mid term election in my lifetime and I think will be decisive in or do we keep going forward\nOr we returned to this left wing fanaticism second it really is a contrast between results and resistance\nAnd one of the people want to continue to create jobs to do the things that were to move and the right direction or go back to the failed policies of the eight years of Obama and then third I think the Republicans should have an eye open next week we'll have sort of very positive think of it as a pledge\nExactly I mean Republicans bless their hearts are so literal that they offer this stuff every single time and they feel that they have to debate the details of this or that case when actually has nothing to do with the details with justice itself this is a tactic designed to hold onto power when\nRon ... is an Andrew Gillum got the nomination for governor in Florida My very first thought was the sentence is going to be erased watched us has to be they're going to paint him as one within twenty four hours they flip around some use some harmless phrase next thing you know the lead of every show Ron to San Francisco racist you knew that was going to happen because it had to happen\nLot greater there in Nineteen Ninety eight a radio ad in Missouri by the Democratic party said oh you know elect Republicans black cross a cost is going to be burnt on people's\nLawns or ... well the James Byrd add I mean Al Gore telling a predominantly black audience Republicans have the wrong agenda for African Americans they don't even want to count you in the census at all\nAnd just really outrageous claims and you know one of the things I'd like to see come out of this that what has now become a predictable tactic that they get called out on this Brett Kavanaugh up until two weeks ago yesterday\nWas a gentleman gentlemen and now all of these allegations all of the soliciting\nSo go yesterday was a gentleman gentlemen and now all of these allegations all of these solicitations and it doesn't matter like if Michael ... is making the claim that thirty six years ago\nThat there was a gang of boys that were routinely drug in girls and then waiting in line to gang and trail raped them\nAnd that this was happening with a regular occurrence but nobody said it at the time nobody told the teacher a law enforcement official apparent that it just kept going on and was covered up for this long\nBut there's I Know where I go to why we went to school at one kid got in trouble for anything everybody knew within seconds\nWorth ridiculous I mean his client is alleging that she went to nine consecutive ... gang raped in a row and never said anything to anybody and no one else did either and she on the tenth one was right for self and didn't say a single word about it for thirty seven years okay I don't have time for that actually there's a whole country\nWith all sorts of real problems to address it tends to what you really have to be a Republican senator since you had to take that seriously these people fall for the same ... every single time it's football\nAnd you have like the center for Arizona's like oh really need to get to sit here and really if there are plausible claims being made yes they should be investigated this is a guy who's had six FBI investigations into his background in space Twenty years\nRadical clearance that allowed him the codes to the nuclear arsenal he was fat vetted and yet we need another on the basis of claims that have no substantially shirt all men not tactical\nChristine for it I'm just making the obvious point she claims that this happens from him for people she says repressive off or say it didn't happen\nAnd no one has the brass to ask our questions I mean\nIt's a joke at is what's actually happening it's a joke and only the Republicans in the Senate don't know what to\nDo this is either some said they had no recollection ever of anything like that ever happening or being at any party in the case of her best friend she said well I I don't doubt what professor border saying about I don't have any recollection but also professor of foreign identified one person\nAnd that was mark judge him more judge having been in the room when the alleged assault took place and he has said over and over again that's not true now they made statements under\nPenalty of felony and if they are so when the FBI goes back to them if they changed their story they would be admitting committing a felony\nSo I'm not really expecting a whole lot to change here\nExcept now the Democrats are put out a statement earlier today and they are now demanding all the witnesses telling the FBI how to do their job and meanwhile when they had a chance last week to talk about this Ramirez or a Michael ... client they passed and they punted and they didn't bring it up\nBut now they want to end it into that aspect and put some\nBut why are we playing along with this I mean they actually\nThat I can tell you why because Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski they they wanted this extra work done it was supposed to be limited in scope and uh just a limited amount of time it didn't turn out that way\nJeff Flake is not in control the Senate they could pass it without flake and where the leaders other than ... and I hate to say is Lindsey Graham seems we only person willing to tell the truth but where the rats were the other Nineteen Republican senators out there on television make their case not just for Brett Kavanaugh the common sense\nAnd presumption of innocence but where are these people and\nThey they control the United States Senate they haven't passed any of the agenda pretty much that the president land on they're giving the finger to their own voters\nThey control the United States Senate they haven't passed any of the agenda pretty much that the president ran on they're giving the finger to their own voters and on this one thing they can't just tell the truth why is that for art and were they afraid of exactly I don't understand\nWhat do you think that you've been in cable news a long time you were back in the crossfire days I think even had a stint shortly at MSNBC I don't know how that worked out for you but\nUh I got fired yeah um well I mean I think that they are one opinion network and that's it and is all conspiracy all hate Trump all the time but uh now you've been doing really well in the Fox news channel news shows doing really well and uh\nWhat what is the difference that you think is happening with cable news today I mean we're on the opinion side of things and Fox obviously as a news division but I kind of look at what I Do is\nTalk show host as being the entire newspaper we report news sometimes it straight news we even do investigative reporting other days and we give strong opinions other interviews where people give opinion\nUm we do sports we do culture pop culture it's to me it's the whole newspaper all these other people claim to be reporters and they're anything but\nWe break a lot of news on our show and we have reporters working on the show there on my job is to find new things to fleshed out do interviews I mean I you know I I had been in this my whole life so my family did I don't feel insecure about you know why you're not a journalist whatever I don't care what you call me\nBut we bring new facts Hawaii\nEvery night and I see our top quarter and return to explain what this means to really confusing time it's I wrote a book about it that's what the book is how do we get here why did this happen why did Trump get elected ... who didn't get a black to grow up what actually\nHappened and what actually happened was\nThe people in charge made a series of incredibly\nDumb decisions about our culture our economy our foreign policy they never said sorry and they never learn anything and so ... got mad at punish them and good for them but why would so that's I that's what I think my job is is to explain what this means and I think you know maybe disagreement but I think that's a valuable thing to do right now\nSo I think the other thing is I'm a believer in strong opinion but at least we're honest about it\nI totally like for example there'll be days on his radio show we're all we're doing is reporting news same on TV there'll be other days we're doing investigative reporting there were days I'm just giving opinions and taking calls from people that have opinions and that's what it's all under the umbrella of being a talk show host\nYou know people say well Hannity you even said you're not a journalist no but I Do journalism is part of what I Do but we don't just do that\n[noise] um anyway talking\nA little bit weird that all the attention that we get

Tucker there is a yeah I Know\nIt's rather a handful of us Tucker there's not that many and by the way it is a orchestrated effort in millions of dollars being spent to shut down any anybody that

I don't think anybody I don't know anyone else and media here that line by this life or death yeah no no not right or left life or death I I heard the line life or death you give them credit for that I Know that was very good very very catchy but the but it's true\nAnd desert bowling often reminds us this can happen to you because it's happening to a lot of people\nCatchy but it's but it's true and desert bowling often reminds us this can happen to you because it's happening to a lot of people and not only does anybody listening to this program that hasn't been impacted by opioid addiction or addiction of some kind alcoholism but this is the worst\nBut it's a hundred and Ninety two deaths a day a day that's every day one death every seven minutes\nAnd then by the way and they're saving a lot of lives with mark Hamm which were versus the effects\nOf ... but not that no not a problem feral and deadly these kids don't know it sounds like even if they're taking ... which is pretty scary for these college kids they don't know that it's laced with that now that\nOne time one bad one notes terrible alright well congratulation Enron it becomes a boss or when it becomes available we will tell you how to get a hold of it All right as promised let's get to our busy telephones here as we say can't even read this land is in Orlando Lynn Hi how are you\nHey Sean plugs going on her e oh man oh I'm sitting by the expressway waiting on you to put me on [laughter]\nOn several glad we got young what's going on no rationale [noise]\nNo I won't but I also worked for Bill done in Athens, Alabama\nWow what'd you do know he's billed as the by first professional radio gig in Nineteen Ninety\nI or I heard you say that all of a you know pass out when I heard that but uh I just the a list or appreciation radio concerts we had down at the airstrip in Huntsville remember those on the radio station\nWe had a country radio station on a on a a you know today's hits yesterday's a classic it's W. the YPG which was a big big station that\nThey are what are we ... the one for a pasta radio is what I eventually became [laughter] you're right yeah\nMy buddy storm in Norman used to work in the mornings there was one of the funniest guys on radio ever knows a great guy he'd call on my show all the time and I wouldn't even know its him half the time\n[laughter] yeah that with those are fun days and then of course he knows the stakes fog cutters down there on university\nSo you end up [laughter] so well so\nI had a question have you heard any Democrats say that if the FBI investigations proves these allegations faults that they will vote for Brett Kavanaugh\nNo maybe in the end would do it I we know that Claire McCaskill's how we know Joe Donnelly is out I don't think Heidi Heitkamp is going to be in the only shot at any Democrat I think at this point is mansion and but you gotta remember he comes from\nWest Virginia that's pro Trump forty two percent and he probably wants to keep a job and thirty six days\nSo I'm not even sure although I think he did vote for Neil Gorsuch if my\nMemory serves me well but look they they want endless investigations here they're out now on a fishing expedition they want us that this is about blood shooting and destroying at all costs this isn't going to be limited in scope to them this isn't going to be in a in a week no artificial timelines as soon as as soon as Jeff snowflakes that okay\nThen no bar got moved a thousand times because that's the way the Democrats play and Republicans fell right into the trap and I guess if they ask for more extensions will get more than what we need to get no no no we need another investigation into this\nWell there's five new people fifty new people that have just come out today we've got to get to that a gene is next thank you so much Lynn we appreciate a gene is in North Carolina Gina Hi how are you and welcome to the sewer the swamp known as a Washington DC\nThanks for taking my call sound good to talk with you it's good to talk with you what's going on I'm very angry that Senator Feinstein now you have a right to be totally handle the I Do not see how she could perform her duties and responsibilities to the Judiciary Committee anti\nWhen one of your constituents um I don't get it either\nI honest she she sat on this for six weeks she sits privately would judge Kavanaugh\nAnd tells him nothing about this nothing while simultaneously\nWorking with professor forward to hire an attorney ... became Deborah cats who was a woman that really said some awful things as it relates to Paula Jones and then she supported our Frankenstein\nThe creepy senator from Minnesota at the time so it's not the cause for professor Ford's attorney it's a radical left wing her and now we have friends that Deborah cats\nNow out there asking people in the Georgetown Prep community to come forward if they have information\nWell that sounds like a fishing expedition to me it ... I don't think there's a person in the country that is not aware of what's happening right now as it relates to Brett Kavanaugh and ... even if they didn't watch the hearings they're very aware of what took place last week and if they wanted to come forward I don't know if they need letters from people to do so that's my opinion\nA it's a yeah I think we need a full fledged investigation absolutely positively no doubt about it and then we don't then you know look we get the country we deserve and then if you liked the progress that America has been making under President Trump then you'd better go out and vote and thirty six days if you don't\nLike the radicalism that you see on display now the last Fifteen days\nFifteen days ago Brett Kavanaugh had a stellar reputation if you don't think they're going to have endless investigations into Trump\nThat they don't want to impeach him there this is who they are and what they do they can run on their record when Obama was president for eight years 'cause it's a disaster if you want the progress to continue for the country for the forgotten men and women I mean we barely have time to mention that the president got\nYou know incredible new deals with both Canada and Mexico getting rid of a bad deal NAFTA now you had to break a few dishes an ad that threaten the trade war but ultimately got it done because it was\nThese weren't one sided trade deals and so if you don't say you're willing to pull out of a deal you're never going to get a deal done and the president is effective at at negotiating\nOn all fronts I don't care if it's\nNATO and ... those countries that don't pay their fair share European allies countries of ours that have been taken advantage of us on trade issues\nIf you don't say you're willing to do it nobody will believe you and nobody will move but now he's putting America First in thirty six days you'll decide their agenda is enlist investigations impeachment open borders eliminating ice keeping Obamacare and they want the crumbs back if you want that\nThan stay home I mean go to go vote on for for the Democrats on\nElection day in thirty six days if you want progress to continue for the country and you don't want to give them this power which way which they will abuse then you can stop it if you voted for Trump\nTwo years ago everything you voted for is now in jeopardy and thirty six days they want for them this is they want to redo the twenty sixteen results they think it was a mistake they don't believe in happen somehow we were misled and it's been two years even with Republicans in power\nOf non stop never ending smears slander conspiracy theories ... blood thinning of the president and the media is of course the willing accomplices you know every step of the way [noise]\nUm anyway Gina thank you let's say Hi is it Lee is in Virginia how are you glad you called\nI think if I take my call I speak to you as a legal immigrant proudly voted\nI have to say I have to say my wife and I have never been angrier\nUrban angry or the tactical we wait\nOn Thursday it was such a travesty pick up all this gossiping it cutters\nMan with two weeks ago was cleaner whistle and honorable ... could be and I just want to wait for your listeners if the Republican Party not confirmed as\nWell you need to do for the legislative branch what we did for the executive branch finding goggles could get in the legislative branch because Donald Trump does not play by the Democratic trait book so I plead with everybody that's listening to get out there", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "01"}
