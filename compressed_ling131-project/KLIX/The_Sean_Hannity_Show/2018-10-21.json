become atheist for intellectual reasons they become atheist for emotional reasons um we don't know that I agree with that no most atheist know however I Will tell you this that it's\nA atheism as it stands is fairly irrational to also ah because you're making a I'm a blanket statement about things that you could possibly be wrong about\nAlso the statement that I'm making that there is no God you're saying it isn't as yeah it's obvious that now that\nThere there are varying degrees of atheism ... years dating is what is known as strong atheism I'm not a strong atheist on what's known as we\nMike Mike and you're an agnostic\nNo I'm not an agnostic is completely different terminology\nMike an agnostic it just strictly based on the word of all fears them without God agnostic without knowledge so if you're a week atheist that means that you're not sure whether there was a God\nThat's not what that means OK then you're saying there is no God\nNo no I wouldn't let me tell you what it is that I that I play I claim my uh my atheism is based on I don't believe in a God that is different entirely different from saying there is no God that's making a statement of\nFaith and belief is well belief is a statement of knowledge is well\nNo it's a lack of atheism they lack of belief that's all it is\nSo you're saying that your knowledge this is your world view not saying whether it is or isn't outside of Mike and Mike them or do you believe there is no God no I'm not saying that so what is your belief\nTo say I ... to say that I Believe there is no God is state there is no God and then I'm saying that I Know that and I believe it and it's just a fact as far as I'm concerned I'm not I'm not saying there is\nNo so you're saying there might be a God but you don't believe in God exactly I'm okay that's enough to system so I don't mean to get some adult Mike India is\nAbsolutely is and you can you can play offs you complain you complain semantics yes I Will take the time to look it up in the dictionary agnostic versus a off the U.S means exactly what the words meat like not no God\nKnowledge atheism is about a week I'm just saying I don't believe that makes me an atheist I can be an economic\nSo you're saying that outside of your knowledge Mike there might be a God\nYes but I was not an offense to it so I don't believe in okay\nThat would fall into enough the system these levels of atheism I'm not sure why you want to debate that I mean even at that oh so you're you're you're an atheist with a little a\nI'm an agnostic atheist okay fair enough that I how come you're not a theorist\nOr not he has become more searching that I Do the more I Try to understand God the more I uh you know I did lots of praying I called to him I ask for him to intervene to to to change my heart\nAnd there was no no response to to your liking time again unfortunately\n\n\n\nOh Jesus Christ and show he'll return\nTo be a part of the show called age seven seven holding

hell\nUm but I'm not sure who's going to learn or who who gains from\nFirst of this is that uh to know that God is adjust God and so it's not just about this going away but that there's justice done so uh if you feel that you've been wronged and the you know judicial system of the United states of America feels that he's in the wrong then you you file a lawsuit and see what comes to that\nBut that whole the point of the scripture is listen as Christians you you you are bound by the laws of the land and you're bound by the laws of gone\nLook to the laws of God's first to see if there's a way for you can recognize him to reconcile what's taking place and to do it that way first and foremost if not\nIf you ignore you if he runs from you if he doesn't return your calls these types of things than he is the ones who is a putting in a position or\nChristians are not supposed to be wishy washy or\nYou know spineless wimps\nThat's not what you are called to I'm not sure where that became important and why are you know that seems to be the focus that the Christians become doormat that's\nA that's not what you call do whatsoever so Rob if you feel that you were wronged and he's not responding in a way that you can conclude this not scripture never says that you are to brush off the injustice of a situation and released is try and reconcile\nA humanely and in a Christian man

your own not your parents it says in scripture that a a man will find a woman or this will be the perfect partner this will be an equal partner and for this reason and genesis that says you will leave your family and do her you will cleave become one flesh\nSo this is about starting your family and you have to allow your parents to ah\nMake the decisions in their family as well which you are part but you're moving on an out to start your own that's the purpose of you getting married is to become your own man and a your wife to become her own woman\nAnd to be partners in life together and I'm hoping you make that decision based on\nOn the character of the individual and not on you know something your parents said ah they're they're there to seek to guide you John and to give you the tools but what you do a with those tools is up to you\nKnow we're we're supposed to look at me as individuals who are actually you know they represent an\nAction that anyway you know the hospitals and

the fact is you are called to learn from the people around you it's not always going to be less than you want but your your call do observant and learn and to bring that into your life\nAnd this particular case um you have to allow them to make the decisions they haven't changed their not different people or\nThey're in a different situation so you have to take those tools and not use it as

E. ratio\nThat stands for the price divided by the earnings ratio so one method of valuing a stock or the stock market is to determine what they pay a ratio the price earnings ratio is and then to compare that\nWith historical norms and then also to compare that with some of the critical variables that have an impact\nOn the ... the ratio most especially things like inflation expectations and interest rates so when we take a look at the historical range of PE ratios as they would apply for example to the standard and Poor's five hundred index\nWe see that over the very very long term the range has been quite wide for example back in Nineteen Seventy four when the stock market was in the throes of a brutal bear market that lasted for close to two full years\nWould I take a percentage of the total of my stock allocation like four percent and make that uh what would I Would put into one individual stock it was a mix of\nWell if you liked a company so much of that you wanted to put the maximum wasting of it into a portfolio than I Would go no higher than four percent and the reason for that has to do with diversifying specific company risk\nBut that was so if you had a stock we saw a this was a stock that uh I just have to own I Want to own as much of it that makes sense\nThen you could make a case for yourself of placing four percent up to up to four percent of your stock market portfolio in one company and that would be a an example of a company that would be the most attractive in your view\nOkay well thanks I had one other question I have a lot of stocks and my ... and I know that you think it should be bombs and they are heroes\nShould I sell them and put them in my non IRA part um the does that make sense I mean if I sell it there's no there's no capital gains and I guess I couldn't disagree by them or the other counts as a disease that a wise move\nWell I think that um here's the consideration there let's go back to the basics here why is it that investors benefit from having stocks in their personal money\nAnd bonds and their tax privileged money the answer is because the interest that you are in on a taxable bond is subject to taxation\nIn your case a lot of taxation in New York City or the interest that you are in whereas if you put it in a tax privilege to count\nThen it's a it's not going to be that year you're not going to pay income tax on taxable income because it's in the tax privilege to count whereas with your stocks when you have those in your personal account you get the benefit\nOf the law if you hold it for a long term you get the benefit of the long term capital gain rule\nWhich limits your tax ability somewhat although I have to say in your case your case in the top bracket you would be paying\nThe ability of your New York state income tax you're in New York City income tax and you're in New York state sales tax and any property taxes above ten thousand dollars so New Yorkers are getting the shaft\nRight so in my case it really wouldn't make much difference of a of a hill\nBecause of your very high tax bracket is not is not a dramatic difference\nOkay and the last question of the ... my I have a forty six the allocation of a decided and I'm I'm I'm ... years old the same too many socks that seemed like too much to me stocks\nYou have a ... percent equity allocation\nForty percent of equity yes\nYeah I think at that age I probably would not be troubled uh assuming you have a favorable market outlook I Would probably not be troubled by too\nI I could with fifty fifty but I Know the people in\nIndia but that's not what I that's not what it is not what I said David all thank you for ... let me thank you for calling a I Would be comfortable with the allegation that you have right now and I do appreciate the call us get out to San jose New Mexico listening to the great cake he'll be radio Albuquerque Paul welcome to talk [noise]\nHey Bob good afternoon listen I appreciate that lasted for a long time and I know how you feel about the federal deficit and how\nIt has such a good effect on the national debt and I would I I personally think that Republicans were very critical and passing this tax cut because they have always\nBeen so critical of the opposition uh for the lack of interest in the dead and now I think the Republicans have had just been very hypocritical because of the effects that this tax cut will have on the debt and I just I Hope I Would like to hear your commentary on it\nAnd get see if if you if if you say the same thing that I did a fake you bought it\nFor you know thank you Paul I must say I have not been hearing anything at all out of Washington DC from the GOP you about the annual deficit or the national debt I haven't been hearing anything at all it's basically been radio silence on the subject of the national debt and\nDaniel deficit let's get Chris on the line in San Ramon Cruz it's your turn\nHi, Bob thank you for taking my call good to have you with us\nThank you um my question basically is whether it's wise for me to use that money manager I'm I'll tell you my situation I'm retired I have two and a half million dollars a for investing and currently I have a lot of that in portfolio three\nUm bottom on that uneasy about putting all my money into that portfolio\nUm and it's just that I don't know why exactly I think it's an emotional thing putting so much into having money um mutual funds\nSo I recently met with a financial adviser and um she gave me a couple of points I was just wondering if if you would comment on them um she of course thinks I should give that a manager and I'm One of the reasons why she said anyone with over five hundred thousand dollars a should be an individual stocks as opposed to mutual funds\nBecause of the fees involved the risk of over diversifying and the inability to Harvard law says\nHarvest losses and maximize gains\nUm and I was just wondering if you had a comment on that of course there's also the fees that they're going to charge which I think our little high at one point two five up to a million dollars but down beside from that um do you have any comment on it and the other reason that that she used\n... I think it's an adult oriented nonsense a let's take a point by point what's the first point\nReasoning that that she is\nWhy I think it's an adult oriented nonsense a let's take a point by point what's the first point you'd like to comment on\nHow well the the case for mutual\nWell it's going to a million dollars a one on a quarter that's twelve thousand five hundred dollars what are you getting for twelve thousand five hundred dollars\nWhat are you getting a well and I guess the ability to move the money around faster um\nWhoa whoa whoa I I don't even know what that means if you if you have a portfolio for example of index funds you can as a general rule you can call up the ... family and move money at will on the telephone or even better doing online\nMany people do it on line so I don't even know what that means moving money around faster has no meaning\nParticularly pointed out that it takes a day to you know ... and if you get the prize at the end of the day when you saw in the actual find as opposed to the\nMedia to are are are they suggesting or they suggesting\nThis is incredible are they suggesting to you that you would receive a benefit because they would be able to de trade as opposed to trading at the close of the market on a given day\nIs that the implication that they would be day trading within the day and you wouldn't have to wait till the end of the day because of that is what they're saying then that makes no sense at all to me\nWell that was one of their point I think they were sort of pointing out getting off the market if we were predicting a drop in the market we could get out more quickly I think that was\nOr do they do they have a history of having successfully called drops in the market of that sort and then re entering after the drop has been complete or near ... near complete so they have a history of that that's been proved to you document\nHow would that be proven I Do think she has\nA there was a good question there's a great question there is a good question well look obviously a obviously Chris this person is a salesperson rice and ... and wants to open the account so that the fees can be accrued to the company I understand all that I\nI don't know I I haven't heard anything from this presentation\nThat would suggest to me that I should shell out twelve thousand five hundred dollars when I have a situation where I have a portfolio that is predominantly invested in index funds a portfolio that has performed very very well I haven't given me a single reason\nThey over diversification if not\nI don't even know what that means what the heck does that mean if I owned a total stock market index\nThen which you do by the way in model three then that means I Am I essentially own the length and breath\nOf the companies across America or I don't even know what I mean to me that sounds like something for the I'm On a negotiated over diversification if I have the total stock market index\nSemi or am I the ... and I'm like well diversified of course I'm very well diversified if I might overdo versus what the heck does that mean [noise] this is money to [noise]\nThis is money to [noise]\nTo national debt is now we're ... trillion dollars what happens next rising inflation drops in the dollars I some experts say another crashes coming you can fight is not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins and then I arrived from Augusta precious metals coal eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and learn how an IRA backed\nBy physical golden silver can hedge against inflation calling us are precious metals right now any five five eight five eight five eight\nYeah you were born into bookstores in Fort Sill on line at Amazon apple I used in other outlets handle all aspects of the publishing process for you\nLet me thank you for your time and great program I appreciate that listener and subscribers since Nineteen Ninety and I say this one just for um they can feel warm but I just thank you but I'm I'm fortunate for past nine years so\nIt was a personal\nChallenges I'm I have not been able to follow you or listen to the show as I've just started listening so I Need to revise I'm I'm going back to my old notes that have taken which I maintain I have a I run shop I roads\nAnd I'm going back into portfolio number one\n[noise] of course I'm going to do the dollar cost averaging had this market but I'm Wondering what they consider that won't accounts or should I really consider them as she was separate account because it's one that's Iowa one supplier\nAnd those are old you are all ... privilege that counts\nThat's correct Yes sir\nI ... I Do like the top down approach and I would view them as one portfolio\nNext question find me very quickly as I said past nine years I have not this and I'm just getting back on my feet are numb but let me let me add something also because of you I was able to um stay home and take care of my spouse has helped 'em\nAnd because of the things that trip on so I think that I'm On the phone\nWhich will if somebody is making and this is an example fifty thousand dollars a year ... percent Detroit's or is that true that um ... a few cold ones before it's like you were mentioning you need to have like two million dollars in able to\nUm based on a four percent of all of which will have about fifty thousand dollar income for you\nI Would say that in order to generate an annual income of fifty thousand dollars a year\nYou would want to have a portfolio of approximately one and one quarter million dollars that would be one million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars if you were able to\nEngineer or four percent withdrawal rate on that principle then that would give you an annual income from that particular set of numbers\nOf fifty thousand dollars a year I think that in the beginning you could start with the four percent withdrawal guideline you want to review it every year you want to make sure it's working\nBut I think it is a reasonable starting point\nAnd that would mean on a million dollars that would generate approximately forty thousand and gross income and William first of all I Want to thank you for your kind words\nAnd secondly I Want to thank you very very much for calling in from Burbank, California and of course our program in Burbank, California and throughout\nThe greater Los Angeles area is on the legendary K ABC Radio Los Angeles as we go to the

hundred dollars\nBy not doing something for your program is invaluable to people I just enjoy it so much listening to all the different questions because boy I tell you you learn a lot by hearing either the answers that you've given the reasons why but here's my question I Do subscribe to buy bankers market time\nTimer and my question is this I Know in portfolio three that you recommend that total stock market or is there anything wrong with having the total stock market and they asked him the five hundred in the same retirement account\nI guess what I Would say or would simply be that the U.S and the five hundred is part of the total stock market index\nSo that if you owned a total total stock market index you already own the U.S and the five hundred\nOkay very good thank you I I Can't really you know I have less than ... many times that I never heard anybody ask that question about that I just thought hey I Wonder what the answer would be the debt so thank you very much and have a great day\nThinking boy and a royals right that was a great question\nDoug is on the line and Val ... hello Doug welcome to Monday talk\nBob I'm I'm a long time since ... son it's a long time ago\nTalked about double taxation\nThere's also a program where they tax Social Security benefits\n\nAnd it was created in Ninety three by six thirty four thousand and joined cry or earning forty four thousand can add eighty five percent of their Social Security benefits exposed to federal income tax rate\nAlthough not mistaken Doug they basically a subject all income\nAnd local taxes in states that have\nState taxes so whether the income is from Social Security or whether it's from um let's say rental income or whether it's from a salary or whatever it may be if it's income it generally is taxed at the prevailing rates of the state you live in\nAnd what it does come out\nHere so so I got out my thing is about thirty four thousand or my joy is about thirty four thousand that credit goes on my Social Security that I'm receiving\nAbsolutely correct but again this is in the income category this is money that is coming in to you in the form of additional money coming in from your Social Security account\nSo that's his income income than at home in a horse headed on that day she\nOf course you did and that's the reason you qualify for those payments but it's it's classified as income and when you classify it is incumbent become subject to the prevailing federal and state taxes under current law\n[laughter] that's true but don't you think that the double taxation orange security benefit\nI think it's double taxation on all income when you when you have federal and state income tax on the states that have that which is a forty one on everything and forty three on earned\nHave that ... of course it's double taxation but it's double taxation on income\nAnd that is prevailing across the country I'll give you a triple taxation Philadelphia gives you triple taxation with the Philadelphia wage tax New York city triple taxation with the New York city income tax so I'll I'll take your double taxation and I'll raise the ... the triple taxation\nThank you Doug appreciate the call very much\nLet's get Jay on the line listening to the mighty WLS Chicago Jay it is your return welcome\nThank you I was wondering if you invest and asked them five hundred or a total stock market or Irish invested\nWell ah it's a market risk investment is a stock market risk investment\nA zero risk investment would be an FDIC insured CD or a U.S treasury held the maturity held the maturity especially a treasury bill was short term that would be zero risk investment\nBut if you wanted to take a stock market risk investment that reflected the risk in the stock market at large that would be reflected in the U.S and be five hundred\nBecause [noise] um [noise] active [noise] recommendation [noise] quite a bit about it and uh [noise]\nOh no question about it in our active passive and let

way is a mutual fund remember that a mutual funds have three forms they have no Logan she'll funds loaded mutual funds and exchange traded mutual funds which are called ATF so they're all mutual funds so what he's talking about is\nThat people have traded in and out of exchange traded mutual funds and it's been there ...\nAh because they haven't been able to match the buying hold return in that

returned back to my company match if I have the funds to do so\nWell that's an option or certainly want to go up to the match me nuts the no brainer part of your question you absolutely want to go up

to the beyond that is going to depend also on whether you want that deduction right now are you in a high bracket\nI I Am\nAnd that would be thirty seven percent so that would be the same as getting a thirty seven percent a tax deduction on the money you put in that's a lot of money\n[noise] okay [noise] so so that's why we get older than I Would consider that I Would I Would consider that thirty seven percent as of now is if\nYou wanted to diversify more into or you could but I think if you're into thirty seven percent top bracket or as a high earner and\nI I think that's a really nice

B. E. N. radio buffalo although David\n... thank you for taking my call I appreciate it um well my question is I'm pursuing a business opportunity and um [noise] and try\nI actually I mean as I said at the drop of money from the IRA do continuously bonded a I'm not that I like totally but everything I'm obviously the the er the income has been low so the impact you know and I think it would be there uh\nWhat's your take on something like that again I said I'm not going to totally a widow everything it's like let me until you know I don't need it so to speak\nI'm not going to totally everything it's like let me until you know I don't need it for the state [noise]\n[noise] well my understanding is that if you are how old are you David\n\nMy understanding is that at your age if you take money out of your IRA you're going to have to pay a penalty on a withdrawal for not being fifty nine and a half and you're also going to have to pay in Buffalo the prevailing federal and state tax\n\nNow there is a way to potentially reduce your tax burden on that by setting up a seat core and establishing a corporate retirement account\nAnd if you do that if you do that and what I'd recommend because this might be beneficial to you what I Would recommend is that you sit down with a certified public it counted in your case and see if they could be helpful to you\nShow\nBy an hour of their time purchasing power of\nTheir time go over it and see if they can be helpful to you because they may be able to uh to help you to set the account up in such a way that you can use the money and reduce your burden because right now without that if you just take money out of an IRA\nAt the age of forty five even if you're using it in your business or to fund anything at that point you have a premature withdrawal friendly and you have federal and state tax in Buffalo so that's what I Would do a definitely a invested in an hour as a time of day a certified public accounting to go over that\nLet's get out to the show me state of Missouri and Tom is on the line Tom it's your turn\n... thank you Bob I'm seem like there's been articles or a book the death of retail and so forth and I'm Wondering if uh [noise]\nIf that continues if if we could see a situation where the\nS. and P. five hundred could become the S. and P. fifty or the S P five [noise] and and were hundreds of companies could just drop out by by having Amazon and Walmart and everything [noise]\nI Know sometimes a must feel like we're heading in that direction I can certainly understand why people would get that feeling I think some people were surprised when Amazon went out and acquired whole foods and the uh the Justice Department had very little to say about it uh\nI think that there's as long as the
