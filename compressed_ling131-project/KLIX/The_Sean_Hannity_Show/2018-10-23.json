I saw\n\n\nFormer speaker of the house Newt Gingrich is with us\nThey don't need silver didn't have a very good year and twenty sixteen but he had predicted both of Obama's victories I'm Scott Rasmussen was the closest pollster John McLaughlin was the other coast poster in twenty uh sixteen and he says there's an eighty six percent chance the Democrats take over the\nHouse eighty two percent chance that Republicans pick up seats in the Senate I don't have a feel on the house\nBut I Do believe Republicans could actually win Florida Tennessee\nMissouri Nevada Arizona for sure North Dakota for sure maybe Montana and if they didn't have a libertarian in Indiana they win that race for sure but they got a good shot beating Joe Donnelly in Indiana if people don't vote libertarian I'm On the house side it's very hard to get a feel forty retirements doesn't make it any easier\nMothers for best right but I think eighty eighty percent way too high and a little surprised the silver\nOr for the second cycle rose going that far out in a limb I'm most recent survey indicates that in fact you have 'em in the very closely contested districts and this was an NBC survey um that they actually are within about two points on the generic ballot\nWell if that's in the contest districts out we're losing the Democratic districts very badly world so not so much money and then we're not campaigning and I'm when I'm making our case a but but in the swing seats that matter a we actually are basically tied other generic 'bout\nIn and all I can tell you is\nI I look at the issues that are going to matter shoots the two things happening you see this little bit with Stacey Abrams or in in Georgia the candidate for governor who explained today that she's opposed to free enterprise and health care because she she hates making a profit and you never do any good if you make a profit um\nAnd and she is just very left wing cinema the Democrat in in Arizona for US Senate\nRefuses to apologize for urging Americans to saying it's okay for Americans to join\nThe Taliban um what's happened in Minnesota now where I think Keith Ellison may drag down the entire chicken except for any publisher and they may lose a Senate seat house seats the governorship a because with Keith Ellison is just so totally left wing and unacceptable\nAnd so I keep looking around at these patterns and uh I think what you're seeing is a remarkable moment where\nThe ... billion for example\nWhen we were talking about ten days ago you and I were that this was a race between jobs and march or if you look at the pictures coming out of Mexico right now you couldn't get a better picture of a mob and if you watch the Democrats\nCould can you can you stay for another five minutes I Want to really get into this more deeply out there because it's the terminal important where fourteen days out of an election two weeks from today you'll be voting and two weeks from tonight you'll be turning on your television sets and you're either going to have great news all the way around maybe it's going to be\nOr the ... they're actually fake news CNN actually says president wise tries to gin up division\nAnd they've never covered what Maxine Waters has been saying they've never covered a single thing of her saying you know create a crowd followed them in a grocery stores Paul them in the department stores gas stations and you tell them then I Want to hear anywhere anymore\nOr what's happened to Pam Bondi or secretary Nielsen Sarah Sanders a Ted Cruz and now Mitch McConnell and Henry Kissinger and you know obviously this is the the mob mentality is coming from the left nor do I see Mr Speaker nor can I say or\nOr elaborate on any one issue or program they're offering\nThat will help the lives of the American people not one that's not what they're running on\nYou know I look I I well they do run on\nA government run health care for everybody which they can't defend which which when you examine it collapses because is totally unsustainable financially and would be a nightmare to try to implement that's the closest thing they've come to a big idea and it's a really bad idea\nI agree totally All right um we'll be checking in regularly fourteen days to go or do you believe the admission by this Georgia gubernatorial candidate but see burned the state flag or is that going to change that race now\nWow I don't think that that doesn't change the race for the totality of her being a radical the fact that the organization she had it up\nTreat thousand falls voting registration for people who don't exist I mean I think the more we learn about her as more trouble she gets to be fine\nBut I appreciate it thank you so much a former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich let's get to our phones here uh oh I got to say Hi to big time AJ Houston, Texas he was the star\nAt the at the town hall I was in we had a wonderful time down in Texas I saw big time may J I saw a Rick Perry I saw Ted Cruz and there was a Jay came up on stage with me and uh you know I I don't know why I had a different mental picture of you\nAnd I mean you have this big huge massive powerful voice and you know what you like the same size as me\n[laughter]\nHow are you I enjoyed meeting you big time what's going on maybe\nA very very well I tell you I like I go to court rally last

I mean ... everybody was night everybody was beautiful I mean by a a child\nSo I hung up on stage and the everybody knew big time AJ from used an everybody in the crowd went nuts it was like you know I don't know if you were running for office which by the way may not be a bad idea at some point that you run\nAway or the other ... they're probably knock me out the bucks but it's funny you say that South Africa that China two guy in if you're a ballot at you know\nI saw you signing autographs it and I said I [laughter] I think crime signing autographs and then\nWe brought Linda on the stage and

these liberals after they lost and twenty sixteen I sucked it up when Obama won two terms you know we're survive whatever the country throws at us but wouldn't it be nice\nAgain to shock the world wouldn't that be nice to say that the Republicans not only are picking up houses in the seats in the Senate I'm pretty confident we can do that\nBut if we also prevent Nancy Pelosi from becoming

people that are coming from other countries that have horrific a\nOppression and those other countries and that very bad situations where we had the exact same story is for people who are on the list doing it legally with the exact same problems that I don't think it's a we should you know highlight those people's stories\nAnd you know get more exposure to those stories that are doing it the right way and say hey listen we draw the line everyone's got the same tragedies and [noise] or we will prior we will um disrespect the people that are doing it the right way by just letting anyone come in

are the wall up it would be for safe and more secure for both sides let me tell you what I don't ever want to have\nHappened and I have no doubt that many people not care of and they want a better life they're good people their government sucks there's no hope no opportunity and the government that gets so much aid from from us a lot of these governments that we give money to all around the world so many of them are corrupt and it doesn't ever get to the people where we want it to get to\nBut the reality is is we cannot allow we are a sovereign nation we have\nOur country that has built on a constitution and the rule of law this is the law the land we have a process designed to taking people from other countries you've got to first follow the law if you want to be in America\nThat's it and and I know the Democrats are silent on the issue but most Americans agree that you know they would be precipitating a showdown crisis where people are going to get hurt I don't want anybody on either side to get hurt\nNobody wants innocent people hurt out we don't know we can't vouch for every person in that crowd we can't say that there are not people that are bad intentions that they want to bring into America\nMaybe it's just the tiniest the percentage what if it's five people out of fourteen thousand we cannot risk that\nAnd by the way if we allow them to Rochelle border bone rushed the border and get in and we were all reward that behavior or the next one's going to be fifty thousand that's going to be a hundred thousand and then we'll have what Democrats love open borders and then they'll call for amnesty when they think they have no future generations\nAnd it's got to be stopped at some point I urge Mexico to do the job now in turn these people around that's their job

state is if you look at those numbers it's an are six or so it is a real fight we knew this a twenty two months ago when I was sworn in that this would be a a a fight for the foundation\nFor who gets the speaker's gavel in twenty Eighteen and voted it come true\nNow it seems like people are waking up voters are starting to turn out and we're thankful for every single one of these conservative voters that are going to the polls of the few days of early voting but again this is a con harassed rates you know for low unemployment ah like we've got growing the economy we didn't have done what I said I was going to do\nWell you also have the ninth district in a in a tight race\nAnd mark Harris is on on deck and Trump or the president is coming into port me and mark Harris both ah this coming friday night and so looking forward to mark Harris a winning the starting with him he's a great guy I've known him for two decades or so look forward to him winning and serving right alongside him\nWell this is an important race if you're in the thirteenth congressional district and you're in North Carolina including what much of high point or Greensboro all ... counties of um parts of Rhone counties and and some others you know this is a big raise this is going to be a bellwether race are to election I\nCounties well exactly thank you so much\nAll right thank you we wish you the best thanks so much for being with U.S Congress\nA race or let's get to our phones patios and but that is the Maryland Patty how are you\nI'm doing great how are you Sean\nI'm good thank you glad you called\nYeah you know I'm I just wish I believe in ... I Believe in what he's saying I Believe what you're saying you cannot let the migrants come in and now it's ridiculous it's out of control but it's all about the whole coordinate efforts and showing it so that the Democrats crack\nCan't play their same game as you know of course you ... you know the way they're using all of their their word to feel sympathy and field\nNext trust against the Republicans and trumpet so good at this she's just got to make sure again there's a coordinated effort said that there is she and the people there and the military show of force start sending buses start sending planes all staged they're ready to say we mean that\nThis is his red in line and the sad just like Obama hat\nWith Syria he didn't do that this is this is ... and he's got to show this in and handle this fight with a really good work needed Africa\nI'm really not worry yeah of course I Do I mean we don't want a humanitarian crisis you know the vice president actually said today that\nYou know Central American leaders told him that left us in Venezuela or bankrolling this caravan which wouldn't ... Honduran right resident telling the vice president that then Pence told the Washington Post the president of on doors told me this was organized by leftist groups in Honduras financed by Venezuela look\nBottom line is they should be turned back\nNow but if in fact\nWe see they're getting closer and closer to our southern border we've got to protect the border\nWe're going to do this in a way I I Know that is we want to have the best interests of innocent people and all of this nobody's innocent if they're willing to just brush our border Russia across the border\nWe don't want people hurt we definitely don't want people killed and ultimately the people that will precipitate this crisis they're going to be on the Mexican side of the border\nBecause America is not going to do anything to people that don't violate the law but if they violate the law there'll be arrested and I I hear what you're saying we should have food water medicine supplies and transportation back to where they came from\nAnd I I think you're going to do it in as as expeditious way possible with them as much care as possible um but I don't think any arrest ever looks good and if the people on the Mexican side of the border border one of confrontation\nWith American police and ice and our military\nOur side is gonna win and you're right we should do it as compassion early as possible I don't want anybody to get hurt\nYou know a lot of these people probably come from nothing they have zero to lose here and\nThat's a that's a tough position to be in and then you have agitator that or you know they're not telling them anything that's on us than truthful that they're they're telling them they're going to get in and so they're going to be disappointed feelings of anger anger who's gonna probably be on display so we're just hoping to get a turned around before this even happens\nBut well you know let's let's be clear here this is the United states of America where a constitutional republic we believe in the rule of law and the application of\nOur laws that's it Democrats don't like it they can change the law good luck to them doing that on this topic which John Podesta says they shouldn't even be talking about right anyway Patty thank you I'm Becky as in Tucson, Arizona next on the Sean Hannity show how are you glad you called Becky\nHi Sharon how are you today I'm good what's going on well I got a couple of things things from a border town okay that people don't understand about this this law that's kinda [noise] yes they come to our border but they don't understand that they also come with a lot of diseases like TV\nAffairs this law that's kinda [noise] yes they come to our border but they don't understand that they also come with a lot of diseases like TV chicken pox in life and our border patrol agents and all are people that are working with them get exposed to this\nThey don't understand there's long term ramifications of him and I had a feeling of thought about why I'm a ... government it's not stopping some mob\nIt's because when they come here and earn money they send millions and millions and millions of dollars hacked to their family members the wire transfer so why should they stopped them because they're making money off of it so I think we should stop the wire trained first\nLook there is a part of me having been down to where you live in Tucson\nThe Rio Grande everywhere in between and I've been I've reported on the border more than anybody else that I Know in media today that Ben horseback all terrain vehicle helicopters boats I'd been there I've seen a I was up close and personal when it turned out gang members were being arrested I've got the video of it\nDrug warehouses tunnels I've seen it all look I understand that people come from countries where there's great poverty and little opportunity um but the answer isn't not obeying the laws that we have\nA an immigration policy immigration laws the first step if you want to ever come to America is to respect the laws of this land and respect\nAmerican sovereignty and respect our borders and that if you're not willing to do that basic most fundamental of things and then at that point there are other people that would would be willing to accept that and do it the right way and they should have precedence over those that are law lesson don't respect our laws\nSo it's really really simple and you know I feel listen to the world America had the money you know we do so much already ... the tunes are billions and trillions of dollars were spent over the years to help other people in other lands\nAt some point we've got to take care of America First\nWe've got to take Americans out of poverty first we've got Americans that need help in this country that that don't yet have not fully gotten on board we need every American successful and those that can take care of themselves they will be taking care of no Americans never lack for compassion\nJust the opposite there's never been a country that has accumulated more power and used it for the advancement of human good around the world more than the U.S including paying the price and shutting the blood for the cause of liberty and freedom for many people around the world um\nBut it is that if we cannot take on the world's problems either we don't have the money we don't have\nThe ability to do that anyway eight hundred million for one showing you want to be a part of the program dawn is in Iowa Don Hi how are you glad you called\nHi Sean thank you for taking my call I appreciate it a I'm a marine veteran\nYes sir semper fi glad you're glad you called\nSilver ... thank you sir I called actually to\nEcho what you had earlier reported about this uh uh being finance or through Venezuela in it that kind of reminds me of a very good friends with the Venezuelan this is a rock Obama and this kind of had that feel that it came up through him\nI just I feel that that this has got his his uh organizing feels written all over it\nWas an I don't ... you mean in terms of the caravan well there are literally the vice president is saying today and and again I don't know who's organizing it who's funding it I Know that you know I get the distinct feeling that there\nA little the vice president is saying today and and again I don't know who's organizing it who's funding it I Know that you know I get the distinct feeling that there are you know the the less silence on this is very suspicious to me you know why don't they speak out about protecting our borders", "year": "2018",
