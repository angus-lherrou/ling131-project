that it's\nReally about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... in labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Ilan mosque or being very very ... well you know he's involved in driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also got his finger in this whole neural net a business is a a really the new one of the new hot topics out there\nI imagine a ... and ... and ... imagine this because we're already doing it with my ... and and then the very near future um you know it's pretty certain that we're going to be doing it with humans but imagine this un jak\nReally what amounts to a very fine fisherman's net think of it I think of it as a fisherman snatch so you injected into the brain cavity of a mouse and when you do that it's almost like tossing out a fishing net it wrapped itself around the brain\nAnd then kind of a integrate itself into the brain tissue and so it becomes one with a brain tissue and there's no room that has a lead a electrical lead a coming out of it\nAnd the idea is that now we have a mechanism we have a real honest to goodness mechanism by which we can tap into the human mind and plug it into let's say the Internet so one of the things that the lawn mosque is thinking about doing that and by the way you don't even have to have a lead you could have a wireless connection\nThat's that's even better but one of the one of the things that you know a mosque as foreseen\nIs a day when when you were to use the one of these narrow and that we can actually surf\nThe Internet with our thoughts we don't need a ... or anything like that so I think that is the beginning of the of of the mechanism we can use to upload our thoughts are memories are in code them digitally um it's not at all farfetched anymore once you have that in\nThe upload our thoughts are memories are in code them digitally um it's not at all farfetched anymore once you have that in our own that you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will our thoughts onto a super computer and you know\nQuantum computers are on the horizon is so ... you're talking about supercomputers quantum computers are going to be like\nWhoa [laughter] way way out there right and so it could easily\nEasily a whole you know it's not just the ordinary flash drive I mean you can hold on a ... a person's entire a lifetime history of memories and then as I say robots are becoming very realistic\nWay can read about that tonight ... I I think\nThat's the way to go not cryogenic that will ... is a kind of an old school I'm not saying that it's not going to be around it it will be but I think these other technology is much more sexy and much more practical\nYou know and so and I'm not going to try and partially what you said to me it's been a ... I think it's fair to say and this is where I I think I draw maybe a different line than you do in this narrative moving forward is when we use terms like thinking about doing or\nYou know beginning of the mechanism that's what I'm Talking about when I see the future because what we can do now is the frontier but that's not where these are going into you know as we would say cilia logically that's not the end game for where these things are and I think partly that's the scary peace because\nYou know ugly ... if we take our science fiction movies seriously then we're often reminded that what starts off as a really good idea [laughter] I couldn't go terribly wrong when it actually becomes applied science right\n... thank you thank yeah absolutely oh I\nKnow absolutely and and you're right there's this book deals with we're right at the house in and I I think that's what makes it exciting but it also makes it in for some degree unsettling and and even downright dangerous that we we are really at the threshold of these technologies ...\nAre are kind of one foot in the present and one foot in the immediate future and so you're right it it you know it enables us\nIf you will to make very accurate forecast in other words we're not talking about pie in the sky\n... you know the sweet bind by one day no these are things that are now becoming realized and so we can have this kind of discussion about hey what what kind of world are we creating what what is ... is a mortality in any sense of the word now possible [noise]\nAnd the short answer is yes it is very much so now that we have\nA ... they we are creating these are incredible robots artificial intelligence so we have the ability to manipulate DNA now at well so so yes you're absolutely right that what we're discussing is the near future but it is it's it's enabling right now it's it's crazy\nWell and so I'm reminded of the ... the ... song\nUm which I I inevitably come back to an subjects like this history shows again and again how nature points up the folly of men Godzilla\nAnd and the the the I think this is where and I'm sort of curious about your approaching this because this book is published by a a publishing company which is known for being faith based\nAnd and I think this is in in in the in the certainly in the publicity for the book but even as you get into there's a larger discussion of not just doing things because we can but because we should do and the office\nDiscussion of not just doing things because we can but because we should do and the arts are really important in there too so you know just because we're on the threshold of doing some things aren't we do that\nAnd ... how are we going to make a decision on the implications of when we decide yep this is where we're going with this\nYeah you're you're right about regular you know when they approached me to write this book and I have to give them credited with their idea um and you know they said basically hey you know you you really love writing about science history and I do I love science history\nBecause of the lessons it teaches us about what we can do and what we can't do what we should do and what we shouldn't do [noise]\nUm they said why don't why don't you write about you know what's going on right now you're you're uniquely qualified you've been reporting science all your life and\nI thought about it and it was a kind of a no brainer I said yeah I'll do it and then they gave me the the freedom to kind of\nYou know opine about this that I Am a because I'm a theoretical physicist and you know I I I'm very strict about things so I decided I was going to write a book and the four sections that that I describe\nAll ... it's just like you know the old dragnet series you know the facts ma'am right Andrew ... that's what I did with those four sections there more than a thousand foot now if you can imagine\nOh no I've read through to you you're very very thorough\nVery thorough but then I allowed myself that last final chapter and I thought you know I Can't just serve this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it and so here here my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise]\nUm I see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence that really spectacular many of them are brilliant are a lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this but then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous [noise]\nWhat I think we need now because we are at this threshold of creating\nFor ourselves a world that can either be grim or great\nAnd so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other\nIs to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I\nGrew up in east LA with the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really and that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics math and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started asking myself how does this universe that I've been studying come to me and I explored Hindu wisdom and Buddhism and ... a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and [laughter]\nAnd finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I wasn't interested I thought was like five or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it it's so I became a man of faith faith I'm a Christian\nAnd I take my son my face very very seriously and so when I say\nWe need to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion ancient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist sets a faith system there are some innovations in this book that I think\n\nMichael Guillen former science reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book is ah is is just great it's a the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in\nDiscussions of what we should and ought to do which might be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving your physical life on this planet\nIs like the weather that was through uploading brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nQuestion whether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for that what is the ultimate was the end use for that um other than our own human vanity that we become immortal\n[noise] yeah I agree with you and and uh I think in another concern a in addition to that is that a lot\nAgree with you in and uh I think in another concern a in addition to that is that a lot of this technology that we're we're kind of ... we're talking about right now it's no longer speculative it's actually happening\nIs very expensive um you know and and never mind are trying to achieve immortality through some of this technology let's let's talk about some of the technology that is being used to let's say\nA I'm a help treat macular degeneration I'm going to just pick that as an example there is such a good way in California right there's a company in California that is a marketing a retinal implants for people who are have macular degeneration and their eyesight a going away\nAll that stuff costs you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most insurance policy so\nA lot of this technology that that are aimed at improving our health Hansing our health enhancing our life achieving immortality is going to be available to the super rich\nAnd so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to do to the dynamics of a society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people elites if you will I'm\nAble to to benefit from the ... and the others are you know like being put out of business by robots and so I talk seriously about a ... in my book I talk seriously about the possibility of there being a human revolution you know we often talk about in science fiction often ... picks\nYou know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the earth well you know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the way this technology is shaping up right now is for people who have been kind of disenfranchised\nUm or marginalized by this technology will just be get fed up at some point and say you know this is enough is enough I mean we're we're shaking and we're taking it as a behind and and\nAnd and and we're not going to we're not going to take it anymore and so ... and and I it's interesting and I talk about in the book\nDoes ring or I Know you talk like that to the people in Salem no use that kind of I mean really [laughter] I gotta I gotta be really on a limb there you know and [laughter]\nYeah so I figured it's a late night show so\nI'm trying to get all your gun and now I Know it's\nLate but you know nevermind regularly I got to worry about my wife you know tied to head the white you said was a bus or [laughter]\nBut um but I talk about how a lot of these guys from Silicon Valley are actually are buying these what they're calling bug out houses\nRent they're buying houses in these remote places in the country and in the world\nOn the chance that you know when this stuff hits the fan there I go again or one of the stuff hits the fan they they want to be able to escape and this is a serious thing I Hope some I quote former Google engineers and a Google executives are and and others\nWho say yeah you know a human revolution is a real possibility many of them are trying to avoid that possibility now by talking about the universal basic income\nOkay but he knows the meat and you listen I listen to ... ... ... ... because yes\nThe idea of having a bug out house right\nYeah that's like I mean every every you know church of latter day saints person I Know has a has that philosophy right is it ... yeah I Know lots of other people who practice that believes that doesn't that's not the same to me although I understand your point\nI'm thinking about I I'm more reminded of of ah you know what Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park when he said you know the dinosaurs\nOh I I'm more reminded of of ah you know what Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park when he said you know the dinosaurs had\nTheir chance right they're done\nThey they ... they ... that was there a moment and the fact\nThat bringing them back is is to reintroduce say living dinosaurs just because we can\nIs and the and the notion to that for example when you talk about the the the wealthy elites as opposed to the intellectual elite sort of the physical elites or any other types of ways in which we the moral or leads any way we could you know a ... quantify society\nIt's the wealthy elites aren't necessarily the best in anything except inheriting stuff you know some of them might have gotten it on their own\nBut not all of them and then if that\nBecomes the ... the class that's perpetuated I Would say again they had their chance to ... ... it has to there has to be a Darwinian element to that where somebody else is going to have to come along behind them or we turn into Illinois and more locks from H. G. wells time machine right\nMhm yeah yeah yeah yeah no it it it's interesting ah by the way I interviewed ... this is just a funny aside when in fact when Jurassic Park came out I was at ABC News and\nI had been in touch with the producers and they invited me to come to the big Hollywood premiere and the at the after party and Jet Blue and was there and\nA bunch of other guys and I went up to ... I said Jeff you know you're always like playing a scientist\nOr not just in Jurassic Park but elsewhere and I said sure I I'm just curious I said you know I did you have an interest in science growing up or what it says not just a job and you know he has all how is that right is appointed in his answer I thought he was going to say oh yeah you know I majored in physics at\nCollege right now you know [laughter] but no job\nFor him but yeah it ... I ... I Love you bringing that up in the dinosaurs had their chance [noise] it's really an indication of how the earth how the world works how the universe works\nAre designed to work as designed to work exactly yeah and\nYou know a lot you know your ... somebody's religious beliefs aside for a moment let's just talk like strictly science sure um ... what what we learn is that uh the species have a window of\nTime in which they rise up and they flourish then they die out for whatever reason whether it's a meteor or whether it's a\nA temperature change or or it's a a rampant disease that ... that I'm In you know like the woolly mammoth saber tooth cats and so forth and so on\nAnd the dinosaurs are and and one wonders as as as you contemplate these innovations that we're creating the ones that I describe in this book you can't help but wonder ... are we doing here and then I think of what Arthur C Clark one set and it stuck with me\nHe said it remains to be proven that intelligence has any survival value\n[laughter] I go oh\nYou know and you wonder are we like outsmarting ourselves you know are we are we just being too clever by a half with a staff thinking that you know we're going to improve life the we're going to improve the human condition and in fact just the opposite happens we do ourselves in\nI mean that's a real possibility and and and you think of Jeff Goldblum face they had their chance maybe some some creature in the future we'll look back at us and say yeah oh yeah human beings they had their their chance\nNow he blew it up\nSure we'll look back at us and say yeah oh yeah human beings they had their their chance now he blew it\nUp and now here's an age now let me ... is up a little differently\nYeah there was a ... humans ... killed off species\nThey didn't die out naturally they were killed off\nAs opposed to say\nEvolution they weren't they they weren't allowed to follow their evolutionary cycle that was truncated right by you know the fact that they you know some giant bird and New Zealand laid these really big exit you know human could eat off for three days and so\nUm you know there's going to so I mean I I realize you can make a Darwinian argument for that but I think there are some species like some\nLike some there are some tiger whenever that if we cloned that Darren brought him back in ... introduced it to the wild not enough time has passed\nThat he couldn't read absorbed that back into the the natural flow of\nOur evolutionary cycles um but I Do think when we start looking into the future and then we started making all these plans of who's going to be and who's going to not be that's when I think you'd get super well to use the words in your book ominous but\nWere interactive can help with consistent monthly reports he had anytime access to your site metrics you always know what's going on with your website\nMy name is Marilyn I mean I'm not going to get it out and play\nGood having a ... if you don't know how to find them when you're when you're not only\nGetting easier even if you remember that you can log into the site and see what happens with parents where either rent out the right price for that I'm here locally in the ... the reason I print out a ... year old ... ... ...\n... is our technical parents ...

the bumper was pretty predictable it's like a law\nUh but still a great dog after all these years Michael Gilliland is the author of this a book the end of life as we know it ominous news from the

next on coast to coast am this is Ian but it [noise]\n[noise] we've got a great feeling story carnivores\nOne of those botanical gardens so absolutely so amazing David if you're a guy that has overcome severe issue\n[noise] [noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay\nAh where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it or just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up they the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to\nA level of success with monkeys and so now emboldened by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who has been quoted a frequently\nOr who is a quadriplegic ah you know otherwise\nMentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig and there are scientists who are over her quoted as saying yeah they're going to do it so we're at once again you know remember\nI'm I'm old enough to remember the first artificial heart\nTransplant sure yeah you remember that a Jobbik are sure of what was his name Jobbik right or yeah something like that and um\nEverybody cringed at oh my God way way putting them which mechanical hard in a human being and the you know was in South Africa right and yeah a ... and ... and ... and\nAnd you know now artificial hearts are pretty routine thing although now you know with stem cell research and other things going on a day where even getting past mechanical hearts hey by the way in a you talk about things that give me some pause here's one\nThere are three groups of scientists in California and Minnesota and you know I read that it's like Minnesota that's like so random but okay there you are\nNo you're right that the minute University of Minnesota's a monster for ... you had a huge research you it's a it's an are one it's a big school\nNo no you're right you're right I just it just I don't know why this gives me an article but anyway you have three groups of scientists who are creating a creatures that have never walked the face of the year before they're called ... has really there shape human and pick human come air so these are\nCreatures whose DNA has been knit together you\nAre there called come era's shape human and pick human come air so these are\nCreatures whose DNA has been knit together using human DNA and shoot the N. A. or human DNA pick DNA and they're creating these creatures because they will have human Oregon they will have human kidneys\nHuman livers human hearts for the purpose of you know transplanting them to patients and neat and you know I get that I had a friend who who died recently because his kidneys just went south and he could get a transplant and boom\nA but now what that's done is to raise the very real possibility not discuss the book that\nIf you put too much human DNA into the recipe you know so it's always a question too much human DNA too little human DNA then you don't get the human organs right if you put in too much DNA then you can have an animal a creature\nThat thinks like him and that has basically human brain trapped inside of a body of a sheep or a pig I mean these these are the things that are very real now because of our ability to tamper with DNA um so that's one of the things that gives me it gives me a little bit later that we really want to and what's interesting is that\nThese guys are doing it and by the way I quote one of the researchers that says yeah that's that's a real possibility says it's not like you know made up of pie in the sky I mean they even the researchers admits yeah we got to be careful this possibility\nBut they're doing this research against the wishes of the anti age the national institutes of health which is the government's never one funny body for biological genetic engineering so even the anti age it's kind of very um [noise] yeah you know forward thinking of funding organization is saying you know maybe we should just push the pause\nButton and decide do we want to do this and if so what are the guidelines for the guard rails\nAre I'm sure I'm sure these guys are no just doing it in violation of the ancient probably doing it against the advice of their moms and what do you do yeah they don't\nMind the oh my God they were ... when I was growing up in east LA and then ... says the town over and I was a real geek I mean I was speaking out when I was a kid and I found a way to make hydrogen gas using stuff that I found in my mom's kitchen and I look back and I'm Out there in the garage at the ... of our how\n[laughter] making hydrogen gas and you know that stuff is explosive\nYou know below I Would filled balloons up with it and then send little insects law just to see what happens that's like a I was eight and a little mad scientist in an area to create\nYour own space program against their will right by the way these\nGuys that come area you're right the mothers I say why do you do get right up suing that already go this is all played tiddlywinks or something safer\nIn Delhi ... as you mentioned earlier when you mentioned that the the game is still tied in the fifteenth between Boston and LA you kidding me know so I didn't know what I think the ending\nFifteens inning game three of the world series Richard tweeted out on Twitter he said he's listening to this show and watching\nThe uh the world series game he said it's like sinking a pink Floyd in the wizard of Oz he said the kind of works and so I don't know I I guess I guess that means I'm committed a lot of errors because that's how that's how it's happening right now still there's two men on\nTop of the fifteenth and well we'll keep an eye on it so All right Joe ... the the island of Dr Morrow things pretty scary it really is\nBut I I I still you know now do you think of what the technology that people do you see all the commercials for\nWhich I'm you know we're Siri you know\nThe technology that people you see all the commercials for\nWhich I'm you know we're Siri you know what how cold is it outside I don't want to look out a window series is it snowing\nYou know or you know Google ... ... ... ... you know by me some more uh ten meet whatever and these commercials or the ... everybody's focused on that type of business and I kinda get it\nBut there were just beginning to learn the downs of having a microphone connected um and and monitored inside of one's house aren't we\nYeah and that's another it's interesting you bring that up because that was on my short list of things to worry about it and that's the other thing we're bringing about ourselves okay you're a ... if you're absolutely right I tell\nThe story of a little girl in Dallas texas who use the Amazon Echo or you know and said hey Alexa buy me a bunch of cookies hey Alexa by may ... you know this a\nDollhouse fancy fancy dollhouse and\nParents were totally clueless stuff starts arriving at the house the parents freak out but here's the punch line and\nYou would think that the parents will have learned a lesson and like ditch the echo you know get rid of it ah but instead I have a mother quoted as saying you know we need to whisper around ...

[laughter] yeah I Know it's\nSo big brother in a way to because it's not just I mean that story\nAnd ... and again I remind people will get to the phones you're coming up they're already ringing and will line of people to to talk with Michael deal in the end of life as we know it in a few but\nBut that story out of turkey about the supposedly the audio recording that was made by this guy ... um you know apple watch\nThat they were able to monitor his apple watch and record his torture and just now I I don't know that I Believe that I don't know that it really really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter may be there in the Saudi constantly they have a they have Google and they had the Little Syria or whatever and they monitor that way but however\nIt happened that kind of the debt that passive\nListening that is going on that we had not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are communities\nAnd for the security of our country I've just had an op ed that is going to be published very shortly I'm a U.S a Congress issued a report on Thursday so\nA saying that um the Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nThe her videos that kind of a that your friends your either your dishwasher everything that's connected\nAll the smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's or the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on\n... there are now a more than a billion Internet uh of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book\nAnd the Chinese are ... see this as an opportunity to buckets to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you talk about the show he thing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nRight but she was murdered and the police started looking into the the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder and how they came in to kill he killed his wife in the basement and we started looking at things and they found she was wearing a watch\n\n\nMichael before we started getting all these calls waiting for you let's ruled that story back about twenty seconds before we 'cause I was ... I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [laughter]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed a one story and the police looked into it or his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a face woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so\nThey downloaded the data from the fitbit and they found out that the they could actually get this\nCalculate how many feet chi walk and it didn't square with the story from the husband and then and then other things started happening with Facebook\nIn other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology out at this husband he ended up being charged with murder because of this this kind of a Internet of things that are fine on every aspects of our life they can tell you when you're asleep when you're awake how many feet you are what your heart rate\nAre fine on every aspects of our life they can tell you when you were asleep when you're awake how many feet you are what your heart rate uh you know it if you watch Netflix see the the they they download what you're watching when how for how long I mean there ... this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but we've invited\nOn ourselves in we're well these gadgets\nYet and I liked him a lot of them I mean I were an apple watched by the way they used that as a plot device that thing about the fitbit in a ... a law and order episode last week the exact same thing they took it from the real life\nOh they do maybe they are they always do you know ripped from today's headlines so he uh but that's where I mean I\nI think that they like to catch a killer is one thing people literally go good they kind of killer because of the ... the hard part will be is when evidence is presented in court that's collected from some of these ancillary passive data collection systems which\nAccidentally convicts somebody who didn't commit a crime I mean that that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test of this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI now having this humongous database of face prince\nRight or that they don't you cover and\nThe ... yeah and and and and they have like a eighty they they allow themselves in eighty percent accuracy rate for the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent inaccuracy room with which raises the possibility that you and I\nCan have the FBI knocking on our doors because they think we committed a crime based on their database but the facial recognition technology that they're using to id and could finger culprits it's wrong twenty percent of the time and and by the way\nResearchers who are looking into it from Australia and elsewhere are saying it's it's more than twenty percent and so this this is what you just described is a very real possibility now where innocent people\nAre going to be fingered by a by a screen up\nA Michael deal in the end of life as we know that let's get you Keith who's in Virginia on coast to coast am key\nHello can you hear me in a perfectly good are you tonight on my own turned back up there you go and get a question from Michael yes Michael and I heard you were speaking about the ah\nJarvis cart have a couple of friends one of which I Would be a great guess because of his favorite experience\nAnd service even as a whistle blower this call them coast to coast and before but uh it'd be great to have him on\nTo tell a story about a lot of things [noise] um well I'm a I'm a predecessors that artificial heart was a a heart open heart surgery that was a heart lung machine\nAnd Dr wrestling Nelson a\nWorked on that at the University of Minnesota understand that a sharp a cart was at the University of Utah\nAnd ... years earlier and he and his career as a heart surgeon\nAt some paranormal experiences wanted which was a where he did a surgery that a technique that had never been done before\nAnd he describes it as after praying to know what to do that basically a ... or whatever it was quite right\nIt was after praying to know what to do that basically it's as if a ... or whatever it was clear right in his mind and he did the surgery a from most instructions said he was able to see it in his mind and later a gotta\nGet you a question because there's so many people who have questions for Michael so if you want to hang on for an open line called the sounds more like that but did you have a question from Michael\nThat could be yeah I'm a lotta her mouth and by the way is\nI'm going to put you on hold I'm going to put you on hold right now and we just let me get back to the cause I Know there's ... we had our time is pressures in an open lines is where that kind of belong\nSo let me go to Tracy who is trucking in Alabama with a question for Michael Guillen Tracy\nMichael I got one question for you here where does it and where to stop when do we stop playing God\nOr are we ... we those are good question but are we playing God yet and when do we play God is maybe is another question but Michael [noise]\nWell I think that is the ultimate question that trace he's asking and uh you know I I quote a very well known biologist in the book\nUm who was actually a a major participant in in mapping\nThe human genome remembered the human genome project sure it wrapped up in two thousand and three and there was a big ceremony and the White House Bill Clinton was president and he said now we have discovered the language of God now that we've mapped the human genome well this biologist Craig Venter I quote him in the book\nAnd ... and it's a very telling quote and I have to be careful but he says you know when it comes to biology we don't know blank I'm not going to use the word he uses but he was when it comes to biology we don't know blank now this is a guy who was in the thick of it\nAnd this this is directly in answer to Tracy is excellent question that in effect what Craig Venter is in South is saying is look we're we're toying with something we don't know squat about and and and that is a recipe for dangerous picture\nA child playing with matches or worse than that plane with a nuclear bomb or playing with a dynamite you know you pick your your your pick ... imagery and that is really the picture that emerges when you read my book\nWhatever you think about the technology and there's a lot of positive but let's keep in mind that you're going to have Ninety nine positive consequences wonderful sunshine positive consequences like the neural prosthetics but all it takes is one stink or that can really thin\nRight that does everything else\nBut I think that's the crux two of the playing God premise are we playing God or are we would we cure a disease\nIf the diseases natural it was as God made it natural in New York is hurricanes are we not playing God when we cure a disease\nI I I I get what you're saying and that's why I tend to avoid this phrase although I Know it's a popular phrase phrase right and\nThat's what I'm saying it's too weak to use for that context as it doesn't really encompass all the ways in which you know when we make a better break pad\nOr do I mean there were always attempting to try to save lives and sometimes those will come with unintended consequences but it was really a matter of playing God I I think it's true with the ... thing I think that gets into a very weird area though [laughter]\nYeah no no I agree and and I I think you know what it's like when we restore sight the blind with these retinal\nIt's very weird area though [laughter] yeah no no I agree and and I I think you know what it's like when we restore sight the blind with these retinal transplant I I mean that can be said we're playing ... so I what I like to do is look I when I was at ABC News I covered the Persian Gulf War story\nYou remember when they lift the oilfields on fire oh totally I what I was\nVie for television correspond to actually find my way to those oil you know a ... a a oil fields that were on fire and the way I had to get their way through a minefield we got a guy from aramco the a Saudi Arabian oil company he knew our way through the mind feels\nAnd so that's how I I think of trace this question is I see it there I see as navigating a mine field\nAnd you know so far we've been able to avoid a stepping on that one line that's going to do it then but as we progress with some of the stuff that is unsettling and outright dangerous nevermind a great stuff okay\nThat's gonna sunshine I if I say all it takes for us to do with the step on that one line that one hit and mine\nAnd it's just going to blow us up\nOkay we're Mississippi thing I think that will be the end if it had to come that way but now I have it in\nOkay so you're the scientist you're the you're the you got the PHD in physics [noise] let me just give you\nWant to be recycled dot org a public service advertising

I Wonder how often when I'm driving down the road how I can trust\nThe authenticity of the Bible because [noise] you know I have often heard that a lot of the major story from it like the story of the fraud and the story of I'm In a like a [noise]\nI said you're our hero type figure being one of a virgin and stuff those steroids can be found in like ... that the Carl Caulk snow like ancient shoreline ten pac from like the marrying the Babylonian get uh whatever creates the Bible so\nYou're talking about the ...\nYou're talking about ... if you're talking about the story of NOAA for example um and there are some very interesting parallels in the in the guilt diminish narratives should the news story [noise] um and you are correct in saying that there had been other traditions that had a sort of\nMan God um that was birthed by a human mother but from a a divine father and that that is is just another version of that\nSo the question to me always is not this to me\nAnd this is where I think a lot of it in my personal opinion I Believe this is where some people get really hung up because I'm not going I'm not trusting the Bible because it has so many facts in it I trust the Bible because of how many troops it has in it\n[noise] okay there's a there's a difference to me and there are ...\nThat we know to be a worse steering by right there there you can count you can count on these troops or that for example when you're good to others they will be good to you or even if they are good to you\nYou still have to be good to them because it only makes us is Jewish worse you know an ... so there are ... and and a lot of these stories to tell the truth is the actual facts\nOf these stories it's always been less interesting to me too so I'll be honest we\nBuy it or they'll let you know story that can be found in other places we can still try you're saying like the other information on the ...\nWell no here what I Would say though is that even some of those other stories there are some of those things which you have heard that probably aren't true so there are some people who win Christianity was catching on over two thousand years ago\nOr ... other people started in ... like I'm emphasizing\nSomething from their tradition saying see were just like Christianity and so it was because of the rise of Christianity that they started to really promote the things that they said had pre existed\nThat story whether they did or not there's really there really isn't always a lot of proof about that there isn't in the Egyptians there's there's a little bit of a tradition of that but but it in the end does it matter\nI mean it it it's do you can you do live your life better does it improve your life that's the question and I think getting hung up on worrying about whether or not the Bible is a book of science there's a lot of people treat it like it's supposed to be a science book and it's not I don't think [noise]\nUm and I think the stories are very instructive and we need to you know re learn from them every day\nUm and I think the stories are very instructive and we need to you know re learn from them every day\nHow\nDo you think of that that's my best answer for you I Hope it gives you some detour while you're while you're on the open road with a full tank of\nGas and and the lifestyle out here to things sound good [laughter] good\nWill be ... be a you know if you're a bad man in the gym and you get where you're going well and thank you so much for joining in and I'm Glad you're was the first time I got to be there with you\nUm I go to a adjusted in who's in Texas on coast to coast Justin\nHey buddy say\nHey yeah and it's nice to be on my list that river ever actually call them or have you ever wanted to take it to the left everybody's on the the religious aspect but uh you know whatever you want to get some more scientific stuff yeah sure I'm not sure if a lot of people call it that Iran mosque interview\nOr he had with Joe Rogan and I only smoked ...\nYeah they they I think there are a little out there but uh\nI think somebody is uh that night logically advanced in the mind and has the means to do a lot pretty impactful when he says things about like a a guy in a diabetic augmentation and stuff and uh I really thought it was a neat\nMetaphor they use saying how human beings are pretty much augmented already carrying their cell phones around you know we have the ability on the massive\nComputations and access to any kind of data that we had that we want and all that and he said that you know in the very\nNear future that could possibly be a thing that we could do hands free you know and uh you know what would that do maybe to the educational system would we go to school but we just take a loss of classes to learn how to think properly you know\nYeah well we need more of those I think we need more of those [noise] no I think I think I think I think philosophy would be we treat or ... yeah I think we treat philosophy of some sort of exotic thing and it was really the first thing around which all education was built and\nIt's just a fine arts credit that people just have\nTo have to write it because it can do it if it's not that it's dance you know or something so aside and dance at least ... you don't have to go [laughter]\nBut you know to your point on on ... I'm a big believer in I'm In his technological shoot solutions on big I'm big on sustainability um\nUh the Joe Rogan interview is troublesome because I think actually if you want to look at it in a different way all the time he spent talking about being depressed or you know his mental state from over working and not sleeping enough and et cetera\nI I think that review much more of these humanness which we don't and we tend to think almost of Ilan must cause some big giant slot machine\nYeah somebody in the whenever he's just he's a human being\nRight and he may be a slightly unstable human being these days I\nI own Venus is are you know I ... that's a very intellectual always have some kind of inner struggle\nRight and so I'm a I I'm an investor actually in a very small way I'm In a couple of thousand dollars for the stock which took a hit after that Joe Rogan interview and uh and has recovered mostly\nOr something like that would affect stock\nWell I don't know that though because I see my argument would be that Iran must we I invested in the lung mosque mhm right I didn't I invested in him I decided at some point probably after the sixty minutes interview\nOn his dentures but as a person\nYeah I thought that guy smart he gets it um and I think he's going to come up with cool stuff and it's going to make life better and\nThey bought on that basis so when I'm watching him in the interview I'm watching the wheels come off right I'm watching it was the wheels are going to eat and just like watching a Tesla with the wheels are coming up it would be very worrisome so I I I think anytime\nThe head of the company like that become so synonymous with the product I think they have to be much more careful about how they live their lives in public that's my feeling on that but but I don't want to take away from him 'cause I Know I agree to use its own genius\nI think these photos and stuff a little more on it in on public but I think the thought process that everything is pretty consistent whether he was an easy read it or not he claims that that's a that's a very\nSoon future you know ... was based in June of Nineteen you know what I mean right now than this but they were mentally getting more technical logically advanced we have robots now\nYou're struggling with your mortgage payments not knowing what to do you do nothing but if you do something\nLikely to get the most positive about\nMaking homo for to bars and free government\nHousing expert about your options\nIn eighty nine Ninety five\nVisit making on what portable dark\nCouncil [noise] news then talk on the radio\nStations use radio ... yeah ... you know what you're\nBreaking the law love jak Ella and Fox News the longest game of the world series history I think just a few minutes ago and dramatic fashion\nHigh man [noise]\nJoe Buck would the call on Fox ... overcoming seven hours twenty minutes after the game started making the Dodgers three to two winners Red Sox still leave the world series two games to one game for later tonight in LA the FBI says the fourteen devices meld the leading Democrats this week we're potentially\nWorking bombs that have suspected of sending the battle custody\nA latent fingerprint from a package tend to California congresswoman Maxine Waters plus other DNA evidence help police identify stays are say act that fifty six year old Florida resident accused of sending more than a dozen dangerous packages the former President Obama Hillary Clinton and other high profile Democrats\nBut we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nFBI Director Christopher Wray says the packages each contains six inches of PVC pipe ...

I grew up on the collection of Addams family\nBooks from I'm from Charles Adams the or the original cartoon and so I I Can't believe I slipped by me but you're exactly right and uh I I Love to get the

as\nValidating law vetting what I come up to ... what kind of ... um what kind of\nInformation I get [noise] 'cause I have to check out everything at least a from two different sauces and her mother and her friends as well maybe a knowledgeable in this area\nIt's pretty it's a very compelling idea that that uh maybe if we're if we're worried on this planet that artificial intelligence could overrun\nUs and deprive us of our humanity and eventually make us into something other than what we are just to serve it to them to some degree if that if that ... that can happen here that we're worried about why don't we think it could happen\nSomewhere else another and I think it's actually a really great idea for a movie that I think that's really it's really interesting\nYou might want to consider what if it did happen somewhere else and it came here and now it's running it's game on us and we're building the very thing that it is\nI'm game I'm In great ah interesting I don't think it

am on a wildcard line before the bottom of the hour walk\nA little ... and it's nice to talk to you [laughter] I think you know\nWhy I told God wanting to say something about the border but you started talking about the Bible I'm a I was brought up as a Roman Catholic but I shutter looking subsequently become I make his diagnostic than not so I don't know what to say really\nAh [laughter] well I wasn't trying to hijack the show that way but it was just it you know a couple of callers mentioned something and next thing you know I'm I'm John away but it's the space I live in I live in a space during the week so that kinda bleeds through the arrow afraid if\nIn the shadow government when you said that uh\nYou know people come out of church and then they act like an atheist and the reason I'm an atheist is because uh\nI Can't possibly believing in God that show hypocrite\nOr maybe you're talking about the outrage over or all all the other God's up you know in the Bible up you know how can I possibly even yeah wages whoa but when he kills children by the thousands regular hot than about Passover\nThree sons who loved ... first trip change or the great flood\nOr Saddam ain't got more of their own data innocent children killed there so I mean yeah I can I possibly believing that God like that\nSo you know I guess part of that again comes down to how much are we going to invest in a particular narrative as being the defining story so I except what you're saying\nAnd I think don't get my point wrong about atheists I I I I I Know you're gently chiding me on the on the offending part but let me just say when I say atheist I really mean that in the strictest sense I think a lot of people live their lives like there is no God\nAnd then when they go to the to go to church somehow to hedge their bets and they look like they do that and but they never actually it doesn't actually make a change in what they do is I mean\nAnd so you know everybody puts their faith in something let me just put it that way well\nPuts their faith in something [noise] but you pay the money for your season sex you put your faith in cars that everything these things are going to make

I have a property in view for um South Carolina no I Love that area so I don't ... I don't get there very often but one of these days I'll enjoy I\nAm a I'm not help who had only real yeah we're neighbors okay well\nThe caller brought up something about that at our website where you mentioned that they called Jesus like an imaginary figure let that go figure and then they went into my ...\nHe was a Lexus they asked well that's what it was yeah and and that's it\nAnd then they went into Mohamed's\nHe was a Lexus let me ask you know that's what it was yeah and and that's that's I hadn't heard that myself but that's what he reported elects is right after ...\nHeart but yes he did say that it's all immediately triggered him my brains I bought this perfect set up Encyclopedia Britannica from the church mouse [laughter]\nOr and I was so excited than when I got at home I opened it up I might have been the first person to ever open it and I write for a first\nPart the first introductory part and it was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth and Ronald Reagan wow and then you're going to if you haven't seen this you would probably\nBe ... by it so that it explain that this was a new format for Encyclopedia Britannica and they created the alphabetical volumes and they they chose to put it at length in that heart\nAnd then the ... the other selections at their discretion\nAnd so when you look up Jesus in this edition of Encyclopedia Britannica it has just a few little paragraphs and it it cultural a mythical figure someone who might have live\nVery in a certain time period and then it represents there's a way to look in the end that are more information and then if you turn to Islam it is like page after page after page and the regular section and still do you know anything about it\nNo that's very interesting that's very ... those are good looking over your shoulder will you talk to you you're doing the\nSenate box there yeah and I just kind of put them away and that kind of feel\nLike like they're not really\nIn life even though you don't usually draw here's your dues and reduce the idea\nThat I mean like the as you said\nI I Know there are still printing they must be printing a verb means nothing done completely they'd all anything\nThat's the that's all right after the second truck Alaskan slow but I'd have to buy it gave them high low or at home and all that and so I started looking up things and I thought who decided to to make it this way and so yeah you can find out I mean if you could do harm or a\n... a burning treatment that ideas so they'll have to wait maybe tomorrow night if I could figure out something between now tomorrow night or I Will and I appreciate that and I'll get to ... if I Do going to be in the first hour tomorrow night\nAn otherwise I'm not sure it will be back on again Thanksgiving so it may have to wait a while but most people do you do but they use really it's really very interesting let me go to Karen\nWho is in Alaska on coast to coast am Karen\nHi um this link and when she was just saying and it definitely ties in with last night there was some gas and um it the show was short um first of all I wanted to stay you are by far my favorite other than that has to gorge but you seem to be afraid of controversial subject\n[laughter] though because they love it [laughter]\nSo you know politically correct though we can't talk about or they just\nKnow oh yeah you know I I I guess I it's funny 'cause I I should listen more maybe I'm I'm Out of step maybe I should be more like you said you will your nose to say that I don't really know what what\nI wanted to change the subject to in like I said you may go along with what she would say and I'll tell you a few things I don't get off the air and everybody else\nWhat what I wanted to change the subject to like I said it may go along with what she would say and I'll tell you a few things that I'll get off the air and everybody else and put in a sense where\nUm that Mandela Effect first of all\nYou've probably heard about it there's a million dollars memory to yeah we'll ask all they face all memory\nAnd everything in the world were members of one way and then suddenly it's not and and last night the example they gay was um I Believe it was I fail Evan six in the Bible the wolf and the land versus the way we grew up hearing about the lion and the lamb that\nA couple of other examples and and it's in any like when you're confined hey guess what\nI got catalog in the mail today [laughter]\nAnd somebody had a prayer 'cause he was saying last night they had also changed the Lord's Prayer and maybe 'cause the catalog print like by this I don't know for our comfort her sister\nRemember what it was but anyway it was the way we will remember that so Luke I Am your father now if you look at the movie it says no I Am your father um the things that have changed life was like a box of chocolate you watched that movie now Forrest Gump\nLife is like a box of chocolate and Sally Field you remember when she really liked me you like me or anything right now they're saying if you watch it now says she says you really liked me now okay that's\nInteresting when no when he was saying encyclopedia how you have a couple of paragraphs about Jesus and pages and pages them all on it last night and I agree with this it's like a ... I've been doing the research for a couple of year and a half maybe so they've been saying that\nThird baby that they're they said something about their goal was to make a\nI don't know portal into another dimension\nVery faint demon into our yeah well they were doing say panic rituals outside that place I'm and I'm Wondering if maybe that's why they're diminishing Jesus now and and mom it that the 'cause we all know what he does you know the things he believes in the many way\nThe other things and we would do to do be there'll be a victim of the Mandela Effect well even as you're talking about it because it made me on all nightmares more ah\nHere's here's what I Want to Iran I proposed to do the the thing I mentioned to you about Islam and above bendel I'm about to Mohammed is that\nWhat we often do and I think you're you're getting to this ... this is a completely fair point is that we we rely on other people to give us our memory\nAnd so we think we heard something we think we remember it away to hear somebody else and then somehow we insert their memory in two hours and and and whatever we may have hope we might have originally thought of the line the way it was ... you know the more people repeat it\nAnd that's the only way that you you know that that they can hear it so I think the ... the fact is very interesting I think it's compelling um I'm Sorry I missed the show we brought a great examples [noise]\nUm I Will say when it comes to Bible translation just remember this\nIt you can't do a perfect transition into English from Hebrew and Greek ... from that era Hebrew enough that era Greek\nIt's impossible to do a perfect translation there will always be change and some of them are just as simple ones\nSome of them are just you know pronouns and people in ... the name of the person that was talking because it's easier to follow the story but you are changing it you know just by dropping opponent putting a person's name in but others are much trickier\nBecause there are verbs that literally don't exist anymore and so we have to find you quibble informed\nFacing was a verb for a long time I am facing and we just don't use that terminology so you know the fact that that trust\nThe verb for a long time I am facing\nAnd we just don't use that terminology so you know the fact that the translations keep changing that's great that's the way to be ... and I hope not politically correct purposes\nBut because it's just a matter of getting it correct which I think is more interesting All right so let me go to um uh Marty who is in Tulsa and the time we have left on goes to goes day I'm Marty\nAnd a pleasure are monitored a first I've ever tried to call in the coast to coast I've been listening to her like others for\nYears and years I had to hit the readout about fourteen times that I was surprised to be able to get on\nA leading right [noise]\nI had a and it's nice by the way to hear your back on coast once in a while I thought you uh had disappeared forever so\nI [laughter] yeah [laughter] well they needed here [noise]\nHey I'm In a discussing or with a couple a gentleman earlier about the Bible yeah about thirty minutes ago or so you had talked about how genes or um is depicted as being murder and the ... but not in the Bible and I think um give it a seminary student at a\nSedentary five one one six zero jak tire on oil we're going to be the best\n[laughter]\nElse\nIt doesn't really matter [noise] they all count because every time dad like us take a moment like that to spend with our kids\nIs pretty momentous [noise]\nSounds like somebody agrees\nSo let's take a moment to make 'em out today called eight seven seven four dead for one\nOr visit fatherhood dad gummed ... by the U.S department of health and Human Services and the ad council [noise]\nNews then talk on the radio dishes news radio Thirteen say hey I swim fall I owe you a simple\nBlue a bigger rest ...

baby Ruth or whatever it is a good trick or treat [laughter] so I don't know any more [noise] uh\nAll right so in for George Norris tonight who's getting a good weekend off I Hope and doing something fun and ... in in this period just before Halloween that is our focus for both tonight and tomorrow night when I'll be hosting coast to coast again coming up tomorrow night looking forward to a season with the which\nIt's a in our first hour we'll talk about uh about Salem, Massachusetts again because we've had a great show but about witchcraft and Salem a couple of months ago but in this case\nUh we'll be talking about in regard to Halloween and some of the festivities it will be taking place and uh and then also the men\nFrom the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer about the scariest story you could ever imagine to here on a Saturday Night before Halloween because it's all true\nAnd also happens to be a written by a guy named Bill James whom so it'd be better no as a sportswriter he writes ah he follows the Boston Red Sox and he writes about the Bo Sox he was not in not in LA tonight ... originally we had him scheduled\nA Bill James for tomorrow night on with the contingency that if the Boston Red Sox made the world series you may not be able to make it but as it turns out he wasn't traveling to LA so he's going to fit isn't after all which is great because in the tradition of like\nYou know Freddie and Jason and Michael and all of the Halloween stuff uh it's a creepy story and you're going to want to hear it coming up tomorrow night\nOn coast to coast but it won't be any better than tonight will do open lines later on we'll tell you that some of the subjects will get to in the news segment in a minute but but by the way speaking of the world series I think we're competing against it right now we're still in in the late innings still tied up unless something changed\nUh it was a great game and I don't want to accuse Larry King of being a vampire you know I'm not saying Larry King a vampire\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us\nYou know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but but you do you how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to load\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real uh in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... in labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Ilan mosque or being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also got his finger in this whole neural net\nOf business it says the really the new one of the new hot topics out there\nI imagine a ... and ... and ... imagine this because we're already doing it with my ... and in in the very near future um you know it it's pretty certain that we are going to be doing it with humans but imagine this joined jak\nReally what amounts to a very fine fisherman's net think of it I think of it as a fisherman snatch so you injected into the brain cavity of a mouse and when you do that it's almost like tossing out a fishing net it wrapped itself around the brain\nAnd then kind of a integrates itself into the brain tissue and so it becomes one with the brain tissue and this neural net has a lead a electrical lead a coming out of it\nAnd the idea is that now we have a mechanism we have a real honest to goodness mechanism by which I'm we can tap into the human mind and plug it into let's say the Internet so one of the things that have on mosque is thinking about doing and by the way you don't even have to have a lead you could have a wireless connection\nThat's that's even better but one of the one of the things that you know a mosque as foreseen\nIs a day when when you were to use the one of these narrow and that we can actually surf\nThe Internet with our thoughts we don't need a Keeter word or anything like that so I think that is the beginning of the of of the mechanism we can use to upload our thoughts are memories are in code them digitally um it's not at all farfetched anymore\nOnce you had that in our own that you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will\nOf it's not at all farfetched anymore once you have that in our own that you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will our thoughts onto a super computer and you know quantum computers are on the horizon it's so ... you're talking about supercomputers quantum computers are going to be like\nWhoa [laughter] way way out there right and so it could easily easily a whole you know it's not just the ordinary flash drive I mean you can hold out of a person's entire\nA lifetime history of memories and then as I say robots are becoming very realistic way can read about that tonight and we will I I think that's the way to go not cryogenic ... is a kind of an old school I'm not saying that it's not going to be around it it will be\nBut I think the other technologies are much more sexy and much more practical\nYou know ... and so and I'm not going to try and partially what you said to me it's been a a I think it's fair to say this is where I I think I draw maybe a different line than you do in this narrative moving forward is when we use terms like thinking about doing or\nYou know beginning of the mechanism that's what I'm Talking about when I see the future because what we can do now is the frontier but that's not where these are going into you know as we would say cilia logically that's not the end game for where these things are and I think partly that's the scary peace because\nYou know if we if we take our science fiction movies seriously then we're often reminded that what starts off as a really good idea [laughter]\nCan go terribly wrong when it actually becomes applied science right\n... thank you thank you absolutely oh no absolutely\nAnd and your writing this book deals with we're right at the cost in and I I think that's what makes it exciting but it also makes it in for some degree unsettling and and even downright dangerous that we we are really at the threshold of these technologies ...\nAre are kind of one foot in the present and one foot in the immediate future and so you're right it is you know it it enabled us\nIf you will to make very accurate forecast in other words we're not talking about pie in the sky want you know the sweet bind by one day now these are things that are now becoming realized and so we can have this kind of discussion about hey what kind\nOf world are we creating what what is ... is a mortality\nIn any sense of the word now possible [noise]\nAnd the short answer is yes it is very much so now that we have\nA ... they we are creating these are incredible robots artificial intelligence so we have the ability to manipulate DNA now at well so so yes you're absolutely right that what we're discussing is the near future but it is it's ... right now it's it's crazy\nWhat is uh I'm reminded of the ... the ... song\nUm which I I inevitably come back to an subjects like this is a history shows again and again how nature points up the folly of men Godzilla\nAnd and the the the I think this is where and I'm sort of curious about your approaching this because this book is published by a a publishing company which is known for being faith based\nAnd and I think this is in in in the in the certainly in the publicity for the book but even as you get into there's a larger discussion of not just doing things because we can but because we should do and the arts are really important in there too so\nYou know just because we're on the Suresh\nBut because we should do and the arts are really important in there too so you know just because we're on the threshold doing some things aren't we do that and ... how are we going to make a decision on the implications of when we decide this is where we're going with this\nYeah you're you're right about regular you know when they approached me to write this book and I have to give them credit it was their idea um and you know they said basically hey you know you you really love writing about science history and I do I love science history\nBecause of the lessons it teaches us about what we can do and what we can't do what we should do and what will we shouldn't do [noise]\nUm they said why don't why don't you write about you know what's going on right now you're you're uniquely qualified you can uh reporting science all your life and\nI've thought about it and it was a kind of a no brainer I said yeah I'll do it and then they gave me the the freedom to kind of\nYou know opine about this that I Am because I'm a theoretical physicist and you know I I I'm very strict about things so I decided I was going to write a book and the four sections that that I described\nAll fact based in their ... it's just like you know the old dragnet series you know the facts ma'am right Andrew ... that's what I did with those four sections there more than a thousand foot notes if you can imagine\nOh no ... I read through to you you're very very thorough\nVery thorough but then I allowed myself that last final chapter and I thought you know I Can't just serve this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it and so here here my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise]\nUm I see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence they really spectacular many of them are really on a lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this but then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous [noise]\nWhat I think we need now because we are at this threshold of creating for ourselves a world that can either be grim\nFor great and so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other is to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I grew\nUp in east LA with the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really and that dream took me to UCLA than on the Cornell where I got my PHD in physics math and astronomy and then as I said on the\nHarvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started asking myself how does this universe that I've been studying come to the end\nI explored into wisdom and Buddhism and ... a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and [laughter]\nAnd finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I wasn't interested I was like five or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I became a man of faith a face I'm a Christian\nAnd I take my my faith very very seriously and so when I say we\nNeed to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality\nMichael Guillen former science reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book is ah is is is great it's a the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in\nDiscussions of what we should and ought to do which might be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\n[noise] about the idea of preserving a physical life uh on this planet\nLike whether that was through uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nQuestion whether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for that what is the ultimate was the end used for that um other than our own human vanity that we've become immortal\n[noise] yeah I agree with you in and I think that in another concern or in addition to that is that a lot of this technology that we're we're kind of ... we're talking about right now it's no longer speculative it's actually happening\nIs very expensive um you know ... and never\nKind of ... we're talking about right now it's no longer speculative it's actually happening\nIs very expensive um you know ... and never mind ... I Try to achieve immortality through some of this technology let's let's talk about some of the technology that is being used to let's say\nA I'm a help treat macular degeneration I'm going to just pick that as an example there is such a good way in California right there's a company in California that is a marketing a retinal implants for people who are have macular degeneration and their eyesight a going away\nAll that stuff costs you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most insurance policy so\nA lot of the technology that that are aimed at improving our health Hansing our health enhancing our life achieving immortality is going to be available to the super rich\nAnd so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to do to the dynamics of a society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people at least if you will I'm\nAble to to benefit from the ... and the others are you know like being put out of business by robots and so I talk seriously about a ... in my book I talk seriously about the possibility of there being a human revolution you know we often talk about in science fiction often to pick\nYou know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the earth well you know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the way this technology is shaping up right now is for people who have been kind of disenfranchised\nUm or marginalized by this technology will just be get fed up at some point and say you know this is enough is enough I mean we're we're taking in the we're taking it as a\nBehind and and and and and we're not going to we're not going to take it anymore and so and and I it's interesting and I talk about in the book\nDoes ... do you talk like that to the people Salem no use that kind of I mean really [laughter] I gotta I gotta you're really on a limb there you know and [laughter]\nYeah well I figured it's a late night show so\nI Try and she's going to you're done and now I Know it's\nLate but you know never mind regularly I got to worry about my wife you know ... what you said was a bus or [laughter] but um but I talk about how a lot of these\nGuys from Silicon Valley are actually a buying these what they're calling bug out houses rent they're buying houses in these remote places in the country and in the world\nOn the chance that you know when the stuff hits the fan there I go again or one of the stuff hits the fan they they want to be able to escape and this is a serious thing I caught some I quote former Google engineers and a Google executives are and and others\nWho say yeah you know a human revolution is a real possibility many of them are trying to avoid that possibility now by talking about the universal basic income\nOkay been hanging on the ... lives in ... ... ... because he has the idea of having a bug out house right\nYeah that's like I mean every every you know church of latter day saints person I Know has has that philosophies right is it ... yeah I Know lots of other people who practice that believes that doesn't that's not the same to me although I understand your point\nI I'm thinking about I I'm more reminded of of ah you know what Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park when he said you know the dinosaurs had their chance right they're done they they ... they ... that was there a moment and the fact that bringing them back is is\nDinosaurs just because we can is and the and the notion to that for example when you talk about the the the wealthy elites as opposed to the intellectual elite sort of the physical elites or any other types of ways in which we the moral or leads any we could you know a ... quantify society\nHits the wealthy elites aren't necessarily the best in anything except inheriting stuff you know some of them might have gotten it on their own but not all of them and then if that becomes the ... the class that's perpetuated I Would say again they had their chance to ... ... it has to there has\nTo be a Darwinian element to that where somebody else who's going to have to come along behind them or we turn into Illinois and more locks from H. G. wells time machine right\nMhm yeah yeah yeah yeah no ... it's interesting ah by the way I interviewed Jeff Goldblum one this is just a funny aside when in fact when Jurassic Park came out I was at ABC News and\nI had been in touch with the producers and they invited me to come to the big Hollywood premiere in the at the after party and Jeff bloom was there and\nA bunch of other guys and I went up to ... I said Jeff you know you're always like playing a scientist\nOr not just in Jurassic Park but elsewhere and I said sure I I'm just curious I said you know I did you have an interest in science growing up or what he says not just a job and you know he has the housing is appointed in his answer I thought he was going to say oh yeah you know I majored in physics at\nCollege right now you know [laughter] but now you got\nFor him but yeah it ... I I I Love you bringing that up in the dinosaurs had their chance [noise] it's really an indication of how the earth how the world works how the universe works\nFor design work is designed to work exactly yeah and\nYou know you know your ... somebody's\nReligious beliefs aside for a moment let's just talk like strictly science sure um ... what what what you learn is that uh the species have a window of time in which they rise up and they flourish then they die out for whatever reason whether it's a meteor or whether it's a\nA temperature change or or it it said a rampant disease that ... that I'm In you know like the woolly mammoth saber tooth cats and so forth and so on [noise]\nUh and the dinosaurs are and and one wonders as as as you contemplate these innovations that we're creating the ones that I describe in this book you can't help but wonder why we doing here and then I think of what Arthur C Clark one set and its back with me\nHe said it remains to be proven that intelligence has any survival value\n[laughter] I got a minute oh\nYou know and you wonder are we like outsmarting ourselves you know are we are we just being too clever by a half with a staff thinking that you know we're going to improve life the are going to improve the human condition and in fact just the opposite happens we do ourselves in\nI mean that's a real possibility and and and you think of Jeff Goldblum said they had their chance maybe some some creature in the future we'll look back at us and say yeah oh yeah human beings they had their their chance now he blew it\nUp and now here's an age now let me ... is a little differently\nIf there was a ... humans killed off species they didn't die out no actually they were killed off as opposed to say evolution they weren't they they weren't allowed to follow\nKilled off as opposed to say\nEvolution they weren't they they weren't allowed to follow their evolutionary cycle that was truncated right by you know the fact that they you know some giant bird in New Zealand laid these really big exit you know human could eat off for three days and so\nUm you know there's going to so I mean I I realize you can make a Darwinian argument for that but I think there are some species like some\nLike some there are some tiger or whatever that if we cloned that there and brought it back in ... introduced it to the wild not enough time has passed\nThat he couldn't read absorbed that back in to the the natural flow of our evolutionary cycles um but I Do think when we start looking into the future and then we start making all these plans of who's going to beat and who's going to not be that's\nName is Sarah I'm\nCat named sentimental ... my ...\nMy main\nYou can respond to the opposite from the shelter and young Eighteen months\nEarly intervention make a lifetime of\nTo find an obvious ones being done on last night Romney lie on who's being on the\n[noise] news then talk on the radio dishes use radio Thirteen windfall oil pipe\nBombs just back spends the night behind bars ...

law uh but still a great dog after all these years Michael Gilliland is the author of this book the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science we'll\nWe'll get back to\nSome

things you want to keep\nAn eye on I'm saying about you [noise]\nUh and uh and it will be the end of life as we know that life will carry on but what will it be like we'll talk more about that just admitted also will bring you in on the conversation at the bottom of the hour we'll get the numbers at the bottom of the hour\nThe next hour we go to open lines cause it's friday Georgia's got the night off I'm sitting in and uh and I want to get back to some of those go stories that are up the coast to coast am dot coms I'm giving you the heads up\nTo look for that story about the ghost that moves the jar you can see the video\nIt's it's in the carousel as we call it the you know the rotating stories of the top of the fold the website it goes to goes to um to come watch that before we get to open lines next door I'd love to hear your explanation for it if you think there's kind of a science the one\nYou get to the next hour in the meantime let's pick up this conversation about a about ... to about the idea of blending human physical animal life together\nUm it's not just about splicing it's more than that we'll get your next on coast to coast am this is Ian but it [noise]\n[noise] we've got a great feeling story part of\nOur one of those botanical that is so absolutely so amazing David if you're a guy that has overcome severe issue\n[noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay\nAh where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it or just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up they the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to\nA level of success with monkeys and so now embolden or by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who has been quoted a frequently\nOr who is a quadriplegic a you know otherwise\nMentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig and there are scientists who are over her quoted as saying yeah they're going to do it so we're at once again you know remember\nI'm I'm old enough to remember the first artificial heart\nTransplant sure you remember that a ... a share of the um the what was his name Jobbik writer yeah something like that and um\nEverybody cringed at oh my God way way putting that much mechanical heart in a human being and you know within South Africa right and you are ... and ... and ... and\nAnd you know now artificial hearts are pretty routine thing although now you know with stem cell research and other things going on a ... were even getting past mechanical hearts hey by the way in a you talk about things that give me some pause here's one\nThere are three groups of scientists in California and Minnesota and I read that it's like Minnesota that's like so random but okay there you are\nNo you're right that the minute University of Minnesota's a monster ... do you have a huge research you it's a it's an hour one it's a big school\nNo you're right you're right I just I just I don't know why this gives me an article but anyway you have three groups of scientists who are creating a creatures that have never walked the face of the earth before they're called come era's shape human and pick him income areas so these are\nCreatures whose DNA has been together using human DNA and ship the an a or human DNA picking a and they're creating these creatures because they will have human Oregon they will\nIn a or human DNA picking a and they're creating these creatures because they will have human Oregon they will have human kidneys\nHuman livers human hearts for the purpose of you know transplanting them to patients and neat and you know I get that I had a friend who who died recently because his kidneys just went south and he couldn't get a transplant and boom\nA but now what that's done is to raise the very real possibility and I discuss the book that\nIf you put too much human DNA into the recipe you know so it's always a question too much human DNA too little human DNA then you don't get the human Oregon's right if you put in too much DNA then you can have an animal a creature\nThat thinks like him and that has basically human brain trapped inside of a body of a sheep or a pig I mean they these are the things that are very real now because of our ability to tamper with DNA um so that's one of the things that give me give me a little bit later that we really wanted to and what's interesting is that\nThese guys are doing it and by the way I quote one of the researchers that says yeah that's that's a real possibility so this is not like you know made up of pie in the sky I mean they even the researchers admits yeah we got to be careful this possibility\nBut they're doing this research against the wishes of the anti age the national institutes of health which is the government's never one funny body for biological genetic engineering so even the anti age it's kind of very um [noise] yeah you know forward thinking of funding organization is saying you know maybe we should just push the pause button and\nDecide do we want to do this and if so what are the guidelines for the guard rails are on sure\nI'm sure these guys are no just doing it a violation of the age of probably doing it against the advice of\nTheir moms and what do you do yeah yeah they don't mind\nThe oh my God they were either when I was growing up in east LA and then ... says the town over and I was a real geek I mean I was speaking out when I was a kid and I found a way to make hydrogen gas using stuff that I found in my mom's kitchen and I look back at I'm Out there in the garage at the ... of our how\n[laughter] making hydrogen gas and you know that stuff is explosive\nYou know below I Would filled balloons up with it and then send little insects are locked just to see what happens that took a while I was a little mad scientists and area\nCreate your own space program against their will right by the by the way these\nGuys are that come area you're right the mothers I say why don't you know I get I write suing that already go this is all played tiddlywinks or something safer\n... LA ... as you mentioned earlier when you mentioned that the the game is still tied in the fifteenth between Boston\nAnd LA you kidding me know so I just wanted him to any\nAny game three of the world series Richard tweeted out on Twitter he said he's listening to this show and watching\nThe uh the world series game he said it's like sinking a pink Floyd in the wizard of Oz you said the kind of works and so I don't know I I guess\nI guess that means I'm committed a lot of errors ... when it snows happened to go right now still there's two men on top of the fifteenth and we'll keep an eye on it so sorry Joe ... the the island of Dr ... pretty scary it really is\nBut I I I still you know now do you think of what the technology that people you see all the commercials for\nWhich I'm you know we're Siri you know what how cold is it outside I don't want to look on a window series is it snowing you know or you know Google ... ... ... you know\nI don't want to look out a window series is it snowing\nYou know or you know Google ... ... ... ... you know by me some more uh ten meet whatever in these commercials or the N everybody's focused on that type of this is and I kinda get\nIt but they were just beginning to learn the downside of having a a microphone connected\nUm and on monitored inside of one's house aren't we\nYeah and that's another it's interesting you bring that up because that was on my short list of things to worry about and that's the other thing we're bringing about our cell okay you're a\n... if you're absolutely right I tell the story of a little girl in Dallas texas who use the Amazon Echo or you know and said hey Alexa buy me a bunch of cookies hey Alexa by the way you know this a\nDollhouse fancy fancy dollhouse and\nParents are totally clueless stuff starts arriving at the house the parents\nFreak out but here's the punch line and you would think that the parents will have learned a lesson in like ditch the echo you know get rid of it uh but instead I have the mother quoted as saying you know we need to whisper around ... election now are you\nKidding me alive I mean that that take away having leaders are oh yeah I Know right it's\nSo good you'd rather in a way to because it's not just I mean that story\nAnd ... and again I remind people will get to the phones you're coming up they're already ringing and will line of people to to talk with Michael deal in the end of life as we know it in a few but\nBut that story out of turkey about the supposedly the audio recording that was made by this guy ... um you know apple watch\nThat they were able to monitor his apple watch and record his torture and just now I I don't know that I Believe that I don't know that it really really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter\nMay be in there in the ... they have a they have Google and they had the Little Syria or whatever and they monitor that way but however\nIt happened that kind of the debt that passive\nListening that is going on that we had not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships a park communities\nAnd for the security of our ... a country I've just had an op ed that is going to be published very shortly I'm a U.S a Congress issued a report on Thursday so\nA saying that um the Chinese are hell bent on a a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nThere was a kind of a that your ... your dishwasher everything that's going to have\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's or the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on\n... there are now a more than a billion Internet uh of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book\nAnd the Chinese are ... see this as an opportunity to bug us to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you talk about the ... thing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI don't want to give away the story but she was murdered in the police started looking into the the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder\n[noise]\nAh Michael before we started getting all these calls waiting for you let's ruled that story back about twenty seconds before we 'cause I was ... I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [laughter]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed a one story and the police looked into it or his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a face woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so\nThey downloaded the data from the fit fit and they found out that the they could actually get this\nCalculate how many feet chi walk\nAnd it didn't square with the story from the husband and then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology out at this husband he ended up being charged with murder because of this this kind of a Internet of things\nThat are fine on every aspects of our life they can tell you when you're at sleep when you're awake how many feet you are\nWhat your heart rate uh you know it if you watch Netflix the the the they they download what you're watching when how for how long I mean there ... this is a ...\nDo you watch Netflix the the the they they download what you're watching when how for how long I mean there ... this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but we've invited on ourselves than we are well these gadgets\nYeah and I liked a lot of them I mean I I were an apple watched by the way they used that as a plot device that thing about the fitbit in a ... a law and order episode last week [laughter] exact same thing they\nTook it from the real life oh they do maybe they always do not know ripped from today's headlines so he uh but that's where I mean I I think that they like\nTo catch a killer is one thing many people is really good they kind of killer because of the fitness the hard part will be is when evidence is presented in court\nThat's collected from some of these ancillary passive data collection systems which accidentally convict somebody who didn't commit the crime I mean that that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test of this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI now having the humongous database of face prince\nRight or that they don't you cover in\nThe ... yeah and and and and they have like an eighty they they allow themselves in eighty percent accuracy rate so the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent inaccuracy room with which raises the possibility that you and I\nGot to have the FBI knocking on our doors because they think we committed a crime based on their data base but the facial recognition technology that they're using to id and could finger culprits is wrong twenty percent of the time and and by the way\nResearchers who are looking into it from Australia and elsewhere are saying it's it's more than twenty percent and so this this is what you just described is a very real possibility now where innocent people\nAre going to be fingered by a by a screen up\nA Michael deal in the end of life as we knew it let's get you Keith who's in Virginia on coast to coast am key\nHello can you hear me in a perfectly good ah how are you tonight on my phone turned back up there you go and get a question from Michael yes Michael and I heard you were speaking about the ah Jarvis cart happened\nCouple of friends one of which I Would be a great guess because of his very experience\nAnd service even as a whistle blower this call them coast to coast and before but uh but it'd be great to have him on\nTo tell a story about a lot of things I'm One of the um the predecessors of that artificial heart was a a a heart open heart to see that was a heart lung machine\nAnd Dr wrestling Nelson or worked on that at the University of Minnesota understand that the sharper cart was at the University of Utah\nAnd some Thirty years earlier and he and his career as a heart surgery\nAt some paranormal experience is one of which was a where he did a surgery that a technique that they never been done before\nAnd he describes it as after praying to know what to do that basically it's ... or whatever it was clear right in his mind any that the surgery a from\nMost instructions said he was able to see him his mind and later\nI mean that the surgery a from most instructions said he was able to see in his mind and later a kind of\nGet you a question because there's so many people who have questions for Michael so if you want to hang on for an open line called the sounds more like that but did you have a question from Michael\nThat could be yeah I'm a lot of her fellow Nelson by the way is\nI'm going to put you on hold I'm going to put you on hold right now and it would just let me get back to the cause I Know there's ... we had our time is pressures in an open lines is where that kind of belong\nSo let me go to a Tracy who is trucking in Alabama with a question for Michael Guillen Tracy\nYeah Michael I got one question for you here where does it end whereas a wind away stop playing God\nOr are we ... we those are a good question but are we playing God yet and when do we play God is maybe another question but Michael [noise]\nWell I think that is the ultimate question the traits he's asking and uh you know I I quote a very well known biologist in the book\nUm who was actually a a major participant in in mapping the human genome remembered the human genome project sure it wrapped up in two thousand and three and there was a big ceremony\nAnd the White House Bill Clinton was president and he said now we have discovered the language of God now that we've mapped the human genome well this biologist Craig Venter I hold him in the book\nAnd ... and it's a very telling quote and I have\nTo be careful but he says you know when it comes to biology we don't know blank I'm not going to use the word he uses but he was when it comes to biology we don't know blank now this is a guy who's in the thick of it\nAnd this this is directly an answer to Tracy is excellent question that in effect what Craig Venter is in South is saying is look we're we're toying with something we don't know squat about and and and that is a recipe for dangerous picture\nA child playing with matches or worse than that plane with a nuclear bomb or playing with a dynamite you know you pick your you you pick your image imagery and that is really the picture that emerges when you read my book\nWhatever you think about the technology and there's a lot of positive but let's keep in mind that you're going to have Ninety nine positive consequences wonderful sunshine positive consequences like the neural prosthetics but all it takes is one stink or that can really within\nRice that but it was everything else\nBut I think that's the crux two of the playing God premise\nAre we playing God or aren't we when we cure a disease if the diseases natural it was as God made it natural in Europe is hurricanes are we not playing God when we cure a disease\nI I I I get what you're saying and that's why I tend to avoid this phrase although I Know it's a popular phrase phrase right and\nThat's what I'm saying I just it's too weak to use for the context as it doesn't really encompass all the ways in which you know when we make a better break pad\nOr do I mean there were always attempting to try to save lives and sometimes those will come with unintended consequences but who is that really a matter of playing God I I think it's true with the kind of mirror thing I think that gets into a very weird area though [laughter]\nYeah no no I agree and and I I think you know what it's like when we restore sight the blind with these retinal transplant I I mean that can be said we're playing ... so what I like to do is look I when I was at ABC News I covered the Persian Gulf War story [noise]\nI I mean that can be said we're playing ... so I what I like to do is look I when I was at ABC News I covered the Persian Gulf War story you remember when they lift the oil fields on fire oh totally\nI what I was vie for television correspond to actually find my way to those oil fill a oh a oil fields that were on fire and the way I had to get their way through a minefield regatta guy from aramco the Saudi Arabian oil company he knew way through the mind feels\nAnd so that's how I I think a trace this question is I see it there I see as navigating a mine field\nAnd you know so far we've been able to avoid a stepping on that one line that's going to do it in but as we progress with some of the stuff that is unsettling and outright dangerous nevermind a great stuff okay that's gonna sunshine but I as I say all it takes\nFor us to do is to step on that one mind that one hit and mine\nAnd it's just going to blow us up okay remains to be thing I think that will be the end if it comes that way but no I Am committed\nOkay so you're the scientist you're the you're the you got to a PHD in physics\nThursday nights and you're grabbing drinks with some friends started off

I mean on Saturday when I get here our video\nYeah some day in time can you keep ...\nPeople that there is certain people that are so beautiful and so wonderful and ensure old literature and it just kills her or what am I think you're one of them\nWell you're very sweet but I agree with you and I think that morning period after art I think it was just the ... it just even though many people were anticipating that this complication was going to get worse I\nI think it you know if you'll pardon the expression I think we all you know lost her breath over that were just it was just cut us off guard [laughter] so yeah and I'm Sorry and I I Know that I think I think you have you with us\nHighways that and that this er say real quick my father is a price tag okay here oh cool apps toy and I grew up and I\nYou know\nYou grow up around radio stations trends that yeah [laughter] that would never did that Star Trek though a nap\nAnd get their do but I guess this is the kid there was a ... oh my God it's not\nThat well is he needs to chat with you I tell me real quickly um so what kind of see what station did your father worked for a week\n... they'll Cape deal Iran and cat eight eight\nThan they were aware of how\nKnow I think you so much that they should I Would like to I was like to hear that you God Bless you have a great night I I've always worked cannot ... advance I mean I can handle the little one and probably two oh one of any class about engineering and something like that but I Love you\nIt's I mean I can handle the little one and probably two oh one of any class about engineering and something like that but I Love engineers they really know the stuff\nThat's really cool they can just build something out of nothing\nI'm All right so that brings me to oh T's from Virginia is back so he had called the ... when we were talking with our guest last hour and it seemed much more appropriate to have money or for open lines so\nI'm Glad you called back heat so you you had a friend who is you you were telling your story about how the surgeon had essentially experience to kind is\nAlmost like a scientific revolution but it came into almost sort of divinely\nDeliberate where he suddenly knew exactly what you do in this complicated surgery do I get that right\nOh that's correct because I understand it and uh\nThat individual by the way and and\nAh thanks for having to get back on and sorry for not being a little bit quicker smoother with everything but um somebody very topics he discussed and and they related this time of the things I wanted to say too but\nSure this gentleman Dr wrestling now and uh also had a a he relates to experience that of a failure or twice in surgery which his patients died\nAnd they were children and they later many years later a\nVisited him from the spirit world and delivered a message for him to give to their parents and so anyway this individual by the way is the same time I'm now from that in a at the age of Ninety three\nAfter having been a possible for the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints having left 'cause world renowned medical career a\nBecame president of the church in January of this year at the age of Ninety three and a an amazing man even a damn downhill skier at that age\nAnd um [noise] anyhow um what I wanted to get to was a I mentioned before a couple of things regarding astronomy\nAnd some other things in which things revealed by the prophet Joseph Smith gave a little bit more and hiding from time to time I hear things on the coast to coast am that there can be perhaps a connecting and for ... informed at length\nAbout paranormal and things from traditional Judeo Christian teaching a that we find in and also in the Bible\nAnd and and that is a lot of the things that Joseph ... revealed or had to reveal to him I should say by a Jesus Christ and many other officers that he had profits and he brought about a lot of\nNew scripture hatred scripture as well as new scripture [noise] you know and and they're going to get about thirty more seconds used to go ahead I said\nBasically to wrap it up the turtle man is one concept that he spoke about and he taught about and I wondered if you've ever heard of that book I just learned that recently by trim and maps and there's a very good Youtube video Jennifer Smith and the recovery of eternal man\nBecause a lot of those principles seem to have been lost by you know\nThe the church from the council on some of the scriptures and the boss said that were the basis of the creek\nThey measure pharmacist or want it all the pairs correctly and ended up in a jar container so they're all fishing out towards out or whether they can get to order it would it have their own fan right there\nYet but the thing of the the moving of the I mean it really is it's an amazing video in for people that don't believe in in goes I think you'll enjoy it um but the scissors in the ... the ... in this little cup holder only district moving around\nAnd it's just it's not I mean you could almost making arguments like maybe the jar\nWas on its slanted surface or something and we couldn't see it from the camera angle and they're just having a good laugh but I don't get the thing with the the pencils and the than the scissors so yeah benevolent pulled their guys I'll go with that until it got any other theory to a a back in a ... show\nIs in Wyoming on coast to coast Michele\nHow high the and I'm Sorry I'm jak that round I like all\nThe first things first the first things first if I can put you on hold and come back in a minute but that'd be easier\nI Know I can count right now for a second can take on I'm I'm ... and call her longtime listener and nice to have you when I was wondering why it's like I was raised Catholic and then like I chose\nOther options and other things out there because you know I just I don't know that that's the way I'd help inside an when let them higher gas Michael I'm Carson when he first got on he was talking about that you know that scientific side of him and and\nThe thing that I mean but that lady\nTell them to read the Bible and now he's changed his mind on it and it's a Christian so what I was wondering and I don't know how well very strong religious stuff exactly but I'm a little bit\nLike I I Wonder how often when I'm driving down the road how we can trust\nThe authenticity of the Bible because you know I've often heard that a lot of the major story from it like the story of the fried and the story of um you know like a [noise]\nI said you're our hero type figure if they run a virgin and stuff those there can be found in like ... that the call tax you know like ancient shoreline ten packs for like some area in the ... own and you know whatever creates the Bible so you're\nTalking about the ...\nYou're talking about ... if you're talking about the story of NOAA for example um and there are some very interesting parallels in the in the guilt diminish narratives should the news story [noise] um and you are correct in saying that there had been other traditions that had a sort of man God\nA ... that was birthed by a human mother but from a a divine father and that that is it was just another version of that\nSo the question to me always is not this to me\nAnd this is where I think a lot of it in my personal opinion I Believe this is where some people get really hung up because I'm not going I'm not trusting the Bible because it has so many facts in it I trust the Bible because of how many true ... it has in it\n[noise] okay there's a\nThere's a difference to me and there are true is that we know to be a worse steering by right there there you you can count you can count on these troops that for example when you're good to others they will be good to you or even if they are good you you\nYou still have to be good to them because it only makes us is Jewish first you know a ... so there are ... and and a lot of these stories tell these troops the actual facts\nOf these stories it's always been less interesting to me too so I'll be honest we\nBuy or sell but you know story that can be found in other places we can still tried as saying like the other information on the bottom\nWell here I Would say though is that even some of those other stories\nThere are some of those things which you have heard that probably aren't true so there are some people who win Christianity was catching on over two thousand years ago um other people started in ... like I'm emphasizing\nSomething from their tradition saying see were just like Christianity and so it was because of the rise of Christianity that they started to really promote the things that they said had pre existed that story whether they did or not there's really there really isn't always a lot of proof about that there is in the in the Egyptians\nThere's there's a little bit of a tradition of that but but it in the end does it matter\nI mean it it it's do you can you do live your life better does it improve your life that's the question and I think getting hung up on ... worrying about whether or not the Bible is a book of science\nThere's a lot of people treat it like it's supposed to be a science book and it's not I don't think [noise] um and I think the stories are very instructive and we need to you know re learn from them every day\nThat's my best answer for you I don't think it gives you something to chew over while you're while you're on the open road with a full tank of gas and\nIn a long time out here to thing sounds good [laughter] good\nWill be ... be a help you're a bad man the gym and you get where you're going well and thank you so much for joining in and I'm Glad you're was the first time I got to be there with ya\nUm I go to a adjust and who's in Texas on coast to coast Justin\nHey buddy hey hey yeah and it's nice to be on my list them wherever they were actually called in or have you\nEver wanted to take it to the left everybody's on the the religious aspect\nBut uh do whatever you wanna get some more scientific stuff yeah sure I'm not sure if a lot of people caught you on a mosque interview or he had with Joe Rogan\nAnd I only smoked ...\nYeah they they I think there are a little out there but uh I think somebody is uh that logically advanced in the mind and has the means to do a lot pretty impactful when he said things about like a a guy in a cyber ... augmentation and stuff and uh I really thought it was a neat\nMetaphor that he used saying how human beings are pretty much augmented already carrying their cell phones around you know we have the ability to do the massive computations and access to any kind of data that we had that we want\nAnd all that and he said that you know in the very near future that could possibly be a thing that we could do hands free you know and uh\nYou know what would that do maybe to the educational system where we go to school will be just philosophy classes to learn how to think properly you know\nYeah well we need more of those I think we need more of those no I think I think I think I think philosophy would be ... or ... yeah I think we treat philosophy of some sort of exotic thing and it was really the first thing around which all education was built and\nI mean it's just a fine arts credit that people just take\nIt right because it 'cause it's not that it's dance you know or something so excited and dance at least the proper you don't have to go [laughter]\nBut you know to your point on on ... I'm a big believer in I'm In his technological ... solutions on big big in sustainability um\nUh the Joe Rogan interview is troublesome because I think actually if you want to look at it in a different way all the time he spent talking about being depressed\nOr you know his mental state from over working and not sleeping enough and et cetera\nI I think that review much more of these humanness which we don't and we tend to think almost of Ilan must cause some big giant plot machine says\nYeah someday against the whenever he's just he's a human being\nRight and he may be a slightly unstable human being these days I I only\nVenus is are you know I I don't recall you that that's a very intellectual always have some kind of inner struggle\nRight and so I'm a I I'm an investor actually in a very small way I'm In a couple of thousand dollars for the stock which took a hit after that Joe Rogan interview and ah and has recovered mostly when\nIt or something like that one of the fact stocks\nWell I don't know that though because I see my argument would be that ... we I invested in ... mosque mhm right I didn't I invested in him I decided at some point probably after the sixty minutes interview\nIn his dentures but as a person\nI thought that guy smart he gets it um and I think he's going to come up with cool stuff and it's going to make life better and make a lot of money and so I bought on that basis so when I'm watching him in the interview I'm watching the wheels come off right I'm watching like it was a wheel circle\nAnd so I bought on that basis so when I'm watching him in an interview I'm watching the wheels come off\nRight I'm watching the wheels are going to eat and just like watching a tense lower the wheels are coming up it would be very worrisome so I'm I I think anytime\nThe head of the company like that become so synonymous with the product I think they have to be much more careful about how they lived their lives in public that's my feeling on that but but I don't want to take away from him 'cause I Know I agree do you use it to ingenious\nI think these shows and stuff a little more on it in ... on public but I think the thought process that everything is pretty consistent whether he was an even read it or not he claims that that's a that's a very soon future you know blame it on the Web", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "27"}
