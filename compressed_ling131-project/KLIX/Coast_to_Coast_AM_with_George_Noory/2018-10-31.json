hearing from further junk writer in the in the last\nHour or give me the information to basically taking back his silence after sixty years Steven giving his feet the uh uh I guess you could call describes account which is amazing some of the stuff that you've sent into all the things I read or\nJust ... you know here's a question that ah I I mean just sent me away you clarify for me and a lot of people don't notice so\nWhen these things started happening Roland or are um a number of his aunts and uncles in some priests were aware of this they were before the as you said that might be to a Lutheran ministers slept\nWith the boy they slept in his bedroom to try and figure out what was going on\nAnd then uh there were a Catholic ... a non Catholic and an uncle much relatives were present and\nThey made a makeshift refugee board\nI've heard different accounts that yes there there was that you know that the ants ... enjoy using the ... um you know it was an article and um but in the document and the PDF the reference to um I'm not aware and there wasn't any reference from what I've seen to the actual use of the ...\nWell I was it a week or per se they were actually this is what I read from the the documents that they actually use quote un alphabetical medium on porcelain kitchen table\nLitters of the alphabet were written on paper were underlined whenever the table moved or wherever the plate moved on the table\nAnd a coded messages became evidence is similar to what was done except without the Christmas lights on stranger things actually uh and the phenomena indicated that it wasn't the devil now this said that it was the soul of the disease and then there's it's it's redacted\nWho do they figure out what was the spirit was possessing the boy\nYes and and\nYou do mention that there was some documentation and they did write those letters down as well when I misunderstood you know about the ... the wage\nOn at the hobby it's kind of a makeshift we did it or that's what I said makeshift we ...\nYeah yeah and um so I think they suspected because they were trying to I I think they were really hoping that it would be the ant and then you know essentially from you know conduct in you know asking questions um the day we did receive confirmation that E S ... it was the ant\nBut they were being deceived um\n[noise] and um you know ultimately it was the game and then and there are references to the the devil um itself as well you know as you get further into the document\nSo again this is like in the movie The Exorcist ... were first a father terrorists or his mother was a in the body of Reagan and and remember de me don't do this to be the main uh the other spirits were speaking him he says you're not my mother you're not in there with my mother this is all a deception\nSo probably that's where they got the idea of what was going on is that they probably thought the aunt was in ... with possessing the child and then eventually they were deceived and found that it truly was a demon that was was asking the child\nHe yes and um and then they were um and the ... the father does a really great job or a a document and um\nThen the messages on that were initially you know some recording you know given the background with respect to what the family recorded but then a demographic that's got to start\nArming the exercise um and and even actually um preceding their their travels to St Louis um\nThey felt they were noticing that there were you know red marks and and riding appearing on his skin on and um one one of the the word was Louis so they felt that that you know that they would eventually we're supposed to go they saw it as a sign\nInitially that's what they should go to St Louis and um and then contact the Jesuit\nOrder and and the priest stare for help so um so it it's you know very deceptive and um you know and then as as it progressed says I you know the\nThe word gets sinister and and I'm more and more evil and and even those a lot of as he sat rejected right messages has while they were just two styles lower\nThan that yeah they couldn't share them because apparently from what I was reading and like your your excellently pointing out a and sort of a brother Grider he said the words were spoken by this young boy were so foul I Will not repeat\nAnd and and put it a somewhere where people\nCan do the research if that's okay with you because it's so well done\nA lot of research you provided for us is so well done about what happened in that uh you know going from the permission to was given by archbishop just if you are Ritter a father that father about or an end or others would were able to power Halloran and others\nWere able to do this exercise them and how it took a long time uh and and you were talking about um what they call it the ... I Can't even say demography is that when they call it\n... graft we aren't Germany dirty laundry we yeah go ahead you're demographically I just you know just the the writing on\nThe skin and again and one important point is you know some may suspect a while the um you know that it may be a child had had written and you know as as a Ruth I'm by the witnesses again the family where there there were ... priests there and they would appear without and being anywhere near\nA touching the part of his body and also um there were they were on the parts of his body they couldn't even possibly taught\nYou know this guy in Prince from what I understand it is and and I don't want to get to grab it but I guess you know we're on late night radio and if you're listening to the program so far you know we're dealing with\nWe're dealing with demons we're dealing with how they were they rack and tear up the human body and how most of the priests were involved here aged quite a bit when they were working on this and trying to get this boy back to normal one of the things I've heard as it was so bad they had to basically hog tied him to the bad\nAnd and they had to keep them from ... and the problem was\nThat the the demon whatever it was would spell on his body things like a devil and hell and a lot of as sacrilegious references to Jesus Christ and at the time they were done\nFull and hell and a lot of the sack\nReligious references to Jesus Christ and at the time they were done the priest would say we command\nChrist with Christ command you or we command\nThe devil demon name your name yourself and leave the body of a boy and every time the demon would speak to them in Latin and then with the move doing them and and and you know we're lucky you always saw was pea soup in The Exorcist before and I understand that the boy would decade and urinate over the priests city\nIt was it wasn't you know the you know taking a a you know regular like projectiles what it was so you know they they eliminated the gross is of back\nAnd and replaced it with vomiting or in the movie but the truth was is the the demon would literally said to them that are you there is going to leave the body and the boy and Everytime he did it the boy would either urinate or are you a decade on the ... and so they were covered in in in all of that while they were doing the extras as\nWell and if you don't mind that I share quickly I'm just from the from the journal when first of all I I Do want to clarify that the um the PDF is available online and\nUm so um it's it's you know they love of the public and I will share I Can't say that you know it's it's my you know my document or a get out um or any of that means so right you know from my standpoint I certainly you know please to share it but again I\nHave a library that we are developing a library of of of files and we're going to announce people why we're developing a library of files and I just wanted to make sure that I could use that as they put the Lincoln our library of files so people can do the research of anguish too and that's how I was asking\nOh it certainly certainly and and and you know from my standpoint yes most definitely but I just wanted to clarify that and if you don't mind reading quickly just from the the journalist says the most distinct markings on the body with a picture of the devil on ours right leg in the word hell imprinted on our chest in such a way that our\nCould look down upon his shut the read the letters plainly so it was horrific for\nYou know for for Roland is experiencing this but it's like you just quickly add it just said that um there were also you know the arrows pointing down towards you know his his male part in it and they said that\nThey feel that um and further answers to the prayer because they would constantly prayer there were two letters go and the third\nPointed away from the crotch an indication that might have meant that the devil would leave by way of you are a nation or ... so it just shows you know the level of horrible and um [noise] and uh that you know this poor boy you know\nUnder one and then also the whole family that's that's you know at ... at this point in time I don't believe they were there they were already in the um they went from the house to actually at the college church um\nThere is a ... on campus a southern fables university campus they actually did perform some part of the extra over there as well you know um and that's a little known fat but\nHere is another thing a John Grider had said that one of the things was most terrifying was him constantly sounding like woody woodpeckers\nHe would click his tongue and he would laugh like woody woodpeckers so we'd go [laughter] any laugh like that and it was so bizarre because they said it was perfect\nAnd it sounded like it was a it was it was a just to see panic a woody woodpeckers laughter but what was interesting is the is that there was a time\nWhere a a he doubled over a and they woke up crying and he says my throat hurts my throat hurts and they and they you know when you do for the boy and then as soon as he said my throat hurts all of a sudden his voice cleared and they heard him sing or harm or la la la\nFamily yeah and then of course he's saying the old rugged cross and I heard I even heard from 'em what someone else so I I think it was actually mark telling me that he also saying they also say that some old man river\nAnd what was funny is that he was performing these songs and and as he performed them the priest felt like oh well obviously you know nothing evil could do this you know they're they're getting closer closer closer and then as soon as um as soon as they got closer\nTo the see the boy was okay it happened again the the boy would you know release everything out to them\nAnd and the and he would say to them you know in Latin some horrible thing about the ... about the ... or father you ... you know and so all the stuff we saw the movie The Exorcist was nothing compared to what was going on without boy you know it's pretty\nWell yes and actually he broke father Halloran no Senate referenced and the PDF and um so they are many any hit another um\nAnother father that was there in the nose law and caused at the bleeding severely but he actually broke father Halloran snow son and he's he's the I I feel more connected even though I never really had an official relationship with him or anything never really knew him but you know just seeing them around\nCampus and just knowing you know just knowing you know seeing them interact\nYou know a ... a a couple of times that I did I just a very serious man and and um\nAgain just really\nHorrific but he didn't really talk about it but just to know that that was documented in there and um and the other thing if I may add quickly that I Do want to share um during my time in the archives um\nThere was a professor that would come in and they had a a an old middle aged a manuscript collection so you know they they collected so the a professor of going to the archives and do his research while he he knew father Halloran quite well and um\nHe shared a story that there is that there was always a sense of dread and foreboding when he would prepare to go to the election brother's hospital to assess father\nAbout Ernie and um it was just that I live in a negative like forest or energy that you know just a feeling of dread one time he used to back in that that\nTime they had street cars and he took the streetcar and add to the election brother's hospital stopped and was about to exit the streetcar\nWhen he put his foot from the street car down to that set foot on the ground a fourth stop him his top to Medicare and he could not\nHe could not place it down so and he said a prayer and then it released and he was able to you know put it down planets split into scope carry on you know it's just getting the access or something but that was you know that's not first came from father Halloween but\nIt was from a very trusted source that you know that I got you know during my time there and and I trust I mean these are honest\nHonest people and um you know again but it was just a story that took as always fascinated me and I'm just pleased to be able to share that\nWant to read an excerpt from is going to the phones says at midnight the father's planning to give Roland holy communion but Satan would have no part of it even while the institution of the buses Akron was explained to roll in\nHis body was badly scratched and branded the

BP's electronic voice phenomena where there's a whole chapter in a book about\n... percent perfect because it seems to me that since we've gone to the digital age from the analog age they're getting more and more of these recordings\n[noise] yes indeed and I think that what you have is you have the ability now to use digital radio to scan the frequencies more quickly a fellow by the name of Frank ... in the nineties figured out that if you hack\nA digital FM radio you can literally break it in such a way so that is that scans the frequency is it doesn't stop at a station when the signal comes in clear it just continually sweeps and again that\nThat's that continuous sweeping has you'll ... if you do that voices and other sounds sort of a rise out of that noise\nAnd again people will write these words down that they will capturing these very quick sparse moment says it scans the frequencies and see if they can have some or attempt to have some kind of communication with with a imagine has the spirit world\nShe came up with one is called springs box which is exactly that isn't it\nThat's right Frank's box and you can see some of the photographs online if he's a really wonderful very creative um devices that he made and he they became more and more complex so eventually he started to think that maybe in fact that wasn't spirits at all but then when he was communicating with extraterrestrials\nPeter as you were putting together strange frequencies did you come across anything strange yourself\nWell I did some experiments and\nThere were a few times where there were a few things that I thought were particularly odd but I think what was important was that I was able to sort of get into that had space where I felt that I was\nDoing something that had been being done for centuries I mean I'm I'm would like to make the argument that even somebody like John the who was using his scene stones to try to communicate with the angels and ... and\nAs a result created what magicians called the ... language that that use of a scene stone is the same as using radio to communicate with the spirit world that that this is something that human beings have been attempting to do with some media mystic device some material device\nWhere we take something and we read purpose that we use it in a way that it wasn't originally intended\nAnd in fact the magician or the medium becomes a kind of spiritual hacker\nWhere we're really trying to interact\nWith our technologies and the material world in a way that some would say really is that what we're supposed to be doing with it and yet as we know what's\nHave more early on the most inventive and if it wasn't for the hackers we probably wouldn't have desktop computers today in our home [laughter]\nThat's true people do with those whose latest book is called strange frequencies you start the book with Jewish mythology and legends round in the Golan tell us about that\n[noise] yeah I mean I like to think that the goal is really the first piece of technology right where we\nTry to build something and and view it with a spiritual\nPower and use it to some and what's interesting about the Golan legend is the legend of the goal of as it's called particularly the coal to Prague is a story of a rabbi who builds a goal and to help the Jewish people who feel um who are being attacked\nOr there's a poll rum and they're trying to defend themselves and eventually the goal and becomes it goes you know it it it it it there's chaos ensues the rabbi can no longer control it and he either has to destroy it or he has to put it to sleep\nThat one of the stories that goal and gross so large that the rabbi has to climb up on a ladder and a race the secret word from its forehead and it crumbles into a sometimes crushing the rabbi and some of the stories but if you look at the actual Jewish ... missed this as a mystical writings about the call them\nThe goal of them is in some ways\nAnd means by which the the rabbi demonstrates their spiritual AQIM in it it's almost like a test to show that they are prepared for greater mystical magical knowledge but the column itself is was understood by the rabbis to be just kind of a dumb machine\nThere's a wonderful tell my story where a rabbi ... go to the head rabbi and they show him the goal I'm In the\nSense of the world what can I Do kind of speak and they say well no I Can't speak and he says well then what good is it it's just\nIt's just the toy beaches what really makes the human being different from all the other creatures arraignment so we can't do that we're not playing God we might think we are but if we can't do that\nThen we're just pretend there's to the throne as it were\nYou what about the ... you know you need 'em uh American tradition and other types of was a cultures ... seemed to be the Persian connected to the other side\n[noise] that's right and the Sherman would also use utilize\nSound and light off and and other kinds of mechanisms to try to induce the states have consciousness in their\nPeople and I think that what the showman does and what the stage magician does in many ways this is very connected and it also can access and connects the technology to the history of spiritualism\nAnd the staging of spiritualism with spirit cabinets and the different ways in which\nPeople were using technologies sometimes it was just a little lever inside the cabinet but they were using technologies to be able to create the state\nOf consciousness in the audience and so I don't think that it's necessarily when we we don't go to see a magic trick and get mad that were being tricked right we want to be we want to be and chanted we want to exist in that state of mind\nAnd so all the ways in which people have used technology whether it's very primitive are very advance I think it's something that we've long been excited about it I mean even watching a a film about spirits\nIn the movie theater is almost like a showman is that your experience as knit\nIs obsessed with trying to communicate with the other side he tried to build his own machine I don't think he was never able to do it wasn't you\nKnow and and in fact you know he really wanted it to be true in this even goes back\nTo the ways in which we have very interesting thing here where we're people who are considered scientists to rationalize and stop it they were the funky because they want it to just be cynical skeptical because they really want that there to be the truth is this true Houdini\nHoudini really wanted him he really wanted to find a medium who could communicate with the other side so that he might speak with his eerily departed mother but he couldn't find on all he found was Charlotte but his but she believed that it could be possible\nAnd I think that that's an important thing that sometimes we we lose a sense that mystery in our lives where\nLet's just for a moment for ten even if it's just a quick ten moment imagine that these things could be possible I think that that's a valuable place sometimes just sit still for a while with ourselves end up\nThose are new Houdini by the way you write was obsessed with trying to find out about the other side we're talking about him in a couple of hours after we're done talking on the right yes that's right\n... going to be exciting he's he was one heck of a guy what are you as you say he wasn't able to find the medium to do the job that's right if he had today's equipment do you think he might be able to do something\nMaybe but I think that he would also find\nWhich unfortunately I sometimes founded that people were using these things but if you sort of you to move the curtain aside you saw the wizard of Oz there with all his contraption think is most quickly try to hide the fact that maybe he really was it is magical as you thought\nWere going to be back in a moment to talk more with Peter a beeper gold his book strange frequencies we've got a link to his publisher Random House to make it easy for you to get the book if you're into this it's a magnificent story the subtitle is the extraordinary story of the technological quest\nFor the super natural to stick with us we're going to take calls with Peter next hour we'll leave and take your stories you're paranormal stories and just your general questions more to talk with him about though about strange frequencies high technology and its ability to maybe communicate with the other side\nCoast insiders the new version of the coast to coast am Abu no available Rawhide bone and know Android ... listen live we're on demand anywhere anytime good goes to goes to um dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n\nI think what Dr fat quest is what drives a very human quest to\nTake control of our own spiritual material death that he's I mean if it I think it's actually a very American Spirit right I mean that some scholars a sociologist one in particular max vapor used to talk about\nYou know Protestantism and the spirit of capitalism that something about the Protestant American Spirit is something whereby we want to\nProve our righteousness we want to prove that we are loved by God by by being successful in the world by being innovators inventors entrepreneur is right and I think that that extends even to our sense of our own spirituality and that this idea that we\nAre in charge of our own salvation where we want to be right in front of\nOur experience with the divine is is again something that's very human I think particularly American off and and so you have these people who are just doing what we've always wanted to do which is to say you know what I'm going to do it I'm going to figure out\nHow to interact with with spirit or with God or divine or whatever\nAnd and how do we do that well we often do that by inventing something by making something by taking something the pre existing eye opening it up and read purpose in it and so I think that that drive is is a is a very human drive it's why people practice magic for millennium right\nJust another example of magic of a of a cult practice where we are trying to insert ourselves between right right in the middle to get right in there and to say I want to\nHave this experience directly I don't want it to be mediated but if it is going to be mediated I'm going to be the one who who uses that tool\nI mean we put you Peter in that category\nMyself yeah well I definitely am somebody who who believes in a spiritual reality and who wants to interact with that\nUm I tend to ah believe though that we have to be careful about how much we try to rest that you know\nWe have to put it this way we have to meet God halfway right we can't make it all the way [laughter] you know and if we get so far and we don't get an answer that maybe there wasn't an answer at that moment for us to get\nWhy does it seem that some people get the answer or at least they think they do and then others can't even get close\nYeah I mean that's the greatest that's the greatest mystery though isn't it I mean there is\nYou know why some people seem to be more sensitive to this or why some people are\nBut this goes you know back to the whole idea that we once used to think that a bit a profit was somebody who had special information for us and now we often believe that those people might actually be crazy right so\nYou know it's a for a long time we've been wrestling with the visionary experience and\nUm and that's why you know even people who produce art that we called visionary art or spiritual are are often considered outsider artists why is that why the people who are working with these themes consider to be outside artist as opposed to just people who are part of a regular\nAre mainstream artistic community and I think it's we live in a world where we still feel that these questions have to be a little bit on the outside of our normal experience and what's interesting about technology is it is and this is really key here to\nSee if I can explain this somebody takes or radio and they say I'm gonna I'm gonna open up this radio and I'm gonna risotto a few connections to see if I can communicate with the spirit world\nBut the science that made that radio possible and the science that makes it possible to the Saudi Arabia and have another effect hate place the science behind that that even made this radio or something that you could find a store\nWhich said that communication with the spirit world is not possible spirits don't it yes and yet we can take the things this technology and somehow divorced it from the science that is underneath the scientific method in scientific understanding of the world it's it's underneath it\nAnd divorced and turn it into a tool that we can use to try to have these experiences and so I think there's a fascinating disconnect there about how we can think about technologies in ways that that the science connected to them might actually be in opposition to\nWell if you didn't own a radio or have a computer where you could listen on line and somebody came up to you and said\nPeter ... I hear voices of this guy at night talking about ghosts and spirits and all these strange things he's alter he's out there and you of course new never had a radio you've never went on line like that to listen you're probably saying what's this guy talking about he's insane\nOr what my voice is out there who's being heard by millions\nOr if they have the receiver to pick it up in in I think all we need in order to pick up the spirit world which is all energy to the right time to receiver\nWhile it's fascinating that you say that because when\nSpiritual ism was becoming very popular I'm In the Eighteen hundreds in the mid to late Eighteen hundreds it was also when we had started developed ... telegraph technology\nAnd people called medium spiritual mediums spiritual telegraph [laughter] they really believe that there was this link between this\nThis new version and technology and how you're right it was a special a new kind of receiver and transmit her and that the human being could also be this thing and so we use that same language\nKind of receiver and transmit are and that the human being could also be this thing and so we use that same language to talk about them\nYou see that being from the television Iraq has really augmented in shape things were spirituality and technology tell me why\nWhile I mean the TV itself is kind of a ... very strange and scary yeah at the some of the the there is a very wonderful advertisement from a television set in Nineteen thirty four\nCalled the clue television company and they actually eight this is how they advertise their television this is what they said\nThe dreams of witches have come true oh my God\nSo they they saw this thing this new device that the way to capture the public's imagination about buying this thing was not to try to make it less weird\nBut to increase its sense of being connected to some supernatural dream that we once had that we could communicate in this way over the ether ripe [noise]\nUm and so the the the fact that you know week that we used to call those the after effects on a TV you know in the when we used to watch you ate shepherd VHS stations with an antenna\nWe used to call those dose right so even the way in which we think about the television metaphorically is is filled to the brim right with these supernatural on a cult metaphors and I think that that's really important I think it even when we\nTalk about technology for not believers and even if we're just using it we still use these this language to try to make sense of it\nAnd I remember those days to dump that this has anything to do with our discussion tonight but a ... radios televisions were built into very heavy ... remember those\nOh my gosh yeah absolutely yep\nMy dad had an old silk on radio and this thing must have been about four feet tall and you know where it was ... it was in case in this beautiful piece wouldn't senator\nAnd had silicone written across it uh it ... it was it was a piece of art in the same way uh TVs in the in the stereos other started coming out with\nThe Chinese are meant to be central pieces of our home right and so you can imagine this thing the centerpiece of our home and then a movie like corporate guys comes out it only makes sense that this is how the spirits would come into our lives is through the TV\nAre you a hundred percent convinced Peter that the other side exists\nI'm not a hundred per cent convinced about anything so I you know I live in a very limited all\nPlace what I what I like more than anything and what I like about it's about technology is that I really believe that these ambiguous states\nAre and chanting states that when somebody tries to convince me something as a hundred percent true I tend to be a lot more skeptical than somebody who just wants to share an interesting experience with me\nGet into your time machine and tell me what you think things will be like fifty years from now with regards to try to communicate with the other side\n[laughter] well let's talk more about um maybe it's not that we will communicate with the other side but we will have transcended to the other side by use of\nYou know it's for special when it gets like this just a little cautious cross\nSection owns the place and how she was so incredibly ... difference to demand more strong willed feline and see how she grows up and cuddle her person\n[noise] their pitch on her powering is simply perfect touch on testing cat\nHas taken but really the best way to know one amazing show to pet like Nico is to meet one visit to shelter pet project auto today adopt work you by most on the humane society the United states in the outcome so [noise] news then talk on the radio\nDishes use radio search in ...

really believe the angels were there Ron thanks for that Peter you're probably too young to remember that\nNo but I Love it all happened um that these miracles happened over the television\nYeah that's true [laughter] that's absolutely true technology at its best\nRight somebody's going to come up with something somewhere I think don't you\nI mean some you know we can only become more advanced and it's going to be interesting to see if one day these different parts of our lives can really merge in some way and maybe it's technology that's going to make that possible\nWho's going to Carolyn are hemmed in Connecticut now Hi Carol thanks for calling\nHi or maybe you haven't had anyone tell you about a strange and sent ... with a CD player or I go ahead please what happened was I was writing a one block past where my son used to work and and in between the songs on the CD it's about five seven second\nAnd uh all of a sudden I hear a young boy say\nDon't drive that way no one\nNo one has any access to my CDs my anything and I'm looking around all of a thing where it's coming from is coming from the thing and it never happens again I played it over and over again it never happened on any other CDs\nDon't drive you have all of the advice of the slaves or I bet it said you didn't have Carol\n[noise] well I don't know if that if he just met don't don't cut through

aware of it were you thinking a little bit more\nI wasn't thinking about it [laughter] I can you know in between absolutely quiet you know you know a pretty new CD and I played it over and over again and I just thought you you'd want to know about a CD incident where you say there's radio you know am FM or whatever we say this is your CD\nAlright that's pretty ... pretty soon it'll be popping up on podcasts Peter\n[laughter] that's right exactly what those to the whole range of electronic voice phenomenon I mean the earliest researchers weren't using radios they were using light noise they were using just a quiet room with a microphone it was it wasn't so much about the\nThat the vice itself it was the fact that it was electronic media it was making this possible some record of all media whether it was a tape 'em or in this case a CD\nWell in one one of the things I think that is very intriguing about all of this is that some people do not react to that little angels sitting on their shoulder whispering in their ear telling them don't do this hormone here go straight to stop\nYou have to be able to determine when to do these things right mhm because if you don't you could miss a great opportunity or you could get killed or something like that but that\nAbsolutely and I know you know maybe in some ways and and I don't mean to diminish anybody's experienced that maybe you know\nMaybe sometimes we project these things from within ourselves on to the media you know maybe it's not the spirit world communicating to us with the\nWith the um radio or what the tape player maybe it's our own unconscious our own spirits that are trying to communicate something to us that we need to hear\nWhen you started writing the book strange frequencies was an easy or difficult for you\nTo watch that we need to hear when you started writing the book strange frequencies\nWas easy or difficult for you to get it started\n[noise] well a part of the problem for me was that each one of the subjects that I took up there's been you know decades of research and books about them so\nBut I Would have to try to figure out a way to do is take all this material and and turned it into what I think I Hope is interesting stories about these these specific things I mean the history of there's some wonderful books about the history of spare photography\nBut I Want it to specifically orient my story around Shannon's work and doing show take up you know some of the important background information\nBut yes it where it was difficult than I have to say and and you know I'm sure that you understand is that\nNo matter how you want to approach the subjects whether you want to approach them as a skeptical as a full on believer or the way that I liked to approach them more as a journalist and a historian\nThat people are worried when you bring up or it's like supernatural are caught they don't know if you're going to try to exploit them or make fun of them or\nIf you're coming at it from a I'm a way that they feel is is not rational enough you know and so just the idea that I wanted to work with the subjects that all poses problems sometimes when I'm asking to interview somebody and they're\nA little bit mistrust sure my intentions might be\nWell in a lot of people Peter when they hear the word cult St close it's sickness or double Rappler ... yeah and it

take some final call here for you as they continue Raleigh now show in the Bronx age oh go ahead\nPlease do it all is well good uh Peter you mentioned earlier that you didn't think the spirits possessed vocal cords so I had an experience or when my brother visited me or that the rest away um [noise]\nThat immediately or they passed away but several years later I'm I was having read his blog I'm a singer songwriter\nAnd um I was stuck on a song without uh any uh you know a inspiration coming to me at the moment and it was during the day and he uh he walked past to put him like that\nAnd he said just get it done show that\nSaying that uh they don't possess a way to generate their own voices that that's why they're using technology than hell was that voice generated\nYeah I mean that's just another experience I mean I I don't say that I was I was commenting on what people who are based on what a Jew and had said that ... pi researchers might respond to her idea\nThat indeed there couldn't be voices but certainly or experiences one which thousands and thousands of people throughout history and had\nYou know and I got to tell you Peter that ah you know since people have been investigating goals and haunting from the other side to show many years do you find that these sightings are more prevalent now or are the less than before\n[noise] well I think it feels more prevalent because we have access to information that um you know so quickly so I think everything feels like it's more because you can hear about it more more often\nBut certainly there is an increase in general I think in an interest in\nUm alternative spirituality Reno I'm you know there's a a huge increase in interest in Wicca and neo paganism right now I'm a lots of people who are experimenting and reading about and writing about witchcraft\nUm so I just think that overall there's an increase in people's needs to be seeking\nUm some alternative ways of thinking about a spiritual experience but I Do think that we just live in an age where you know information is just overload enough and so certainly it feels like there's more but I think that either experience as a human being says\nThan

of spooky lock them [noise]\nAnd uh [noise] that Saturday Night a will stay there and I had a strange dream where I um [noise] seems to encountered two\nOther worldly beings I could not describe them or they didn't have a form but they had a presence\nAnd um [noise] I said to argue and ah not not verbal you but you know you're hearing the dream state so [noise] um there there was communication that I Can't quite pinpoint either but there was a very clear conversation a very clear words used 'em\nI said are you an alien or are you an angel there was one standing in the back and there was one that was communicating with me\nHe said I Am an angel I Am an arcane journal and the only eight or ten so I was aware of it this time was saint Michel so I said are you say Michael she said no I Am St ...\nI didn't think very much of it woke up the next day my parents went to attend math future um I don't practice so I decided to go with one of the city and um while they were there\nI'm not far from the ... which also sitting on a stone wall after I'd walked around a little bit of catching my breath and I see this old Anglican cemetery across the road\nIt's called St Michael's cemetery so I take a stroll through there I'm looking at all the old gravestones is really nice and I walk 'em up its place Tadic corner sort of a at an intersection where you can walk in through from one side walk and you can exit\nAnd um I walked through the entire length of the trail there and whenever I caught the other exit I noticed that this event and there wasn't any other woman patient and the

to a comment on directly but I'd love to hear what you think George\nWell like these strange things happen all the time I I Am a staunch believer that there are no coincidence is mhm I you know there's lock in things happened but I Believe that said takes over and does all these incredible things the synchronous cities of life\nAre done for a reason I mean it's it just happens\nOr I guess it's all about how we respond to them though correct yep absolutely how we pick 'em up see I think\nAll of us as individuals or centers and receivers of information or through telepathy through all kinds of vehicles and we're constantly doing this with individuals and the more and more you get to know somebody\nKnew more tuned in you are with them where you say something and they were about to

this whole angel thing I'm I'm I'm God believer a crisis follower and\nI make no bones about it obviously I come into this conversation with a little bit of a bias but um I guess the cost and I wanted to get to those those of us in the audience that are of like mind is that is to use caution with the amount of emphasis that you put on trying to seek out\nThe guardian angel aspect and and I guess we get dangerously close to worshipping the the angels in worshipping the people that God's putting our lives to help us\nI'm a father I've got a young kids and it wasn't until I got kids that are really understood this whole concept of love like I Do now\nI Believe God loves this very very deeply so much so we can't even understand it and if my kid you know got hurt and got sick out whatever I needed a seeing eye dog for example and my kid loves the dog my kid loves the dog but then my kids love my dog that I gave him to help him get through his handicap more than he loves me\nI guess as a father and my heart would be heartbroken that I Would lose out on the full relations but I Would have with my kid and I guess to the extent that many of us try to\nSeek out the angels more than ...

am with George Nouri\nThen I'll go back to the coast to coast as we continue with the supernatural at the moment are very special guest professor slim king joins us\nTo talk about Harry Houdini for a moment Harry Houdini was the Hungarian born American illusion this than stumped performer noted for his sensational escape actually first attracted noticed a Bob Dylan the U.S\nAnd that is Sherrie ... got a tour of Europe or he challenged police forces to keep it locked up Sunni extended his repertoire to include chains ropes slung from\nSkyscrapers straight jackets underwater and having to escape from an old his breath inside of sealed milk can with the water in Ninety four thousand watched as he tried to escape from special ... cups commissioned by London daily mirror keeping image suspense for an hour\nLive only just able to claw himself to the surface or merge you know the state of near break down now what many suspected that these escapes were fate\nHoudini presented himself as a scourge of fake spiritual as he was obsessed with trying to communicate with his dad mother that went through all kinds of mediums and people to find her\nHe was not successful he told his wife bass that when he died they will try to communicate he will try to come back\nAnd um they decided that Houdini or you know die from this punch a lot of doctors nowadays say he just died at ... night is from a panics mhm so it's the battles rage on and on and what really killed him and it goes back and forth\nBut I think he was had the onset of a ... and the fight if and when he was hit it actually broke\nThe Boston that's right and all that bacteria comes out and just ran through his body\nRight and they had no anti bacterial anything back then in twenty six so he uh had took in seven days to die\nWho do you have one of the substances that what happened\nYes yeah it was a ... so its ups assault through they had two operations and then they gave him some mysterious serum that they'd been working on but nothing seemed to work\nDuring those seven days he had time to go over this afterlife experiment that he invests it worked out and they'd had it since the early Nineteen hundreds\nThey had this it's a two way code that they worked out if one of them died that they would use this code contact each other\nAnd so he had a week it took him a week to pass away he was so strong and so they had a week together to fine tune this code and then about two years later she gets uh the actual code from Arthur forward\nNow how does our to forget the code what are the you know a a medium trans what happens\nIs Arthur Ford was a trance medium he wasn't like I'm a Marjory I'm you know the er which\nFor life than you would you like was he was he liked Whoopi Goldberg in a post\n... he just goes into he puts on a blindfold and goes to sleep okay like like Casey\nAll righty goes into that trap state\nRight he just goes into a trance state they have to write down everything that happens and then he read the later he doesn't really always remember what goes on attendance subconscious but he consciously doesn't really remember\nAll the time what happened so they transcribe these fans so he started having these senses\nAnd in one of them he contacted Houdini some other about a year before this and then he starts having the finances and he starts getting the code now the Houdini messages actually in three parts\nIt's one word than a nine words that\nSpell another word and then she it's a two way code\nI'm Beth has five words in French that she says back to him now does that make sense to you or everybody I talked to a Ninety nine percent of them only think of a one way code you have you're on the other side\nA one word or something you're going to get it across\nAnd then they're going to know that you're there but Houdini was sharper than that Houdini said listen I'm over on the other side I Want to make sure she gets the code\nThat she's the one who gets\nRight I Want to make its shirts her so she has five words in French that she gets back to come back to him [noise] so this was an ingenious code really at because it's take it's a ten it's like Fifteen words wow\nWhy why was Harry professor obsessed with either trying to come back spiritually who would even let everybody know what was going on\n[noise] well ah as you know Harry had to be first\nPerson that had to escape\nRight here with us as Scott pollock just had to be first I don't know if you know that Harry was the first guy to fly an airplane and Australia\nYes he was not sure I heard him so\nHe had to be first in a matter of fact he did a great movie called the grim game about that so uh and he did several movies he he was a really multi talented guy\nUm I think he would have been I think he would have had a movie um ... you know mogul yeah it had he survived he invented what they call now the dailies uh in in the movie industry he invented that\nHe rushed cautious right\nYes so he was a you know awesome and all these\nDifferent ways so he was going to be number one and if he had to come back from the grape to do it he was going to\nDo he was going to do it and do you think it was successful\nI I Know we're successful I Know that the code and the message that he gave was exactly the same message that they that they had agreed upon\nYou didn't know that for a fact comfort professor Beck\nBass was in tough shape should best was pretty depressed but you know her husband had died and bass was um she had developed some what I Would consider bad habits she spent money like crazy and she uh\nWhile he was alive in after died\nWhile he was alive and after he died and so if you remember Nineteen twenty nine when the message came back ah all hell broke loose the none of her\nMagic friends really wanted to believe that in any way and then later in the year the stock market crashes and she loses not only all her friends\nShe loses all her money she was arrested in the stock market yes she loses the majority of her friends the majority of her money and now she's\nGot this bad habit of spending money like a girls on trees she just\nAnd I guess here we left are nice little so\nYeah he liked her a part of the uh they paid double a\nIndexing lady or whatever for his ah insurance insurance the insurance was twenty five thousand dollars\nWhich in Nineteen thirty six is probably a lot of money that\nRight ... probably that's close to a million dollars um so they doubled that because\nThey said it was an accident because this guy punched him and so it was the insurance company that came up and said\nAh that can't happen you can get appendicitis from being punched and so they were proven wrong in court so she got fifty thousand so she was rolling in do now and then she they put it all in the market and she lost at all\nNow you have heard of the crash that killed Houdini yes what is the curse\n[noise] know Houdini had a three part show the first part of the show was magic the second part was a ... a scape he would do an escape\nThat was where the water or a Chinese water torture cell or the uh the milk can escape and then the last part towards the end of his career\nHe would go out for the spiritual less than you would have have this um confrontation with them\nLaunched himself like confrontation right well at some point in time he would say I've had enough and he would get up during a third party he would go out to a palm reader or somebody or a\nA that he considered fake and you would go in there and all the reporters and everybody to be following him and he'd go in and you find a couch or something and they pull out like an incandescent down that goes in the dark or sometimes\nSee I oh I got you you know and\nAnd they're probably string or something like that\nRight so uh and of course the the medium to adjust what uh what do you do that I didn't have nothing to do with that\nWell they honestly didn't because I I'm a magician and a magician always have what you call an out the way out you work it into your magic trick if you have a magic trick you might have two or three\nDifferent methods on how it works and there's something else he switched to the next one and\nYou switch to the next one\nAnd and it works so you're assured of success and so in his magic that's built in in his escapes of course I'm I guarantee you had two or three keys in there you know and if all that failed and he couldn't get the T vast would come out and kiss him and she'd have the appropriate T\nAnd there was no exactly uh-huh he always had an out she always had a way out well ... actually the same thing for the spiritual spirituals because he had an agent\nAnd she would go into town and she would find some hanging fruit you would\nFind some a medium that were obviously tricking but some she couldn't find what they're doing and she couldn't catch them so she would pull out something from her clothes and like stop it into the couch\nAnd so later he had a sure thing that he could come back and told them even though they didn't know anything about it [noise]\nIt seems as though that somebody somewhere put

R. E. F. the James Randi educational foundation had a million dollar one\nHere which they never had to give out\nRight they never had to give it out but they I don't think they actually let anybody who could actually win participate\n[laughter] um well they're all like you for that one\nYeah ah well they can they can deflect me all they want I don't think they played fair and they finally shut it down and they're just giving them money whoever they want it interesting that they were taking in about one point five million dollars a year talking about a million dollar\nWhoever they want a that is interesting that they were taking in about one point five million dollars a year talking about a million dollar contest so they were coming out way ahead\nSo anyway the uh the Scientific American has the same kind of thing going on so they're always going to Marjory say on says so they set this up with six of these and Houdini goes up but he doesn't send\n'em ... that's the agents that easily center ahead what he does he builds up box kind of looks like a sauna he builds this box and then he has um\nJames Collins build it for him\nAnd he builds all of a Houdini props and it's it's designed so that only means head in our hands can stick out okay so she can't get at anything so who d'nese gotta make sure that she can't\nProduce any trickery so they ah do once they aren't in everything goes according to plan and\nUh they have what they call a ballot box it's a little a bell inside of a box and if they push on the only I had the the bell rang and they always put the box outside of the reach of me now\nAh and in this particular instance they put it between Houdini slack\nSo there's no way anyone could get out well in the first chance the bell rings\nSo the second fancy brings in the box and he puts her in the box he's going to stop it right and they put that in the second say on the bell rings now so now he's got a fixture in memory what we talked about before about there's always an out you have to he has to\nFix marching Marjorie because he's actually already written a book about her\nHow he's you know exposed her yeah so he's got this book he's going to put out so we have to expose her so she comes in uh everybody gets around the fans and of course Marjorie has a spirit guide\nAnd his name is Walter when it's Marjorie brother so Walter she goes into a trance and Walter comes out and just starts cussing and swearing and cursing at Houdini and he says why do you put this foul thing in here why are you doing this why did you do this I'm cursing you\nEvery news in the mirror and saying this right\nThis is the spirit saying it through Marjorie\nAnd the ... puts a death occurs because\nInside the box is a rule or one of those ... rulers pulls up into three pieces in one of those all kinds and it's in side the box the only people that had access to the box was Houdini and a James Collins\nHouse was the curse a professor and then we ended up dying\nWell the ... he cursed him and some people say that he said you'll die in a year that that's a you know people debate about that\nBut he died in two years he was totally dead this big strong man died in two years after being cursed by Walter scare him well actually Houdini used it in his advertising you can see their Houdini ads all over the place\nWhere Houdini advertise that he's under the curse of the spiritual die at any moment yeah and it's really really helped him you know kind of in a way but then you get this concept of self fulfilling prophecy\nOff the side that he's gonna die so later when Houdini gets sick maybe this is in the back of his mind and so he doesn't go to the doctor\n'cause he doesn't want he doesn't want to prove them right he doesn't want to show that he's getting sick or that something's happened and that kinda my viewpoint of maybe what happened why he didn't go when he first started getting sick\nAnd Arthur for what happened to him was actually\nArthur Ford Arthur forward toward the world after he gave this or did he I'll live Houdini the outlive you all are he lived until ... Seventy one oh wow okay\nPoured lived a fantastic life um so after a Houdini or tries to frame up Marjory I'm he puts out this book he actually fails but he says he doesn't and you've got these photos of Marjory legs under the\nTable mhm and then he had some drawings made where her leg is reaching around his leg so he makes some drawings and puts them in the book where the photo is not anything like that drawing a\nLoyal trickery by Houdini\nYes Houdini once again is doing this and um there was a guy named Walter ... Gibson and he is probably one of if not the number one\nA expert on Houdini he worked with Houdini he worked with down injure and then he worked with ...\nAnd he makes a statement that there's a a a bombshell in in the interview crafting and uh he gives this quote by Gibson says when we're all magicians realize that Houdini was often as this honest as the mediums he purported to expose\nWow that's pretty heavy\nThat is heavy coming from the number one guy so he knew that they were putting 'em ...

correlation of Houdini Detroit and I just wanted to say that I Believe\nThat's a that's a that's a great story rich thanks for that Houdini was in the Detroit River when he was in town before he died was he not professor\nYeah I think I think that was one of his one of his skates\nYeah it really was they dumped him in the ... river I think he was in a straight jacket upside down\nYeah that you love doing that and sometimes he was in a box\nHoudini would uh he would uh modify his escape to whatever of you know kind of businesses that wanted to support him\nSo ah you know if the police supported him either skate from one of their jail cells or a there was one tiny escape from a like big fish they built the big fish 'cause there was a fish company that was sponsoring him in their town\nSo he would or would it kind of knew if he would make up some way to escape from something that tied in to his advertisers\nTony Curtis died in a twenty two and he was eighty five years old but I thought he did a great job in that Harry Houdini movie you remember it\nYes yeah I think all of the movies had been actually pretty good yeah ah I don't they don't stick with the actual\nHow did how did he make that elephant disappear in the ... in London how did he do that\nWell can you want me to tell him yeah you know the traffic [laughter] I mean what did he how do they have the thing covered or or what first of all [noise] ah I Can't I'm not gonna tell 'em come on now I might\nTell you in private there's a book you can buy a ... or by a guy who\nHill and let me ask you this if I'm right would you tell me\n[noise] yes and if I if if your right oh I'll tell you or do I have to tell you on air\nYeah well I'm just going to ask you a few questions okay that's how did he have any apparatus that raises the elephant from underground you know you did not okay I'm going to assume that the elephant was always there\n[noise] [noise] yes [noise]\nOkay we'll do a little more homework after they do know that comes up with the tricks I mean was it Houdini does that make him a genius for being able to come up with this or did he have somebody on staff like you who would say here's this trek\nAnd let's do this and we can make this and that how did they do this is Sam was ... feel too I assume ... people on staff like you are right\nExactly exactly I'm James Collins when the guy that Houdini the built in all of them for like Houdini would say I want to do this and then\nAnd then they would have to come up with how you would\nDo so I assume in the human genome they walk you Nelson out everybody sees this thing lumbering in ... and then they shrouded in clumps ... or something and then the trick began I mean it's absolutely amazing wasn't the queen there at the time\n[noise] uh well he probably the same between that's there [laughter] in Europe but\nI don't think she was at their okay I I don't know for sure next on it I don't\nThink she was there I think he performed for them in Europe\nOh let's go to the first time caller Ralph in Indianapolis Hi Ralph go ahead\nYes I'm here already taken away readings\nA new worker for a while and it was the last five years of his life got a letter from him just before he died out seeing vicious pike on a ledge when he was trying to go over to comb Ron in Israel and that's where they found him\nA question for you or is that what we what year did Arthur forward bring back the code to Mrs Houdini this was in Nineteen twenty nine okay I was a three part code or the code was the middle section the first word was Rosa dollar rows\nAnd then he had a code for the nine or words that spelled out believe and then she had dry words in French which mean I pulled the curtain back like this and that's what she told him so he was a shirt that has coded gotten through\nNow didn't he she later denied that later on a after she loses her friends she loses all her money a man a called Edward Said comes into her life and says he's er manager but they live\nTogether he fell in love again ... yeah so he didn't like that and that's why you wanted to come back\nRight she meet women the same kind of way that I mean there's a lot of things going on here but he's like Twenty years younger than her [noise] ... ... her that she came on Roman make a movie and she'll make a million dollars okay go ahead\n[noise] uh what year than bitchy deny that the the code was correct well the first time she never denies the code was correct uh she says that she was fooled but she never denies that the code was correct\nBut she first about a year and a half after um she they're given the Houdini messages\nShe having lunch with some ladies in Miami and she she said she was hesitant about a\nHoudini coming back because why didn't he favor from the depression so she was she thought that Houdini would somehow favor from this math\nDepression that what's happening or that somehow he was going to come back and have breakfast with there every morning or something I don't know what she was thinking but she wasn't happy about the fact that\nUh our before it was on tour somewhere so she had no way to contact him and so she was you know showing here just pleasure for that\nThen Edward fake comes in later promises or a million dollars and then they go on and about eight years later they make a movie called a a religious racket chairs\nYeah he made a a couple of movies bleach Disney\nWell Houdini made four or five movies yeah and they also I Hope they do they do well\nOr they did fine but he was he was the star of of every movie\nWas like an actor or were they more like documentaries\nThey he was an actor and he always had like a really really good looking\nLike an actor or were they more like documentaries\nThey he was an actor and he always had like a really really good looking co star\nHis real name Eric Weiss yes\nHe was he was a pretty good looking guy too\nI kind of a sudden muffin guy he was only and

the movies\nReal name Eric white some\nHank yes and that's Eric turned into Harry and then Houdini he got from Don and he added and I called it Houdini\nAnd er so to this day they called him Harry

stimulus\nWhy do they do the caption just to make sure you're a real person\nExactly so they know you're not a hot as it were\nWell and I did it happen with technology you know I'm I'm also fascinated I don't know if you looked at ... piece electronic voice phenomena where the whole chapter in the book about\n... percent perfect because it seems to me that since we've gone to the digital age from the analog age they're getting more and more these recordings\n[noise] yes indeed and I think that what you have is you have the ability now to use digital radios to scan the frequencies more quickly a fellow by the name of Frank ... in the nineties figured out that if you hack\nA digital FM radio you can literally break it in such a way so that is that scans the frequency is it doesn't stop at a station when the signal comes in clear just continually sweeps and again that\nThat's that continuous sweeping has ... ... if you do that voices and other sounds sort of a rise out of that noise\nAnd again people will write these words down that they will capture in these very quick sparse moment says it scans the frequencies and see if they can have some or attempt to have some kind of communication with with a imagine as the spirit world\nHe came up with one of his cold springs box which is ... exactly that isn't it\nThat's right Frank's box and you can see some of the photographs online if he's a really wonderful very creative um devices that he made and he they became more and more complex\nSo eventually he started to think that maybe in fact it wasn't spirits at all but they do what he was communicating with extraterrestrials\nPeter as you were putting together strange frequencies did you come across anything strangers sells\nWell I did some experiments and\nThere were a few times where there were a few things that I thought were particularly odd but I think was important was that I was able to sort of get into that had space where I felt that I was\nDoing something that had been being done for centuries I mean I'm I'm would like to make the argument that even somebody like John the who was using his scenes stones to try to communicate with the angels and ... and as a result created what magicians called the ... language\nThat that use of a scene stone is the same as using a ...\nCreated what magicians called the ... language that that use of a scene stone is the same as using radio to communicate with the spirit world that\nThat this is something that human beings have been attempting to do with some media mystic the vice some material device where we take something and we read purpose that we use it in a way that it wasn't originally intended and in fact the magician or the medium becomes a kind of spiritual hacker\nWhere we're really trying to interact with our technologies and the material world in a way that some would say really is that what we're supposed to be doing with it and yet as we know it's really the hackers\nThat have more early on the most inventive and if it wasn't for the hackers we probably wouldn't have desktop computers today in our home [laughter]\nThat's true Peter ... with us his latest book is called strange frequencies you start the book was Jewish mythology and legend surrounding the goal and tell us about that\n[noise] yeah I mean I like to think that the goal is really the first piece of technology right where we\nTry to build something and in ... with a spiritual\nPower and use it to some and what's interesting about the Golan legend is the legend of the goal of as it's called particularly the goal of Prague is a story of a rabbi who builds a goal and to help the Jewish people who feel um who are being attacked\nOr there's a whole rum and they're trying to defend themselves and eventually the goal and becomes it goes you know it it it it it there's chaos ensues the rabbi can no longer control it and either has to destroy it or he has to put it to sleep\nGetting one of the stories that goal and gross so large that the rabbi has to climb up on a ladder and a race the secret word from its forehead and it crumbles into sometimes crushing the rabbi and some of the stories but if you look at the actual\nJewish ... stick mysticism mystical writings about the call them\nThe goal of them is in some ways a\nA means by which the the rabbi demonstrates their spiritual accurate and it's it's almost like a test to show that they are prepared for greater\nMystical magical knowledge but the goal in itself is was understood by the rabbis the beaches kind of a dumb machine\nThere is a wonderful how MK story where\nA rabbi ... go to the head rabbi and they show him the goal I'm In the ... says to them well what can I Do tend to speak and they say well no I Can't speak and he says well then what good is it it's just a it's just the toy\nBeach is what really makes the human being different from all the other creatures are writing and so\nWe can't do that we're not playing God we might think we are but if we can't do that\nThen we're just pretend there's to the throne as it were\nYou what about the showman wild you know in Native American tradition and other types of was a cultures ... seemed to be the person connected to the other side\n[noise] that's right and the Sherman would also use utilize\nSound and light off and and other kinds of mechanisms to try to induce the states have consciousness in their\nPeople and I think that what the showman does and what the stage magician does in many ways this is very connected and it also can access it connects the technology to the history of spiritualism and the staging of spiritualism which spirit cabinets and the different ways in which [noise]\nTechnologies sometimes it was just a little lever inside the cabinet but they were using technologies to be able to create the state\nOf consciousness in the audience and so I don't think that it's necessarily or we we don't go to see a magic trick and get mad that were being tricked right we want to be we want to be in chanted we want to invest in that state of mind\nAnd so all the ways in which people have used technology whether it's very primitive are very advance I think it's something that we've long and excited about it I mean even watching a film about spirits\nIn the movie theater is almost like a ... that sure experience isn't it\nThomas Edison the great inventor was obsessed with trying to communicate with the other side he tried to build his own machine I don't think he was ever able to do it wasn't you\nKnow and and in fact you know he really wanted it to be true in this even goes back to the ways in which we have\nVery interesting thing here we're we're people who are considered scientists to rationalize and stop it they were the monkey and because they want it to just be cynical skeptical because they really want it there to be the truth this is true of Houdini\nHoudini really want it to him he really wanted to find a medium\nWho could communicate with the other side so that he might speak with his eerily departed mother but he couldn't find on all he found or Charlotte but his but she believed that it could be possible and I think that that's an important thing that sometimes we we lose a sense of that mystery in our lives where\nLet's just for a moment pretend even if it's just a quick ten moment imagine that these things could be possible I think that that's a valuable place sometimes just sit still for a while with ourselves and not\nKnow Houdini by the way you write was obsessed with trying to find out about the other side we're talking about him in a couple of hours after we're done talking on the right yes that's right ... ... going to be exciting he's he was one heck of a guy\nBut to you as you say he wasn't able to find the medium to do the job that's right if he had today's equipment do you think he might be able to do something\n[laughter] maybe but I think that he would also find\nWhich unfortunately I sometimes found is that people were using these things but if you set of you to move the curtain aside you saw the wizard of Oz there with all his contraption think is most quickly try to hide the fact that maybe he really was it is magical as you thought\nWere going to be back in the moment to talk more with Peter a ... his book strange frequencies we've got a link to his publisher Random House to make it easy for you to get the book if you're into this it's a magnificent story the subtitle is the extraordinary story of the technological quest\nFor the super natural stick with us we're going to take calls with Peter next hour we'll leave and take your stories you're paranormal stories and just your general questions more to talk with him about though about strange frequencies high technology\nAnd its ability to maybe communicate with the other side\nCoast insiders the new version of it goes to goes to a a map is no available for iPhone and know Android ... was ... on demand anywhere anytime good acoustical stadium dot com and downloaded today\n[noise]\nI think what Dr fat quest is what drives a very human requests to\nTake control of our own virtual material destiny I mean I think it's actually a very American Spirit right I mean that some scholars a sociologist ... used to talk about\nYou know Protestantism in the spirit of capitalism that something about the Protestant American Spirit is some in whereby we want to\nProve our righteousness we want to prove that we are loved by God by by being successful in the world by being innovators inventors entrepreneur is right and I think that that extends even to our sense of our own spirituality and that this idea that we\nAre in charge of our own salvation where we want to be right in front of\nOur experience with the divine is is again something that's very human I think typically American off and and so you have these people who are just doing what we've always wanted to do which is to say you know what I'm gonna do it I'm going to figure out\nHow to interact with with spirit or with God or divine or whatever\nAnd and how do we do that well we often do that I invented something by making something by taking something that pre existed\nAnd and how do we do that well we often do that by inventing something by making something by taking something the pre existing eye opening it up and re purpose in it\nAnd so I think that that drive is is a is a very human drive it's why people have practiced magic for millennium right\nJust another example of magic of a of a cult practice where we are trying to insert ourselves between right right in the middle to get right in there and to say I want to\nHave this experience directly I don't want it to be mediated but if it is going to be mediated I'm going to be the one who who uses that tool and I\nWe put you Peter in that category\n[noise] myself yeah well I definitely am somebody who who believes in a spiritual reality and who wants to interact with that\nUm I tend to believe though that we have to be careful about how much we try to rest that you know from that that we have to post put it this way we have to be caught halfway right we can't make it all the way [laughter]\nYou know and if we get so far and we don't get an answer that maybe there wasn't an answer at that moment for us to get\nWhy does it seem that some people get the answer or at least they think they do and then others can't even get close\n[noise] yeah I mean that's the greatest that's the greatest mystery though isn't it I mean there is\nYou know why some people seem to be more sensitive to this or why some people are\nBut this goes you know back to the whole idea that we once used to think that a that a profit was somebody who has special information for us and now we often believe that those people might actually be crazy right so\nYou know it's a for a long time we've been wrestling with the visionary experience and\nUm and that's why you know even people who produce art that we called visionary art or spiritual aren't are often considered outsider artists why is that why is that people were working with these themes considered to be outside artist as opposed to just people who are part of a regular\nAre you know mainstream artistic community and I think it's we live in a world where we still feel that these questions have to be a little bit on the outside of our normal experience\nAnd what's interesting about technology is it is and this is really key here to see if I can explain this somebody takes or radio and they say I'm gonna I'm gonna open up this radio and I'm gonna risotto a few connections to see if I can communicate with the spirit world\nBut the science that made that radio possible and the science that makes it possible to east Saudi Arabia and have another effect take place the science behind that that even made this radio or something that you could find a store\nWhich said that communication with the spirit world is not possible spirits don't against and yet we can take the thing this technology and somehow divorced it from the science that is underneath the scientific method and scientific understanding of the world it's southern effect\nAnd divorced and turn it into a tool that we can use to try to have these experiences and so I think there's a fascinating disconnect there about how we can think about technologies in ways that that the science connected to them might actually be in opposition to\nWell you didn't own a radio or have a computer where you could listen online and somebody came up to humans Peter I hear voices of this\nTalking about ghosts and spirits and all these strange things he's out there he's out there and you of course new never had a radio you never went on line like that to listen you're probably saying what's this guy talking about he's insane or but my voice is out there who's being hurt by millions\nOr if they have the receiver to pick it up in in I think all we need in order to pick up the spirit world which is all energy to is the right kind of receiver\nWell fascinating that you say that because when spiritual is that it was becoming very popular I'm In the Eighteen hundreds in the mid to late Eighteen hundreds it was also when we had started developed ... telegraph technology\nAnd people called medium spiritual mediums spiritual telegraph [laughter] they really believe that there was this link between this\nThis new version and technology and how you're right it was a special a new kind of receiver and transmit are and that the human being could also be this thing and so we use that same language to talk about them\nYou see that being from the television Iraq has really augmented in shape things were spirituality and technology tell me why\n[noise] [noise] well I mean the TV itself is kind of a ... very strange and scary oh yeah yeah the some of the the there is a very wonderful advertisement from a television set in Nineteen thirty four\nCalled the clue television company and they actually ate it says how they advertise their television this is what they said\nThe dreams of witches have come true oh my God\nSo they they saw this thing this new device that the way to capture the public's imagination about buying this thing was not to try to make it less weird\nBut to increase its sense of being connected to some supernatural dream that we once had that we could communicate in this way over the ether right [noise]\nUm and so the the fact that you know week that we used to call those the after effects on TV you know in the when we were used to watch ... VHS stations with an antenna\nWe used to call those dose right so even the way in which we think about the television metaphorically is is filled to the brim right with these supernatural on a cult metaphors and I think that that's really important I think even when we\nTalk about technology for not believers and even if we're just using it we still use these this language to try to make sense of it\nAnd I remember those days to not that this has anything to do with our discussion tonight but a ... radios televisions were built into very heavy ... remember those\nOh my gosh yeah absolutely yep\n... my dad had an old silk on radio and this thing's must have been about four feet tall and you know where it was it was in case in this beautiful piece of wouldn't form richer and had silicone written across it\nUh it ... it was it was a piece of art in the same way our TVs in in the stereotypes that they started coming out with\nThe Chinese are meant to be central pieces of our home right and so you can imagine this thing the centerpiece of our home and then a movie like pulp that guy's comes out it only makes sense that this is how the spirits would come into our lives is through the TV\nAre you a hundred percent convinced Peter that the other side exists\nI'm not a hundred per cent convinced about anything so I you know I live in a very limited\nI like more than anything and what I liked about is about technology is that I really believe that these ambiguous states\nAre in chanting states that when somebody tries to convince me something as a hundred percent true I tend to be a lot more skeptical as somebody who just wants to share an interesting experience with me\nGet into your time machine and tell me what you think things will be like fifty years from now with regards to try to communicate with the other side\n[laughter] well let's talk more about um maybe it's not that we will communicate with the other side but we will have transcended to the other side by use of\nArtificial intelligence uploading our consciousness to computers\nFor more information called me too oh wait for two three ... three foot bound or observation navigator foundation and find a whole

tell you about a strange and sent them than with a a CD player or I go ahead what happened was I was writing a one block past where my son used to work and and in between the songs on the CD is about five seven seconds\nAnd uh all of a sudden I hear a young boy\nSay don't drive that way no one no one has\nAny access to my CDs my anything and I'm looking around all of a thing where it's coming from

FM or whatever we say this CD\nAlright it's pretty pretty soon we'll be popping up on podcasts Peter\n[laughter] that's right exactly want those to the whole range of electronic\nPatricia weren't using radios they were using white noise they were using just a quiet room with a microphone it was it wasn't so much about that that the vice itself it was the fact that they it was a electronic media it was making this possible some record of all media whether it was a tape\n'em or less case a CD\nWell in one one of the things I think that is very intriguing about all of this is that some people do not react to that little angels city now their shoulder whispering in their ear telling them don't do this or go here go straight stop\nYou have to be able to determine when to do these things right mhm because if you don't you could miss a great opportunity where you could get killed or something like that and put out\nAbsolutely and uh do you know maybe in some ways and and I don't mean to diminish anybody's experience but maybe you know maybe sometimes we project\nThe things from within ourselves on to the media you know maybe it's not the spirit world communicating to us with the with the um radio or what the tape player maybe it's our own unconscious our own spirits that are trying to communicate something to us that we need to hear\nWhen you started writing the book strange frequencies was easy or difficult for you to get it started\n[noise] well at part of the problem for me was is that each one of the subjects that I took up there's been you know decades of research and books about them so\nWhat I Would have to try to figure out a way to do is take all this material and and turned it into what I think I Hope is interesting stories about these these specific things I mean the history of there's some wonderful books about the history of spare photography\nBut I wanted to specifically orient my story around Shannon's work and doing so take up you know some of the important background information\nBut yes it ... it was difficult than I have to say and and you know I'm sure that you understand is that\nNo matter how you want to approach the subjects whether you want to approach them to the skeptic or as a full on believer or the way that I liked to approach them more as a journalist and historian\nThat people are worried when you bring up or it's like supernatural are caught they don't know if you're going to try to exploit them or make fun of them or\nIf you're coming at it from a from a way that they feel is is not rational enough you know and so just the idea that I wanted to work with the subjects that all poses problems sometimes when I'm asking to interview somebody and they're a little bit mistrust my intentions might be\nWell in a lot of people Peter when they hear the word a cult thing because it's sickness sport double backlash yeah and it really is we're going to come back with final phone calls in a moment
