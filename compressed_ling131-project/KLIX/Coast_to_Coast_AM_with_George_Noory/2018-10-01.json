[noise]\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal lead train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get outstanding training they're smart people they understand what should be done\nAnd I asked for a list of missing people well they came back and they said they don't carry any list and they don't have any of us a missing people in their parks and jurisdictions and uh we talked about it and it had to be a semantics issues ... refiled and they came back and had tourney called the Simon said well why do you want this information\nAnd explain to him I said hey you can't ask that as a determining factor in for you and they said oh we're not we're not saying we are going to use it to determine we just want to know why you want it and I said well research and then it came back and he said well we don't have any of us missing people\nI said well you have two hundred and eighty three parks monuments the patrol and you have a lot of police officers and then you have special agents that are to the detectives\nSo somebody must be keep it a list that each individual location or a cumulative list at headquarters to understand what's happening and it's only politically correct if somebody calls in and wants to know the status of the case how you ever going to find it\nAnd said no we don't have any less so years ago somebody said well they are just file a request and see how many rules of toilet paper it Yosemite National park I bet they have that inventory list\n[laughter] and of course they would but as it happened they came back and I said well I'm a printed author so I Want to use my authors status\nAs an exclusion for fees and get you to accumulate that list for me a couple of weeks later they came back and they said well your books earning enough libraries to qualify Lucian of such qualifiers just some are broken\nA couple of weeks later they came back and they said well your books aren't enough libraries to qualify Lucian of such qualifiers just some arbitrary thing they said\nAnd then I said okay well why don't you just tell me how much it's going to cost me for you to put together the lists and want to list from Yosemite and I want to was from the national Park Service\nAnd they said well it's going to be thirty four thousand for the list from Yosemite and one point four million from the list from the entire system and I can't tell you how many people since I first said that years ago have tried to go at the Park Service and get it but nobody's ever been successful in getting to us from their entire system because they still say they don't have it\nAnd I've done interviews on other stations were\nHosts have said Dave I'll say it right now we will buy a laptop computer with the excel spreadsheets\nAnd we'll put a clip boards at every park and every jurisdiction they have\nAnd let them start accumulating the list and they could hire an intern during the summer that can screen the monthly reports to come in the Park Service that have these and they could start from scratch doing it now of course they they wouldn't even respond and wouldn't even acknowledge it\nBut as you've stated in many others after you nobody believes them they say that the list exists\nWell a ... if they're going to charge one point four million more than a list exists um you know it it's it's pretty clear they don't want to cooperate on this that they don't want to pay more attention to be drawn to it and um it's a night we're going to explore maybe some of the reasons behind it\nUp for those who have not heard your previous interviews let's let's get the ... points of the cases that jumped out at you that make it into your books the kinds of things that you look for\nSome people need to understand that if you read the hundred search and rescue reports law enforcement reports on missing people you're not going to get a lot when you read a thousand certain things start jumping out at you\nAnd when I went through my third three hundred four hundred and five hundred read reports start making piles in my office of certain things\nAnd after you hit four five six thousand then things really start to delineate out one thing that's about a Ninety nine percent hit rate on the cases I write about is when they bring in canine search and rescue they canines can't find a scent and they can't track the person down\nNow someone who worked in a canine unit on the SWAT Team for a number of years our dogs had about a Ninety nine percent capture rate\nAnd probably the reason why is that our dog's trained ten hours a week and it's directly a relationship between the amount of hours you trained with a dog and how effective they are going to be [noise]\nAnd there's a lot of people out there don't have the time the train a dog a lot there might be a lot of great dogs out there who just cannot find a cent maybe the scent isn't there\nI've had reports where the dogs are brought to the scent location where the person was last seen they walk a foot they turn in a circle and they sit down or they laid out it's like they don't want to search or they have no interest\nSo that's a big one at the time the person disappears or shortly thereafter there's a major weather change weather event if\nThe victim is located they're located in an area that's been previously searched sometimes hundreds of times the time of the disappearance high high percentage of the time is three four five PM\nMany of the victims have some type of disability illness or congenital abnormality\nOr if the victim is found and they're able to talk they have no memory or they can't explain what\nEr plays a key role in this is the first thing disappears very near water or they're found in or near water boulders and granted play a big role if it's in an area where these exist meaning the number one geographical cluster of missing people anywhere in the world she was Seventy national park\nWell that's probably the biggest conglomeration of granted anywhere in the world but granted plays much more of a role as I've explained and many of the books [noise]\nThere's a location in the event called the point of separation you're walking down the trail with your friends your loved one and they walk ahead of you you fall behind them at that point of separation something happens\nAnd that's where things go awry and I can't explain it but I can tell you that in interviewing dozens and dozens and dozens of people and you read these things in the report that's when it happens\nIt's almost like something's watching and when you split off from a group or a family that's when they move in\nYeah [noise] equipment malfunction and this is a this one is not in huge numbers but it's enough to bother me and I've written about it and prior books\nThere was an abnormal number of aircraft crashes in conjunction with these searches and then people talk about other equipment there are other things malfunctioning in conjunction with this [noise]\nAnd then the last one is I've written about many many highly intellectual people that have vanished\nThe probably the one that's gotten the most notoriety is I've written about physicists of a German heritage that have disappeared I'm Talking about us in German but our German ancestry that have disappeared and have never been found\nIt's very strange I cannot find a physicist that have disappeared that isn't German so strange that is but there's also a lot of a\nMedical professionals that have disappeared physicians and things so when when you think about people that just disappear in the woods no I'm not I'm not really interested in that\nInterested in this specific profile that I just laid out here\nAnd there's a this geographical clustering that I figured out why after I started putting Ken's in a U.S map when I started to track this years ago\nAnd right now we're sitting at sixty geographical clusters in North America us and Canada now there are other locations in eleven other countries of the world\nWhere these this exact same sort of things happening a lot of times I found it on my own but many times after the book started to get rolling and people are different parts of the world read them\nAnd say hey you know I live in New Zealand we've had a whole series of these very true Australia same thing you case same thing Canada same thing in Spain in the ... I mean you'd be surprised how this fits into this little niche\nUm\nAnd it's I think you I read that it's eleven hundred thirty five cases and it's men to women is a four to one ratio correct\nMy any idea why why so many more men than women maybe more men are out in the outdoors in out there alone\nYeah yeah I I think that could be one thing maybe men take more risks than women I guess\nWe're talking with David ... about his latest work missing for one one land air water coming up in the next segment we're going to get into some specific cases and uh as I said before they will raise the hair on the back of your neck and the Beatles they ended the break we'll be right back\nSo I Try to tell us that people don't trust you to really don't even listen to him a ... missing project site that's the only real site that you're going to get off information from\nAll right um talk for a moment about search and rescue parameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that huge zero in on I mean there are metrics there are there's data\nUm for search and rescue 'em uh how how they proceed and and I are huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate and the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports\nNow find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased they're released the report most times times they walk there is a case from eighty six\nI'm an era the girl's name was Eris she was missing from Yosemite and I've tried to get that case ten times and I know nobody looked at the case in Twenty years and especially if they're told me I'll never see that case it's a standard missing persons case\nThere is no suspect there's no crime why can't I see it um and just so people understand in law enforcement missing people is one of the few things that they handled it isn't criminal\nUh everything else in the law enforcement world it's criminal oriented\nAnd missing people it's not against fraud go missing if you want\nUh everything else in the law enforcement world is criminal oriented\nAnd missing people it's not against fraud go missing if you want to fall out of society and you can and it's handled entirely different than a criminal investigation there's no prosecution that's gonna emanates from these cases that are Thirty years old that disappeared in the middle years somebody\nWith these people harbor it like there is some secret in there that they don't want you to see\nAnd a lotta times I'll grant you that the reports are horrific they don't have much data they don't have much information other times they are really really good and I don't understand why there and want us to see it but there's this I called territorial behavior\nAnd many of the times they won't grant you access\nNow in the state of Washington they have a mandatory disclosure law that reports have to be disposed to the public tunnel crust\nColorado has that laws well sort of like the freedom of Information Act a law\nBut many states don't and law enforcement knows that and they won't give up anything um so the first thing is you got to get these reports to really see what is there because you really can't trust I'm Sorry to say this George you can't trust the media\nBecause I Would say eighty percent of the time when I finally get a copy of the report the news reports are totally completely wrong compared to what law enforcement said happened and I like to think back thirty\nYears ago forty years ago when there were reporters that really dug deep and got to the heart of the story and maybe today they can't spend the time to do it and so there's this superficial job with collecting information because it's really not too good these days\nWell I Would think that um you know reporters just regular beat reporters who get assigned\nTo go out and cover a missing persons case you know like outside of Las Vegas and then a couple that you and I've talked about before it's not something they cover all the time so they just start to law enforcement if there's a law enforcement authority the person in charge of the of the scene I'm who tells you specifics here the details\nUm you know there's not many ways to take it further are you you just heard of them you give them the benefit of the doubt not realizing that maybe they'd really don't want to tell the whole story of what's going on 'cause it's too weird to explain you know makes me wonder about the national Park Service whether\nThey don't want to give you this information because they don't want to scare people away from the parks or they don't want to give me the information because they have in a general idea about what's going on and they don't want to uh you know don't want to have to answer questions about what do you think\nI think that the people the Fort Wayne people that you see when you go into the parks heart and soul the best of people in the world those rangers that are guiding you in the park and helping you and talking to you about nature those people have no idea what's going on\nIt's the people at the top tier in the government that are controlling really what's disseminated and how it's dispersed and communicated\nAnd it's those individuals that have this they exude this belief that it's their stuff it's not yours and you're not going to get it and I don't understand it I Can't explain it\nAnd every once in awhile through a backdoor way I'll get it anyhow I mean sometimes I'll get the reports when a sheriff's office help on a search and they had some of the report from the national Park Service as well and mistakenly they just sent me everything", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "01"}
