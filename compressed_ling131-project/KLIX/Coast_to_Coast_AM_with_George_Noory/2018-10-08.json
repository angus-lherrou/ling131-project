that she was with the Egyptian prints and that she was going to save herself for him and the next life so you're getting a sex\nAnd this is a reasoning so I asked him to ask her when she was in contact with this guy to ask him what how to say I love you and the chips and\nAnd uh she got very defensive because something inside of a deal that this and to be wouldn't be able to speak to her ... and she would be able to repeat it\nSo impasse like progression that these people are from Egypt or ... whatever why not test them Kim\nI assume this way something very simple and the native language asking what year to live with the name of their addiction with was settled et cetera and what did you find is that if they are in contact with these entities they're very limited\nTo what they can communicate and I think more of it is the imagination of the actual if I could count for and the person under hypnosis and if you look at mathematically\nYou add up all the people that have existed before Nineteen forty more people are just now seven billion than all the people that have been if you out of the Nineteen forty in the past which means how could everybody have\nA second or even a third past life which everyone seems to have when you do these past aggressions\nBy the way it lands on the board is I Love you and Arabic just so you know [laughter] I'm In Georgia have your program I was I I don't think I was the Egyptian prints though you may have been there a base [laughter]\nI Love to go ahead to lead to react to some of that\nYeah I hear what you're saying there ah you know if you do a regular if you put somebody in a regular hypnosis and do a half\nLife what can happen is well a couple of things that might be a wannabe half life like all\nI think I was a Lincoln in the past life you know you get people like that and guess who's going to show up have you know that's right now because the conscious mind Bill Bill\nThings yeah and you know that's one thing that I really want to do was this state a state therapy the sleep hypnosis\nUm because there is no conscious mind and what I'd like to do is um a lot of people to actually learn this and test the waters like what you're saying\nBecause like in a regular hassling progression their questions you really\nAnd test the waters like what you're saying\nBecause like in a regular pass slight progression there are questions you really don't want to ask like you know what is your name where do you live because if you start asking specific questions\nThe analytical mind steps forward and either makes\nThings up or already things you know I was a Lincoln you know or whatever and fills in the gaps so um you know I'm I'm extremely busy but you know maybe somebody can pick up the ball on this thing that I've creative and actually start doing that\nBecause if there is no conscious mind they really should be able to tell you you know where they live what their full name is um maybe like where they graduated um\nWhere they were buried that kinda thing and that would be really really cool to have a bunch of sessions\nStrung together like that and then go and and and then check what the heck was going on um that reminds me of the first school I went through and I'll be brief on the story but I'm the director of that school that of past life\nOn a woman I'm and she gave the name and details of this law office she worked at in uh Chicago and the name of the family all the stuff came through and it all turned out to be correct\nAnd she actually contacted her brother from her past lives and they became friends\nTim when Edgar Casey was in his trench like states was was almost like a hypnotic state\nYeah actually uh the story with Edgar is he had a difficulty with his voice his voice stopped working and she needed that hurt his job he went to a bunch of doctors and they couldn't help 'em out\nSo he ended up going to attempt and it shows and that is actually allows him to speak again and from what I've read about him what he would do is he'd lay down on and on his couch and she would go into like a trainer\nAnd he would basically float up to the ... hashtag record and read the information of whoever was asking him questions and that's kind of how we did it\nMatched up let's go to a Fort Smith Arkansas it's John Stewart on coast to coast John go ahead sir\nHey good morning or my quick question is I show up or from my uh sleep apnea and my question is ah is this something\nWhen I stopped breathing in my sleep is just something that hypnosis can help prevent and who would I contact or you know how do I know a reputable or\nGive them a therapist or how do I get in contact with you\nOh okay well you can contact me through my Web site which is on coast to coast a website\nRight there and let me quickly ask you John are you a are you reading what the sea pac\nI have a bypass machine or with oxygen added to it\nOkay All right go ahead Tim\nYeah to to find someone breath vehicle or to to work with is you'd want someone that's very very good at age regression and that's that's how you fix things so if you came to me what I Would do is I Would ask you when is this\nRussian and that's that's how you fix things so if you came to me what I Would do is I Would ask you when is this the worst and then what I Would do is put you into this status space and then I Would um basically talking to your subconscious\nWe would identify the heart within you that's\nCausing this problem we track it back to where first began which is usually between the ages of zero and seven years old even if you've never had dumped on with until you were forty or fifty usually the problem began in early childhood\nAnd it's kind of like getting in a time machine going back in time and you basically how the child we're we're the problem started so I Would first\nDo that and we would fix that then it causes your spirit guy and I find out hey what what's going on with this what this breathing problems to see if it's related the karma of past life\nOr you signed up for it and then I had asked the spirit guide you know can you can you go ahead and and ah you know fix this I don't ask like that but basically I Would ask them to fix that\nThen I Would do some a direct suggestion and when you're in that state a state it's like direct suggestion on steroids because what I say is basically fact so when ever gets the worst I Would now\nFlipped the meaning and say well you'll find that you know between whatever three and four AM you're breathing easily in fact that's the easiest you ever worry and and uh basically very quickly like as little as ... session boom done deal\nI Love it blitz we've only got about a minute and a half left before the break or Tim but as a people want to learn how to be a hypnosis test how long does it take\nWell you can you kinda learn rather quickly to get much chance however it really takes a lot of sessions inexperienced to become good at it or\nI'd say for me it took me about five hundred sessions before I felt comfortable and and I was doing well um you know this new this new process I have is not like that you don't you don't need a background and hypnosis or anything like that\nBut you know to feel comfortable to to you know 'cause everybody's different and you you never know what you're going to get hit with you never know how someone is going to to to to be the only in a session you know some people are gonna think through everything and you got to deal with that for other people come in and they're really Neal fearful\nOf the process so you have to deal with that\nAnd there was a lot of different techniques like age regression parts therapy timeline therapy ... therapies they have to learn all of that so um you know it it takes a little while basically\nOne of the true toss okay well you stick with us we're going to come back and just a moment fast night tonight we're going to take final phone calls here with him markedly as we talked about hypnotism this is fascinating we'll be\nBack ghost inside the new version of that goes to ... am Abu ... bone and know Android ... listen live on demand anywhere the Nissan good acoustical stadium dot com and downloaded today\nEntering the realm of a hypnosis and the subconscious mind delivering information that he might have been programmed to forget not by or sound\nOr you know not by um anything that may have happened on earth but speaking in terms of uh abduction\n... okay that's a good question\nYou know 'cause some people get hypnotized so that they can remember a southern a nation that they've then you know take it\nAnd then they get hypnotized and seven hundred horrible or from you know I think it's all part of a bigger plan but what do you feel like are we going to remember this event or 'cause I kinda think ...\n... and then [noise] ice and stuff out but I'm a little scared [noise] should you be afraid of it to him\nA well known you you actually going to go there every day at least a dozen times oh you you don't realize that like I said earlier is just brainwave in your brain wave beat up and slow down so you go there anyway\nAnd I'm I'm not sure if I got the whole question\nWhile he was talking about it you know can you use hypnosis to determine if you've been abducted for example from a some kind of beauty situation\nOh yeah definitely definitely you you you definitely can do that\nExample from a some kind of beauty situation\nOh yeah and you know definitely definitely if you you definitely can do that um you know you you basically just you know find out the details like if you had missing time or you know it was this particular nine\nAnd then you just basically ... the person that and have walked through the nice you know just like regular I mean I Do it all the time you know just regular regression very simple\nHow important is the hip to just to the event that's you're going to undertake I mean because they're good hypnotists new bad ones but the ... is that is that critical\n[laughter] yeah you know traditionally when you work for say have no says\nIt was all in direct suggestion so like you'd be put into hypnosis then the hypnotists would just tell you how good you feel or whatever and then you're done\nSo you do need to find a hypnotists that's not only been trained in regression techniques but have has\nConducted really thousands obsession that that's what I'd be looking for and um you find somebody like that and you can use in my opinion you can fix anything you would want to fix or you could find out anything you want to find out\nWhat's going to Springfield, Illinois Mike Stern on coast to coast time Mike go ahead\nHi jarred Hi Pam payout earlier in the show you were saying that um when you focus when when you focus on that your brain interest or a certain state and I have a seven week kind\nOf leaning to believe that uh that same state yeah with the state that would be most conducive to like catch students learning something a like a reading is laughing or something and are are there any techniques\nThat you can use like exercise your brain and through that state a ...\nThat's a good question and he ... he just made it on this but can you went through that state with ah with your own mind\nOh yeah you definitely can um the more you do hypnosis the better you will get at it I've worked with people that were horrible subjects and I basically I give them a home or as they go listen to this this audio for a couple of weeks and they come back and they're much better\nUm what you can do like in my state of state therapy you what I Do because I in the stall or re induction key word craze\nSo when you were here you know so when you hear the phrase oh you go in to the state of mind instantly\nSo if you want it to apply that to learning which is\nReally a good application for this than what you can do is get tradition what's safe for key word or when I pinch my fingers together like this my eyes close our lax than my eyes hello there and\nBoom venue star studying you know so ... or you can get trained in self hypnosis so for the next hour I'm going to go into self hypnosis while I study and um you fire in that a key word phrase\nOr a finger pinch or something like that and open up your eyes and go ahead and study and the materials actually I think in a whole lot better\nWell it sure does it just sounds like a great way to uh be able to go to college\nThe better you job to do all kinds of things by being able to self hypnotize yourself too\nYeah yeah it's just new can absorb this information actually you know in going back was sleep it now says the person I mentioned Dave el ... and she had heard that in a World War two they had officers that would learn Japanese while they slash\nWow now I don't know how\nTrue or not but that's that's well that's where she got the idea of sleep hypnosis so think of that you know you're going to this heightened awareness day you wake up and you're talking Japanese [laughter]\nLet's go to Chino Hills California Cindy stern goes to goes to the go ahead\nOh gosh they get good guess Tim nice to talk to you I you know everything you're saying sounds right on\nUm I got real sick um had a great job and I got really sick about twelve years ago and I don't know ... and living on Social Security and\nTrying to do my best to to steady on my\nOwn and um did a um\nBiofeedback kind of exercises mhm\nAnd I was getting really good at it you know Tom relaxation and you know I'm just so much like the key phrase you were talking about you know like I\nStart the first words on the tape and they like totally relax [noise]\nYeah yeah and they I um I came out of my body you know [laughter] and it scared me I didn't expect it at all and it scared me in a slam drink back down into my body and now I've been ... I've had this\nIrrational fear about tat happening again and it isn't it prevents me from doing any relaxation deep relaxation and\n... uh-huh I Wonder you know what you could tell me about like the self sabotage I'm connecting on myself [laughter]\nI ah I I really want to get well we'll see what is she doing to herself so\nWell it's you know when when I work with people with a lot of different um challenges it's really all kind of the same and it kind of boils down to ...\nBeer and stress and that's kind of sounds like what's going on with you you know you had that experience and it was a bit\nFearful so now you've got the guard up you know and what if that happens again kind\nOf thing so um you know again like if I was working with you we could we could just re condition that and so you don't have the fear that any longer um so to get over that I Would say\nYou know working with us you know just I mean really quick like like one session quick\nYou can really change the emotion in your perception about that ah that out of body experience that you had so I I Would suggest that you do that\nUm you know obviously there are books out there that ah that that tell you to give yourself like suggest like waking suggestions and you'll keep repeating it like a million times\nAnd that does work if you put a lot of time and effort into it but um that's what I Would do if I ... I Would find such as much as that\nAnd you tell them that fear that you have because you really enjoy relaxing and you know very quickly like like like I said one session will quickly and you'll be relaxed again and be able to do that again\nDo the spirit guide to tell you about the future too\nYou know I haven't asked them to be honest with you but one thing that you can also do which I didn't mention you know everybody talks about past scifri Russians going back in time but you can apply the exact\nSame thing and you can go into the future you can grow grass I had a session to me like that

as we talk about shovel things including the cycle man the him which was popularized by or different of ramen moody the originator of the term\nNear death experience and let us bring in Joshua pie worn right now hello there Mr Warren\nHey George I am so excited to be on the program tonight it's Halloween the event oh I Love it\nOr we're going to dig into this extremely creepy thing that's like a man you mirror I also have an update for you about time warps in UFOs\nOr later on we are going to give away from free tickets to my big event in Los Angeles this Saturday and there's a lot going on tonight so I'm pretty pumped to be with you\nThe way I'm bummed 'cause I got to be in Denver taping some beyond belief shows on Saturday and Sunday I'm going to miss your event but at least the spirit of me will be with you OK\nWell you know what when people say that to me it means something so thank you\nYou got that aren't the cycle man the of it's a small enclosed area set up with a chair dim lighting the mirror is angle so you don't reflect anything but darkness it's intended to communicate with spirits the dead have you tried using one of these things\nIn the darkness it's intended to communicate with spirits the dead have you tried using one of these things\nOh yes Oh yes as a matter of fact a doctor Raymond Moody as a friend of mine and I even invited him to western North Carolina years ago to train me\nAnd the number of other people in person in the Sacramento him technique um and it it is really however George began with me when I was a teenager\nBecause I started writing articles about ghosts and spooky things when I was quite quite young for the or a local newspaper and I found again and again when I Would go into a haunted place\nSomeone would take me into a room and said this is the most haunted room and I would look around and see two mirrors facing each other [noise]\nUh it got to the point where I Would go to a supposedly haunted house and say to the owner don't even tell me what the haunted room is let's see if I can figure it out and walk around and I'd find a room that had reflections like that\nAnd there's something about mirrors that magnifies ghostly and spiritual and often creepy phenomena um there are a number of possible explanations for this for one thing when you have two mirrors facing each other and you look at the reflection it just looks like an infant a tunnel\nRight like it goes on and on and on forever\nAbsolutely it's a reflection within a reflection with and now what is light light is electromagnetic energy and so it may be that we're creating some kind of an infinite tunnel of light which operates has some sort of a portal [noise]\nThat these beings that have some electromagnetic connection can sort of travel through to go in and out of our realm and that's pretty far out there and I know that but when you look at a mirror [noise]\nUm there's a similar phenomenon going on because we don't know about consciousness is and when you look at a near what you're doing is you're seeing yourself and so it's almost like you're creating an infinite tunnel of consciousness there\nAnd it may be that this helps to facilitate the passage of the spirits into our dimension\nOf course ancient people used to cry by staring into reflective things whether it be just a a a glass of water or a bowl of water or a creek highly polished stone\nBut there's something about this idea that when you take a reflective of substance and you gaze on it and you go into a meditative state\nThen if your intention is to have a paranormal experience\nYou have an experience Georgian and then I Want everybody to understand this I'm not talking about some kind of a little illusion\nLike oh you see something spooky that shows up in the mirror or you just get some kind of a dream like trance like state known them when you do this properly and that's what Dr moody has studied how to do this properly\nWhen you perfect this you will actually have the experience of a full bodied tangible three dimensional\nSeemingly Corp portrayal figure that will appear right in front of your head to toe\nAnd this being can come up to you and not only speak to you but touch and so the idea here is that if you know how to use this technique and it's important to you and you go in there with a purpose\nYou can create that experience for yourself and that will be your reality\nHow do you get rid of the spirit if you want to go back in what happens\nWell fortunately most of the time when people go into a truly well designed\nPsycho mantey and they're going in there with a mission\nThey usually want to contact someone that they love who has passed on and there's a preparation for that so if you were to go to somebody like Dr moody and say well I Want to contact my deceased mother\nThen he would take you through a period of time that could be days where he just talks to you about memories of your mother and and says you know grab whatever artifacts that you may be able to find that reminds you of her and he pictures\nAnd he really talks you extensively through this whole process of remembering her\nAnd so then when you go in there your mind is charged with that intention and ah so that is what it dramatically increases the chances of your mother coming through\nNow when this becomes very scary as when you have people who experiment or you know people talk about like I Know just about enough to get me in trouble or that one thing you know you have people who go in there\nAnd they just say I don't care I just want to see something and when you go in there with that attitude\nThat's a ... you you will love you know you get what you ask for right I just want to see something and if you want to if you go into these situations and it's very simple to create a cycle Mandy\nBut you're convinced they work\nOh they work they definitely weren't they weren't in fact uh over the years I've done many experiments where it was set up a camera to see if we can record the experience and sometimes we can't record what happens but it's very real for the person who's sitting there and the chair\nAnd so the basic thing you need is a big mirror on the wall of a dimly lit room with a chair in front of\nIt I'm not that old saying mirror mirror on the wall I Wonder if that has anything to do with it\nAnd bloody Mary and blood you know all that kind of stuff yeah I think we ... the odd thing is you're not supposed to position the mirror directly in front of you so you can directly see your own face\nYou put it slightly above Iowa level usually have something like a candle or little nowadays LAPD laugh in the background and maybe some white noise I Love playing white noise it helps a lot with the and I've taken probably ah you know close to two hundred people through Sacramento him experience\nAnd I would say that a lot of people ... it is a lot of people yeah I I started doing this a long time ago even before I met Dr moody and a three quarters of them easily I almost want to say a hundred percent\nBut I always am you know worried about or maybe I'm forgetting one or two incidents but almost a hundred percent of the the people had some kind of a paranormal experience they couldn't explain and about half of them actually had\nThe full on draft dramatic Josh stay with us we'll come back and talk about time warps in some UFOs here's our first emerging artists Paul Ruben from Santa Barbara California with us on cold winter when\nWhen we\nAnd I know that that that sounds a bit suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have this new piece of technology I'm going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said where of course that plays turned out to be ... Las Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada\nAnd um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas that area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO hot spots in the state were incredible footage has been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred\nAnd so uh I have of course continued now going around and taking measurements trying to see if I can or capture something else but in the meantime here's what I Would like to share with your George and um I mentioned this to you when we were in Asheville by the way a very cool\nThat you played a a a group from Ashville North Carolina regroup party [laughter]\nYou know ... my home town for for listeners who may not know and uh you know that's where I have my history museum and we do the halted Ashville go stores so very very fitting to play or an Ashville group [noise]\nBut anyway George in Ashville I mentioned this to you but it's gotten even more intriguing\nThere is a timeline that I Would like to know share with you in the audience that I think perhaps helps to put my discovery in context okay um and\nI Want everybody listening be the judge okay am I just being paranoid as all this just coincidence or are we just seeing different facets of a larger project that is\nBeing paranoid is all this just coincidence or are we just seeing different facets of a larger project that as sort of a being slowly revealed or exposed however you want to view it\nThen of course I never believe in coincidence Josh\nWell you and I have that in common for sure I agree entirely to believe and that would mean\nYou'd believe there could be in effect without a cause and that just doesn't make sense does it ... new so All right let's start with December of twenty Seventeen this is something that's been talked about many times on coast to coast am of course the Pentagon finally announced that that that they were working on this thing\nA back engineering UFO debris in the state of Nevada\nAh the advanced aerospace threat identification program called a tip so that was a big deal there should have been covered even more by the mainstream media\nBut it was not it was it was not\nNo I mean it was broken by the New York times so I mean there was plenty of ample opportunity for everybody to really get the scoop\nUh and this was a program that was a course headed up by Senator Harry Reid who was it was the senator from Nevada\nSenate majority leader and it involves a contract that was primarily given to Robert Bigelow aerospace who has his operation here in Nevada to keep that in mind\nUh okay so now let's move up to June of twenty Eighteen of this year in early June NASA announced they found quote complex organic material on Mars and grow up [noise]\nNow later in the month of June to be precise on June Eighteenth of two thousand Eighteen I discovered this time warp and which was the product of me being the first investigator to take this technology out into the field and use it\nThat night George as I was in my very remote motel room out in the middle of nowhere a winding down out in the middle of the desert I turn on the news and solve the very night\nThat I discovered this time warp President Trump announced the creation of the space force so here I Am next to Harry fifty one and I get that news that was pretty intriguing that was in a memorable night [noise]\nUh and then we moved to July on July twenty fifth now NASA announced that there is an underground lake on Mars and also right around that same time George Jeanette whom we all know well and love who is of course a journalist here in the state of\nNevada and a good one\nHe is the best uh he released this incredible mind boggling letter that Senator Harry Reid wrote to the department of defense in June of two thousand nine if any of your audience members have not read this letter I just want to point out a few key key parts of it\nThis is a letter where Senator Reid is saying we need more stringent security because of what we've discovered by ... this advanced aerospace you know a project\nAnd and I've got it in front of me and he says much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive unconventional aerospace related findings\nHe goes on to say given the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involving spaceflight weapons communications and propose and the standard management and safeguarding for classified information or not sufficient\nHe goes on to say even more and this is the one that really gets me associated exotic knowledge of that ... that ... what do you think that means folks associated exotic technologies likely involve extreme\nNow the ... that ... that ... what do you think that means folks associated exotic technologies likely involve extremely sophisticated concepts within the world of quantum mechanics nuclear science electromagnetic theory ... and thermodynamics\nGiven that all of these have the potential to be used with catastrophic effects by adversaries\nAn unusually high degree of operational security is required let me pause for a second here so he said in this letter which is a validated it's been verified live independently verified it with my own sources here in Las Vegas [noise]\nHe's saying George we have discovered an exotic technology that's going to affect all these things but we have to make sure our adversaries don't\nGet don't get it that's why we need we need to get it before they do and that's what he's saying\nSo what he's saying is that didn't come from them new so if you discovered something that has that impact that didn't come from your adversaries and you call it exotic where could have possibly come from\nUm I also want to just mention here briefly a you know there is a an appendix to Des where they go down a list of some of the topics\nThat have been a officially explored with this project and some of these topics this thirty eight of them\nAre one is a advanced space propulsion a invisibility or cloaking wormholes in space time gravity wave communication worked drives brain machine interface a laser weapons quantum entanglement communication ultra capacitors\nAnd my favorite one is number thirty eight redacted so it's like whoa you're putting all this incredible material out there with the topic and the scientist and the institution a scientist as with and yet still there's one that's redacted so anyway getting back to the timeline\nSo that also came out right around the same time and uh you know ... with which July twenty fifth All right so that said now we move up to August\nAugust of twenty eight team right around the time when you were doing your event in Asheville George ... the mainstream media announced that the air force has been doing experiments dropping a new kind of weaponry\nWhich is very similar to a type of earth penetrating nuclear gravity bomb and they've been experimenting with these things and dropping with them and doing God Knows what else\nFrom a beach to add Neal is air force base which happened to be right beside the area where I got my anomaly and furthermore guests when they were doing their experiments\nJune of two thousand Eighteen when I got my anomaly and when the president announced the creation of the space force\nSo that said I Am of the impression here\nThat there is some kind of amazing technology that is being utilized to form some kind of weaponry that as being tested around here and I just so happened to stumble into a spot where they were testing their their their stuff out\nAnd it but you see the thing is it doesn't matter because\nThey're humans are not supposed to have technology that will manipulate space time but it looks like they might and I want everybody to know if you doubt when

chiding him and ah I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there\nThey were taking him out and cathartic Lee releasing their pent up frustrations\nOn him and it was when the shock wave of curses and bad luck started hitting all those people that suddenly word began to spread like okay this dog here and you know he\nWas fighting back\nYeah and it's because of that that um he I Believe that was so famous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how you have to be respectful people now take it seriously\nAnd I don't think that there are nearly as many people who are going to see him now who are having bad experiences or even paranormal experiences because he seems to be at peace\nAnd I think it's in part thanks to people like you George you know you inspired me and gave me the opportunity to go down there to Key West and uh almost ten years ago\nAnd to do live reports and to really dig into this and I you may or may not recall George I actually called into the show\nI realized you know live it was just me and Robert and the whole place just the two of us was it creepy yes it is great [laughter]\nDollar I mean just anybody who's never seen Robert that all just go look him up you know on the just type in Robert that all Google and you know you can see he's a creepy looking guy\nBut from the moment I got there I was respectful I ask because prevention if you go to my Web site you can click around and find some of my video that I shot you know from the moment that I actually met Robert The how to do and I said look I'm Joshua pie Warren\nI have come here to understand you I'm going to report on what I find to a lot of people I'm asking for your permission and blah blah blah\nAnd so I think Robert I got along very well and uh so I think you should also rest assured George that you played a big role probably and helping to educate people\nThat there is something bad happens to you if you're disrespectful to this stall and if you're nice to the ... then you have nothing to worry about so I think he is much happier so to speak than ever\nNow originally to win the dome was first given to the family years ago didn't people see the dome like in the window or running back and forth and weird stuff like that\nWell you know the the weirdest thing creepy is thing about the story of Robert The haunted Dahl is that\nHe was given to a young boy a Robert Eugene auto which everybody called Eugene ore gene and gene became obsessed with this dog when gene was only like maybe four or five years old\nAnd then Jean grew up to be a very successful man a ... had a wife that everybody loves had a nice big house but it ...\nYou can with the dog I mean are you might think back when you were a kid maybe there is some point that was special to you and then there came a point when it just sort of drifted away that never happened for gene auto he kept this\nThis uh ... uh till the end of his life and treated it in many cases they say if you talk to the locals better than he treated his wife I mean\nHow little special furniture made for him and gave him a little special room so are his room was ... moved to the attic at at the wife's insistence but you know they claim that when finally Eugene died\nA and his wife moved out of the house and the house sat there abandoned for quite a few years waiting for a fire to come along and I actually did get to talk to some of the caretakers who ah worked in the house during that period of time who told me about just chilling experiences\nBut nonetheless people who were in the community said at night you could sometimes walk outside the windows and you look up by new new\nThat house was Emory one new there ever read see little Robert de do running around the house George Back and forth in front of the windows I Love that\nNext time let's go to Tyler in Asheville North Carolina first time calling for Tyler Tyler welcome to the program hey how you doing good good to be with us\nSo ah Joshua I was a up on the blue ridge parkway about fourteen years ago it was around uh August\nAnd I spirit who crazy life\nUm to make it to make a brief I was up a around like black ball some area me and my friends were just hanging out up there and then all of a sudden like this huge deep dark fog just kind of swept in in the afternoon like we're watching the sun to all of a sudden\nIt's super thick fog just sat and there were like six to eight what looked to be like jeep headlights\nOff in the distance thought nothing of it about five to ten minutes later they started heading writer at like right at us we've got to thinking about it we're at and overlook there was no way it could have been like jeeps or anything\nWe started watching them in like this belief at this point they get right upon us about two hundred feet away and then they dislike broke apart and just started like bugs and all around and we took off\nUm come to find like for two years I thought I was crazy me and my two friends ... what the heck was that\nWhat's going on out that way Josh\n... it was it was some wild stuff and then uh\nAbout a year or two later my my buddy send me a link it might have been from your website or something talking about it and uh it just like connected the dots of I've been really trying to contact you learn not trying but you know willing to talk to you for about twelve years now to just see what you think about it\nWhat is that Josh\nWell it's highly thank you for that call always good to talk to a fellow Asheville in another tar hill and um you know Ryan in North Carolina you know everybody of course focuses on brown mountains or the brown mountain lights because the brown mountain lights are the most famous example\nYou talked about them before Josh\nOf of this strange phenomenon where you have these balls of life that appear but actually this is widespread this goes beyond brown mountain\nThis goes all over as Tyler was saying the blue Ridge Mountains and ah you know the which is of course part of the Appalachian chain Lena leading over to the great Smoky Mountains there are all kinds of spots where these ...\nUm I Believe that [noise] if you get me if you if you really want to get the scoop on this you can download a free PDF about it if you go to brown mountain whites dot com\nBut basically an eye on that website but um but what I can tell you is that there are places on earth that produce an incredible amount of natural energy\nAnd that that energy has as a byproduct a bunch of paranormal activity that spins off so you get more ... ... people seeing UFOs time flips scripted all that kinda stuff but\nIn its role as form it's almost like Marie idioms on planet earth that acupuncture is Mike compare it to the Meridian of energy that flow on a human body\nThese are places that conduct electricity\nAnd when that electricity manifest and ... ... in certain angles at certain cliffs it can create what similar to to ball whitening and so you have so much of that which is creepy\nAround west North Carolina but at the same time it almost seems to sometimes have a consciousness and so we're still uncertain as to whether or not these ball the white\nAre just merely and simply a raw natural phenomenon like ball lightning or if they might also have some sense of intelligence and ah this is what makes this such a great mystery\nJosh ...

Warner final segment next hour we'll talk about on to the world war two amazing stories Matthew swing will join us\nSo Josh my friend you are one of a kind how did you originally get started in paranormal investigating what was that one catalysts that got you into it\n[noise] oddly enough George it was really an incident that happened before I was born really um\n'cause I come from a large family or my mother is the youngest of ten kids and my dad is one of seven kids while and I both both sides of my family they'd been in the mountains of western North Carolina since the late Seventeen hundreds early Eighteen hundreds [noise]\nUh but there was this one incident that occurred on my mother's side of the family in the great depression or my mother is a mother was named to Virginia Callaway that was her maiden name\nAnd when she was about Thirteen Years old she got a camera as a birthday present which was a pretty big deal back to her family was a little better off than most but\nThat didn't last long they they lost everything in the depression but she lives out in the countryside and one day her father a guy named Jack and her older brother who was in his twenties are named Claude came home from a small game hunting trip and she photograph them\nA holding up their squirrels and rabbits and stuff and when the picture develop my great uncle clog Callaway her older brother did not have a head\nAnd they they knew that was weird but they were not able to understand enough about photography to realize just how weird it was so fast forward one month later\nA clause was sitting on the porch of the house\nAnd he was reading a copy of his favorite publication western magazine old gunslinger tails and uh his father Jack was in the kitchen fixing fixing lunch and they were conversing through an open window and at some point or jak said something to Claude called didn't answer\nAnd when the lunch was ready jak went outside and I'm here has claws magazine lying on the porch but there's no claws and I'm a long story short my great uncle called Calloway was never seen or heard from again\nShe uh get David ladies involved in the ...\nWell yeah well you know it's actually it's not too far from where there is a national uh part these days you know the ... national park area in ... and what's even weirder is that you know they I mean they did everything they got the authorities involved they got you know they were searching the woods and\nUm you know hearing this fellow my great uncle was waiting for his lunch and I'm In the middle of the story and reading a magazine ... how could he have disappeared was he abducted was the rapture the way that he did he get caught up in a space time slip I mean\nWe don't know but but you see it was compounded by the fact that this creepy photograph was taken one month before and when I became an adult I went back to that area and did everything I could to try to find out what had happened and I mean I've verify the whole story with\nElderly people and a historians and but still there's there's no explanation for that\nI mean I've verify the whole story with elderly people and a historians and but still there's there's no explanation for this and and you see this was a big tragedy in my family or they never got over it they never had closure\nAnd I got to grow up sort of seeing the the sensitive wound this created\nAnd it made me realize that some of these mysterious phenomena or they're not just legends or superstition or or old folk tales I mean the the paranormal if you want to call it that there's something very real\nThat we have to take seriously and so that inspired me to go out and sort of try to define fact ah versus fiction and then finally by the time I got into my early twenties\nWas when I really started seeing some bizarre stuff or for myself with my own two wives\nWho were you let's go to the final calls here let's go to Mary in Los Angeles to get things started Hi merry go ahead\nI like her November of ... and I was ... it will I Will\nAlso say yes and how does that relate to how all souls day in Halloween\n[noise] yeah well thank you for your call Mary as a matter of fact um my birthdays October twenty fifth my mother's birthday is November the third the day after yours and my sister's birthday is November the fifth\nAnd I can't tell you how many people I Know who have birthdays around Halloween including Dr Moulder who builds wishing machines his birthday is on Halloween\nAnd I'll just say a ... if you go back nine months that takes you kind of close to Valentine's Day so maybe there's an explanation for why I Know so many people who have birthdays around or you know October [noise]\nBut um as far as your particular question is concerned\nSo the the the basic tradition of Sao on which of course we now call Halloween is built around October thirty first and this is the product of the Catholic Church\nComing into the pagan areas of Europe and trying to dominate them and switch them away from their pagan beliefs into Christianity\nWith their own date well November of ...\nWell they they realize that you know they weren't doing a good job at switching them over to Christianity so instead the Catholic Church tried to sort of work with a pagan and say instead of considering October thirty first\nUm some kind of a pagan holiday you know why don't why don't we kind of a you know sanctify this whole time period\nAnd say that well this is the evening before the spirits of the saints comeback which would be November the first\nAnd so we will say November the first is the Halloween day\nAnd the evening before that is the Halloween evening or Halloween and so then uh they sort of combined the pagan beliefs of Halloween with all saints day on November first\nAnd then of course November second they said well why don't we just not only celebrate saints but just celebrate all the soles of people who have died and so you end up with all souls day\nUh but this is one of those are interesting examples ah it goes back to you know Christmas we're going to be hearing more stories about this in a probably is Christmas approaches where you know the a lot of the patients will go out and worshipped trees you know the evergreen\nHe's about this in a probably is Christmas approaches where\nYou know the a lot of the patients will go out and worshipped tree is you know the evergreen quality of trees and there was there was one of the um the higher ups in the Catholic Church is said look if we go out and we find a bunch of people who were worshipping a tree\nThey pretty much stay to I\nJust like the world has been lifted off your shoulders now your focus is supporting this child\nPatient care is magical\nState

Okinawa they would build an airbase in that air base would bring\nA most of Japan uh easily into the range of their of of the American bombers so what the Japanese did was they spread stories to the civilians\nThat if the Americans invaded they would torture kill and you know God Knows what else ... civilians are enslave them\nScare the living daylights on right\nAbsolutely terrified so when the Americans did\nInvade the uh civilians were would run off of cliffs and commit suicide and then you know that's a documented piece of history\nJust a terrifying uh a story but now it it there are stories a one story in particular that rate of that I wrote about in the book\nA story but now it there are stories a one story in particular that rate of that I wrote about in the book\nIs that a a group of tourists were added peace museum near those cliffs and they were walking in a field near that that museum and they heard the sound of a what they considered and they said it was almost like a herd of of footsteps coming their way and they couldn't see anything\nAnd then they felt a wind pass them and then later heard what they described as cries and screams so that was pretty moving for me\nUm another story from the Pacific he would Jima is is equally um heartbreaking and he would Jima\n... there are literally thousands of Japanese soldiers that were probably buried alive because they were ... they were a in a tunnel system a very intricate\nTunnel system under the island\nAnd um the the entrances caved in or or or the soldiers were actually burned alive or in the tunnels so there's a story that I write about that one\nA Japanese civilian worker claims that every time he gets a call that he has to return to the mainland to any\nUh he gets a knock on the door and he claims that these spirits of these soldiers on wood Jima that want to be repatriated back to the to the mainland and Japan to those are some pretty intense stories\nThat a crop up and it's ... they're certainly not where ah in in this volume middle\nEast what's interesting too mad is that they seem to be so prevalent all over the place something's going on\nYeah that's true and not only are they everywhere that the different one of the amazing aspects of of the world war two supernatural is that the ghost don't even necessarily have to be people because there's actually goes planes that appear especially over England\nAlmost like the flying Dutch man the ship\nYeah absolutely exactly people see these planes\nAnd they're really not there yet this is a ... and I'll tell you a little story from my own family did they hear them too\nWell some do and some do but there's one area or in the United kingdom um [noise] uh it's a northern section of of the u._k. called derby sheer\nAnd it's known as the Bermuda Triangle of um the u._k. it it sounds pretty pastoral sounding so I I don't know why there's such activity\nBut there have been a lot of plane crashes there about fifty planes I think if have crashed in that area and it has quite a reputation but over the years there have been what they called ghost plane flaps so for example in Nineteen eighty five\nA bunch of people a claim to seeing this huge military aircraft flying overhead one couple was\nI'm driving down the highway and they saw this very low flying bomber\nCruising over the highway or and they said that it didn't have any sound whatsoever which was remarkable because it was so big and uh you know I think they described it as a a for prop I'm an engineer to look like a World War two bomb or\nSo of course skeptics believe that it was probably you know ... either a current military plane or possibly a um\nMaybe a a bomb or going to an air show or something like that was what they do what they thought yeah\nYou're right but to counter that a lot of these people that solve this\nAir show or something like that was what they want they thought yeah\nYou're right but to counter that a lot of these people that solve this first of all\nThere didn't seem to be a pattern a flight with with this there didn't seem to be a straight line as you might see with a a a a a regular conventional non spooky aircraft disappeared in different areas throughout that region\nAnd a couple of the people that spotted this\nOne in particular worked uh for a an airfield during World War two a a was a I Believe I'm a somewhat flight mechanics for the for the uh R. E. F.\nSo definitely would have known the difference between let's say a modern I guess like a Hercules aircraft\nAnd something like a B. twenty four or uh Lancaster Bomber and and this person described it either as a Lancaster or is it be twenty four bomber\nSo a pretty peculiar and and there have been other what they called ghost playing flaps a throughout history and I think there was even one as I was writing this book so two thousand Seventeen um pretty interesting\nMathieu did they describe how the planes would disappear how would how how they would leave\nIf\nThe one couple just said that it flew overhead and they thought it was going to crash and I believe they pulled over to see you know see if it did crash or at least to hear it and it just it just kind of disappeared\nJust like that yeah yeah like you want to do a different time warp or something right\nIn and the reason I looked into the these are a ghost planes stories is when I was young my parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and\nSaid that as they were starting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy or you can make it sound went overhead and it just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be Erie\nThat what it was my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well England was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any any stories similar and sure enough it's a\nIt's not that it happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these goes planes to be seen\nI bet they handles hundreds of and we're going to come back

talk a little bit about that tonight\nAs well but tonight right now we're talking about his latest punch in World War two soldiers spirits goes planes in strange synchronous cities\nPearl Harbor is it hostage or not\nIt's extremely hearted according to a lot of the people that go there and uh\nMany of the people tourists people who are interested in history go there uh we'll talk about the feelings they have when they're touring Pearl Harbor especially the the USS Arizona memorial which is essentially a to a mass grave\n'em and it'll tell you what a a moving experiences and again we we think about that idea that somehow the power of that event has etched itself\nInto the time and space around Pearl Harbor and the stories that are have been told about that a famous area are are pretty extensive there's one story of a of a sailor who apparently left\nHis watch on the USS Arizona [noise] ah just briefly and then er during that time where he left the ship it was attacked and and sunk and now there's this story of this poor Lauren looking sailor standing at the uh\nMemorial kind of looking out into the bay where the Arizona now rafts of so that goes story has been told a quite a bit um [noise] excuse me sure\nThere's also a story of a of a a one lady who took a picture just of the memorial and of course uh the waves in the memorial and then when she looked at it there seem to be faces\nIn them into the picture is a very uh in that went on online throughout and not only is the area Pearl Harbor the harbor itself haunted by therapy and goes stories at places like the show field barracks\nAnd hit them airbase areas that were a part of the the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and one place in particular in heck I'm a there was the headquarters building that uh supposedly served as a morgue after the attack and had some two hundred three hundred bodies in it\nAnd the places so haunted they said that they moved to the sea cue desk which is usually inside the building they say now say they post the guards outside of the building because of all the complaints that the soldiers had of\nThis ghostly activity the sound of people running up and down steps to such a degree that are the steps the staircase itself would shake so it's a it's a pretty haunted place\nThe desert Fox rumble or the or the Nazi tens or think leader and some incredible things happened to him to he died in Nineteen forty four mhm but what does he still haunts\nWas that's probably the most interesting\nA story that I found a a when I when I started to research this book because I I did initially look to see if I could find the the ghosts of a lot of famous general's pat and Eisenhower as well as some of them the axis powers or and or when Romney has always been\nKind of a subject of fascination for me so I started to you know try to find if there were any ghost stories about him\nUh I I thought he might be found in North Africa which is where he gained much of his fame as the desert Fox\nMaybe on the shores of Normandy he would be among those many goes that appear in Normandy he was really behind a a architecture the development of the fortifications there are in the constructions of the defenses along with what was considered the their Atlantic Wall\nOr maybe he would be in Germany but I actually found ghost stories about ... in the United states believe it or not\nSo one of the places is mount Hebron cemetery and Winchester, Virginia people claimed to see this a figure a long trench coat or a cap on a looking over the graves and and there are some people who say that he is actually at the\nThe graves or he's seen at the graves of some of patents\nA general patents ancestors and then there's a A N in West Virginia where they claimed that raw will haunt so what's the story behind that there is a story that\nAre between the wars ... along with a few other German generals traveled on a secret trip to America to visit some of the ... the battlefields of the civil war particularly\nThey were looking at the way that Stonewall Jackson maneuver through the Shenandoah Valley\nSo this is why this story that\nAnd we're all more haunts these areas is is around today they think that\nUh he has left his spirit here because he once once visited the site now is there any historical basis for this\nI haven't been able to find any in most historians will tell you that it never had happened that the German generals never came here are people who believe these stories say it was a a secret mission and therefore there would be no historic record that was kind of the interesting one for me\nAnd what about other World War two infamous people do they still show up pawns\nWell there's some really interesting stories uh for me there's there's one that Churchill still haunts a subway in a\nIn a in London that once served as kind of a temporary bomb shelter and and and people have seen his spirit there I found the story that Churchill actually witness to the ghost of Abraham Lincoln in World War two\nTo be fascinating ah he said that he and I hate to lay the imagery on your listeners but\nA according to Churchill he had stepped out of the bathroom completely naked\nIn what's now called the Lincoln Bedroom at the White House and he had traveled to the White House on several occasions to visit with a ... FDR Franklin Delano Roosevelt as well as other uh officials from the American side\nUh he steps out of the the bathroom and there's Abraham Lincoln leaning against the mantle and I think Churchill says something like when Lincoln turns to face him Churchill says something like ah I see you've caught me at a disadvantage Mr President and then a Lincoln fades away so that was kind of\nLincoln probably faded away quickly\nYes I I would've I would've got out there as fast as I could he's Lincoln has gone through enough he didn't need to witness\nNot I'm not a new Winston traditionally ...\nSo there's some other stories about Eisenhower he haunts ah what's called the bullet which is a a train that's on display at the national railroad museum I think that's in in Green Bay Wisconsin or we talked a little bit about the ghosts of Gettysburg and apparently he andme Amy maybe behind some of the haunting Z\nIn the farmhouse that they used to own their\nSo yeah there's a lot of um a famous ghost stories from uh some of the the bigger leaders of uh the most famous leaders of World War two\nEnded these continue these haunting\nYeah they do as a matter of fact uh you know the ... the bullet a I Believe there's the story that some of the stories that I found out about that\nUh were from the Nineteen nineties the two thousands one story is that I'm a custodian who was a vacuuming the carpet in the bowl it ... uh was halfway finished and decided to take a break left lock the door\nOf the the train and uh went to lunch or or have a snack and then when he came back\nThe someone had completed the of vacuuming and he could tell because the lines of the vacuum cleaner were super straight up and down and according to some of the people who knew Eisenhower he was very meticulous\nAnd that's how he insisted on having his the bullet cleaned so that story probably uh not too long ago and you know as we talked about the ghost plane flap they're happening probably even as we speak\nBack in World War two there were actually reports of UFOs they called them food fighters and they were small little disc type objects flying all over the place the pilots\nReports of UFOs they called them food fighters and they were small little disc type objects flying all over the place that pilots reported seen did you come across anything like that\nYeah I actually did a whole section on it because they were so prevalent as you point out\nOn the innovative ways to ... or less\nBeyond the walls of the class\nHow to recognize great things are happening in the\nMoney and you can [noise]\nNews and talk on the radio dishes use radio for change the way oil [noise]\nFlorida is getting ready I'm an Carrick Fox News chocolate tropical storm Michael is moving into the Gulf of Mexico and likely will be a hurricane later today before making landfall Florida governor Rick Scott declaring an emergency Sunday for high risk area as the\nStorm approaches the risk of tornadoes will be greater on the east side of the storm right down tropical storm Michael has fifty mile an hour winds and forecasts move slower and grow stronger make landfall as a category to storm mid week along the north east Gulf Coast a category to store\nThat means the panhandle big band could see went to the next steps excess of one hundred miles per hour\nWind speeds from Michael now at sixty miles per hour as anticipated the number of dead from the September earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia continues to ride the official number now one thousand nine hundred forty four and thousands more remain missing likely still buried in deep mud\nThe newest member of the U.S Supreme Court is getting right to work\nShortly after the Senate confirmed him by fifty to forty eight votes Brett Kavanaugh was headed for the Supreme Court to be sworn in Saturday\nBy chief justice John Roberts and retired Justice Anthony Kennedy a statement\nFrom the Supreme Court says cabinet can participate in the work of the court immediately his first opportunity to hear oral arguments tomorrow a pair of cases on the docket a formal investor ceremony will take place during a special sitting of the court that is not yet been announced on Capitol Hill dirt out Bernadette Fox News\nGas prices up seven cents in the past two weeks ... is with the Lindbergh survey\nRight now the highest in this panel of cities is Los Angeles three eighty two for regular and the low is Houston to fifty eight\nThe average price for regular now to Ninety seven this is Fox News [noise]\nYou know what your favorite part time in the\nNation coming soon going to be the personal ...

I thought wearing costumes\nOf the civil war and their faces and the expressions were just they were extremely so scared they were just awfully awfully worried from their expressions\nAnd the smell was this something that I had to get away from so I went back in\nAnd our guide hot ... and said where have you been and I said I just went in and nine I came out and they said we've been looking for you for the last half hour wow while we are we going to have enough time to watch the filming\nThose costumes are excellent please explain to me how they were able to get that stench that's now hideous now and they all looked at each other and they said there isn't anyone out there\nAre there are a lot of smells associated with some of these on teens man\nThere is a ... of a sense with um with ah some of these haunting sand or for instance\nThe er when ... I'm go story is really focused on uh the smell of a pipe that he allegedly used to smoke in this this haunted in so there there are stories like that there are stories about people getting to a I think in the case of the heck I'm a airbase\nThere's the scent of a rotting corpses that overwhelms people um the interesting thing for the when the caller reminded me that uh [noise] my history professor told me that one of the most sought after um [noise]\nAh articles uh after Gettysburg for the civilians was a kind of um I I think it was I guess you would describe it almost as many drops that they use to put on their nostrils because the the scent was so bad and then you know that story certainly remind them\nWe will be a up the seventies seventh anniversary of Pearl Harbor\nI guess there can't be many soldiers or seeming still left from the Nineteen forty one I mean that that was Seventy seven years ago right and if they were twenties they'd be Ninety seven there might be a few but I don't think there are many are there\nNo I don't think so and it's um it's sad because again that that's why I think the important thing is to make sure that these\nThese stories are preserved and the memory goes on and if this book helps that at all or maybe inspires people to look into um [noise] the the battle of of Pearl Harbor in particular I I think that it's done it's done its job\nRyan in Indianapolis is with us She's still the Rockies good morning bright\nHey George how are you worried hope you are to where I'm at work again is all they are always working my gosh\nWell you know it's good for my four oh one K. my retirement\nPerfect and when you retire you'll still listen to the coast to coast stripe\nOh you you do it you know it play list and I got three things to say All right well I'm I'm a friend of Eric truck driving somewhere in Indiana [laughter] he's a good guy he is a guy if you have your brain your show Indianapolis uh George ... you'd be working on that\nOK number two now a good story that might be something for the show in a later date that is a World War two a bang the USS Indianapolis the sinking of the ... that\nI think we we just did a show on that uh about a month just a couple of weeks ago\nSure on how well you know I felt it was a weekend show a\nMan but there is a good book out I\nMean these were the ... the seemingly ruin the see the sharks were there it was horrible\nYeah yeah twelve hundred men went into the water to ship the ships sunken twelve minutes the twelve hundred men went in the water or know\nOut of twelve hundred men a hundred and eighty eight eight hundred and eighty name went into water three hundred and went down to ship five days later only three hundred and sixteen now because of new research done\nCame out of the water or there's only two survivors left and I believe the next July this coming July will be the last reunion here in Indianapolis because it's so hard for them to get around\nLike you said there are nine oh yeah absolutely guy and we always got to remember the greatest generation that they they sacrificed for us and they did a untold but here I\nI was stationed in Germany are back in aid maybe one eighty three\nI took a day trip which some some ah friends of mine down to back out concentration camp ha ha and you know it was more of a political prisoner camp it wasn't like a extermination camp you know\nLike the ... the mother ones were but we were we were able to take pictures and stuff you know in and when we got there when you as soon as you walk in the gate the pressure on you\nWhich just the norm you could feel it imagine you could feel it but we took pictures you know and then back then you had thirty five millimeter cameras so you had to get you had to get the film developed two weeks later we were going through the pictures that a couple of friends of mine had taken\nAnd just one picture out of the blue in the sequence of pictures was was a kind of blurry but he took it down between\nThe very that are there and in the at the end of the berry you can see these three silhouettes of these three we assumed we were ... they were prisoners you could use either white\nAnd not only works in one way it works in a whole bunch of different ways because it gives me energy niggers me like ...

friend of mine and I even invited him to western North Carolina years ago to train me and a number of other people\nBecome anti um technique um and it it is really however George began with me when I was a teenager because I started writing articles about ghosts and spooky things when I was quite quite young for the or a local newspaper and I found again and again\nWhen I Would go into a haunted place\nSomeone would take me into a room and said this is the most talented room and I would look around and see two mirrors facing each other [noise]\nUh it got to the point where I Would go to a supposedly haunted house and say to the owner don't even tell me what the haunted room is let's see if I can figure it out and walk around and I'd find a room that had reflections like that\nAnd there's something about mirrors that magnifies ghostly and spiritual and often creepy phenomena um there are a number of possible explanations for this for one thing when you have two mirrors facing each other and you look at the reflection it just looks like an infant a tunnel\nRight like it goes on and on and on forever\nAbsolutely it's a reflection within a reflection with and now what is light light as electromagnetic energy and so it may be that we're creating some kind of an infinite tunnel of light which operates has some sort of a portal\nThat these beings that have some electromagnetic connection can sort of travel through to go in and out of our realm and that's pretty far out there and I know that but when you look at a mirror [noise]\nUm there's a similar phenomenon going on because we don't know what consciousness is and when you look at a near what you're doing is you're seeing yourself and so it's almost like you're creating an infinite tunnel of consciousness there\nAnd it may be that this helps to facilitate the passage of the spirits into our dimension\nOf course ancient people used to cry by staring into reflective things whether it be just a a a glass of water or a bowl of water or a creek highly polished stone\nBut there's something about this idea that when you take a reflective of substance you gaze on it and you go into a meditative state\nThen if your intention is to have a paranormal experience\nYou have an experience Georgian and then I Want everybody to understand this I'm not talking about some kind of a little illusion like oh you see something spooky that shows up in the mirror\nOr you just get some kind of a dream like trance like state no no when you do this properly and that's what Dr moody has studied how to do this properly\nWhen you perfect this you will actually have the experience of a full bodied tangible three dimensional\nSeemingly Corp portrayal figure that will appear right in front of you climb head to toe\nAnd this being can come up to you and it's not only speak to you but touch\nAnd so the idea here is that if you know how to use this technique and it's important to you and you go in there with a purpose you can create that experience for yourself and that will be your reality\nHow do you get rid of the spirit if you want to go back in what happens\nWell fortunately most of the time when people go into a truly well designed properly oriented psycho man the ... they're going in there with a mission they usually want to contact someone that they love\nWho has passed on and there's a preparation for that so if you were to go to somebody like Dr moody and say well I Want to contact my deceased mother than he would take you through\nHey is where he just talks to you about memories of your mother and and says you know grab whatever artifacts that you may be able to find the reminds you of her any pictures\nAnd he really talks you extensively through this whole process of remembering her and so then when you go in there your mind is charged with the intention and uh so that is what it dramatically increases the chances of your mother coming through\nNow when this become is very scary as when you have people who experiment or you know people talk about like I Know just about enough to get me in trouble they're throwing things you know you have people who go in there\nAnd they just say I don't care I just want to see something and when you go in there with that attitude\nThat's a ... you you will you know you get what you ask for it right I just want to see something and if you want to if you go into these situations and it's very simple to create a psycho Mandy\nBut you're convinced they work\nOh they work they definitely weren't they weren't in fact uh over the years I've done many experiments where it was set up a camera to see if we can record the experience and sometimes we can't record what happens but it's very real for the person who's sitting there and the chair\nAnd so the basic thing you need is a big mirror on the wall of a dimly lit room with a chair in front of\nIt and I'm not that old saying mirror mirror on the wall I Wonder if that has anything to do with it\nAnd bloody Mary and boy you know all that kind of stuff yeah I think we ... the odd thing is you're not supposed to position the mirror directly in front of you so you can directly see your own face\nYou put a slightly above Iowa level usually have something like a candle or little nowadays LAPD laugh in the background\nAnd maybe some white noise I Love playing white noise it helps a lot with the and I've taken probably ah you know close to two hundred people through Sacramento him experience\nAnd I would say that a lot of people chores or is it is a lot of people yeah I I started doing this a long time ago even before I met Dr moody and a three quarters of them easily I almost want to say a hundred percent\nBut I always am you know worried about or maybe I'm forgetting one or two incidents but almost a hundred percent of the the people had some kind of a paranormal experience they couldn't explain and about half of them actually had the full\nOn Amtrak dramatic Josh stay with us we'll come back and talk about time warps in some UFOs here's our first emerging artists Paul Ruben from Santa Barbara California with a song called winter when\nWho isn't\nBook before I even did it [laughter] and I know that that that sounds a bit suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have this new piece of technology\nI'm going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said we're of course that place turned out to be ... Las Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada\nAnd um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas that area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO hot spots in the state were incredible footage has been shot of UFOs or close encounters have occurred\nAnd so uh I have of course continued now going around and taking measurements trying to see if I can capture something else\nBut in the meantime here's what I Would like to share with your George and um I mentioned this to you when we were in Asheville by the way with very cool that you played a a a group from Ashville North Carolina three group party [laughter]\nYou know ... my home town for for listeners who may not know and uh you know that's where I have my mystery museum but we do the halted Ashville ghost tours so very very fitting declare an Ashville group [noise] but anyway George in Ashville I mentioned this to you but it's gotten even more intriguing\nThere is a timeline that I Would like to know share with you in the audience that I think perhaps helps to put my discovery in context okay um and\nI Want everybody listening be the judge okay am I just being paranoid is all this just incidents or are we just seeing different facets of a larger project that is sort of a being slowly revealed or exposed however you want to hear it\nAnd of course I never believed coincidences Josh\nWell you and I have that in common for sure I agree entirely to believe and that would mean you'd believe there could be\nBelieve in coincidence Josh well you and I have that in common for sure I agree entirely to believe in that would mean you'd believe there could be in effect without a cause and that just doesn't make sense does it Jordan new\nSo All right let's start with December of twenty Seventeen this is something that's been talked about many times on coast to coast am of course the Pentagon finally announced that that that they were working on this thing a back engineering UFO debris in the state of Nevada\nAh the advanced aerospace threat identification program called a tip so that was a big deal there should have been covered even more by the mainstream media\nBut it was not it was not\nNo I mean it was broken by the New York times so I mean there was plenty of ample opportunity for everybody to really get the scoop\nUh and this was a program that was of course headed up by Senator Harry Reid who was it was the senator from Nevada\nSenate majority leader and it involves a contract that was primarily given to Robert Bigelow aerospace who has his operation here in Nevada to keep that in mind\nUh okay so now let's move up to June of twenty Eighteen of this year in early June NASA announced they found quote complex organic material on Mars and grow [noise]\nNow later in the month of June to be precise on June Eighteenth of two thousand Eighteen I discovered this time warp and which was the product of me being the first investigator to take this technology out into the field and use it\nThat night George as I was in my very remote motel room out in the middle of nowhere a winding down out in the middle of the desert I turn on the news and solve the very night\nThat I discovered this time warp President Trump announced the creation of the space force so here I Am next to Harry fifty one and I get that news that was pretty intriguing that was in a memorable night [noise]\nUh and then we moved to July on July twenty fifth now NASA announced that there is an underground lake on Mars and also right around the same time George Jeanette whom we all know well and love who is of course a journalist here in\nThe state of Nevada and they're doing one\nHe is the best uh he released this incredible mind boggling letter that Senator Harry Reid wrote to the department of defense in June of two thousand nine if any of your audience members have not read this letter I just want to point out a few key key parts of it\nThis is a letter where Senator Reid is saying we need more stringent security because of what we've discovered by ... this advanced aerospace you know a project\nAnd and I've got it in front of me and he says much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive unconventional aerospace related findings\nHe goes on to say given the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involving spaceflight weapons communications and propose and the standard management in safeguarding for classified information or not sufficient\nHe goes on to say even more and this is the one that really gets me associated exotic now that ... that ... what do you think that means folks associated exotic technologies\nLikely involve extremely sophisticated concepts within the world of quantum mechanics nuclear science electromagnetic theory ... and thermodynamics\nGiven that all of these have the potential to be used with catastrophic effects by al ...\nAnd physics and thermodynamics given that all of these have the potential to be used with catastrophic effects by adversaries\nAn unusually high degree of operational security is required let me pause for a second here so he said in this letter which is a validated it's been verified live independently verified it with my own sources here in Las Vegas [noise]\nHe's saying George we have discovered an exotic technology that's going to affect all these things but we have to make sure our adversaries don't\nGet don't get it that's why we need we need to get it before they do that's what he's saying\nSo what he's saying is that didn't come from them new so if you discovered something that has that impact that didn't come from your adversaries and you call it exotic where could have possibly come from\nUm I also want to just mention here briefly a you know there is a an appendix to Des where they go down a list of some of the topics\nThat have been a officially explored with this project and some of these topics there's thirty eight of them\nAre one is a advanced space propulsion a invisibility or cloaking wormholes and space time gravity wave communication warped drives brain machine interface a laser weapons quantum entanglement communication ultra capacitors\nAnd my favorite one is number thirty eight redacted so it's like whoa you're putting all this incredible material out there with the topic and the scientists and the institution a scientist as with and yet still there's one that's redacted so anyway getting back to the timeline\nSo that also came out right around the same time and a ... with which July twenty fifth All right so that said now we move up to August\nAugust of twenty eight team right around the time when you were doing your event in Asheville George ... the mainstream media announced that the air force has been doing experiments dropping a new kind of weaponry which is very similar\nTo a type of earth penetrating nuclear gravity bomb and they've been experimenting with these things and dropping with him and doing God Knows what else\nFrom a beach to add Neal is air force base which happened to be right beside the area where I got my anomaly and furthermore guests when they were doing their experiments\nJune of two thousand Eighteen when I got my anomaly and when the president announced the creation of the space force\nSo that said I Am of the impression here\nThat there is some kind of amazing technology that is being utilized to form some kind of weaponry that as being tested around here and I just so happened to stumble into a spot where they were testing their their their stuff out\nAnd it but you see the thing is it doesn't matter because they're humans are not supposed to have technology that will manipulate space time but it looks like they might and I want everybody to

was so famous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how you have to be respectful people now take it seriously\nAnd I don't think that there are nearly as many people who were going to see him now who are having bad experiences or even paranormal experiences because he seems to be at peace\nAnd I think it's in part thanks to people like you George you know you inspired me and gave me the opportunity to go down there to Key West and uh almost ten years ago\nAnd to do live reports and to really dig into this and I you may or may not recall George I actually called

have come here to understand you I'm going to report on what I find to a lot of people I'm asking for your permission and blah blah blah\nAnd so I think Robert I got along very well and uh so I think

nice to the ... then you have nothing to worry about so I think he is much happier so to speak than ever\nKnow originally to win the dome was first given to the family years ago didn't people see the dome like in the window or running back and forth and weird stuff like that\nWell you know the the weirdest thing creepy his thing about the story of Robert The haunted Dahl is that\nHe was given to a young boy a Robert Eugene auto which everybody called Eugene ore gene and gene became obsessed with this dog when gene was only like maybe four or five years old\nAnd then Jean grew up to be a very successful man a ... had a wife that everybody loves had a nice big house but it didn't change his infatuation with the dog\nI mean uh you might think back when you were a kid maybe there is some toys that was special to you in there came a point when it just sort of drifted away that never happened for gene auto\nHe kept this this a doll uh till the end of his life and treated it in many cases they say if you talk to the locals better than he treated his wife I mean\nHow little special furniture made for him and gave him a little special room so are his room was ... he moved to the attic at at the wife's insistence but you know they claim that when finally Eugene died\nA and his wife moved out of the house and the house sat there abandoned for quite a few years waiting for a fire to come along\nAnd I actually did get to talk to some of the caretakers who ah worked in the house during that period of time who told me about just chilling experiences but nonetheless people who weren't\nSometimes walk outside the windows and you'd look up by new new that house was ... new there ever read see little Robert de do running around the house George Back and forth in front of the

friends were just hanging out up there and then all of a sudden like this huge deep dark fog just kinda swept in in the afternoon like we're watching the sun to all of a sudden\nIt's super thick fog just sat and there were like six to eight what looked to be like jeep headlights\nOff in the distance thought nothing of it about five to ten minutes later they started heading right out of like right at us we've got to thinking about it we're at and overlooked there was no way it could have been like jeeps or anything\nWe started watching them in like this belief at this point they get right up on us about two hundred feet away and then they just like broke apart and just started like bugs and all around and we took off\nUm come to find like for two years I thought I was crazy me and my two friends were like what the heck was that\nWhat's going on out that way Josh\n... it was it was a lot of stuff and then uh\nAbout a year or two later my my buddy send me a link it might have been from your website or something talking about it and uh it just like connected the dots I've I've been really trying to contact you learn not trying but you know willing to talk to you for about twelve years now to just see what you think about it\nWhat is that Josh Well Tyler thank you for that call always good to talk to a fellow Ashville yet another tar hill and um you know Ryan\nIn North Carolina you know everybody of course focuses on brown mountains or the brown mountain lights because the brown mountain lights are the most famous example\nYou talked about them before Josh\nYeah of of this strange phenomenon where you have these balls of light that appear but actually this is widespread this goes beyond brown mountain\nThis goes all over as Tyler was saying the blue Ridge Mountains and ah you know which is of course part of the Appalachian chain Lena leading over to the great Smoky Mountains there are all kinds of spots where these balls of light appear\nNow I Believe that [noise]\nIf you if you if you really want to get the scoop on this you can download a free PDF about it if you go to brown mountain lights dot com [noise]\nBut basically an eye on that website but um but what I can tell you is that there are places on earth\nThat produce an incredible amount of natural energy\nAnd that that energy has as a byproduct a bunch of paranormal activity that spins off\nSo you get more grossly encounters people seeing UFOs time slips scripted all that kind of stuff but\nIn its role as form it's almost like Marie idioms on planet earth that acupuncture is Mike

Joshua ... the war in our final segment next hour we'll talk about haunted World War two amazing stories Matthew swing will join us so Josh my friend you are one of a kind how did you originally get started in paranormal investigating what was that one catalysts that got you into\nIt [noise] oddly enough George it was really an incident that happened before I was born really um 'cause I I come from a large family or my mother is the youngest of ten kids and my dad\nReally I'm here because I come from a large family or my mother is the youngest of ten kids and my dad is one of seven kids while and I both both sides of my family they'd been in the mountains of western North Carolina since the uh late Seventeen hundreds early Eighteen hundreds [noise]\nUh but there was this one incident that occurred on my mother's side of the family\nIn the great depression or my mother is a mother was named to Virginia Calloway that was her maiden name and when she was about Thirteen Years old she got a camera as a birthday present which was a pretty big deal back that her family was a little better off than most but\nThat didn't last long they they lost everything and the depression but she lives out in the countryside and one day her father a guy named Jack and her older brother who was in his twenties are named Claude came home from a small game hunting trip and she photographed them\nA holding up their squirrels and rabbits and stuff and when the picture develop my great uncle clog Calloway her older brother did not have a head\nAnd they they knew that was weird but they were not able to understand enough about photography to realize just how weird it was so fast forward one month later a clause was sitting on the porch of the house\nAnd he was reading a copy of his favorite publication western magazine old gunslinger tails and uh his father Jack was in the kitchen fixing fixing lunch\nAnd they were conversing through an open window and at some point or jak said something to Claude Claude Napster and when the lunch was ready jak went outside and\nI'm here's clause magazine lying on the porch but there's no call and I'm a long story short my great uncle Claude Calloway was never seen or heard from again\nHe's a good evening ladies involved in the ...\nWell yeah well you know it's actually it's not too far from where there is a national uh part these days you know the ... national park area and and and what's even weirder is that you know I mean they did everything they got the authorities involved they got you know they were searching the woods and\nUm you know hearing this fellow my great uncle who was waiting for his lunch\nYou know in the middle of a story and reading a magazine ... how could he disappeared was the abducted was the rapture way did he did he get caught up in a space time slip I mean\nWe don't know but but you see it was compounded by the fact that this creepy photograph was taken one month before\nAnd when I became an adult I went back to that area and did everything I could to try to find out what had happened and I mean I've verify the whole story with\nElderly people and ah historians and but still there's there's no explanation for this and and you see this was a big tragedy in my family or they never got over it they never had closure\nAnd I got to grow up sort of seeing the the sensitive wound this created\nAnd it made me realize that some of these mysterious phenomena or they're not just legends or superstition or or old folk tales I mean the the paranormal if you want to call it that there's something very real\nThat we have to take seriously and so that inspired me to go out and sort of try to find facts or versus fiction and then finally by the time I got into my early twenties was well I really started seeing some bizarre stuff uh for myself with my own two wives\nFor you let's go to the final calls here let's go to Mary in Los Angeles to get things started Hi Mary\nOr stuff or for myself with my own two wise\nFor you let's go to the final calls here let's go to Mary in Los Angeles to get things started Hi merry go ahead\nI I like earth is November ... to ... go ahead and I was ... it was it will\nAlso said yes and how does that relate to how all souls day in Halloween\n[noise] yeah well thank you for your call Mary as a matter of fact um my birthdays October twenty fifth my mother's birthday is November the third the day after yours and my sister's birthday is November the fifth\nAnd I can't tell you how many people I Know who have birthdays around Halloween including Dr Moulder who builds wishing machines his birthday is on Halloween\nAnd I'll just say a ... if you go back nine months that takes you kind of close to Valentine's Day so maybe there's an explanation for why I Know so many people who have birthdays around or you know October [noise]\nBut um as far as your particular question is concerned so the the the basic tradition of Sao on which of course we now call Halloween\nIs built around October thirty first and this is the product of the Catholic Church coming into the pagan areas of Europe and trying to dominate them and switch them away from their pagan beliefs into Christianity\nWith their own date well November ...\nWell they they realize that you know they were doing a good job at switching them over to Christianity so instead the Catholic Church tried to sort of work with the beginnings\nAnd say instead of considering October thirty first um some kind of a pagan holiday you know why don't why don't we kind of a you know sanctify this whole time period\nAnd say that well this is the evening before the spirits of the saints comeback which would be November the first\nAnd so we will say November the first is the hallowed with day\nAnd the evening before that is the Halloween evening or Halloween and so then uh they sort of combined the pagan believes of Halloween with all saints day on November first\nAnd then of course November second they said well why don't we just not only celebrate saints but just celebrate all the soles of people who have died and so you end up with all souls day\nUh but this is one of those are interesting examples it goes back to you know Christmas we're going to be hearing more stories about this and uh probably is Christmas approaches where you know the a lot of the patients will go out and worshipped trees\nYou know the evergreen quality of trees and there was there was one of the um the higher ups in the Catholic Church is said look if we go out and we find a bunch of people who were worshipping a tree", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "08"}
