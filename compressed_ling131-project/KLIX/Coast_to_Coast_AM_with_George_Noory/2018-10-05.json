I agree with you um I don't know whether you're at liberty can you can you say who is is a building has built this temple or this arch\nYeah I Know it was responsible for it I mean it was a group of it was called um the digital archaeological and then it means super digital archeology basically what they do they do three D a treaty printing of a sudden these monuments and they found it interesting too\nThe reconstruct and and uh actually uh Iraq\nThese ah this arch over the world and every time it goes\nGoes there people always protest it and they say this is a representation of evil do not bring the the the doorway or the arch way to the temple you up to our city and they do anyway and when they bring the city's things go weird when when it was in ... square or they actually\nSomebody decided well we have that why don't we erect a a a statue are supposed to do was the only the demon or the actresses were sitting there on the library of the queen\nThat she is incredible then then and then uh you know why the New York they do it they put it right next to the for the call Cleopatra's Needle which is which is basically horses member it'd be it's the ... the Jed and and it would be a symbolism of the meeting of both male and female in New York they did that and no one seemed to blink an eye about bad luck surprised\nBecause one of those cities that right it's just dark all the time\nAnd so the rice and the thing that happened the other day\nWhere the guy mailed the rice into the president and Ted Cruz's staff\nAnd all those people it happened when the stars just happened to align with the moon and it was Gemini it was ... it was the crown of the chronic bailed Gemini with the with the two stars the twins politics and caster castor oil caster seeds may make rice and as he is but that are out there is all happening yeah\nWho are alleging they're saying to their cousin to your show every night you were mentioning about the uh the uh the European Parliament just in the shape of the uh the tower a battle yeah and and then you're talking about the horror ball on top or the ... the horror babble on top of the beef stew in the states\nAll over the it's all over the area and Brussels wherever the European Union is that and then they have the the twelve stars and the crown of the of the woman who babble on 'em and the European Union applied you see the woman to Babylon writing the beast and therefore you're you see it on tapestries all over the place and then they have an unfinished looking building that replicates or at least books like the tower battle\nThey're they're they're just open about\nHow they're using that symbolism the symbolism of the apocalypse to bring about the government's they want and the center of the they wish to tap into a ... and they're tapping into the dark forces have confidence strictures bitter bitter or old demons like pie on as Modi as I could go down the list of all the demon did they decide they want to worship and bring forward and this is what they're doing\nThey're panicking at Washington because they know if they get this fits the conservative vote on the at nine members of a Supreme Court then that means things like baby murders going to be reopened and of course the other thing which means you know Saddam equals marriage\nThey well and and and what does bail represent baby murder\nExactly baby murder and everything that is Washington I mean you always have been if ever there was like a dilemma legit\nSo uh we're out here we love you we listen cue thank you all just remember man love is solved the coldest solver and God calls the shots God's cheese and the weights and while\nThe Democrats are panicking and if you if you're implying that their culture and I agree with ya\nSomebody's conjuring I don't know if it's a party if someone wants to see everything come together class together and some wrecking ball operation with a cult overtones that really is it it's crazy Paul thank you for the call AAA thinks having three thirty seven hundred a triple eight six seven three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero and we'll be back\n[noise]\nAh\n\n\n[noise] Mm [noise] Mm Mm\nAnd numbers together so there are letters that having American values so if you look at the Hebrew equivalent of R. W. letter is vi\nV. A. V. vibe or it's Bob and so the number of value of five he's six so ... Bob Bob or WWW numerically ... fix fix fix\nThat is correct and uh I think again solidifies uh everything you're\nSaying ... and ah I just want people to know\nWhat have you ... the room and if you take the Roman numeral uh you take the Roman numerals six\nOkay which is why you're vi V. IBM guy and then you could not ... it's WWW so you have another six six six\nAmazing and it just it's just weird but ... it's weird\nHow cold ah numerology a new we're number gaming and let her dreaming but it's certainly a comes together and such a way\nYeah uh that you know are very you know we've got so many different languages and ... and all but just like you are confounding at a a just seems to go on and on and you know again will never date set or anything but I just wanted to thank you for the show and just like Paul vaguely said the other night we're not\nGoing ... setting ... really believe we're in the delivery\n... and I think people need to get ready\nThe thing about all ... that I Know that uh he's certainly you know he follows ...\nVery very ... and I think people need to get ready\nFor the thing about ... that I Know that uh he certainly you know he follows my show and I just love him and that's why I bring him on all the time because he just seems to be you know he has a great personality and he delivers when he delivers in such a way that makes it interesting it doesn't make it boring is not as dogmatic\nIs most preachers and that's why I find Paul Begley to be very interesting and very very entertaining and I've seen is I've seen his sermons and they are amazing so you know I I Love the guy\nSo all the way I appreciate the time you're getting ready to talk about this and I hope it will help people understand that a lot of the anti Christ has the tools and that's the only thing the computer and\nI get the feeling that that in my case yeah go ahead I'm Sorry what you're saying\nI was going to ask you are in relation to the Israel becoming a nation in Nineteen forty eight\nAbout I think was forty eight or forty six okay\nDoes anybody know like the advent of the could appear like well ear that was no okay I just wonder if that coincided anyway it was a it was Nineteen forty eight actually\nThey're Nineteen forty eight now May of Nineteen forty eight where they became indoor Israel becoming a nation in yeah may Nineteen forty eight\nOkay again or just everything that's going on and Trump recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel\nAnd those are the things the housing look Elaine odd I mean you're a Christian or write\nAny of us are like I say you know Christians are right now looking at their politics and they're looking at their belief systems\nAnd whether or not diametrically opposed they certainly are throwing wedges into everything we think and everything we do and what a what bigger wedge is there then the debate about sexual promiscuity rape and the death of children and these are the the main things that are focused\nWith the horn guy to bail and this is the main thing is being focused in this hearing and it's the main thing that it's going to be ruled upon by the FBI and by the Senate so if this is not a coincidence a very very deep and meaningful coincidence I\nDon't know what it is yeah here's thought on with everything you're saying I appreciate you know bringing outlets to like keep that in the spotlight um 'cause the mainstream media share is not going to do it\nThank you Todd I appreciate the call I think can't fire let's go to Felix in Pennsylvania Hi Felix from ground zero\n[noise] hey how ya doing doing good man hey you know it isn't stressed out of it it's very interesting that ah you know the topic of bell number here the internal growth right that Russia's and Clinton and I believe for rock bottom all hang out there together\nWell yeah a lot of uh a lot of famous uh you know dignitaries leaders me Henry Kissinger Ronald Reagan Nixon or go down the list of all leaders I mean in fact the plan to drop the bomb on Hiroshima was made the bohemian drove under the hour so I mean the oil it up yeah yeah\nThe Manhattan Project it was all just it was all talked about and planned out of the human growth that's where it all came down and came down\nOr after revelation for me out and of course you know that when Oppenheimer build the bombing built it on on some old is a historic uh things he discovered from a debate is in the end you punish odds and it was all ancient to ensure destructive history that uh they didn't reveal to anybody and when\nAsked well how does it feel to set up the world's first atomic bomb he goes no it was the first atomic bomb to go up in modern times meaning that they got the information\nFrom the old ... and the writings of uh of some of the older civilizations that had that power way back when\nYou know I I think that you and I have a very similar religious background okay and and and\nIt was raised a forest fire very devout Christian parents okay though I had everything pounded until you're like you say get out of town and then to write and this whole thing you know about the end of the world you know the second coming in and uh you know\nIt I I've\nI of course have become a bit of a ... aspect because a lot of it doesn't really make sense to me you know like when you go back to the beginning of the Bible yeah where you know they say God is perfect guy knows everything and got a table and then the new you know the new world is going to be you know no more evil evil days I pushed right\nOkay but if God originally created the world is Scott has um that you know knows everything and there's all powerful and hates evil is not the ones who created the devil\nHe created the hell but the but the devils are I guess you could say destiny was to be an opposition of God and that is that was the plan anyway it was a plan that uh we agreed to and we all agreed to it\nOkay\nWe agreed that it would be best that we had liberty and and the ability to choose rather than being forced into slavery under under the direction of God\nSatan wanted slavery or he wanted to slavery a man\nA and and God didn't want that he ... he wanted to save your he wanted to he wanted someone to come down and save the people from their sins because of the original fans of the problems that came about in the in the ... era so I mean we want to get even by that puts out\nThat's what makes no sense to me though you know what I'm saying because they've got a or a writer you know there's there's despises evil why would he created and the first place\nAnd the argument is always drawn up you know I mean I come from a family of eight and half of us are are like me you know and the other half and very devout and they say well of course you know it's because of free well but if God does not want you know sin or you know\nHe can't here's the deal he created opposition to engender strength that's the reason why opposition exists you wouldn't be strong without opposition you wouldn't gain you wouldn't gain muscle without opposition you wouldn't gain fire without friction\nThere's got to be in opposition to make things happen and the choices whether or not you wish to go with the opposition or fight against the opposition\nIn the south and really I don't think too that what the power of apple yeah um how you know man like you know the the way that the scripture says that you know unless man becomes like us you know a wasted separate them somehow you know of course and people were\nGiven different languages that they couldn't understand each other right but the thing that I've always wondered is is that\nEvery single geographic area of the earth people or the state of lead different until they started you know ... to link together and solve that in some ways it's got to make is got to make in over the course of a couple thousand years man couldn't have evolved you know into these distinct difference character\nLanguage raises language was a protection mechanism that's why it changed that's why they were different languages because of the scattering of the people they needed languages to be different in order to protect themselves it was a protection mechanism in the beginning now it's not we we we inter relate with one another but in the past\nIt was the idea of using language is a barrier to keep the enemies away and to have those were of your same kind learning the language is and the codes in the hands gestures it's just like the secret meeting I'm Talking about tonight will be esoteric knowledge there's esoteric speak their esoteric signed symbols and sign posts\nAnd symbols mean a lot to people and and to argue that they don't I think is is is completely ignorant because when you say like for example if I were a swastika\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBegins in his new\nForgive me

I really liked plan nine from outer space it's a guilty pleasure [noise]\nI really love the blob I Know that sounds corny since I'm the host the blob Ben blob is a solid movie I think it's a great movie\nWhat do you think movies like Halloween the ... the shining the conjuring and things like that\nYou know I like those movies I think the shining is actually a a an excellent ghost story a you know in addition to\nUh being I guess it's not ... I mean I don't know if I classify shining the slasher\nUm but it's certainly a horror film and and and and ... and ... and a and a good one and I think it's what I mean forty years old or something now right you know these these are these modern horror films are pretty how are you know the ring is Twenty years old you know so um [noise]\nYou know it's a ... you know a lot of them are are are ah you know whoa hold up pretty well um with age and I I really I think a Halloween the first call lean is really a ... a pretty suspenseful movie and Donald pleasant this really excellent\nAs kind of like the cap and a half trying to stop this uh maniacal a killer actually not even maniacal\nThat someone from Nineteen Seventy eight\nStop this uh you know maniacal a killer actually not even maniacal\nThat someone from Nineteen Seventy eight man\nNineteen Seventy eight is a forty year anniversary of the original Halloween ... manager and it's been that long my gosh [noise]\nUh and John Carpenter who of course ah gave us a the remake of a thing and I'm asking from New York and a bunch of other uh [noise]\nOr films a science fiction a heat of the original concept was that it was going to be an anthology is that every Halloween\nThey would do a different theme or different type of scary movie and the first story was called the babysitter killers\nAnd and they were the babysitter killer a and that was the ... that was the Michael Meyers story ... story [laughter] kicked in and uh the character\nBecame so popular [noise] um the mask he's wearing they were trying to come up with a scary mask and and and what they ended up doing was taking a William Shatner Star Trek mask and spray painting it white\n[laughter]\nSo that's ... that's a weird Shatner mass cookies Larry I'm\nI Wonder how we'll feels about that\nYeah I don't know uh but uh you know and and so it you know the fact that it puts a blank you know expression on the mask and then and not deliberately scary face\nA you know I think that that made it more uh more scary you know I think a lot of times they are newer movies they tried to heart you're talking about the conjuring and\nSome of 'em there are in that family a film bears Anna bell which uh you know the original dog at the Warren are having their a basement full of ah object\nIs Iraq at the end all and we all know what raggedy and looks like and the one that they had ended up doing in the movie\nThey tried to make it look scary a it looks like something out of spirit Halloween you know and they and and it's just it's it's a you know it no one would trust the stall for two seconds you know they're like oh what a beautiful dog with the whole effect looking right off the bat\nYou know it's much scarier when it's something you would least expect you know and no one would think that that their little ... gonna [noise]\nGonna try to possess them or haunt them or hurt that\nComing up on fifty years Rosemary's Baby can you believe that started to leave that either and that's been ... to she was just almost a kid when she started in that movie\nShe was she was you know and that was kind of you know she had kind of a controversial sort of mob look with the short hair and she ... Frank Sinatra's protege\nAnd that's true and that didn't last too long but you're right\nYou know and and uh you know a William Castle want it to make that move you know William Castle was the producer of course in the fifties was famous for his gimmicks you know like emerge Joe\nAnd uh you know I always feel with the ... and the seats and the uh uh uh you know all of these uh move the gimmicks\nOf a house on the hill and um you know straight jak\nClassics hold on for a second Mr Lovell run a break we'll come back with more next our phone calls you will share your movie experience with Mr ... later on on the coast to coast they\nUh I was terrified of these I mean I I I was like in my Spiderman pajamas a you know just sweating under the coffee table\nShaking with a year I'd have to go into the other room I was the kind of a kid that when the skipper with yell at Gilligan earned Gilligan's Island I Would have to get out of the world you know it was a little too little too hot when skipper with yoga and whether it's ... you know\nAnd we were watching a move my dad and I think with a lot of you will get the bonding thing you know fathers son\nKind of on the same way I was going to talk about that and I I Will but you're exactly right\nAnd and I think it kind of a rite of passage you know and and I think originally I just was watching these movies the kind of be with my dad and he would be in the recliner watching creature features but I'd be next to him or hiding behind the recliner sometimes\nAnd you know it ... I think it was maybe I don't know if it was crawling hand or just the hand but they had this very convincing hand to crawl ... different body hand crawling by itself\nAnd I and I'm ... I'm ... and it bothered me so much like that that you know if the rubber hand that they do with great jelly and you know are manipulating liars and ... and I'm sure that we're facing with dead wrong but but it put it into this perspective a wait\nIs fun time they're playing this is a show this is this is this is a game you know this is something can make\nScorcher me this is this is something for fun and I think that there was a kind of an aha kind of moment and I think from that point forward or I couldn't get enough you know I was a highway or if it were ... and not just for all of\nA horror I feel is is that under horror an five five I think are under the bigger umbrella of fantasy though uh I think the horror is an offshoot of fantasy in those five five I I like all of that I like uh I like John or movies I like uh [noise] you know monsters and\nThen the robots and injured and pirates and all\nMy dad used to bring me God rest his soul to all these movies when I was a kid\nI I remember him taking me to see the ... when I was seven years old Mr ... oh yeah and then of course the scary one for me I was nine years old the house on the haunted hill and when the original one with Vincent Price right I mean\nCapsules house on how to like wild blind woman and seller man I thought\nHe would really do all these movies you know I don't know if he brought me because my mom didn't want to go when we\nWhen we just wanted me around but I mean all these all these movies he would bring me too\nYeah and then the the TV shows he would love to see science fiction theater in in in those kinds of shows right you know you'd have them on all the time I I think he's one of the reasons why my mother is one of the reasons why I got into broadcasting\nAnd I'm you know indoor UFOs and the paranormal but my dad got me into these movies and all these science fiction shows he loved those things\nWill sure it you know in all of those and I think it all ties together you know because I think that curiosity you know I'm just the fact like just like a like a show like Star Trek my you know kind of brought us the cell phones and\nAnd uh you know all sorts of things\nYou know I think that that the curiosity for this a cult in a supernatural you know I think it is probably the genesis or the Steve although a lot of um your your guests on your show who started watching these uh\nMovies and and decided to go hey let's dig deeper what you know are there goes let's find out\nI think so too what do you think of the Texas Chainsaw massacre Nineteen Seventy four version\n[noise] you know the the Texas Chainsaw massacre gift that has had the heaviest wrap everyone was trying to do the Texas Chainsaw massacre there is hardly a drop of blood in that whole movie\nYou think there is you think there is one I\nThink the areas right you know and we go back and watch it and you know it's all filmed murky sixteen millimeter and is it just the chainsaw and the little how weird their house was with all the\nThe mold mobiles made out of bounds and you know the the psychological aspect is really what clicked with that movie and I think that everyone that what came after it those are really I think they're really sloppy flat bash\nYou know a bunch of teenagers waiting to get slaughtered kind of movies but really as the original Texas cheap ah they were they were they were heartbroken when they got an R rating they were trying to get a PG E because there was no one was going to go see it\nThe Nineteen sixty Alfred Hitchcock movie psycho new shower scene you would think you were looking at ... moons every second not won them stabbing did you see in that shower saying\nNo no no point does the knife a entered Janet ... body at any point a unit\nYou know it's happening but you don't see it\nAt the sounds I think out a lot of that and there were a bunch of other ... there were a bunch of melons that they had laid out and they were stabbing different types of melons and Hitchcock is standing there\nThe guy you know making all these weird hollow strange down stabbing all these different fruits and vegetables ... doesn't say a word and as he's walking out the door he just says\nTo stop a [laughter] little which magic started with pennies but that was a scary one to\nBlair Witch project is really interesting because you know a a you know they were uh unfortunately I had a friend who was ushered when a when that movie came out and he was cleaning up vomit every single night his job he couldn't handle it\nBecause it was and it wasn't because it was scary it was because people had had a become accustomed to the founders footage first person you know just a just a handy cam or a camcorder filming a whole movie [noise]\nUm you know so uh you know that was kind of a first of the sort of found footage type films\nAnd an independent film and went really big and you know when it's like okay well you can say what you want about that movie but\nYou know that that movie was a that was the director hat final cut and they made the movie they way the way they wanted to make it and they created this whole legend that much more I mean I live in Pennsylvania not far from a where the Blair Witch is supposed to happen\nAnd people still drive in they're looking to uncover this thing that never happened so they really really great job\nOf not only are making a a a found footage film but for creating a a a a story that people want it to believe in and uh you know it's all a nowadays I think that'd be hard to do\nBecause of the Internet it gives you can't keep a secret for twenty second but in Nineteen Ninety nine a fool everybody everyone thought the Blair Witch was the thing\nWhat did you think of Freddie Krueger nightmare on elm street\nYou know it's interesting I didn't like it when I saw it originally uh you know it just it was kinda just greedy and\nCame out in Nineteen eighty four right\nAny for but you know I I've gone back and there's a lot of humor in it and and it's great marriage that said you know he's not just stabbing people going into their dreams\nUh which I think they pretty liberally ripped off from the movie dream skate which I think came the year before which is an excellent movie that people should seek out\nWhere someone is trying to assassinate the president inside of his dream right ah but ah yeah ... it's actually very clever movie and and uh with any any of them whenever they go five six seven equals yet they're getting pretty bad\nThere was a movie out two thousand fourteen I never saw did kind of weird movie it shows up as one of the horror films have you ever heard of at the bottom of Duke\n[noise] yes I have you know and I did not like the father do very much it's Australian film I Believe uh it's about a a mother and a her child [noise]\nAnd uh they are basically kind of dealing with the grief a of a loss of of a spouse or or and a father um\nAnd I think it manifested in this in this creature that kind of comes alive from a children's storybook which kind of looks like London after midnight you know he's got like the top hat and kind of ... kind of hair\nA he's a cartoon out of a children's book uh I didn't really I mean it just it didn't I never really believe the topic do but that wasn't the part of it they didn't like I didn't like that it seemed like a two hour Zoloft commercial\nWhere it was just this allegory for their depression and their grief and that you you don't ever really escape your brief you just have to feed it\n[noise] what is it about a hole in creepy films that people generally like to be scared\nUm you know I think if you you said you've won I think there's two there's two aspects of the roller coaster you know there's two kinds of roller coasters you want to\nYou know I think if you use are you one I think there's two there's two aspects blower coaster you know there's two kinds of roller coasters you want to ... you get on it right you get on a roller coaster and you'd have so much fun that you want to get back on her to get\nThe other kind of a roller coaster is when you get off your kissing the ground [laughter] for effort want to get on a rollercoaster it yeah and they're both fought\nA and I think that you know you you you you ear safe you know you get to put yourself in a kind of a mock a mock danger you know and and but really you're safe and then you feel like you've overcome something and I think that it's just that that Russia I think it's just that thrill\nAnd and again I think it's it for a moment

forty nine years old chip do you go to movies\nI'm Sorry did you go to movies\nI did yesterday yesterday I just saw the nine ... well we got him and uh on my list I met I haven't seen it yet oh it's awesome it's part of the uh uh because during the response movies on the island I Love those yes are great\nUm what I called you about is or what your thoughts on the fog and Santa has them which are two of my favorite a horror movies from the early eighties the\nAh I ... I absolutely love than has been a fan has them was a made on the weekends or the ... the kids who made fantastically smoke dope all week and then on the weekends they shot band has them\nAnd um and when they when a cost to really uh you know took him almost a really long schedule I think it took him almost the whole year\nShoot all the footage with the film and um but when they put it all together a it was a great blend aside by and we're and imitate it a lot throughout the eighties I think the kind of hearken that sort of blend of fantasy\nAnd a lotta later a Haiti's films in the tall man stands as one of the most memorable screen villains of all time uh and the fog is truly creepy great film great atmosphere Adrian Barbaro great ghost story about um the lepers\nOr a Nineteen eighty to come\nBack with a goal that through the fog uh it's just a so good you know there's so many great performances how whole workers the priest which I think was originally supposed to be um Donald pleasant but I don't know\nWhat he was doing at that time but you know it it just a John Carpenter again we've mentioned several of John carpet assume Halloween being one of them are they live being one of them the fog was one of them so I mean John John Carpenter you know next to Steven King I mean\nJohn Carpenter dominated the eighties or with a lot of really wonderful imagine if that fails\nWere these inexpensive movies to make\nA comparatively I mean we weren't like Star Wars movies you know I'm I think that the great thing about a horror film um the beauty of a horror film is that you know you can scare some even take sixty thousand dollars and make fourteen million dollars\nFrom now you have the right distribution absolutely\nThough so so that I think that that's why it's such a hearty genre because you can make it on the cheap usually the darker you make it in the more interesting it is um the more the mind uh takes over you know the lesser the shark you see the more effective jobs was the last of the alien the\nScarier the alien was so you know there is a lot to the site I think it's very easy to over produce or I think it's a horror movie has too much money at it\nIt seems protected you know you look at the second Terminator movie\nYou know if it doesn't play out like a horror film like the first one 'cause there's just too much money and it looked like a franchise so um you know a horror film you know you almost need to cap the budget because if you put too much money and do it\nIt stops seem like a surprise and and if you if you can see the train coming down the track no one is going to knowing shouting blue is going to scare you you know so you it has to kind of be\nA slight of hand it has to appear spontaneous and I think that's why a lot of low budget horror films like neither the living dead ... grant\nA are incredibly scary [noise] and they're cheap\nActors like Bruce Campbell have made a living doing lower budget horror films in the\nAbsolute Lee yeah he's like the Olivier [laughter]\nReally is [laughter] and uh you know and and I you know I got to interview him and he's charming guy and uh you\nKnow he uh he loves ah you know he pretends he doesn't like it but he he he likes it he likes the attention\nThan he likes to paycheck to paycheck absolutely you know and ah I'm\nEvil dead is a is a great a film for an actor I mean he pretty much just carrying that whole movie on his back he's putting himself through\nA you know all of these sort of it's almost like a Chapel Hill where it's just it's huge just following through all of these tap blows that they've created for him so it's it you know it's not too many actors can can carry a whole movie on their back\nWhat do you think of the Stephen King movies from his books that all seemed to have that type feeling for in a cemetery it's things like\nYeah I mean I I like Stephen King films a lot more than the books I mean but I mean I'm a film guy and people always say oh well the book was better it's like they're not exchange commodities you know I mean a dance is different than a sculpture you know ... book is different than a movie it just you know when you're in the mood for a movie\nIt's you know I mean a dance is different than a sculpture you know ... book is different than a movie it's just you know when you're in the mood for a movie you know in the mood to read a book and vice versa and uh you know what works in a book doesn't work in a movie and I I think that a lot of\nMy favorite Stephen King stuff is all the short stories\nI think his novels or to a padded too long winded you know what I understand about Stephen King and I you know I've never met the man but you know he doesn't know where the story ends when he starts he just he just keeps writing he he used to just as surprised as we are because\nHe just keeps writing a and drinking and writing and finished you know and and then uh you know five hundred pages later it done so there's NO PLAN\nGoing in a mall which yeah I think\nAllows for him to ... you know again ... there there was no formula so I think that I think that that's why his books are so surprising but I think at the same time [noise] you know a good director can kind of oil back down\nTo it asked him you know he hated the film the shining and the film is shining I think stands as one of the best pieces of art in the twentieth century\nSo I you know I don't know\nWhat about TV shows that are dealing with horror like the walking dead and things like that uh yeah\nIt's interesting because you know I mean Walking Dead I definitely I feel like oh everything tonight of a living at yes and now it's kind of come down to the main stream come down to the front line you know you go into the wall Mart and you see the\nYou know the rubber ears that you're hanging around your neck or the you know the whatever that inside a signs\nAnd you know it it's all um it's a very commercial\nUm you know I think that uh you know it's a soap opera um and I think it's kind of cowboys and Indians to I smoke that I'm In modern zombie movies you know and as a hobby as the enemy that you can shoot and not feel so out of out\nAnd we don't ... you know ... ... ... in the world of you all are very politically correct world\nThere there there aren't many a screen villains that you can kind of

they get information and then they come back and in the morning when they wake up\nUh it's like if we were to read the newspaper in the morning and see what happened in the world while we were sleeping they use their dreams to help navigate what they're going to do in the course of a day I and so it's like a pre cognitive experience and the whole culture built around that\nAnd I think that's pretty extraordinary um they also make use of plant medicines or the Iowa for example\nOr something that they use for big visions\nSo if they want to anticipate what the whole group should do

aware of the possibility of God or or does it take you the other way\n[noise] I guess it's a matter of definition how do we define God I think that the idea that there is something beyond this limited awareness this encapsulated mind body that connects us to other mind bodies or suggest something vast\nAnd I also think you know people who are able to access these non ordinary states of consciousness experience depths of reality that aren't part of our mundane everyday experience and that's you know pretty mind altering\nWhen your argument due to do a lot of different aspects of a really the supernatural Amish virtual reincarnation and things like gun you've got some great stories about reincarnation of the books that you roll back in two thousand Fifteen just makes life possible told me about that title\nReasonable reincarnation of the books that you roll back in two thousand Fifteen dumped makes life possible told me about that title again how did you come up with that\nWell I like to say I did but I was working in partnership with Deepak Chopra a for a film we made a feature length documentary by that title and he was the one that I was giving a lecture at one of his workshops and I was showing a little video that I had done\nWith some of the scientists who are working in this area of\nYou know after death reincarnation and he told me aside after I was done is like\nMarilyn let's make a movie and I thought well I wouldn't want to make a movie with Deepak Chopra and then I went to bed that night and I woke up the next morning completely petrified you know the whole idea of having to fundraise and all the rest of it and\nSo at lunch I think Tim very profusely and explained that it really wasn't going to be able to do it and he said oh Marilyn stop worrying about the money the money will come\nAnd I'd like to say it was just that easy but uh we did accomplish something that now has been all over the world translated into multiple languages and\nAired on Oprah about two years ago so it's been out there and making 'em an impact with people who are struggling a goal in both the film and the book was to help transform that fear that people have into an inspiration for really living well\nI mean I was told people I'm not you know hopefully to leave but I'm not scared if we have to do it\nRight and we will eventually although the world that's a whole interesting thing to in terms of\nFuture science you know we see now that all of this cloning as happening they've just cloned um eggs that can be fertilized to turn into humans in a

forever\nYeah that may be how we get life on Mars or future beyond that is that it's going to come with you know some kind of genetic manipulation and clothing and\nYou know it may not be that this physical body goes out into space but that it's generations later through these kind of scientific interventions that we start to see the future of humanity\nWhat'd you say to people Maryland who say hogwash life after death does not continue when we die ... ... what are you saying\nWell I'm very respectful that people have various different perspectives different world views and my inclination is to think that what we really believe\nIs probably what we're gonna end up in a so those people who believe in reincarnation may well reincarnate and those people who believe in sort of the Buddhist journey of enlightenment um may end up through in a you know maybe in a black hole somewhere you know alternating at\nThe the threshold of some event horizon I mean I think all of those things that seemed completely far fetched in the past\nAre now something that we can really start to grapple with\nWhen I made the film I interviewed a Michael ... who is he's ... he's a skeptic the well known skeptic he's also you know a really smart guy very interesting and and I use a nice guy yeah I Would say so and I had a really great time interviewing him\nAnd what was fascinating there were two things first of all I\nYeah I Would say so and I had a really great time interviewing him and what was fascinating there were two things first of all I had knowledge that when his mom died he heard her voice and I ... you know with a little surprised that he was telling me this on film\nAnd I said well really let's you know go back to that and he said oh well you know it was really nothing but yeah I heard her voice\nAnd I thought well that's interesting acknowledgement and he had a good psychological justification that was just some kind of hitting the gods ... experience right at that threshold of of sleep and dreaming\nBut it was interesting that he acknowledged it and then the second thing that I I really loved was that um he got married shortly after my interviewing him and I guess they got married in either his house or his\nUh now White House\nAnd her father grandfather I Can't remember the details exactly but had left her a radio and uh it didn't work\nAnd Michael had tried and tried to fix it and eventually and frustration he's stuck the radio and a a drawer\nAnd ... didn't think about it anymore and then months later they were having their wedding ceremony and in the middle of the ceremony all of a sudden they start hearing music playing\nAnd they proceeded to complete the ceremony and went in and followed the music and it was that radio and his wife was quite convinced that this had something to do with her departed loved one\nMichael wrote ... column and Scientific American where he started to play with the idea that maybe this was something more\nAnd his colleagues came down so hard on him that he ... retracted any kind of open mindedness and went back to his kind of\nEntrenched position of skepticism\nWhat's important to as a skeptic is not a known believer ... skeptic want proof\n[noise] right I mean it comes from the ancient Greek where it was the dogmatists where the people who really understood the new and the skeptics were the ones who were questioning it wasn't like they deny the existence of these things but they wanted to raise questions and I think that's different than uh the bunker\nI think so too and it's ... I also think it's healthy to be skeptical until you get the proof\nI Do too I think open minded skepticism is the healthiest perspective we can have we're in agreement on that it must be our Detroit impulses\nYou gotta Merrill Lynch day well those were ... quick break we're going to come back and talk more about your work in our final hour ... hour we'll take phone calls about this but also want

will take your calls next dollar with Dr Merrill Lynch floods author of adults makes life possible also consciousness and healing as well and the Maryland would you tell us the story of the reincarnation of the little child\n[noise] well there's so many stories let's um this one had to step Bruce march or something like that right\nWell Stevenson was a very unusual psychiatrist who developed a very strong interest in\nTrying to document cases of reincarnation and he collected about a thousand case studies of young children who had had\nA some experience in the past life that they report it to their family he went in and investigated um did corroborating evidence interviewed people read\nThat they report it to their family he went in and investigated um did corroborating evidence interviewed people read medical reports\nAnd in about thirty five percent of the people that he identified they had some kind of unusual birth mark\nA so it's not a typical mould but some kind of unusual birth mark and it was often associated with the cause of death of the person that the young child remembered\nSo there were numerous examples where for a for instance one child remembered being a man from a different village\nOr in Asia and he um [noise] in Stevens and then went and investigated the biography of this person that the child remembered being\nAnd it turns out that that person was shot through the chest in the same place\nEntry and exit of where the bullet ostensibly went through the body and so that becomes a kind of biological source of evidence for reincarnation and these young people\nYou know it's not absolutely evidence but are evidence show but it's still compelling\nIn our film we interviewed Jim Tucker who now works in the same Institute at the University of Virginia that in Stephenson had founded\nAnd he tells the story of a young boy who uh you know very early just about the time he learned to speak remembered being his grandfather and he would tell his dad when his dad was changing his diapers or\nI use to change your diapers and\nIt was kind of shocking for these parents and other sure and then this kid's started\nRemembering other things about the kind of car that he used to drive and so it was a little test the ah parents got a bunch of pictures from the dad and the first of all they had a class picture when he was in elementary school\nAnd so this would be the child grandfather and they asked him to pick out which one was him and he had no problem finding himself in the line up\nAnd then uh they were going through some of the other snapshots and he saw his car\nAnd he said that's my car that's my car I used to drive a car\nAnd so again it's not definitive evidence that there is a kind of um survival of consciousness or identity after ... death but these instances give us really compelling ideas about what is possible\nBugs it's truly remarkable you remember the true story of the little boys who claimed that he was a World War two pilots and she knew things are both the plane landed too hard the tires would blow up and really nobody knew the other than the ... and the pilot\nAnd he was telling his parents mission like in the job the ... and ah they took him to a reunion or a World War two veterans and uh she she knew shovel of the people from his unit it was an amazing story you remember the Jews\nI'm I'm vaguely remembering it I don't remember the details of it but I think you're right these things are phenomenally intriguing and it's very exciting I Know that the University of Virginia right now is hiring a post doc\nTo work part time with them and part time at the Monroe Institute to do some psycho physiological research on this\nThe lab here at Sophia to look at the cycle man's him on this was a a technique that was used by the ancient or colds and greed and say I'm ... ostensibly were able to identify and communicate with spirits\nBy looking at our gazing upon a reflective surface and Raymond Moody developed this protocol where he put people in a darkened room put a mirror on the wall illuminated the mirror and such a way that you couldn't see your own reflection but\nBecause you're kind of going into a trance state people start to see things and hear things and experience things and uh you know there have been a number of experiments looking at\nPeople's ability to make contact with their departed loved ones\nAnd have those kind of conversations that they never had a chance to have and it has been shown to be extremely useful for a brief moment counseling so people have an opportunity to have the conversation they can see it they can see there's the spirits\nAnd so what we're doing now is bringing that idea\nInto a virtual reality environment so we'll have people sitting with the virtual reality goggles are looking at a mirror and a sensory deprivation procedure and\nWe're going to record and try to understand what it is that people are experiencing when they enter that state\nOne of ... special guests alter the researcher Rosemarie Ellen ... uses black ... to do a lot of those ... and that's really really strange\nUh-huh or be interested in talking to her yeah\nYeah just to deal with the charm if you were the marijuana in June get you in touch with her or her website is visionary living dot com you might be more emailers straight through there\nOkay but what you're saying even that title for website is really not so much about what happens after but how those ideas and belief inform how we live now\nAnd you know we know that people are believed different things even within a common culture a I'll have to do is look at the political debate that's happening right now to know that\nPeople justify their beliefs based on different kinds of evidence\nAnd while in our culture we tend to\nUm hold in esteem the idea of ration rationality about reason about the idea of objectivity we we make appeals that if we have good objective data that that then is the evidence that is going to shape our beliefs\nBut what we see is that it's most often something else it's most often a\nPersonal direct experience something emotional or transformative\nAnd that's what really shaped our belief and then we just rationalize the rest of it in the name of objective data\nAbsolutely motionless your guest Dr ... we're talking about the really things really was consciousness and the other side how many people who believe in a life after death also believe in God what do you think the person is Marilyn\nI think it's a tricky question I'm Corinne ... [laughter]\nThat about you George [noise] uh I think that it really depends on what people believe going into it and what they defined God to be\nFor example in um the Christian tradition there can be a lot of fear of you know the afterlife because it can be met with you know\nThere can be a lot of fear of you know the afterlife because it can be met with you know I'm\n... ... ... of course\nRight hell and damnation moms can be very very scary whereas if you're coming from a Buddhist tradition where there isn't a God\nPer se but there's this idea of\nYou know consciousness as the ground of all being so in a certain sense consciousness become God\nA that can be a much more um a beautiful journey towards something that allows us a sense of safety and hope optimism so I think you know those preconditions that shape what our\nLikely to get the most positive outcome\nHousing expert among the options that are right for you\nOr visit making before the dot com or do something\n[noise] news then talk on the radio news radio Thirteen say hey I like ... you\nHave a vote before lunch dot ...

... I have ... ... you know other children law did not believe is\nThat they just go to church all the time but you know you don't believe in the afterlife\nBut the thing is George I have been having just

go off they don't think it'd be fighting all the time was when you read the Bible\nYou know it's always fighting on George you know the Bible I I have read the Bible to into school and everything but the thing is this happened to me when I was seven\nYears old 'cause my two girlfriends were Catholic they went to the Sacred Heart church and um\n[noise] well when they knew I wasn't a Catholic so I went to go with them\nSeven o'clock mass on Sunday and I wouldn't have breakfast too because you get neglect to confession and I didn't eat also but there are ... while they were getting dark

[noise]\nAnd welcome back our final segment with Dr Merrill Lynch lunch Marilyn what do you think of mediums\n[noise] there's been some very interesting research some of my colleagues ...\nIn ... Maryland where do you think of mediums\n[noise] there's been some very interesting research some of my colleagues on the ... and others at the Institute of neurotic sciences we're looking at\nThe possibility that when a medium is getting information that is accurate\nAs compared to when it's inaccurate there may be measurable differences in the brain and in fact that's what they found it was a preliminary study but it showed that when people evaluated\nThe statement made by the medium as having been accurate or correct\nThat the ... the memory center of the brain kind of cleared out it was as though the brains of these mediums we're creating a space for another set of memories to come in I find that extremely provocative and interesting so yeah I think there's\nThere's all kinds of mysteries in this world and science will only begin to approximate some of these experiences that people have\nVery Deanie spent most of his life chasing down mediums wanting to try to communicate with his mother he was a successful [noise]\nWell I think there's been a lot of fraud\nThere's been a lot of myths direction and that doesn't mean that all instances of communication are wrong or inaccurate so\nYou know again it's how do we know what we know and what is the basis of formulating our beliefs are convictions and are they right or not you know it's often we get stuck in places that aren't necessarily the best path forward\nBack to the phones now we go George in Corpus Christi Texas one of those George Europe\nHello George either All right oh just the old what's the other callers call him a higher consciousness or\n... or humanities destiny because little or you know are we going the way it is that going to be the only way you're or they're ribbing rod\nWe do and the the lady before a bottle and she said the ... the heart in mhm I'm a firm believer in it is just so hard on the sole\nOr heart pills what the soldiers' view and the soul who's on and I just want to hear her say about that and a friend who joined so much I Love the show\nBut to joy and scientists are beginning to think the heart is much more than a pope Maryland\nAnd the guts I mean we know that we have multiple sources of intelligence in our bodies\nAnd I think that's extremely interesting\nI don't know and the answer to the question or are we evolving toward a higher consciousness or are we evolving toward greater levels of complexity in technology but I'm ... and our ethics haven't really changed that much I've been watching\nA show on the ... cheese and we know that you know they were catalytic to the time of the renaissance and promoting our ten language and science but\nAt the same time there was enormous corruption and you know people poisoning other people to get them out of the way or you know really creating false narratives about people talk about false news um fake news you know it's been happening and I think people have manage their\nInability to resolve different points of view through violence\nAnd I'm not seeing right now that there's a whole lot of [noise]\nOf different points of view through violence and I'm not seeing right now that there's a whole lot of\nAlternative higher level um meaning centered altruistic kinds of principles that are certainly being communicated in the popular media by our political leaders I'm just not seeing a lot of\nUh references to a hopeful message for our own evolution toward something higher if we want to use that metaphor and it doesn't mean I'm not helpful because I also see that there is tremendous good in the world and often times we just need to shine a light on that I think\nEventually good beach out over evil don't you\nI sure hope so I mean I think if we have an option of what to believe that's a good one to believe in\nYou sound a little ... about that I Am a little um ...\nYeah I'm a little skeptical of how much we can simply just say yes\nEverything's going to be fine you know I'm just not sure that that's really where the story goes I think each of us in our life can make choices and do we want to ah grab hold of our highest potential do we want to develop our social and emotional intelligence\nYou know those things take effort and if not people can just resort back to these kind of base impulses that come from the amygdala and the fight or flight and we don't really get that prefrontal cortex involved in a way that allows us to make wise decisions\nAnd one of the things we see about aging and talking to Alice was that\nUh we know as people grow older or there is this concern that we lose memory but at the same time we gain wisdom so it's as though we get these ... that help us to manage our lives better\nAnd so that's one of the hopeful things at least in terms of our own life development is as we grow older we may lose some of the detail but will gain greater insight\nAll right let's go to the first time caller Michael driving in Ohio Hi Michael go ahead sure\nThere are no one likes I just wanted to call because I had the story that I have to\nListen to the Maryland than I normally listen deal might not ever have anything to say you know I don't have any stories of my own but this one you got one on one I was a kid I was hit by a truck when I was riding my bicycle and I didn't die or anything you know I didn't like have a near death experience that I remember\nGetting hit by the truck\nOr remember hitting the ground and then the next member a habit after that is the sky looking up at the sky\nBut then I looked down and I can see a circle of people around me weigh in on the ground and I was just wondering if that's like something you've ever heard of before like it's not a near death experience but it's definitely it out of body experience\nI live in Maryland you have something like that\nYeah that sounds very similar to my experience and again I think what's helpful in telling each other these stories is that it helps us to remember our own ... instances of this and yeah that sounds like a very\nA predictable kind of near death out of body type experience it suggests that consciousness may have the capacity to move outside of our physical embodiment\nWhat is the new webpage experience the organization of course named after world ritual ... science\nBut whether experienced me\nWell no what it comes from the Greek meaning a direct knowing so you might think about kind of what we've been talking about tonight the difference between\nThe objective rational reasons kind of discourse and then that kind of intuition that bubbles up within us and we might not have a direct reference point\nFor how we know what we now but intuitively we know it and that often can be the most reliable source of guidance for us even

I mean I don't know if I classify to signing of the slasher um but it's certainly a horror film\nAnd and and and ... and ... and a and a good one and I think it's what I mean forty years old or something now right you know these these are these modern horror films are pretty how are you know the rainiest Twenty years old you know so um [noise]\nYou know it's a ... you know a lot of them are are are ah you know whoa hold up pretty well um with age and I I really I think a Halloween the first Halloween is really a pretty suspenseful movie and Donald pleasant this really excellent\nAs kind of like the captain kept trying to stop this uh you know maniacal a killer actually not even maniacal\nThat someone from Nineteen Seventy eight man\nNineteen Seventy eight is a forty year anniversary of the original Halloween imagine it's been that long my gosh\n[noise] uh and John Carpenter who of course uh gave us a the remake of a thing and mesquite from York Ken how bunch of other uh [noise] or films a science fiction a heat of the original concept was\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUh I was terrified of these I mean I I I was like in my Spiderman pajamas a you know just sweating under the coffee table\nShaking with year I'd have to go into the other room I was the kind of a kid that when the skipper we yell at Gilligan during Gilligan's Island I Would have to get out of the rule you know it was a little too little too hot when skipper with ... Gilligan whether it's ... you know\nAnd we were watching a movie like that and I think with a lot of these movies the bonding thing you know fathers son\nKind I'm the same way I was going to talk about that and I I Will but you're exactly right\nAnd and I think it kind of a rite of passage you know and and I think originally I was watching these movies to kind of be with my cat and that he would be in the recliner watching creature features would I be next to him or hiding behind the recliner sometimes\nAnd you know what I think it was maybe I don't know if it was crawling hand or just the hand but they had this very convincing hand to crawl it's embodied hand crawling by itself\nAnd I and and I'm ... I'm ... and it bothered me so much to my dad you know if the rubber hand that face filled with great jelly and you know are manipulating the liar and I'm sure his explanation was dead wrong\nBut but it put it into this perspective a wait this is fun time they're playing this is a show this is this is this is this is a game you know this is something can make a ... this isn't something that just the torture me this is this is something for fun\nAnd I think that there was this kind of an a ha kind of moment and I think from that point forward\nOr I couldn't get enough you know I was a high ... if it were ... and not just for all of your horror I feel is is that under horror an five five I think are under the bigger a guerilla of fantasy though uh\nI think the horror is an offshoot a fan of the ... I I like all of that I like a journal\nYou know uh I think the horror is an offshoot of fantasy in both by by I I like all of that I like uh I like John or movies I like uh [noise] you know monsters and then the robots and injured and pirates and all\nMy dad used to bring me God rest his soul to all these movies when I was a kid\nI I I remember him taking me to see the ... when I was seven years old Mr ... oh yeah and then of course the scary one for me I was nine years old the house on the haunted hill then when the original one with Vincent Price right I mean\nCastle house on how to what I wanted a blind woman in the cellar man I thought\nHe would bring me to all these movies you know I don't know if he brought me because my mom didn't want to go when we\nWhen we just wanted me around but\nI mean all these all these movies he would bring me too\nYeah and then the the TV shows he would love to see science fiction theater in in ... in those kinds of shows right you know you'd have them on all the time I I think he's one of the reasons why my mother is one of the reasons why I got into broadcasting\nAnd I'm you know indoor UFOs and the paranormal but my dad got me into these movies and all these science fiction shows he loved those things\nWill sure you know and all of those and I think it all ties together you know because I think that curiosity you know I'm just the fact like just like a like a show like Star Trek my you know kind of brought us the cell phones and and ah you know all sorts of thing [noise]\nYou know I think that the curiosity for this a cult in a supernatural you know I think it is probably the genesis or the speed of a lot of um your your guests on your show who started watching these uh\nMovies and and decided to go hey let's dig deeper what you know are there goes let's find out\nI think so too what do you think of the Texas Chainsaw massacre Nineteen Seventy four version\n[noise] you know to the Texas Chainsaw massacre gets has had the heaviest wrap everyone was trying to do the Texas Chainsaw massacre where it's hardly a drop of blood in the whole movie\nYou'd think there is you think there is and I\nThink the areas right you know and you go back and watch it and you know it's all filmed murky sixteen millimeter and it's a chainsaw and how weird their house was with all the\nThe mo mobiles made out of phones and you know the the psychological aspect is really what clicked with that movie and I think that everyone that what came after it those were really I think they're really sloppy slap bash [noise]\nYou know a bunch of teenagers waiting to get swat are kind of movies but really as the original Texas cheap or they were they were they were heartbroken when they got an R rating they were trying to get a PG E because they with no one was going to go the it\nThe Nineteen sixty Alfred Hitchcock movie psycho the shower scene you would think you were looking at ... moons every second not won a stabbing did you see in that shower scene\nNo I don't know point does the knife a entered Janet Leigh body at any point a union\nYou know it's happening but you don't see it\nAt the sounds I think out a lot of that and there were a bunch of other there were a bunch of male and that they had laid out and they were stabbing different types of melons\nAnd Hitchcock is staying there spoke Shannon watching this down guy you know making all these weird hollow strange down stabbing all these different fruits and vegetables ... government say a word and as you walk out the door he just says ...\n[laughter] Blair Witch project started with pennies but that was a scary one to\nBlair Witch project is really interesting because\nLou which magic started with pennies but that was a scary one to\nBlair Witch project is really interesting because you know a a you know they were uh unfortunately I had a friend who was ushered when a when that movie came out and he was cleaning up vomit every single night in his job he couldn't handle it\n... and it wasn't because it was scary it was because people had had a become accustomed to the pound footage first person you know just a just a handy cam or a camcorder filming a whole movie\nUm you know so uh you know that was kind of first of the sort of found footage type films\nAnd an independent film and went really big and you know and it's like okay well you can say what you want about that movie but\nYou know that that movie was a that was the director hat final cut and they made the movie they way the way they wanted to make it and they created this whole legend that much more I mean I live in Pennsylvania not far from a where the Blair Witch supposed to happen\nAnd people still dry then they're looking to uncover this thing that never happens do they really really great job\nOf not only are making a a a found footage film but for creating a a a a story that people wanted to believe in and uh you know it's all at nowadays I think that'd be hard to do\nBecause of the Internet it gives you can't keep a secret for twenty second but in Nineteen Ninety nine a fool everybody everyone thought the Blair Witch was the thing\nWhat did you think of Freddie Krueger the nightmare on elm street\nYou know it's interesting I didn't like it when I saw it originally uh you know it just it was kind of just greedy and\nCame out in Nineteen eighty four write\nBeatty for but you know I get I've gone back and there's a lot of humor in it and and it's very manage that said you know he's not just stabbing people going into their dreams [noise]\nUh which I think they pretty liberally ripped off from the movie dream skates which I think came the year before which is an excellent movie that people should seek out\nWhere someone is trying to assassinate the president inside of his dream right uh but uh yeah ... it's actually very clever movie and and uh but any on any of them were never they go five six seven equals yet they're getting pretty bad\nThere was a movie out two thousand fourteen I never saw did she got a weird movie it shows up is one of the horror films have you ever heard of at the bottom of do\nYes I have you know and I did not like the father do pretty much it's Australian film I Believe uh it's about a a mother and her child [noise]\nAnd uh they are basically kind of dealing with the grief of the last of of a spouse or wherever and father um\nAnd I think it manifested in this in this creature that kind of comes alive from a children's storybook which kind of looks like London after midnight you know that like the top hat and kind of fight we're kind of hair\nAnd he's a cartoon out of a children's book uh I didn't really I mean it just it didn't I never really believed that ... but that wasn't the part of it they did like I didn't like that it seemed like a two hour Zoloft commercial\nWhere it was just [laughter] this this allegory for their depression and their grief and that you you don't ever really escape your grief you just have to feed it [noise]\nWhat is it about horror in creepy films that people generally like to be scared\nYou know I think if you you said you won I think there's two there's two aspects of the roller coaster you know there's two kinds of roller coasters you want to you get on it right you get on a roller coaster and you have so much fun but you want to get back on her to get the other kind of a roller coaster is when you get off your kissing the ground [laughter]\nRoller coaster it yeah and they're both fought\nA and I think that you know you you you are you here say you know you get to put yourself in a kind of a mock a mock danger you know and and but really you're safe and then you feel like you've overcome something and I think that it's just that that Russia I think it's just that well\nAnd and again I think it's for a moment there it makes you forget all the really thing we'll things in real life that really do terrified and I think that that that's worth the price of admission five so\nAttacking the cheese and act\nAnd on top dollar for each ten thousand once a year and have only had a few times I getting by driving around ten thousand dollars in fines may not be increased insurance I actually just our income and\nNothing kills the bugs are getting pulled over proposed driving because both driving drunk driving too by the national

it's awesome it's part of the uh because during the ... movies so far the love those yes Greg\nI'm what I told you about is or what your thoughts on the fog and Santa has on what your two of my favorite a horror movies from the early eighties\nUh I I absolutely love fans has been a fan has them was a made on the weekends or the ... the kids who made a fantastically smoke dope all week and then on the weekends they shot ban pass them\nAnd um and when they when a cost to rally or you know took him almost a really long schedule I think it took him almost the whole year\nShoot all the footage for the film and um but when they put it all together a it was a great blend aside by an or and imitate it a lot throughout the eighties I think the kind of hearken that sort of blend of fantasy side by an order that you see\nIn a lotta later a Haiti's films and the tall man stands as one of the most memorable screen villains a full time uh and the fog is truly creepy great film great atmosphere Adrian Barbaro great ghost story about um the lepers or a\nNineteen eighty and come back for the gold through the fog or it's just a so good you know a so many great performances ... workers the priest which I\nAll through the fog uh it's just a so good you know it was so many great performances how home workers the priest which I think was originally supposed to be um\nRonald pleasant but I don't know what he was doing at that time but\nYou know it it just a John Carpenter again we've mentioned several of John carpet assume Halloween being one of them are they live being one of them the fog was one of them so I mean John John Carpenter you know next to Steven King I mean John Carpenter dominated the eighties or with a lot of really wonderful imagine if that fails\nWere these inexpensive movies to make\nA comparatively I mean we weren't like Star Wars movies you know I'm I think that the great thing about a horror film um the beauty of a horror film is that you know you can scare some even take sixty thousand dollars and make fourteen million dollars\nFor you health minister view should absolutely\nThough so so that I think that that's why it's such a hearty genre because you can make it on the cheap usually the darker you make it in the more interesting than it is um the more the mind uh takes over you know the lesser the shark you see the more effective jobs was the last of the alien the\nScarier the alien was so you know there is a lot to the site I think it's very easy to over produce or I think if a horror movie has too much money at it\nIt seems protected you know you look the second Terminator movie\nYou know if it doesn't play out like a horror film like the first one because it's just too much money and it feels like a franchise so um you know a horror film you know you almost need to cap the budget because if you put too much money and do it\nIt stops him like a surprise in in ... the the the train coming down the track no one is going to knowing shouting blue is going to scare you you know so you it has to kind of be\nA slight of hand it has to appear spontaneous and I think that's why a lot of low budget horror films like neither the living dead ... grant a\nAre incredibly scary [noise] and they're cheap\nActors like Bruce Campbell have made a living doing lower budget horror film seventh I\nHave to literally yeah he's like the Olivier of [laughter] he really is\n[laughter] and uh you know and I you know I got to interview him and he's charming guy and ah you know he uh he loves ah you know he pretends he doesn't like it but he he likes it he likes the attention than\nHe likes to paycheck\nTo paycheck absolutely you know and ah I'm evil dead is\nA is a great a film for an actor I mean he pretty much just carrying the whole movie on his back he's putting himself through\nA you know all of these ... it's almost like a Chapel Hill where it's just it's huge just following through all of these tap blows that they've created for him so it's it you know ... not too many actors can can carry a whole movie on their back\nWhat do you think of the Stephen King movies from his books that all seemed to have that type feeling for a pet cemetery in things like that\nYeah I mean I I like Stephen King films a lot more than the books I I mean but I mean I'm a film guy and people always say oh well the book was better it's like they're not exchange commodities you know I mean a dance is different than a sculpture\nYou know ... book is different than a movie or just you know when you're in the mood for a movie you you you know I in the mood to read a book and vice versa and uh\nYou know what works in a book doesn't work in a movie and I I think that a lot of my favorite Stephen King stuff is all the short stories\nI think his novels or to a padded too long winded you know what I understand about Stephen King and I you know I've never met them\nShort stories I think his novels or to a padded too long winded you know what I understand about Stephen King and I you know I've never met the man but you know he doesn't know where the story ends when he starts he just he just keeps writing he he used to just as surprised as we are because\nHe just keeps writing a and drinking and writing and ... you know and and then uh you know five hundred pages later it's done\nSo there's NO PLAN going in ... which I think allows for him to the ... you know again ... there was no formula so I think that I think that that's why his books are so surprising but I think at the same time [noise] you know a good director can kind of well back down\nTo its asked him you know he hated the film is shining and the film is shining I think stands as one of the best pieces of art you know the twentieth century so I you know I don't know\nWhat about TV shows that are dealing with horror like the walking dead and things like that\nOr you know it's interesting 'cause you know I mean the walking dead I definitely I feel like owns everything tonight of Olympic that yes and now it's kind of come down to the main stream come down to the front line you know you go into the wall Mart and you see the\nYou know the the rubber ears that you're hanging around your neck or the you know the whatever dead inside a signs and you know it it's all um it's a ... very commercial\nUm you know I
