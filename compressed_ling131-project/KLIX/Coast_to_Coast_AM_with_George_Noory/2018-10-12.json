say well what we're going to do now is we're just going to send out our butts their algorithms to look at the tone of the voices how they're how they're voicing their opinions we don't want to create

all because of the fact people are tired of being silence that doesn't mean they're not going to stop their silencing\nIn fact I had a friend of mine told me I just tonight that uh she was attempting to put something on my site and it was erased right after she put it up uh in fact there was another uh actually there was another email I got to where apparently uh someone had put something up or on

CIA are and that's why guy in Las Vegas everything went wrong so you know we're all about that stuff all that corruption so yes we know that this\nThat whenever something happens like this you're talking about you know agencies and what have you and you'll find out I think we'll find out in the very end Indian Game here is that it's the agencies that are manipulating everything\nNot of the agencies here in the United states agencies all over the world that there is a cabal of intelligence ops miners are doing this every country that they see that they can actually bring down okay and that and that's been that's been something that's been a conspiracy theory of mind for a long time\nAnd I've never really talked about it but um\n'cause I don't consider myself a conspiracy theorist but you have my own theories that I'd made and one conspiracy theory that I have about this whole Russian meddling thing that I never really got to because it really wasn't relevant as as relevant as it could be later on his bat the deep state that we talk about is not\nA a deep state that he's devoted to one party or another I mean does it most the most conservatives would have you believe the deep sense of bunch of liberal you know bastards in there I I Want to bring down Trump no no no no the deep state\nFrom all over the world that want to bring down the United states of America is a bigger bigger pot that they want to topple has nothing to do with Trump the only reason why they're going after Trump is because Trump is easy reason why Trump is easiest because Trump has a nationalist and they can immediately discredit him in some national\nAs white supremacist Bozo and it'd be easy to do because he loves to play into it and he loves to get the media all worked up and stuff\nFor the trail matter is is the deep state that I talk about and that I personally think exists is a deep state that is worldwide and the worldwide cabal of agencies and agents are the ones that are trying to bring Trump down not some it's not some left wing conspiracy of Kelly ... economy on Conway's said\nThe Christian I'm poor through it that Hillary Clinton then she rebounded with wells

tell people which parts of the world which types of companies will come back stronger or not so that's an extra advantage goal you know imagine if you could buy gold at four to seven hundred dollars in next time it\nGoes to four thousand instead of two thousand so no that that's the real advantage when when they correct as much it happens quickly\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that that nothing nothing beats that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down at the present and they don't have any net worth left to buy things\nWhen they're on as well what did the indicators market the last two days is really taking it on the Jim what's the cause is it just panic or ... what's happening\nWhat will will to things in and actually they both relate back to the good old Donald\nUm last week you saw 'em treasury bond yields you know the yields on on the risk free ten and thirty year\nBonds shoot up I'm rather dramatically and we were predicting this would happen we said look at the thirty year treasury bond breaks up above through three point two percent it's probably going to go to four point three percent in less than a year and that's going to raise mortgage rates and that hurts stocks because now bonds are more attractive and\nStock values are based on you know low interest rates are higher for stock values and higher or lower it\nSo you know that that was the first thing that happened but the second thing is is you know concerns over China I mean is this trade war yes it may be a good thing to do in China may be cheating and a lot of ways by China's been the fastest growing economy in the world it's already stalling and slowing\nAnd now it's slowing more in the markets are concerned oh my gosh\nIf China keeps slowing here that's going to trigger a worldwide a downturn in crash and so so it was rising interest rates\nAnd um and then more you know concerns about China it's market just broke a key point we've been talking about\nFor the last month at twenty six forty\nI'm you know that doesn't sound like much but it was fifty five hundred not you know and then a few years ago it crashed forty five percent of three months and then I had this kind of limp rally for years and has been waiting to go back and we said look it breaks twenty six forty that that's a sign that China is starting to go down again\nAnd it in ... did that and the last two days it's a twenty five eighty right now so that's another sign that there's something wrong and then again that was the biggest concern a lot of people keep thinking oh it's just more interest rates no the interest rates was the first whack\nThese last two days had a lot more to do with China and Trump is really pushing this trade war and it is dangerous even though it may be a good policy and a lot of ways and Trump has been losing the economy with tax\nCuts and all this sort of stimulus and stuff and that causes inflation to go up which it has and it causes grows to go up temporarily and what does the Federal Reserve gonna do they're going to raise interest rates that's what they do it the economy's overheating they raise interest rates if it's slowing the lower interest rates which they now they've done for nine years which is ridiculous\nAnd and and now Trump screaming oh my gosh you know I created this great thing and the trumps wrecking it no this was predictable he's not you know he's got some you know gut feelings we gotta do this and that he's not savvy at all when it comes to the consequences\nOf things and the economic impacts he basically is probably the prime rib\nI'm pulled back now it hasn't gotten dangerous yet but it came right to that um yesterday's\nClose what have you read in a couple of more D's downturns tomorrow we have another five hundred point drop I mean then people started saying there's something wrong\n[noise] yes yes we were just at that point we we have to remember we had a we had a crush on like this at the beginning of the year the markets peaked in in late January real kind of like blow off top classic thing and then that that was looking like it could have been a tough\nWe have a correction a sharp correction just like this it was down about ten to twelve percent and different markets but then it stopped\nAnd and and it stopped right about here you know where we are now and then it kinda like went sideways and then it came back up that's the trick George I've learned from when when you got above all of this magnitude\nWhat happens when it does finally burst in and that's when the smart money finally says okay this things over and they start selling and shorting to market\nIt happened very quickly you'll see you know I've seen this the last seven stock bubbles throughout the history of everything from the Nikkei and the early nineties and the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash and then every other one in the last century including the tech rack and recent bubbles\nThat first crash will be forty two percent on average in the first two and a half months with people get\nWalk and that's the sign that that's the only way you know that the bubble has finally birth the problem is by time dot coms people are already in trouble and they're panicking and they get whacked card so\nBut the the danger sign is if we keep going down and and and literally I the markets do look like they're going to open up tomorrow but that'd be that's just the balance after you know fourteen hundred points it may open up two to three hundred points tomorrow that's nothing so far but it is bouncing off a critical level we've been warning our subscribers\nSeventeen hundred on the S. and P. five hundred and twenty five thousand um to doubt if the market breaks that that's the first sign that something's wrong and yes the markets and the traders are going to take that as a bad sign and you'll see another steep sell off and then the odds keep going up\nThat this is a top and it it is a is a top we've got not fifty were fifty four percent like last crashes can be more like Seventy eighty percent or more over a few years and and again the first half of that crash\nWill happen in the first two to three months typically and that's what make problems so dangerous [noise] um uh you know\nThe Rothschild guy Baron Ross child wants to know when somebody asks what what was the secret his wealth in the Eighteen hundreds I think he was the wealthiest man of the world he said you know I always sold a bit early because that's how this level to this is a bubble this isn't a normal bull market\nThat correct so nice staircase manner and goes down bubbles go up dramatically and they crash and and half the time and they crashed twice\nAs dramatically so so that's why I warn people so hard on this\nThis is a once in a lifetime of vent\nAnd it it the signs to me are building we've been telling people man this looks like a top here and if it doesn't top here and we only get\nThe good part is we can gauge as if we only get a normal ten Fifteen Percent or so correction by the end of the year than we're probably good for one more route one more Trump rally into next year before this thing blows but the\nRight now though the odds are shifting towards ah it's already happening so people should be on alert\nThe two thousand seven two thousand they subprime mortgage crisis will this be as bad as that time period\n[noise] ... well this is worse because what's happened is if we did and we of course we were warning about that George ... decades in advance on demographics\n[noise] ... well this is worse because what's happened is that we did and we of course we were warning about that George ... decades in advance on demographics the baby boom peaking\nAnd and and and causing a down turn off the greatest boom in history but but also the subprime crisis was the trigger and we also had record debt levels I mean\nI'm Around the world but especially in developed countries well what happened after the two thousand eight nine crash is we had a big debt bubble in emerging countries\nAnd then of course China's been off the charts for now for Thirty years and then their debt has grown sixty four times just since two thousand just in the last Seventeen Eighteen years so\nLow interest rates and the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries hate developed countries too but we were already too much in debt so we just kind of like went sideways and didn't elaborate our debt emerging countries want on this free and they added sixty to Seventy ... trillion more\nOn top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred trillion in debt and financial asset bubbles around the world [noise]\nAnd and do what was her cracking you see turkey blowing up you see Venezuela with hyper inflation or runs in trouble\nChina is slowing and and like I said they have the biggest that Bob ... of anybody in any time in history when China blows that we're we're going to be worse so so my view is no this is going to be worse than the two thousand two thousand nine recession and stock crash\nBecause they stopped at with massive money printing they just literally stop that they just build the top backup with money that was draining this time more debt\nEverything's more stretch the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have worse debt bubble crashes and stuff and we do so this is going to be worse so instead of uh like I said earlier instead of a fifty four percent crash look for Seventy to eighty per\n... off absolutely huge and that doesn't mean the companies are doing bad here we stay with us we'll talk about that when we come back curious dance with us is website is his name ...

T. dot com couple of his books include the Democrat demographic cliff the sale of a lifetime and zero a\nGhost insiders the new version of the coast to coast am Abu no available Rawhide bone in no Android who not owned above ... on demand anywhere anytime good acoustic goes to um dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nAnd welcome back to ... with the cherry so if we have quality companies that have solid earnings they've got money in the bank their stocks could still get hit when everybody else gets hit and they go down but it doesn't mean that companies going to go out of business right\n[noise] right again well any time you get a major downturn in a recession or stock crap like that some companies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure and that's a good thing recessions are necessary the Federal Reserve and government the recessions is bad thing\nThey're good things um but and then you want to buy the company that survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a Super Bowl I mean the tech bubble took five years to build but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half\nUp six to seven times kind of like the bitcoin bubble here recently cracked in a lot of companies when other well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon if it apart Amazon there oh my God I was\nYou know like a you know a hundred and fifty dollars and now it's like you know gotten up to you know sixteen hundred or something like that so that's the time to buy the best companies\nAnd you want to look at who are the strongest companies okay those are the ones that are actually get the most overvalued in a bubble like this but they're also go down I mean General Motors in the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash\nWent down Ninety three percent that ended up being that was it ended up being the greatest company in the world for decades after that you\nCould have bought it for nothing so that's the secret and and the other thing is even if the earnings of companies if companies are so good\nThat they keep their earnings flat instead of declining evaluations on stock how many times earnings white people pay thirty times earnings for the typical stock right now or forty and and sixty or eighty for the best tax time\nDoes collapse just because investors get fearful and so a stock and go down fifty percent even if its earnings don't decline and then of course most companies' earnings do decline for that's how they end up down eighty percent\nHere you say you have a secret indicator for looking at some of these dangers what is that\n[noise] yeah yeah you know it it's called the smart money\nYou know if you tell us it's not a secret anymore\nWell I Know I Know believe me Wall Street won't do this any way so you don't have to worry but\nBut what what happened to their the smart money or the people who who kind of push ups stopping in and then when things go down there that wants to jump in and buy when when when they see the old investors are over Boston in stocks or about they're the ones that short for us I mean they're in the know and and and they can even watch\nSee the old investors are over Boston in stocks over about they're the ones that short for us I mean they're in the know and and and they can even watch all of us are doing their the sharks that eat all of us minnows that's how they make money they're they're the best traders and stuff [noise]\nWell they you can measure this action whether there's an index from Bloomberg called the smart money flow index\nAnd what they do is the dumb money ... acts in the morning the first thirty minutes\nI mean because the biggest moves in the market come overnight again the smart money the traders have already made their positions in the futures market there ahead of everything and so the market's gonna open down it opens down\nRight at the open or it opens up if it's going to jump most of the moves that may well that's when the dumb money and most people would stop or something to protect themselves\nThat's one of those reactions made that's a dumb money\nThe smart money watches the market during the day they can even running and jumping tested a little bit shorter do this\nThey make their positions in the last half hour into the clothes so they measure this indicator measures but the smart money doing versus a dumb money and the smart money\nHas not bought this rally in fact they'd been shorting it they've been betting against this rally ever since that bottom February this year after that crap\nNow they bought into the last rally they bought into the Trump rally they bought into the to January top early this year but once that crash happened they have not bought him this rally and it's been one of the steep is declines and smart money buying and that has\nBeen a strong warning signal to me uh in in recent months into our subscribers\nAre you in Puerto Rico now\nI Am in Puerto Rico and I went through a hurricane worse than Michael I had to hold my windows from blowing out my condo it was so bad it was unbelievable because the difference between Maria here\nAnd Michael both of them similar force but this storm hung over us for twelve to fourteen hours in Michael at least pass through so I Know what these people are going through it is unbelievable\nUh to watch everything I mean windows blowing up all around me you know you walk out the next morning and the all the leaves are off trees and you know everything you know blown over and stuff it it it's just unbelievable it's it's like can you know God got angry or something you know into through a temper tantrum looks aren't you moved there\nWell I moved there because I had a vacation home I've been working on for years and coal labor which is one of the Virgin Islands but it's in Puerto Rico people don't know that Puerto Rico has the acres and collaborate to islands that are like St Thomas and St Croix or St John\nAnd and you know no passport to come there is a U.S territory so I was building a house there in in I was in Tampa we'd been care taking my wife's family\nFor many many years had to move from Miami we're about to move back to Miami but I'm we're down here working on this place spending more time in San Juan which has gotten much better in the last decade than it was when I first started coming\nAnd I said to my why don't we move here we're in a condo that's a quarter of the price of beach front top quality and a quarter the price of South Beach Miami where we used to live and and we're now I go around the corner from my condo to the small local airport which I get to twenty minutes in advance they only check your id they just wait to\nSee how you're going to tilt below not sure I liked that part well it's fun to play it it's a thirty minute low altitude plane flight it scenic I'm I'm I leave my condo during\nAnd landing on this island in one hour and once I got down here I realized I could qualify for some tax advantages here which are very compelling I mean anybody that trade stocks or or investments for a living and the crypto guys are coming down here because of that\nAnd businesses that can qualify there's real\nAnybody that trade stocks or or investments for a living and the crypto guys are coming down here because of that\nAnd businesses can qualify there's real strong tax advantages so I'm living much cheaper than a man of great climate I can still fly to New York\nIn four hours director Miami in two hours and then almost anywhere in the east coast\nIs now it's difficult if I'm coming out your way but I have to go out to California which I just did for a long pole ad that the long haul now but I tell ya I I like it down here they'd been in a recession there's no civil unrest a recession for twelve years\nWe're about to have a civil war between blue and red factions and we got three point seven percent unemployment they got twelve to Fifteen Percent air and I don't see any civil unrest so I feel good down here for now\nAnd then I'm just going to see what happens in the next\nAre so many years the big banks down there [noise] yeah yeah\nYeah about ... and ... down here at actually a lot of the banks are by banker popular and Santander are Spanish Banks because this is by origin more of a Spanish\nCountry but you know and we've got most of the big box stores and nice malls and stuff but they there are George my biggest problem with a lot of people on the on Amazon and the Internet don't realize that you can ship here on the U.S postal service\nSo people either just because they think we're in Zimbabwe or they charge some huge acts and there's a lot of things little things I used to get on the Internet free I Can't find here that's my biggest frustration I Can't find my radios special pasta sauce and things like yeah but otherwise man this is a good deal and\nYou know I'm Down here for other reasons but I'd say people ought to be Americans ought to be consider retiring here housing in general is sixty percent lower education for for people's ah kids it's sixty percent lower um\nEither we they vote in our elections I don't know how many Americans really understand that that they are allowed to vote in our elections\nWill will most important they are allowed to freely mover immigrate they don't have to even apply and in most Puerto Rico a lot of young people they get a a an inexpensive good education near the education system here is good\nThen they moved to the U.S where they can make twice as much and how much better job opportunities\nAnd then when they get older and have kids guess what they do a lot of the Puerto Ricans will move back to Puerto Rico\nTo put their kids through colleges or dental school or medical school here and save a ton of money and then sometimes a lot of times I'll just stay and retire here but but also a lot of older Puerto Ricans now are moving to the United states why\nSixty two percent of all Puerto Ricans are in the U.S and most of them now are moving to Florida\nAnd so these these older people realize their kids and or their grandkids are in the U.S and they end up moving to the U.S so the U.S is getting highly educated good immigrants\nFrom Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico keeps losing people and that's why they have these tax programs the IRS decides and the government decides the U.S\nIs better to help create good jobs down here the tax advantages rather than just out now subsidized Puerto Rico because the U.S as always always rubbing their best people and again it it's they're more professional educated people that are leaving not the not the everyday people so it's actually a good deal for the U.S\nSo I Want you to use your best impressions on what you think will happen economically over the next year this country seems to be mired right now in\nA conflict emotion it's unbelievable I've

was his point\nHe well he's saying that that you know the the RED People don't like that these are people who are going to vote blue and we got this blue red war so when they see Puerto Ricans he's saying come to Rochester well we don't like him and he said they're not as high skilled while I'm telling ya in Orlando they're not saying that they're they are basically\nUh reinvigorate in Orlando

taken away Gregory right yes my question George and good morning I'm just like\nTo say I live in a congressional district in northern New Jersey\nWe get thirty percent of our federal tax dollars back the blue states subsidized they're red states and the and the state that receives the most was Kentucky where the idiot McConnell is I I just tries me nuts and it's been like this for fifty years we subsidize the south in the southwest the northeast does an SOS the mid west\nAnd I was ... um for your guest I've been reading the Financial Times for many years and what you're saying is his column every week scaring the heck out of all of us with with what you're saying [noise]\n... will be closer to home I'm about four years from retirement for like thirty five years almost forty years far entity which was nationwide ... through New York\nOur pension was over funded in the late nineties it took a horrendous hit with this time the tech stocks and then in two thousand they almost could obliterate his got wiped out we have a meeting now there's thousands of is about to retire right all high tech guys and gals the whole thing\nWe have a meeting in about three weeks that are into the ... and I don't trust any buddy on Wall street I think there should be a ... year teen set up there if you will again\nFrom heaven and come back but the thing is what do we ask our financial people who are running our pension fund with their fancy suits what are they doing to dissipate this problem and I'll take your answer off the air [noise]\nYeah you know real quick they these two problems not only the stock market starts collapsing everybody's been driven end of the stock market because quantitative easing in monetary policy's push down long term rates that you can get on safer investments\nLike treasury bonds and corporate bonds and things like that which pension plan should be more end but but you can't get your seven to eight percent returns they used to get with a conservative combination of stocks and bonds so everybody's gone more stocks and then stock start collapsing\nThan they are in trouble the truth is as much as it's counter intuitive a pension plan today the best thing do what we're telling people right now this this break up and ... is going to make bond as\nA corporate bonds and treasury bonds long term more attractive if that thirty year treasury bond goes up to four point three percent we're telling our subscribers this is likely to happen in the next several months of the next year at the most you're\nGoing to want to lock those and not only to get a four point three percent return is way better than almost any stock the evidence but those bonds will appreciate when stocks collapse and the economy slows down\nAnd interest rates go down bonds like falling interest rates are right now is not the time to buy these bonds but there's going to be a huge opportunity for investors\nAnd pension funds to lock in quality bonds it's only the quality bonds that did well in the great depression AAA corporate [noise]\nTen in thirty year treasury bond lock in those things for appreciation and for higher yields and don't be in stock the worst place to be for pension plan is to do what everybody's that run into stocks and collapse and you also write about blue states subsidizing read\nThat's why I think this time around it's going to be the blue states that succeed against red policies that they don't agree with but most of all they're like okay\nSee what happens to your red economy when New York and California or when the north east and the west coast succeed from the union it'd be would it would be a problem\nLet's go to Thomas in California he Tom go ahead\nHey George thank you for taking my call sir Harry your

or two you know with a lecture magnetic poles\nIt's cetera what is the probability of a shooting war\nYou know I think that's much more likely between emerging countries you know like India and Pakistan I'm\n... but what we're saying and zero hour we we trade global trade back to the Eighteen hundreds and there was a big surge into World War one people don't realize globalization global trade collapsed six\nWorld War one and World War two with the great depression in the middle with a big trade war with rising tariffs just like we're seeing now everything's happening like happened Mitt this works ... it's it everybody does the selfish thing as a country but it works against the whole everybody loses or at least most countries loose\nAnd and that's what's happening now this trade war with China whether it ends up a shooting war or limited like you say in the south China Sea that could definitely be stopped there there's no question there's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe and Russia there could be limited because\nNobody is big enough to challenge just the one advantage we have is there's there is no counter bailing power that could really take us on one on one\nSomebody hit us they would be dead long before we were so I think that's kind of a good thing or in in the early Nineteen hundreds of Nineteen hundred no there were major countervailing powers have how you could have World War two but we're gonna definitely have\nA political huge political jeez this trade or we said it's zero hour before this became obvious this is gonna last two to three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and\nThere there could be some physical or but there's certainly going to\nBe huge a political at

thank you again for the amazing information you always give us\n[noise] yup love the richer people George because people need to hear this\nJason in Portland, Oregon welcome to the program Jason go ahead\nYeah Harry I Want to ask you about a particular sector of the market it's the new sector it has to do with the ... and I happened to it in mid July just before the infusion in the canopy growth with the beverage company\nWhich happened to be pretty good timing and I took a portfolio and actually doubled in value on about fifty thousand up two hundred thousand portfolio but my question is would you um would this kind of be offered a little bit particularly and feel the uh election this November because\nThere are several states that are looking to uh that have it on the ballot and if they legalize usually when that happens there is a kind of like an upswing or would you pull out of that now because of this that danger of ah what you're talking about taking place\nYou know yeah that's a good question because I mean first of all this is a long term trend and even block chanting crypto currency is our but all of these industries above all these these are hot sector like this will get hit strongly\nWhen we have a downturn because first of all everything gets hit but the the the strongest sectors get hit the most 'cause they bubble up the most and people don't understand that same with high in real estate is the best places are going to crash the most and history has shown that so you\nDo have I mean I I Would say in this case you may want to hold on just to the election and see it as a pop but yes I Do think center in such a hot sector take your games see what happens the next few\nYears especially the next year is going to be critical and then yeah things crash that is a good sector to get back into this is a long term social political Trent it's going to go in that direction\nAlthough there may be some backlash and the downturn just because people get a little more conservative for a while but but you are in a good sector but yes I I don't want to be an actor\nWhen it when things crash and and and that's what a lot of people miss a lot of people say well this sector\nDr but yes I I don't want to be an actor\nWhen when things crash and and and that's what a lot of people miss a lot of people say well this sector will do All right because I went and the great depression the entire thirties and look for one any major sector you know toilet paper um utilities movies you know boos you know things that people would maybe use more than a downturn\nAnd and because of that collapse and valuations and that fear factor everything went down I couldn't find anything any major stock sector that made money in the Nineteen thirties only the high quality bombs that so yeah take your games\nYeah again in your case I might just see these elections pop and then and\nThen go the other way or do fifty fifty you know it it's up to you but there is danger there you're right about that\nPeriod when they when the bottom falls out hunting you know what you do you how do you know when the pop back in\nWhat will again I mean we have clear we look at past corrections I mean everything's different this is not like you know the eighty two thousand eight to nine cracked and it's not like the seventies correction stock corrections back then were fifty percent\nThat's more typical this is more like these great resets ... de leveraging of a bubble debt and financial assets which of course stock is are the leading ones\nWhen that happened is Seventy percent is kind of the minimum you look for in up to eighty and in in the Nineteen twenty nine crashed eighty nine percent for the ... eighty nine percent so\nI'm looking for levels like that I think my range is Seventy five percent minimum up to eighty five percent that's when you start\nLooking to buy and again we have the same thing on the flip side for bonds right now that thirty year treasury bond which is a been a three point four percent recently if that gets up to over four percent between four and four point three percent that's when I started by even though that's the best thing in the downturn\nIt's too early to buy that right now if you're going to park you might just be unsafe\nShort term bonds and CDs and T bills and stopped to preserve your money next step is moving to the long term quality bonds and then\nAnd and and the sectors I mean commodities while in emerging markets overseas will probably bottom first\nAnd then developed countries stocks and then real estate so there'll be a succession of buying opportunities so I mean and stuff like that you're in a good market like like like like a marijuana and pot industry especially the medicinal side which is a slam dunk winter long term [noise]\nWait for the guy you may get to buy into that a little earlier than something like you know home builders\nNext on that one has to do good Kentucky first time caller for cello Alan\nHey George a lot of the show you Sacramento\nCorrect me if I'm wrong here but red states are Republican yeah OK stature Democrat Democrat or make then did you not say earner did I miss I understand you've met you said the south was ran during the civil war\nYes they they would have been they would have been more even though\nKnow they called Lincoln a Republican back then the Republican Party was not the same I Know my father help build the Republican Party in the south and help get Nixon elected through southern voters\nAnd that's a whole different party he had to convince a lot of democratic politicians and senators that they were really Republican they were Democrats traditionally all the way back to the civil war so the Republican democratic label actually was the opposite back then no you're right I mean read\nIs Republican blue as Democrats\nThe Republican democratic label actually was the opposite back then no you're right I mean read is Republican blue is Democrat in the present time frame and then the Republicans in charge now if you do see a major downturn I Am just have to tell you from history it is going to favor\nThe Democratic party just like it did in the thirties where you had Republicans who were coming into that when things crash they go to the people that are going to hand out money to the people there that you know the Democrats I'd go to the Democrats\nIn a downturn in a ... in a bull market and the rich are getting richer and a lot of innovation that favors the Republicans we are our long term research shows we are going to switch from a Republican area here\nTo democratic one for a number of decades and that's just something you know the blue people are gonna like that the red people won't but all I Do is report the facts I'm I'm not\nPart is and and my work Republicans are always going to be here Democrats it's it's a play of opposites that's just as important as men and women and booms and Boston inflation and deflation and every other play of opposite\nAnd it goes back and forth the same thing the west has dominated the world uh since since uh the industrial revolution well guess who's going to dominate in the coming decades and even century it's going to be the east and that's another trend and we can clearly show through cycles so so what we do\nIs just show people here's the trends this sector that sector inflation deflation\nThis country that country blue ... I mean we can do all this stuff in the long term it's surprisingly predictable\nAnd that's where Congress get it wrong condoms think the short term predictable I'm guessing when I tell you I think this thing's going to top now or so many months from now I'm making an educated guess that may make me sixty to Seventy percent right but never hundred when I tell told people Twenty years ago baby

I've ever had I mean there I was bouncing on the ceiling\nMay looking at my body and bad I had stayed home from school I never miss school but I had a fever that day and I didn't go with my mother said uh\nGeorge you don't go stay in bed\nAnd I took a nap and I woke up again and this time I was looking down at myself I thought it was a dream Randy Raybon a at that point it's lamb ... back into my body I woke up I was jarred um\nEleven years old I don't know what the heck happened to me yeah about eventually I got my way into a library you know weeks later\nShe stumbled into the um psyche grown section I guess and found a book on astral projection and sure enough I said that's what happened to me but I've not been able to do it since then at least in my awake moments\nWell in my case also with the ... it was completely spontaneous I wasn't trying to do it I didn't know anything about it\nUm I just like you I just found myself floating on the feeling letting down at my body and dead but you know there there are ways to produce and out of body experience there is a neurologist in Montreal Dr ... field was April ... who is mapping out the different areas of the brain\nAnd he if he put on a pickle stimulation on the right temperature attacks he's able to produce and not have body experience [noise]\nThat that doesn't tell me the out of body experience originates in the band that tells me that the that everybody's being will protests the out of body experience\nUm and you know the types of out of body experiences we had quite straightforward\nUm they weren't complicated but some people as you say it can be called astral projection around novel people can leave not just their their body but they can leave the room they can leave their house you know they can actually traveled to different locations\nAbsolutely now do you find that to the people who tend to have these kinds of experiences are believers in the paranormal or not\n[noise] I'd say no not at not at not initially because when this happened to me I certainly wasn't a believer I didn't even know such a thing as possible and I've just kind of learned about the paranormal as I go along and as I have these experiences\nUm another strange experience I had when I was a student um when I was Nineteen years old that and how it's affecting you\nAnd says I'm another strange experience I had when I was a student um when I was Nineteen years old and has the second year medical student I dreamt of us Rajiv exam then that before the exam and when I went to the examined next day the first question on the exam at the same as the first question in my green\nCost you have the answer that you knew exactly\nSo I felt like that dream helped me past my exam that I didn't tell anyone about it because it seems so unbelievable in fact if someone had told me that story I probably wouldn't have believed that\nThe name of the book is called the borders of normal with the subtitle a clinical psychiatrist you by the way these stigmatized says paranormal phenomena tell me about the book\nWell one of the reasons I wrote this book is you know as I say in the subtitle I'm trying to de stigmatize paranormal phenomena\nBecause what I found and this is my own experiences raw when people have these experiences they tend not to talk about them because they think people are gonna think they're weird or their stranger there's something wrong with him or they're losing their mind is something like that [noise]\nThat I'm trying to say that a lot of people have these experiences it's quite normal to have these experiences I mentioned that the word paranormal for example the ... pero mean beside so we have paralegals working beside lawyers have paramedics Paralympics and so on\nThe parent normal I mean beside normal it doesn't mean abnormal\nAnd there is still to this day a lot of stigma attached to talking about these phenomena and I find when I give her reading or if I give a talk somewhere people come up to me afterwards and share with me things that have happened to them which they've never told anyone\nSo I'm trying to make it more acceptable for people to talk about these things and that was really what motivated me to read the book\nDid you ever come across research from a psychiatrist who has died named Dr ...\nNo I'm not familiar with\nHis shoes or her oh her in a it was my aunt and she was she went to a Oxford University and she got her degree in psychiatry yeah and specialized in all kinds of things and then decided\nShe was given all that up to study telepathy and when that's all she did she wrote a couple of books one was called breakthrough the creativity of but she was convinced totally convinced\nThat the ... the was the real deal and uh and again the psychiatrist seen that and so you're the only only other psychiatrists I Know\nThat has really jumped into this\n[noise] I don't know I'd like to look for that ... that sounds very interesting um breakthrough to creativity I'm definitely gonna look for it but you know they're being on a written by physicians but near death experiences for example even Alexander ... who for having me up\nAnd he's a neurosurgeon and marry the meal she goes to heaven and back to the north and the the surgeon and of course Oliver Sacks is in ... he wrote a book called hallucinations so physicians have written about these things that I haven't found another attack as to who's written about paranormal\nYeah you're going to enjoy that I mean she she just the the the devoted her entire career to that uh she uh she passed away in a very bizarre way she was in the bath tub in a radio\nFilled in their own no I Hope to God I wasn't listening to my show oh no you that's terrible it was just a a one on how does he gets\nSo interested in a lot of the\nJust always was and uh there were so many things that had happened to her and she just decided there's something to do this and she's going to study it and she she went into it and the ...\nWell I Know there's been some studies done on telepathy at my monitor his medical center in New York where they were studying dream telepathy the ability to transmit information to people who are dreaming and in that study they had Sanders and receivers\nAnd the receiver it's we're in a sleep lab\nAnd they were hooked up to the ... um the AG could measure what we call REM sleep rapid eye movement\nAnd then once the ... gene state the Centers for giving random images and they were told to concentrate on the images I Try to send them to receivers and they found that people were more susceptible to ... to ... the when the sleep and it's also true that people are more\nSusceptible to a lot of the when they're under hypnosis so there are ways to augment leprosy but in my case and in most people's cases it just happens spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to take a quick break we'll be back with the more Dr mini majors where those his book the borders of normal [noise]\nGo students ... new renewable coast to coast am apple is now available for I don't\nAndroid for not only\nListen live on demand anywhere anytime\nGhouta goes to goes to U.

Eighteen percent of them had a new report in the near death experience\nBut it's that experience is due to lack of oxygen to the brain and they would have all had it because they all have a lack of oxygen the brain not just a ... a small percentage\nDid you do a lack of oxygen to the brain than they would've all headed because they all had a lack of oxygen the brain not just a ... a small percentage [noise]\nSo you know that's one thing but then the other thing is that um these experiences are reported around the world not just in the U.S there's a lot of cross cultural studies that show that these experiences are in many different countries and the v being reported throughout time\nAnd one study looked at patients who are on medication versus patients who learned on medication and the patients who weren't on medication who weren't confused and he didn't have a shortage of auction to the brain had the same experiences and were able to report them just as often as the other patients so [noise]\nUm people are skeptical I think for a good reason and I think it's good to be skeptical [noise] but it's also good to keep an open mind\nWell that's that's true in ... you you've talked about under deathbed visions that they sometimes see a little bit more than just a family member they see other kinds of visitors is well explain that\n[noise] well the other visitors aside from family members\nThey could be someone that they were very close to or sometimes they report angels coming to the others I'm coming to take them to the other side\nUm especially with children and there was a pediatrician mouth and Martha Stewart is dying children and he said the dying children didn't report deceased relatives because their parents and their relatives and friends are all still living but they've reported seeing angels that we're having to take them to the other side\nI had an experience at my father's funeral where I thought to angel is one of the other side of the costs and\nDid anybody else either\nNo so I could say I know they were a product of my own brain no one else saw them but in my own mind I saw those angels and they were just as clear as day standing right in front of me\nAnd I had the idea that thought came into my mind that they were called minutes during angels and they had the idea that they were minister and my father to help them make the transition it's the next level of the next world and they made the most beautiful creatures\nAnd I didn't know what you make that that that's really when I decided I Need to start telling people about what's going on because that was too much for me to keep to myself\nDid they see you I don't think so okay I don't think there were there for me I think there were there for my father\nRight so they didn't acknowledge you know even though you saw them\n... ... [noise] now the other thing is when you say in terms of deathbed visions [noise] you know um\nIf they were produced by certain chemicals than my with the um visitors only ... the people who are deceased why wouldn't they be other people as well the other thing is sometimes these visions of these people\nThey're the person who is dying doesn't know there may be a a brother or sister who had died is the case where there was a car crash and ... all one brother died and the other brother was near death\nSo the the brother that was near death had the vision of his dad brother but he hasn't been told that his brother had died in the same accident he didn't know that there was then and there are other cases like that to where the the deathbed visitors\nThe person who is dying didn't know that that person was actually dead but because of the family wanted to spare them the knowledge\nPre cognitive dreams give us your thoughts on what they are\nWell there again I've had the cognitive beams I mentioned one above the very powerful\nAbove yeah exactly they're very powerful and the question is how do we know of a dream as a precaution\nAnd above the very powerful above yeah exactly they're very\nPowerful and the question is how do we know of a dream is a pre cognitive beam or if it's an anxiety dream because often you know when people are sleeping during the dreams they tried to pro says things that happened during the day or things that they're worried about\nSo you know for example I talk about Abraham Lincoln two weeks before he was assassinated he he had a dream that he was murdered [noise] now we could say that that was the peak cognitive team that week also say that could have been an anxiety dream maybe he was worried that someone was going to kill him\nMaybe I think you also had a dream where he was in the White House and he walked up to ... you saw your ... by ... and it was him in the casket\nI heard of that too yeah yeah [noise] so that could have been ... cognitive Ian but another famous person who reported a pretty crowded the view of Charles Dickens really I didn't hear that\nYeah 'cause when he would put a new book he traveled around the small towns and villages and he'd give readings and so on so one night before he was reading into a new town where he'd never been before he had a dream that\nIn a group of people came up to him after his reading and a young woman in red Shaw introduced himself to her with four words she said I Am ... Napier so when he woke up he thought that was very strange she didn't know anyone by that name but he remarked that the dream was very vivid\nAnd free cognitive beams tend to be very vivid I'm often when we wake up in the morning I deem start to fade the pre cognitive dreams stay with us and maybe member every detail\nSo the next day he went to give his reading and sure enough after the meeting a group of people came up to him and there was a young woman wearing a red shah and she was introduced to him as ... here [noise]\nSo so this stream was pretty cognitive dream and he didn't know what to think of it or\nOr how to explain it but he he reported he had that the cognitive dream [noise] so um it's some people for example Larry ... sees a person has written about yes\n... century cognitive beams and he's written about when should we pay attention to a dream how do we know if it's a peacock into femur not\nAnd he said we should pay attention to dreams first of all the agreements week current or if it's especially vivid or if it involves death I heard of a case recently where um\nBut knowing me what else am I supposed to do remember when I quit you quit sincerely\nYour heart listen to your heart and don't let it sit on you\nDoing the minimum to control your high blood pressure isn't doing enough high blood pressure can lead to a stroke heart attack or death get your blood pressure to a healthy range before it's too late for help keeping yourself healthy range text pressure to nine seven seven to nine a message from the American Heart Association the American ... association and the ad council\n[noise] news and talk on the radio\nDishes use radio Thirteen say hey I like windfall side oh you\nHave to also see now the cleanup of begins ...

morning sure all\nGood morning I'm so glad to be on your show I um went into um they thank you for your guest here\nI um had a really strong very powerful encounter before Princess Diana passed away and um I Dreamed about her I visited her for like two weeks every night and my sleep\nAnd she gave me the whole like she just like toward the end I was driving in a car and having lunch and she and we just talk and we get communicated\nHit it off huh we just hit it off and when the night that she died I was sitting on the couch with bad weather we're having form and I was doing laundry can sleep and I just knew something was wrong and and I thought everything happening on that\nBut er we're having form and I was doing laundry can sleep and I just knew something was wrong and then when I thought everything happening on the TV screen it just was like so surreal it was just\nThat was bizarre time\nI've ever had anything like that ever happened to me um\n[noise] I don't know if anyone else has ever had that kind of I mean it sounds like what you're talking about two and then when my son died I had the same thing I had the vision of ... a dream for like two weeks and just couldn't sleep and uneasy feeling and\nTwo cops coming to his dad's door so horrible and I didn't know what\nTo think of it and it was just I've never had anything else like that happen [noise]\nUm [noise] so um I I'm familiar you know I'm I've heard you know I just I don't know like I it only happens in close people to me when is that they're going to die I kinda know I you know I kind of know things like\nYou do tell them\nWell um no no no I Know I don't know who's going to die I just get really ... somebody's going to die\nI just get um I get very I start crying crying you know I get very emotional and very sensitive and just crying and upset but not sure why many what causes that\nEffect on and say I'm Sorry to hear about your son and I was wondering um if you've had any post death contact with him no any what how do I do not any contact with him since he died\nNow I have not and several people my daughter's in several other friends happened now I have not and that's very troubling\n[noise] okay well in terms of your question [noise] uh George what causes that well I guess I Would call that a pre cognitive dream or premonition [noise] you know and I think it's related to the well on a theoretical level you could say on one level we're all\nConnected\nAnd somehow we're able to communicate with each other in a way that we're not really aware of you know I'm I think that especially with someone very close like a family member especially you know a child or a sibling or parent or a spouse\nIf you want to communicate with the deceased loved one is it easier to be a little more aggressive just try to communicate with them or do you laid back and let them try to come to you\nI Would say the the ladder I Would let them come to you you know because they may not be ready\nYou have to give them any signs that you already\nWell you have to I think you have to say that you open to the experience that you would love to hear from them and then the ball is in their course\nWhat's going to Virginia kids with us welcome to the program Keith\nHi George how are you hey there good good can you hear me okay yeah pretty good okay great I'm\nTo let you a couple of things one last night with your guest I called in but uh to like get on\nAnd it there are some commonality in some of the topics tonight about ah the paranormal and uh\n[noise] something I consider to be quite a link between her normal and the a Judeo Christian teacher of the Bible and the missing link could\nBe a the content of a book called eternal man and\nAnybody can go about or search it on YouTube or Amazon you can find different lectures and things about that\nIt is a book written by a B. Y. U. religion of ... professor and over the years I'm just kind of listening to coast to coast it's just been quite remarkable that\nThere there is so much of the paranormal uh that that can be clarified and expanded upon perhaps to give some other Sandy after ... of of the journal nature and our spiritual nature as well and\nUm to switch to another topic really quick or a ... years ago I had a dream and it could do is buy\nA listener on the coast to coast a lot about you ever do experience for them to friends who passed away only about I think Thirteen Days apart from each other\nAnd about twenty five days after the second one I had a dream it was very vivid now this dream as from about Thirteen Years ago I think\nAnd uh I can still remember today um I don't remember what happened before the event some of the dream and I don't remember what happened after the events of the jury in Marjorie but\nBut it was a very vivid and I want you to hold that thought and and retain that fought in your consideration\nAbout the possibility of a the certainty of Dr Christine Blasey Ford about the events that she said happened to her\nBut yet all the people that she mentioned not a single one of them knew anything about fat\nAnd a dream that I had was that um that was my my brother's apartment where the second friend had little house he passed away playing basketball one night with my brother and um he at the end of this time the jury\nHe said to my brother and me all the later and he looks at\nMe and he says and I'll see you and Thirteen months and I knew he was dead wrong him\nAs a a pretty young lady that was wearing a quote a charcoal grey quote I'm cutting coke or standing next to him I didn't know who that was had seen her before\nThis was in a in a dream mess was all a dream and uh and I thought you know and and every you know the people that I knew that dream were like themselves and and the apartment complex laid out I can tell you exactly the spot where when everything about it\nAnd um and so uh and I actually did try to take action I got life insurance and I figured there is a fifty fifty chance what can happen and it was the uh Thirteen months approached it was it was\nA well it didn't happen you know he didn't say in twelve months when he didn't say and fourteen months so that was a window that I was kind of paying attention\nAnd your past

when you're putting in the book together was or some part of it that just overwhelmed you that you did not expect that you came across when you were researching it and put it together\n[noise] and I think the most interesting thing was a death and vision\nWhen you were researching it and put it together\nWell I think the most interesting thing was the deathbed visions [noise] you know because I wasn't expecting that I didn't realize how common that was [noise] you know we've we've certainly heard a lot of a near death experience and visions and out of body experiences associated with near death experience\nBut I wasn't really ... with a deathbed visions or the visions of deceased loved ones that are also very common\nThe death bed visions do you think it's the body's way of making just a little more comfortable for people or is it something other strictly outside the physical brain\nI think it's both I think it's a combination because I like to look at it from the point of view of the body plus the mind plus the emotional life plus the spiritual life so I think there's four different components in each one is important\nWhat has been for you the most dramatic piece you've come across\n... that's a good question because there's so many of them I mean there's there's cases have ... people who've had the cognitive dreams that have helped him win lotteries\nWow you know I'm I don't have those kind of dreams\nNo me neither but that's been verified [noise] you know I wanted to say one comment about your previous caller sure when he was talking about the connection between paranormal experience and the Judeo Christian tradition Mm mhm\n[noise] if you look at the Bible they certainly lots of biblical profits like Daniel and is the key all or if example Joseph you know who had the cognitive dreams are prophetic dreams you might say\nAnd even in the history of the church people I think ... the the er Joan of arc they heard voices\nYou know when when dealing with Thirteen Years old she said she saw lining light light and you heard of voice which he identified as the art came to my call coming from her father's garden so these experiences have been documented by many people\nThroughout the Bible and throughout the history of the church so I think there is a connection\nYeah they're most definitely is it's just remarkable how this works Manny ... it's it's you know let's call it the gods factor or whatever it might be but it's out there it's real yeah the big question is why did they were the first place what do you think\n[noise] that for the first thing that came to mind if it's out there to make our lives more meaningful because that's a different level or a different dimension to our lives and then somehow if that's something to feel like\nWhat we're going through even if it's a painful experience can have some meaning it can have some value\nAbsolutely okay let's take some phone calls here for you we will be in by going to join in Long Island New York hey Joseph go ahead\nHi Maddie I Want to ask you a little bit more about the dreams\nAre interestingly I had two graves recently that began with a preference of the day it's set of a tall but first and I ended up at the beach I go on the water for a little while but this other people's while they again it's usually warm which would be the case had I Want\nBut I never really had a dream where it started off given the ... the day which was the same day in real life\nSo my question would be with your dream about the past the next day which was you know you had the first question it's it's almost like the dream was a personal coach for you [noise]\nAh so I ask you about that you know what you think and the case that trains are going to\nYou know coach for you [noise] ah so I ask you about that you know what to think advocates Twain for going to a really acting in your favor number one\nAnd then if the dream of not quite calling and what and you're thinking\nCould that be aspects that are still really card and I caught up with Keisha set you could cherry pick and how would you do that well\nFirst of all your first question how do you know if the demons acting in your favor or I'd say is is the content of the dream a warning you know is it something that can be helpful for you and your daily life is telling you about something that's\nComing up for you and your life or is it about another person so I'd say it's acting in your favor first of all if it's about you got about another person\nAnd if it's and if the action is beneficial now in terms of Kenya cherry pick I Would say yes because it can be some super fluid sir extraneous materials in the tree and it's not necessarily related to the main point of the dream [noise]\nSo I think it's to a certain extent you have to take out those parts of the dream which you feel applied to in which can be helpful for you and your daily life\nSo now to Joel yeah that's that was good yeah\nOkay very good next up we're going to marry in Seattle, Washington west of the Rockies Mary going at\nHigh school stuff there also\nPerform because I won't right on dreams they he's talking

talking to people he\nWas just so happy he said he wouldn't tell us what was while he was sick and we'd before he passed the gold a neighbor are you ready to die\nAnd she was shocked she says oh I don't think about that and no way I mean he was just\nUnusually happy the and the night he passed it was three in the morning I was sixteen he woke me up at three in the morning\nAnd I was so sleepy

next morning and my mother's like have you guys see your dad and I told her I said mom he told me last night he was going with his brothers and sisters and she was way shocked she ...\nThe ramifications but I did yeah and my dad I think he was part native or something but he always told me he should win older people in the native culture get old you said they go out in the woods or somewhere and the guy I've heard some people in Alaska or get in a kayak and\nJust go out and you know the water and\nThat's what he did he get 'em to this area that used to be an Indian burial ground

percent fail you around your sisters is a is not acceptable because it\nI mean most of the time you did not recover the ... most of the time of year like this catastrophic\nOh absolutely absolutely I you know I still wondering what are we doing on the I. S. S. U. International Space station what are they doing up there\nI think we're watching for alien mostly I mean maybe it'll British TV show what was it you are or where they had space intruder detectors said they called it up I think it kind of\nOur version that said I mean I don't I don't know what else are you and they're not doing a whole heck of a lot of science and it seems like we're at the point where either we should just build a thing out an expanded and turn it into Babylon five or something\nOr we should just give up and let it crashed down to the markets with one of those two because we're at a turning point I think and are we going to go forward with an American manned space program or not it really past time for us to make that they said well\nOff 'cause you're gonna they're gonna comes out on our dollar\nYeah oh yeah that will come back and and now we also have demographic research that will tell people which parts of the world in which types of companies will come back stronger or not so that's an extra advantage goal you know imagine if you could buy gold at four to seven hundred dollar known in next time it\nGoes to four thousand instead of two thousand so no that that's the real advantage when when they correct is much it happens quickly\nThese big corrections happened on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that nothing nothing beats that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down at the present and they don't have any net worth left to buy things when\nThey're on a trip when what did the indicators market the last two days is really taking it on the Jim ... is it just panic or ... what's happening\nWhat will will to things in and actually they both were laid back to the good old Donald\nHum last week you saw 'em treasury bond you know the yields on on the risk free ten and thirty year\nBonds shoot up I'm rather dramatically and we were predicting this what happened we said look at the thirty year treasury bond breaks above through three point two percent it's probably going to go to a four point three percent in less than a year and that's going to raise mortgage rates and that hurts stocks because now bonds are more attractive and\nStock values are based on you know low interest rates are higher for stock values and higher or lower it\nSo that that was the first thing to happen but the second thing is is you know concerns over China I mean this this trade war yes it may be a good thing to do in China may be cheating and a lot of ways by\nChina's been the fastest growing economy in the world it's already stalling and slowing and now it's slowing more in the markets are concerned oh my gosh\nIf China keeps slowing here that's going to trigger a worldwide a downturn in crash and so so it was rising interest rates\nAnd um and then more you know concerns about China it's market just broke a key point we've been talking about\nFor the last month at twenty six forty\nI'm you know that doesn't sound like much but it was fifty five hundred not you know a few years ago it crashed forty five percent of three months and then I had this kind of limp rally for years and has been waiting to go back down and we said look at breaks twenty six forty that that's a sign that China is starting to go down again\nAnd it in ... did that and the last two days it's a twenty five eighty right now so that's another sign that there's something wrong and then again that was the biggest concern a lot of people keep thinking\nOh it's just more interest rates note the interest rates was the first black\nThese last two days had a lot more to do with China and Trump is really pushing this trade war and it is dangerous even though it may be a good policy and a lot of ways and Trump has been cruising the economy with tax\nCuts and all this sort of stimulus and stuff and that causes inflation to go up which it has and it causes goals to go up temporarily and what is the Federal Reserve going to do they're going to raise interest rates that's what they do if the economy's overheating they raise interest rates if it's slowing the lower interest rates which they now they've done for nine years which is ridiculous\nAnd and and now Trump screaming oh my gosh you know I created this great thing and the trumps wrecking it no this was predictable he's not you know he's got some you know gut feelings we got to do this and that he's not savvy at all when it comes to the consequences\nOf things and the economic impacts he basically is probably the prime reason for this\nUm pull back now it hasn't gotten dangerous yeah but it came right\nIt's close one happening like Hillary in a couple more days of downturns tomorrow we have another five hundred point drop I mean then people start saying there's something wrong here\nYes yes we were just at that point we we have to remember we had a we had a correction like this at the beginning of the year the market peaked in in late January real kind of like blow off the top classic thing and then that that was looking like it could have been a tough\nWe have a correction a sharp correction just like this it was down about ten to twelve percent and different markets but then it stopped\nAnd and and it stopped right about here you know where we are now and then it kinda like went sideways and then it came back up that's the trick George I've learned from when when you got above all of this magnitude\nWhat happens when it does finally burst in and that's when the smart money finally says okay this things over and they start selling and shorting to market\nIt happened very quickly you'll see you know I've seen this the last seven stock bubbles throughout history everything from the Nikkei and the early nineties and the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash and then every other one in the last century including the tech rack and recent bubbles\nThat first crash will be forty two percent on average in the first two and a half months where people\nGet walked and that's the sign that that's the only way you know the the bubble has finally birth the problem is by the time that comes people are already in trouble and they're panicking and they get whacked hard so\nWe did the danger sign is if we keep going down and and and literally I the markets do look like they're going to open up tomorrow but that'd be that's just a bounce after you know fourteen hundred points it may open up two to three hundred points tomorrow that's nothing so far but it is bouncing off a critical level we've been warning our subscribers\nSeventeen hundred on the S. and P. five hundred and twenty five thousand um to doubt if the market breaks that that's the first sign that something's wrong and yes the markets and the traders are going to take that as a bad sign and you'll see another steep sell off and then the odds keep going up\nThat this is a top and it it is a is a top we've got not fifty were fifty four percent like last crashes can be more like Seventy eighty percent or more over a few years and and again the first half of that crash\nWill happen in the first two to three months typically and that's what make ... so dangerous [noise]\nUm uh you know the Rothschild guy Baron Ross child wants to know when somebody asks what what was the secret his wealth in the Eighteen hundreds I think he was the wealthiest man of the world he said you know I always sold a bit early because that's our problem to this is a bubble this isn't a normal bull market\nThat correct so nice staircase manner and goes down\nBubbles go up dramatically and they crash and in half the time and they crashed twice\nA is dramatically so so that's why I warn people so hard on this\nThis is a once in a lifetime of vent\nAnd it it the signs to me are building we'd been telling people man this looks like a top here in the garden top here and we only get\nThe good part is we can gauge as if we only get a normal ten Fifteen Percent or so correction by the end of the year than we're probably good for one more route one more Trump rally and the next year before this thing blows but the\nRight now though the odds are shifting towards a it's already happening so people should be on alert\nThe two thousand seven two thousand they subprime mortgage crisis will this be as bad as that time period\n[noise] well this is worse because what's happened is if we did and we of course we were warning about that George ... decades in advance on demographics the baby boom peaking and then and and causing a down turn off the greatest boom in history\nThis was the trigger and we also had record debt levels I mean I'm Around the world but especially in developed countries well what happened after the two thousand eight nine crash\nIs we had a big debt bubble in emerging countries\nAnd then of course China's been off the charts for now for Thirty years and then their dad has grown sixty four times just since two thousand just in the last Seventeen Eighteen years\nSo low interest rates and the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries hate developed countries too but we were already too much in debt so we just kinda like\nWent sideways and didn't elaborate joined it emerging countries want on this free and they added sixty to Seventy trillion more\nOn top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred trillion in debt and financial asset bubbles around the world\nAnd and those are cracking you see turkey blowing up the seat Venezuela with hyper inflation or runs in trouble\nChina is slowing and and like I said they have the biggest that Bob ... of anybody in any time in history when China blows that we're we're going to be worse so so my view is no this is going to be worse than the two thousand two thousand nine recession and stock crash\nBecause they stopped at with massive money printing they just literally stop that they just filled the top backup with money that was draining this time more debt\nEverything's more stretched the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have worse debt bubble crashes and stuff and we do so this is going to be worse so instead of uh like I said earlier instead of a fifty four percent crash look for Seventy to eighty per\n... absolutely huge and that doesn't mean the companies are doing bad here we stay with us we'll talk about that when we come back here he is dance with us his website is his name Harry Dent D. E. N. T. dot com a couple of his books include the Democrat demographic cliff the sale of a lifetime and zero hour\nGoes didn't sign it was the new version of that goes to goes a a map is no available Rawhide bone and know Android ... listen Leiber on demand anywhere any time going to go to ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n\nAnd we'll come back to ... with the cherry so if we quality companies that have solid earnings they've got money in the bank there's dogs could still get hit when everybody else gets hit and they go down but it doesn't mean that company is going to go out of business right\n[noise] right again well anytime you get a major downturn in a recession or stock crap like that some companies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure and that's a good thing recessions are necessary the Federal Reserve and governments the recessions is bad thing\nThey're good things um but and then you want to buy the company that survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a Super Bowl I mean\nTech bubble took five years to build but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half\nUp six to seven times kind of like the bitcoin bubble here recently cracked and a lot of companies went under well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon if you're a part Amazon there oh my God I was\nYou know like a you know a hundred and fifty dollars and now it's like you know gotten up to you know sixteen hundred or something like that so that's the time to buy the best companies\nAnd you want to look at who are the strongest companies okay those are the ones that are actually get the most overvalued an bubble like this but they're also go down I mean General Motors in the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash\nWent down Ninety three percent that ended up beat that was it ended up being the greatest company in the world for decades after that you\nCould have bought it for nothing so\nThat's the secret and and the other thing is even if the earnings of companies if companies are so good that they keep their earnings flap instead of declining the valuations on stock how many times earnings white people will pay thirty times earnings for the typical stock right now are thirty and and sixty or eighty for the best tax talk\nDoes collapse just because investors get fearful and so a stock and go down to fifty percent even if its earnings don't decline and then of course most companies' earnings to decline so that's how they end up down eighty percent\nHere you say you have a secret indicator for looking at some of the dangers what is that\n[noise] yeah yeah you know it it's called the smart money\nYou know almost it's not a secret anymore\nWell I Know I Know but that believe me Wall Street won't do this any way so you don't have to worry but but what what happened to their the smart money or the people who who kind of push ups stopping in and then when things go down there that wants to jump in and buy when when when they see the old investors are over bought in stocks or about they're the ones that short for his\nI mean they're in the know and and and they can even watch what all of us are doing their the sharks that eat all of us minnows that's how they make money they're they're the best traders and stuff [noise]\nWell they you can measure\nAnd they're the sharks that eat all of us minnows that's how they make money they're they're the best traders and stuff well they you can measure\nThis action what if there's an index from Bloomberg called the smart money flow index\nAnd what they do is the dumb money ... acts in the morning the first thirty minutes I mean because the biggest moves in the market come overnight again the smart money the traders have already made their positions in the futures market there ahead of everything and so the market's gonna open down it opens down\nRight at the open or it opens up if it's going to jump most of the moves there may well that's when the dumb money and most people would stop or something to protect them so that's one of those reactions made that's a dumb money\nThe smart money watches the market during the day they can even running and jumping tested a little bit and shorter do this\nThey make their positions in the last half hour into the clothes so they measure this indicator measures what the smart money is doing versus a dumb money and the smart money\nHas not bought this rally in fact they'd been shorting it they've been betting against this rally ever censored bottom February this year after that crap\nNow they bought into the last rally they bought into the Trump rally they bought into the to January top early this year but once that crash happened they have not bought him this rally and it's been one of the steep is declines and smart money buying and that has\nBeen a strong warning signal to me uh in in recent months into our subscribers\nAre you in Puerto Rico now\nI Am in Puerto Rico and I went through a hurricane worse than Michael I had to hold my windows from blowing out my condo it was so bad it was unbelievable because the difference between Maria here\nAnd Michael both of them similar force but this storm hung over us for twelve to fourteen hours in Michael at least pass through so I Know what these people are going through it is unbelievable\nUh to watch everything I mean windows blowing up all around me you know you walk out the next morning and the all the leaves are off trees and you know everything you know blown over and stop it it's just unbelievable it's it's like you know God got angry or something you know into through a temper tantrum she'd moved there\nWell I moved there because I had a vacation home I've been working on for years and coal labor which is one of the Virgin Islands but it's in Puerto Rico people don't know that Puerto Rico has the acres and collaborate to islands that are like St Thomas and St Croix or St John\nAnd and you know no passport to come there is a U.S territory so I was building a house there in in I was in Tampa we'd been care taking my wife's family\nFor many many years had to move from Miami we're about to move back to Miami but I'm we're down here working on this place spending more time in San Juan which has gotten much better in the last decade was when I first started coming\nAnd I said to my why don't we moved here we're in a condo that's a quarter of the price of beach front top quality and a quarter of the price of South Beach Miami where we used to live and and we're now I go around the corner from my condo to the small local airport which I get to twenty minutes an advanced they only check your id they just wait to\nSee how you're going to tilt below not sure I liked that part well it's fun to play it it's a thirty minute low altitude plane flight it scenic I'm I'm I leave my condo doing\nIn landing on this island in one hour and once I got down here I realized I could qualify for some tax advantages here which are very compelling I mean anybody that trade stocks or or investments for a living and the crypto guys are coming down here because of that\nAnd businesses that can qualify there's real strong tax advantages so I I'm living much cheaper than a man of great climate I can still fly to New York in four hours director Miami in\nIn the east coast is now it's difficult to um coming out your way if I have to go out to California which I just did for a long time that that the long haul now but I tell ya I I like it down here they've been in a recession there's no civil unrest a recession for twelve years\nWe're about to have a civil war between blue and red factions and we got three point seven percent unemployment they got twelve to Fifteen Percent air and I don't see any civil unrest so I feel good down here for now\nAnd then I'm just going to see what happens in the next are so many years\nThe big banks down there [noise] yeah yeah\nYeah about in in ... down here and actually a lot of the banks are by banker popular and Santander are Spanish Banks because this is by origin more of a Spanish\nCountry but you know and we've got most of the big box stores and nice malls and stuff but they there are George my biggest problem with a lot of people on the on Amazon and the Internet don't realize that you can ship here on the U.S postal service\nSo people either just because they think we're in Zimbabwe or they charge some huge X and there's a lot of things little things I used to get on the Internet free I Can't find here that's my biggest frustration I Can't find my radios special pasta sauce and things like yeah otherwise man this is a good deal and\nYou know I'm Down here for other reasons but I tell you people ought to be Americans ought to be consider retiring here housing in general is sixty percent lower\nFor for people's ah kids it's sixty percent lower uh by\nThe way they vote in our elections I don't know how many Americans really understand that that they are allowed to vote in our elections\n... most important they are allowed to freely mover immigrate they don't have to even apply and in most Puerto Rico a lot of young people they get a a an inexpensive good education here the education system here is good\nThen they moved to the U.S where they can make twice as much and how much better job opportunities and then when they get older and have kids guess what they do a lot of the Puerto Ricans will move back to Puerto Rico\nTo put their kids through colleges or dental school or medical school here and save a ton of money and then sometimes a lot of times I'll just stay and retire here but but also a lot of older Puerto Ricans now are moving\nTo the United states why sixty two percent of all Puerto Ricans are in the U.S and most of them now are moving to Florida\nAnd so these these older people realize their kids and or their grandkids are in the U.S and they end up moving to the U.S so the U.S is getting highly educated good immigrants\nFrom Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico keeps losing people and that's why they have these tax programs the IRS decides and the government decides the U.S\nIs better to help create good jobs down here the tax advantages rather than just out now subsidized Puerto Rico because the U.S as always always rubbing their best people and again it it they're more professional educated people that are leaving not the not the everyday people so it's actually a good deal for the U.S\nSo I Want you to you is your best impressions on what you think will happen economic lead over the next year this country seems to be mired right now ... in\nA conflict emotion it's unbelievable I've never seen it this way yeah and I think it's going to affect the economy one day\nIt's another reason I'm kind of happy to be here and watch what's going on this was a major theme for the first time in his zero our book\nThey all count because every time dad like us take a moment like that to spend with our kids\nPretty momentous [noise]\nSounds like somebody agrees\nSo let's take a moment

S. like there is in Puerto Rico now and that is one difference these\nPuerto Ricans are not um don't have that sort of tension and that polarity that's the one thing I can tell you 'cause I'm sitting here and I haven't even seen a bar fight and they're the last any crime where where I Am\nHere is the fact that the Hispanics in most African Americans are voting democratic big deal ... what what was his point\nHe well he's saying that that you know the the RED People don't like that these are people going to vote blue and we got this blue red war so when they see Puerto Ricans he's saying come to Rochester or we don't like him and he said they're not as high skilled while I'm telling ya in Orlando they're not saying that they're they are basically\nA reinvigorated Orlando there's four ... four hundred and fifty thousand Puerto Ricans now in just Orlando and a million\nIn Florida and those million which which she is right about our children devote all all the key Senate races up and guess who they're appealing to those Puerto Ricans the Republican and the Democrats Rick Scott and Bill Nelson running for Senate they're both courting the Puerto Ricans 'cause they're five percent of the vote and that's enough to swing an election and they do\nUse in that one democratic ... isn't that what our democracies on the bottle\nYes it is\nIt is let's go to Greg in New Jersey taken away Gregory right yes my question George and good morning I just like to say I live in a congressional districts in northern New Jersey\nWe get thirty percent of our federal tax dollars back the blue states subsidized the red states and the and the state that receives the most as Kentucky with an idiot McConnell is I I just tries me nuts and it's been like this for fifty years we subsidize the south in the southwest the northeast does an SOS the mid west [noise]\n... um for your guest I've been reading Financial Times for many years and what you're saying as as a column every week scaring the heck out of all of us with with what you're saying [noise]\n... will be closer to home I'm about four years from retirement for like thirty five years almost forty years are entity which has nationwide but some through New York\nOur pension was over funded in the late nineties it took a horrendous hit with the ... the tech stocks and then two thousand they almost got obliterate his go why don't we have a meeting of the thousands of is about to retire right all high tech guys and gals the whole thing\nWe have a meeting in about three weeks that are into the can I don't trust any body on Wall street I think there should be a ... team set up there if you will again and Franklin Roosevelt\nThe other entity can't I don't trust any of that but the on Wall street I think there should be a ... team set up there if you will again and I'm Frank and rose bushes should come down from heaven and come back but the thing is what we ask our financial\nPeople who are running our pension fund with their fancy suits what are they doing to dissipate this problem and I'll take your answer off the air\nYou know real quick they these two problems not only the stock market starts collapsing everybody's been driven end of the stock market because quantitative easing in monetary policy's push down long term rates that you can get on safer investments\nLike treasury bonds and corporate bonds and things like that which pension plan should be more end but but you can't get your seven to eight percent returns they used to get with a conservative combination of stocks and bonds so everybody's gone more stocks and then stock start collapsing\nThan they are in trouble the truth is as much as it's counterintuitive pension plan today the best thing you can do what we're telling people right now this this break up and ... is going to make bond as\nA corporate bonds and treasury bonds long term more attractive if that thirty year treasury bond goes up to four point three percent we're telling our subscribers this is likely to happen in the next several months for the next year at the most\nYou're going to want to lock those and not only to get a four point three percent return on his way better than almost any stock evidence but those bonds will appreciate when stocks collapse and the economy slows down\nAn interest rates go down bonds like falling interest rates are right now is not the time to buy these bonds but there is going to be a huge opportunity for investors\nAnd pension funds to lock in quality bonds it's only the quality bonds that did well in the great depression AAA corporate\nTen and thirty year treasury bonds lock in those things for appreciation and for higher yields and don't be in stocks the worst place to be for a pension plan is to do with everybody that run into stocks and collapse and\nYou also write about blue states subsidizing read that's why I think this time around it's going to be the blue states that succeed against red policies that they don't agree with but most of all they're like\nSee what happens to your red economy when New York and California or when the north east and the west coast succeed from the union it'd be would it would be a problem\nLet's go to Thomas in California he Tom go ahead\nHey George thank you for taking my call sir Harry your research is really appreciated um [noise]\nI Need you know you brought up earlier that a corollary to depressions and major recessions in war and you could argue that the world today is in\nA third world war that's a proxy war you know in places like Syria Yemen the south China Sea etcetera and when global corporations cannot compromise\nTheir differences in the global boardrooms there's a shooting war just like World War one world war two Korea\nVietnam and on and on\nSo don't you think I mean a limited nuclear exchange could turn the United states and to a third world country in a day or two you know with a electromagnetic pulse\nThat cetera what is the probability of a shooting war\nYou know I think that's much more likely between emerging countries like India and Pakistan I'm there but but what we're saying and zero hour we we trade school\nBetween emerging countries like India and Pakistan\nI'm ... but what we're saying and zero hour we we trade global trade back to the Eighteen hundreds and there was a big surge into World War one people don't realize globalization global trade collapse sixty percent\nBetween World War one and World War two and with the great depression in the middle with a big trade war with rising tariffs just like we're seeing now everything's happening like happening\nThis works it it it's it everybody does the selfish thing as a country but it works against the whole everybody loses or at least most countries loose\nAnd and that's what's happening now this trade war with China whether ends up a shooting war or limited like you say in the south China Sea that could definitely be stopped there there's no question there's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe\nAnd Russia there could be limited because nobody's big enough to challenge just the one advantage we have is there's there is no counter bailing power that could really take us on one on one\nSomebody hit us they would be dead long before we were so I think that's kind of a good thing or in in the early Nineteen hundreds ... Nineteen hundred note there were major countervailing power has how you could have World War two but we're going to definitely have\nA political huge political jeez this trade war we said in zero hour before this became obvious this is gonna last two to three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and there there could be some physical war but there's certainly going to\nBe huge a political and trade wars and things\nLike when I hear each there were those were coming back for final phone calls with you in just a moment on coast to coast they\nGet Daily Show updates right to your inbox for free with the ... newsletter sign up today at ... am dot com [noise]\nSpouse [noise] little things mean everything thousands ... family I think Susan supply\n...

Harry thank you again for the amazing information you always give us\n[noise] yup love the richer people George because people need to hear this\nJason in Portland, Oregon welcome to the program Jason go ahead\nYeah Harry I Want to ask you about a particular sector of the market at the new sector it has to do with our thoughts and I happened to it in mid July just before the infusion and fantasy growth with the average company\nWhich happened to be pretty good timing and I took a portfolio and actually doubled in value from about fifty thousand up two hundred thousand portfolio\nBut my question is would you um with this kind of big plus for a little bit particularly and feel the uh election this November because\nThere are several states that are looking to uh that have it on the ballot and if they legalize usually when that happens there is a kind of an upswing or would you call out of that now because of this nature of uh\nWhat you're talking about taking place\nYeah yeah that's a good question because I mean first of all this is a long term trend uneven block Shannon crypto currency is our but\nAll of these industries above all these these are hot sector like this will get hit strongly when we have a downturn because first of all everything gets hit\nBut the the the strongest sectors get hit the most because they bubble up the most and people don't understand that same with high in real estate is the best places are going to crash the most and history has shown that so\nI mean I I Would say in this case you may want to hold on just for the lecture the of as a pop but yes I Do think center and such a hot sector take your games see what happens in the next few\nYears especially the next year is going to be critical and then you know if things crash that is a good sector to get back into this is a long term social politic\nDirection although there may be some backlash in the downturn just because people get a little more conservative for a while but but you are in a good actor but yes I I don't want to be an actor\nWhen it when things crash and and and that's what a lot of people miss a lot of people say well this sector will do All right because I went and the great depression than tired thirties and look for one any major sector you know toilet paper um utilities movies you know boos you know things that people would maybe use more in a downturn\nAnd and because of that collapse and valuations and that fear factor everything went down I couldn't find anything any major stock sector that made money in the Nineteen thirties only the high quality bonds that so yeah take your games yeah again in your case I might just see these elections pop and then\nThen go the other way or do fifty fifty you know it it's up to you but there is danger there you're right about that\nPeriod when they when the bottom falls out hunting you know what you are you how do you know when the bag in\nWhat will again I mean we have clear we look at past corrections I mean everything's different this is not like you know the eighty two thousand eight to nine cracked and it's not like the seventies correction stock corrections back then were fifty percent\nThat's more typical this is more like these great resets ... de leveraging of a bubble debt and financial assets which of course stock is are the leading ones\nWhen that happened is Seventy percent is kind of the minimum you look for in up to eighty and in in the Nineteen twenty nine crashed eighty nine percent for the ... eighty nine percent so\nI'm looking for levels like that I think my range is Seventy five percent minimum up to eighty five percent that's when you start looking to buy and again we have the same thing on the flip side for bonds right now\nIs that thirty year treasury bond which is a been a three point four percent recently if that gets up to over four percent between four and four point three percent that's when I started by even though that's the best thing in the downturn it's too early to buy that right now if you're going to park you might just be unsafe\nShort term bonds and CDs and T bills and stop to preserve your money next step is moving to the long term quality bonds and then\nAnd and and the sectors I mean commodities will in emerging markets overseas will probably bottom first\nAnd then developed countries stocks and then real estate so there'll be a succession of buying opportunities\nSo I mean and stuff like that you're in a good market like like like like a marijuana and pot industry especially the medicinal side which is a slam dunk winter long term [noise] wait for the guy you may get to buy into that a little earlier than something like you know home builders\nNext one is to do good Kentucky first time caller for some allowing\nHey George a lot of the show you Sacramento correct me if I'm wrong here but red states are Republican yup OK stature Democrat Democrat or a\nMethod then they do not signing earner did I miss I understand you've met you said the south was ran during the civil war\nYes they they would have been they would have been more even though you know they called Lincoln a Republican back then the Republican Party was not the same I Know my father help build the Republican Party\nIn the south and help get Nixon elected through southern voters and that's a whole different party he had to convince a lot of democratic politicians in senators that they were really Republican they were Democrats traditionally all the way back to the civil war so\nThe credit label actually was the opposite back then no you're right I mean read is Republican blue is Democrat in the present time frame and then the Republicans in charge now\nIf you do see a major downturn I Am just have to tell you from history it is going to favor the Democratic party just like it did in the thirties we had Republicans who were coming into that when things crash they go to the people that are going to hand out money to the people there that you know the ... they'd go to the Democrats\nIn a downturn in a ... in a bull market and the rich are getting richer and a lot of innovation that favors the Republicans we are our long term research shows we are going to switch from a Republican area here\nTo democratic one for a number of decades and that's just something you know the blue people are gonna like that the red people won't but all I Do is report the facts I'm I'm not\nPart is and and my work Republicans are always going to be here Democrats it it's a play of opposites that's just as important as men and women and booms and busts and inflation and deflation and every other play of opposite\nAnd it goes back and forth the same thing the west has dominated the world uh since since uh the industrial revolution well guess who's going to dominate in the coming decades and even century it's gonna be the east\nAnd that's another trend we can clearly show through cycles so so what we do is just show people here's the trends this sector that sector inflation deflation\nThis country that country blue ... I mean we can do all this stuff the long term is surprisingly predictable\nAnd that's where economists get it wrong commerce think the short term predictable I'm guessing when I tell you I think this thing's gonna top now or so many months from now I'm making an educated guess that may make me sixty to Seventy percent right but never hundreds when I tell told people Twenty years ago baby boomers going to peak in two thousand seven\nIn the economy was going to slow down and it scares that was not I guess that's science of when people predict money just as accurate it wasn't life insurance actuaries will tell people when they die collectively\nNext we'll go to Gordon them Lakeland, Florida in the wild card line and board and by the way next next week we're doing a show on student loans\nOh wow what a coincidence\nNow um any yeah George and Harry thanks for taking my call traditional I'm reading your intro\nNow first off I'm a rally in conservative if you put in if you ask Hugo who's this Gordon over in Lakeland, Florida that last for three decision on the ... thing I I did better than Jeb Bush it'll find me it'll tell you my last name I'm not going to tell them to you I'm pro gun a pro gun rights I'm fiscally conservative\nSo when I say that they both the liberal Democrats and the Republicans have taxed students to death", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "12"}
