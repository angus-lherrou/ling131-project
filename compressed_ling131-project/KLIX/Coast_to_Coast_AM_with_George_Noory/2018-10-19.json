L. I. X. [noise]\n\n\nTotally six seven three seven hundred us AAA thinks have been three thirty seven hundred you want to know more about how programming and why it's so easy to even think for one minute it so he didn't know that we live in a major from the program [noise] did you know there was a a a poll taken [noise]\nAnd it was founded Seventy percent of all American adults believed chocolate milk comes from ... brown cows\nAs according to a survey commissioned by the innovation sort of us there if you do the math works out to sixteen\nPoints four million people sixty believe a point four million milk drinking people that is the equivalent of the population of Pennsylvania the does not know the chocolate milk is milk cocoa and sugar\nJ. thing about that for a minute for decades\nPeople in agriculture and education\nHow bright that many Americans are basically agricultural illiterate and so they don't know whether food's grow they don't know how it gets to the store and they don't even know the chocolate milk comes from cows and they add Coco to it\n\nAnd that's that's part of programming is right back and right up there with flatter the dried up there with you know the paradigm basically breaking down crews geo with us on grounds are I mean how do we escape the programming I mean obviously someone has gotten the controls of the computer a gun control of the matrix and they're able to push\nBut what maybe the population of the size of Pennsylvania believe that uh\nYou know chocolate milk comes from brown cows\nI mean that's that's amazing isn't it just it is it is a good way to the matrix there's gotta be\nWe're getting to the meat and potatoes of everything right now because and it's very easy to break the programming and it's only a matter\nOf recognizing it as a matter of recognizing how consciousness works in in of itself so as we said there's two types of consciousness on the board you have organic consciousness which are are can be like into a world of Warcraft game with a\nPlayer actually sitting there the computer and you have the non player character consciousness that are part of the game they were created within the game they were created within the matrix\nNow the organic consciousness can be overlaid with all these different programs um through traumas through a programming through the television this and that\nBut when you start to deconstruct all those layers and you start to ask yourself\nWho am I before I came into this matrix I we're all in finance I\nI think that that that's what organic consciousness all feels on one level or another who were we before we we came into the matrix when we can reach down into that level and I call it the rock consciousness\nThat's where the notice comes out that's where the understanding comes out that's where the ability to be able to look at these programs and see them for what they are um actually starts to starts to come out so first of all it's about recognizing how these programs work there\nThey're also working through what I term are cons um little entities in the background some people call them demons or the black magicians will call upon them so on and so forth but there are centrally just programs\nThat are working in the background these are ... what they do is they whisper all of these negative thoughts into your mind\nAnd they they have a direct link into the mind and the more that they're whispering into these ... in your mind then they start to be able to affect physical reality because now you're getting all of the stock program start loops um and so on and so forth when you're being put into these uh data states when you're sitting there in front of the television and so on and so forth\nSo when you start to get these start loops if you just recognize wait a minute\nThis isn't really coming for me this is coming from some type\nOf programming um that's been injected into my brain let me go deeper than that let me go beyond that\nWhat you I see when I take a step outside of the matrix or take a step outside of whatever situation that we're looking at whether it's the political situation of spiritual situation a day to day situation how can I see this from a three hundred and sixty degree perspective\nOnce you do that then all of a sudden the programming breaks and when it does then you start to see the world for what it really is and you start seeing elements in the media or in the political atmosphere that are good some elements are bad\nYou don't come from a place of left or right anymore instead you just come from a place of what is right and what is wrong and the way that I defined right or wrong is very simple lighting darkness it's natural law it's it ... or you hurting somebody\nArgue impeding upon somebody's freedom or are you a damaging somebody's property\nUm if you take a look at the situations around us and you asked yourself does this piece of legislation there about the past is that impeding upon freedom is that a beating up on\nLife liberty you know these basic fundamental principles of freedom then you can take a look at the piece of legislation for example as what it is instead of saying well my party says this and so I have to believe this are my party says that um\nSo I have to believe that and then pretty soon realized that this whole divide between us\nHas been systematically programs within the matrix to keep us fighting with each other up while they continue to manifest all of these realities that they want\nBut really the power lays inside each and every one of us to manifest our own reality as I said before I have the CIA document in my hand called um analysis an assessment of gateway process and it shows you how to manifest the reality around you\nSo by realizing that we are in a matrix realizing that you have the power inside of you to manifest your own reality what I always tell people as we look at the huge mountain it's in front of us\nYou know in the church or community and the media community you know all of that and we want to change the world but that's impossible we can't change the world all we can do\nIs just change ourselves but when we can do also as we can pick up a rock and move a single rock and then we can show somebody else how to move another rock and pretty soon that entire mountain starts to change from\nAnd consciousness as as as as being revealed for what it is organic and non player character\nI Want to recommend a book and it's a book that uh if you were paying attention is in the matrix in fact that the book where I remember those guys come to the door the one girl had been rabbits tattooed on her arm and he's looking for I think ... or some sort of drug and eat and a meal has hidden in the book in his book ... the the drug\nAnd the book is called ... suddenly couldn't simulation it's a book by John ... yard and basically he's talking about this he said\nYou know their relationships between reality symbols numbers or how society looks at them and how they're used as ...\nAnd the thing with the patients and symbolism of cultures and media and constructing and understanding a shared existence that's what the book is about it's about how they try to create a shared existence in the collective there are programs that no the words the numbers the codes\nAnd if you can crack the codes and get the cheat sheet you'll be able to master\nA me the master of the game not be someone who's just been ...\nDid you know that the entire cast before they were even allowed to read the script if the matrix had to read that book first\nYou know it's an amazing book I've read it to its jumbled her yard a eyes I recommend this book is another ground zero mosque street it's called ... and simulation it'll help you understand the matrix of hell of a lot more just like ah the ah the justice Campbell book\nAbout myth of power of myth also helps you understand Star Wars the hell of a lot more to go to a Jimmy Jimmy a Jew in California you're on ground zero go ahead\n... what a great show tonight while and crystal Sharif thanks for letting us all behind the veil tonight I gotta say I'm a than a listener for a long time but I think this is one of the laws cogent discussions I've heard about the nature of reality\nEspecially a new guys abroad and at the end PC to the category of a human existence now and I think to ... you may be talking about is is a humanity and another itself because you know through the through the hyper reality programming that we received through a\nFacebook and all I'm we're pretty much a ... responses\nFeed we're getting from the matrix\nAnd a Christian ... um I really wanted to thank you guys for bringing a this conversation to the table on on ground zero as\nAllies wondering is there someplace where 'cause I Know I I I I heard about a video that you guys did I'm over in Egypt earlier in the show and I was wondering is there a place where we can see the videos or is there someplace where we can get a hold of you um you know maybe you guys have a website or something\nYeah absolutely we're working on a film called resetting the matrix I ... in the great pyramid which details are journey into Egypt I'm working with this acreage demonic um brew\nThat uh we actually had four hours in the ... some of the great pyramid\nCompletely alone ... their wings deep deep deep into trans and um you can get that film at resetting the matrix dot com um\nThere were some remarkable things that happened on that journey and it was all live streamed which was incredible and of course um we have a radio station CF are alive dot com or you can listen to beyond the veil as well and YouTube dot com slash beyond the veil thank you very much for asking that\nYou know your dad do you think you were going into my man\nHey quiet I wanted to ask you if you're on on this um post modern as um\nThis this term hyper reality the book that you just brought up is also I'm highly this the psychology and philosophy behind that has a that book because I think one of the main scenes in the matrix that a lot of people overlook\nIs the scene where um the geared goes ignorance is bliss ... you know he saw behind the curtain he got behind the scenes he went on a facade\nHe's he realized he was an eating steak is really just eating gray slob and eventually he got sick eating a gray swab and he wanted to go back into the simulation yeah and just pretend that he was eat in that state even though he knew it was gray slides\nBecause what a ... in the end we prefer the simulation or where the real and that's what we are doing now we're ... we're looking at the simulation\nAnd most people are believing the simulation they believe what they're told they start speaking the script and people started getting ... it's going to destroy us because no one is going to know the truth in reality they're just going to prefer the simulation that's why sex box exist\nThat virtual reality six exists that's why you're finding sympathetic I people would rather be sympathetic\nWith human beings is because they prefer the simulation because they can control is simulation reality or whatever it is we are doing in the matrix is not good enough after program themselves outside to become NBC's\nCan I read one sentence listen to this hyper reality tricks consciousness into detaching from any real emotional engagement and studying instead opting for artificial simulation right an analyst reproductions\nRight ... exactly right and that's another matter is\nHeading ed you got the hardest hitting show on the air ... you are the alternative the alternative thanks for letting me call and you guys great show\nThank you appreciate that very much is very good thank you so much for that kind of in Texas the around with Christians Riggio going at\nIt [noise] um I hadn't actually got I wasn't listening from the very beginning so I just came in what you're talking about the the mean magic and the person sending you the message about it and I was curious about that so I looked it up at one point and basically comes from like the the random number generated\nOn fortune when you post and people would call out like what the end you know you got repeats\nRandom number generated a fortune and when you post and people would call out like what the end you know you got repeating numbers that we're supposed to be significant ... and so people post names and they would\nCall out like what they're what what they thought the end of the sequence would be and\nIf they were right it was looked at as some kind of say let's say seven and the tape a man was already I mean you know years and then they used it and then Donald Trump was getting elected right and they thought eat almost like a medium\nWell yeah well they another uh affected me that ... for the church the sub genius you ever seen that it's a guy smoking a pipe he was taken from an ad\nAnd they use it as a as a a a representation of their religion how pretty Newman was from a to Z ad\nFrom the Nineteen twenties and he became the agriculture mascot or whatever you want to call it a mad magazine so yes sometimes means can be hijacked sometimes they can be used for other purposes this one seems to be this NBC one seems to be very original but it does a very look uncannily like you must feel as a monkey was would you be announced chemical magical\n... or at least a representation of such\nWell and when I was ... I went back and I found the post or their though and it's like that and it said that basically boils down to the moon magic is going back to like chaos magic which has to do with a\nWith a ... and basically that is I guess that I mean it's just more powerful because more people are doing things with it or spreading it or whatever and that was\nThe additional people adding to that means it making the social effective in the ... and the real\nWorld ... yeah it runs the risk aspect yes it runs the risk of stepping out of the Internet into the real world because there's so many people that are empowering it I I uh yeah I mean I ... I'm ... it's it's it's bizarre how that happens\nBut it does happen like I said slender man is an example of this\nAh you know I remember uh somebody had a bit to the director of a nightmare on elm street I actually told me he said that he felt that Freddie Krueger had stepped out of the of the screen and became a Richard Ramirez denied soccer because of course the movie was in theaters\nPretty Krueger stock to people in their dreams and of course a Richard Ramirez would break in through the through in in people's rooms and kill them in the middle of the night so it was kinda like the the representation or the shadow\nOr it's like the idea of the joker for example in the black Knight Rises Heath Ledger a play the joker\nWith course pay he didn't play him as a regular clown you play them of course pay which eventually some people say let from the screen [noise] and ah and became the killer in Aurora [noise] so I mean these these are the things that\nAre you know certainly uh have power and they certainly blow your mind when you see and you know of course Sandy Hook within Batman as well as so many different means to have left from the screener left from the computer into reality\nAnd so this may be one of them to the end PC [noise] but uh certainly is a new name and usage will we have a curse geo Sri geo with his son in the program AAA to six seven three thirty seven hundred in Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred do you want to witness a magic go to the Internet and find the N.

laughed\nAbsolutely and you know you could come without ... if you'd like but it would be better stayed here because we have a lot of work for you to do that really not interested and at that moment I don't think I had much of a choice because my cousin George ... my sister I travel\nCame and told us both out and kind of a ceremony way through it on the beach and that was back in my body\nBut I wanted to tell you that it was a glorious\nKind of an ceremony free throw us on the beach and that was back in my body\nBut ah I wanted to tell you that it was a glorious experience and I've had many that was really one of the first and uh I learned a lot from that I learned not to let my sister to teach me how to swim for one thing that's probably in the mail message from that\nExactly it's a scary thing I got to tell you the same thing happened to me when I was a kid except I didn't have an agility experience terms with my father's brother my uncle was the twins and we're walking in a lake and uh I'm side by side next to my uncle\nAnd uh I you know in this leak in just like you don't I when I must have been about eight years old Joyce\nAnd I'm going I and I thought this is it I'm dead and went back to haunt me back up by pop right back up\nAnd then my uncle didn't even know I went under just kept walking ... was the weirdest mainly but I thought that was it for me it was a strange feeling\nCorrect I wanted to tell you I don't know if you ever went to my website but I Would watch the times Oh thank you I was that\nThe world Trade Center when nine eleven occurred because my husband and I had an apartment very close we're like a thousand feet from some of the world Trade Center and we moved there about a month before buildings came down gosh\nYeah is there a month and on the day we moved and Jack and I looked up and the world Trade Center was towering over a little building on liberty court\nAnd ah I said you know we said to each other boy this thing comes down we're finished well exactly a month later they'd come down as you know and we were we had to leave the building because it was unsafe to be there so many people in that area had to leave\nBut we came back a few days later when it was safe and I had the most phenomenal experience and that's on my website where um what happened I I I actually had gone to sleep and I was awake and and told to go into the living room\nAnd to help people to cross over because they were coming through that had created a portal in my building and then my apartment and the people who were had just died were coming through and being released out into the onto the harbor by the statue of liberty that was Battery Park\nSo that was one of the many incredible experiences I've had and thousands of people see they just kept coming coming I guess you know\nAre you still love that area Joyce\nWe saw that apartment I when my husband passed away and then now I'm In Florida\nBut uh just like so many incredible things that people would just try to remember some of the things that happened to them I think most people say well if it was just and you know something that just happened but write them down recording your dreams as I'm sure your your next guest has got to tell us\nBut write everything down and try to analyze or you're experiencing the best way to develop your yes pay is to try to remember and to try to record with you're experiencing and it will really happen that way it'll open up more of that that consciousness you'll be able to help other people as well\nSo that's that's my primary recommendation record your dream to record your experiences\nI had a I don't know if I should if you ready for me to tell you another one of a one my phenomenal experiences about a\nLovely yeah sure absolutely\nTrucks thank you I had never heard of ... but uh I had an odd about maybe four years ago I had this out ... experience where I did astro travel which I had\nReally no memory of doing ever before I think we all travel and we just forget it but we don't know about it but this was unusual because I went to um a Tibetan rama story [noise]\nI'm a whose name was ... and you know in Tibet George on the day the baby is born that's the first name he was born on a Tuesday so same Tuesday lob saying I can ... and if you go to his website it's a lot saying rapid dot org\nBut he came to get me and I went on this phenomenal trip to\nHis arm is dairy and he had a the ability to answer many of my questions that this man had many walking experiences supposedly he was over many hundreds of years of age he had taken different bodies on the last one more out he took a new body on and he was living as an Englishman\nAnd his final incarnation on the earth and Nineteen eighties so\nI was at Islam is Terry and it was phenomenal and I came back to my body brought me back\nAnd as I was waking up he said to me don't forget my name and I had never heard I couldn't remember it but my husband was there and I said jak before I wake up please write this down and I spelled it out ... and I misspelled it slightly put an H on it or it didn't belong\nAnd then he was a lot of things gone but I went to his website and I was blown away because she has written\nMaybe a couple of hundred books that are free anyone go to his political\nExtremely cell and just feeling and amazing amazing man and it not only was he a doctor but he was also just so many different incarnations it makes you realize that we don't really have to die like St your main also was walking and George do you believe that that's possible he can take on\nA further uh incarnation\nI think George many things are possible mhm really do I mean I'm\nI'm Still wrestling with the living in dying process exactly what we um it's it's kind of strange for me I mean we've got a picture of goes to goes to the dot com bubble goes on the Titanic\nA strange picture you've got to be too don't you\nYes of

realize that the people are not really just dead or sick or whatever they may be thinking\nBecause really I Love church and religious organizations but they don't do is a big favor or they don't say that person's doing really well\nSo I think that would be my primary methods for people to know that when you cross over ... shouldn't\nGo into a place of grief let them be joy for on the other side and enjoy the hill and wellness with them so that that's really important to the medium ship brings and that ability to let people know that their loved ones are doing fine\nDoes the spirit never come

the reason why we're this comes out on film but it\nDoesn't come out with just the human eye thing at a wife has such a difference do you think\nThere's a huge difference in this very strange because for some reason the camera picks up goes or just about everything that you can see\nWith the human eye I mean I guess were restricted to just see things in a certain level where the camera digitally and otherwise picks it up\nThat's right it's so odd and it was a cell phone or really to the same degree that irregular ah thirty five millimeter camera with with a present it's the same thing so I have yet to figure that out spirit is not tell me why but other than the fact\nThat the ah the photographer scientific photography has the ability at the either not have and that's the only answer I could come up with so far is not good [laughter]\nHow do you know you're not being tricked by some demon or something that is trained deceased person somebody\nThat's a great question because if you do any kind of spirit work or you have any kind of messages or you have anything at all you always have to have a blessing for a few tests the spirits you say really are you of God and that's really what I Would say that's what I Would recommend everyone's saying before they become involved in this kind of work at all\nSo you always say are you of God and that's what I Would suggest and then team it's kind of come in and they will not come in or if you have any kind of threat around you are you afraid of anything you know that they will not get past that barrier and if you're religious you

but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our genes I mean bad habits apart from that is part of it the letter also the rushed out of sleep\nSports action but there are other reasons why we're losing our opinions I mean bad habits apart from that is part of it the let ourselves the rushed out of sleep by the alarm clock but then you get the job of deal with the family\nWe think that we should lie in the in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention to those in between twilight states of consciousness between sleep in the wake\nThat's a good time to catch it means good time to talk on the list of dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed to 'cause they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dreams because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slammed the door and say no more dreams sometimes this is very interesting\nSometimes he kissed goodbye to our dreams because we think that our dreams that giving us a little ring pictures a possibility that we cannot manifest because by not young enough but not rich enough will never find the right go all the right guy\nAnd sometimes strangely we kiss goodbye to dream because we don't think we can bring from a beautiful romantic breathing space\nWhat we would like to see an are waking life these are some of the reasons that people lose their dreams\nAnd I noticed that you know if you follow the the simple suggestions that I also you can get your dreams that you can stop dreaming again in the sense of remembering and recalling and one of the most simple ideas is\nYou might have something to them and I think you've got nothing but some say you've got nothing and just pay attention you might have a with he might have a fragment and if you can call that up and begin to play with that you might have a way of getting back in touch with your dreams and another thing I'd say to people George's\nWere then you can dream wide awake world around you will speak the language of science and symbols and things but as you could pay attention and sometimes you get Mora looks to those pop up so the pop ups and waking life that can give you ship is because you feel my gosh there's a hidden handed works\nThat that helps to turn on the dream club in the night as well\nAs some incredible wage the dream pre cognitive lucid dreams what about these recurring dreams and you have had some stories are directly related to that\nWell it's a recurring dream is coming again and again and there's a hilarious story a mysterious realities about a woman doctor from England he was complaining of the breakfast table\nOh Robert why do I keep having the same thing dream when I got to do my medical exams the thirty years on and I did them I keep having the same dream I said what I Would say in general or you know if if you if it really is the same ... very close to the same dream it's probably because\nYou have dreamed producers who are making a movie for you that's something that goes on to\nAnd they're trying to get a message through to try to get you to understand the situation I'm trying to educate you all assuming you might have some clue about what's going on there trying to mobilize you to take some action on the situation so I I Love the stories I I picture I sort of dream production movie company\nThat is making dreams for us and repeating the performance if necessary in order to get a message across and I actually picked how I'll dream producers might be getting very bulletin fed up with us\nIf they have to keep on making the same office just can not getting the message of not taking action from it that's one of the ways that ... come about I mean dreams that not all to be put in one box we do have dreamed productions where you feel\nAnd you might be quite right when you feel this that there is a production crew behind the scenes\nThat is making a certain kind of dream to you because you need to get a message and another the stories and mysterious reality as I describe it very strange women who sat down next to me in a plane or reality and mentioned me at a certain point that the debt has been to the period huh he was a pop musician he'd been shot in the face in a diner in Seattle\nAnd he says to her in her dream I'm I've got a great job now I'm helping to make movies for people that they're seeing their dreams that I'm doing the music and the special effects I think back to that goes on I think that's another fascinating aspect of what's happening and dreams\nWho's in charge of this though who's who's the director of these productions\nWell that's a very good question indeed it might be used the dream or if you become more conscious of what is going on and decide to step into that role until you become conscious it might be that some shadow or hidden aspect of yourself maybe if you're a high a self made a site there wise or inside the highest self\nIs the director I don't think any of this is alien to us I think we are connected to all of this I think the dream production company that might be staging movies for you is not alien to you is not hostile to you\nAnd is probably being run by someone with a side it why is the perspective and maybe more of a sense of humor than you currently have about your current situation because one of the ways that dream shock us awake into doing some course correction is\nThey dramatized and they spoof parity or what what we're doing in our lives in a way that makes it very difficult to avoid noticing that some action might be required\nDreams are powerful Robert in ah I've always used it for my own personal life to get things done accomplish things once you learn how to master your dreams there's no end to what you can do\nThat's right I mean I think that here's here's where our our current understanding of dreaming and currents physics uh meet up I mean the our current under staffed by kind of understanding I mean the really ready to revive some quite ancient\nUnderstanding about dreams that dream is traveling for example\nA physics tell the science tells us that we have access at any moment so the mentality of non local mind we're the field of information quantum field of information that contains everything we could ever possibly need to know and we have access to it\nAccording to our ability to harvest information and do something with it and ... in the first place what's going on I think in dreams we discover the snow doorway into this whole on some information field\nAnd depending on the work and play with prepared to do with the information might getting we can bring through more and more I mean you could set an intention any night for example to be very simple about this very simple practical you can do dreaming basement being juice at an intention\nTo get guidance on anything that interest you in probably something will come through if you don't think you got anything you're awake in the middle of the night to reset your intention and maybe at this point you're ready to lose the dream on that subject as well because he's got some breast and you're ready to take off\nAnd it's amazing how many creative solutions come through in this way and they've come through across history one of my book the secret history of dreaming\nIs full of Stuart narratives from the documentation that suggested dreaming is actually\nA secret engine in the history of everything in the history of credit breakthroughs in science and technology in the aughts even in business and economics as well so when you say that if you wake up to what dreaming is it can take you anywhere you are literally correct it really can\nCan take us to those hidden dimensions of reality that super string theory pause it it can take us into the off the lights the UCs the ham walked the job opportunities some living environment's a like\nA bee on death so you can talk to an ancestor to love it loved ones and ... and others so you know this is\nThe mentality of adventure killing guidance impossibility that opens when you become a more conscious ... what about the ability to time travel in your dreams\nWe do it we do it whether we know do not do it even if we don't remember our dreams and I think it's a basic survival uncertain of dreaming you know if I'm a mistake on a practical missed\nThe ways this that in power out everyday life and one of the things I Know from my own life and\nThose I work with is the previous show you the future in a way that is actionable mean this is very important dreams show us opportunity some challenges lie ahead they ... the things we don't yet know about they can save your life they can save your job they could say that marriage I couldn't be talking to you today\nIf I did not know for certain shows that I had that I have avoided death on the road predates with that the fatal accidents\nBy coming back from dreams that forecast book was happening harvesting the information acting upon it so I didn't have that head on collision with the Eighteen wheeler coming down the hill to file\nOr the other side of a blind spot\nFor example so that's one direction for time travel time doesn't move into a new one direction and in fact\nTo understand what our relationship with the time is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of Libya time altogether we step into a different place and in between place from which we can access time passed a future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in all the time so together in those parallel times we leading a power live this becomes very interesting when you begin to look at\nGifts the lessons you might have learned in a parallel life that you can apply and you present life and how to avoid things went wrong and not at all the power life\nI think it's very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you lost at that time or the guy to that younger self or you find yourself also in the lives of situations that people in far flung places to a part of your multi dimensional family\nI'm a bit of a an agnostic about reincarnation but I firmly believe based on my experience that we are connected

is called mysterious realities how many books have you written Robert\nThis is the ... the old way George but I must tell you I'm getting nervous because I Dreamed some time ago I have a life contract that says I have to probably sixty eight books\nOut on a short of that\nThat's still pretty prolific though good for you good for you and they're ... they're all fascinating works that\nThese dreams are so important I mean I I think people can make themselves healthy in a dream that you can get a better job in a dream they can make other people think about them by concentrating on them and dreams it's amazing what you can do with dreams isn't it\nDoes lifted some really interesting areas for example in terms of a hope right one of the things going on in dreams of that that body chalk as well as social can other words and dreams we see what's going on inside the body and old fashioned doctors understand this and in traditional Chinese medicine for example this is front and center\nThe idea is that a dream my gives us an X ray even an MRI of what's going on inside the body might show symptoms that are developing my necklace to avoid those symptoms but that part of the functions of framing and the and in terms of our emotional and spiritual health\nI'll dreams which shows the things that help us to get wild him to stay well and and it was acting up on those dreams of trying to bring their energy through you mentioned connecting with other people were you know to let the which literally means fellow feeling at a distance or or or being in touch with someone else\nIt's a common phenomenon and dreams in fact it's surprising that more people who are related to each other either by Lovell by family or by common colds or whatever\nI'm not aware more often that they might be dreaming with ... and all of each other I mean there's a phenomenal shed dreaming or interactive treatment which we find ourselves sharing adventures with friends and other people I mean this is another fascinating phenomena and dream as a matter of fact you this\nCreamy which we find ourselves sharing adventures with friends and other people I mean this is another fascinating phenomena and dreams as a matter of fact you discover if you wake up your dreams remember morals and look at what's going on\nBut you have what used to be coded as being cold again super normal capacity that all abnormal they're not supernatural but at the um the normal I'm Talking about things like pre cognition\nUntil after the ... and and so on and and and and you are able to see things before they happen or able to see things the distance or able to connect with other people and these are natural powers and abilities that along to you and if you become a more active ... you'll find that you are growing in developing these gifts and the very helpful in life\nIn terms of creative solution for things green tool to live with them if you can't find a solution to a problem to ordinary life put the question to your dreams and see what comes\nAnd I would add to that that you can do this every day life as well because dreaming for me it's not just about what happens when you close your eyes it's what happens when you open your eyes wider so proud of this part of part of the fence gold is is\nThat the world around you once again we'll speak to like a dream if you pay attention so I encourage people or many of my story is done on this\nTo notice what goes on in the amazing moments of meaningful coincidence when you've got a photo preoccupation on your mind and suddenly the will deliver said incidents are citing that gives you not only a reflection on what's on your mind but sometimes\nA way of dealing with what is on your mind if you have an issue in your life one of the games I

become a reality where they don't even have to play soldiers or whatever\nI'm saying well let's get let's get Robert ... take on some of those rubber what do you think that many damn\nWell it's possible that you were dreaming of future developments in technology and in other ways that might manifest ... sounds as if you haven't run into the situations in ordinary on the tea yet and hopefully you weren't\nBut it's perfectly possible that you had long range pre cognition in dreams of situations that might develop in life it's also possible\nThat the dreams have a symbolic made not simply to look for me but the symbolic me if I'm dreaming of of of the situation that seems very serious and talk and threatening going across the ... and seeing this may be this EMT\nOkay maybe that's symbolic is something that lies ahead to me in life which is going to have the emotional flows into the emotional calls or something like that maybe my dreams are actually coaching me preparing me for it emotional situation which are not all it's a situation which I Need to be ready for I don't know but that comes to my mind\nThe upside down cellphone you know I just want ... holding that image I realize it might be something larger more scary than a cell phone\nBut I sort of want to reach into that dream and grabbed a cell phone let it be a cell phone and speak on it and see who's on the other end I mean\nThis is the way that I Am about treats that's probably why I mean I'd rather liked the idea of the upside down cell phone yeah it's scary but if it's my dream my actually you however many years that he has since the dream\nI sort of want to reach into the dream grab that cell phone or the hold it to my ear and say who is there talk to me a while you and see what I gather it might be that it's the kind of phony what you can talk to someone on the other side of death\nYou know dreams where often people are often talking to the dead\nOn phones are receiving phone calls from them and sort of want to go that direction with that tree\nWherever wire dream sometimes convoluted in mired in a confusion in the parables and things like that why isn't it just so obvious\nWell I think that actually the dream so the dream sources of many sources of freedom to try to communicate as clearly as possible but but not necessarily smart enough to follow all of this\nAh and also we need to remember the dreams are experiences with whatever report we we quote to each other from a dream\nIs only a report it's not the full experience so it might seem convoluted all confusing or not ... but that might be because we've only brought back a few things from the dream and don't know how to put them together which is why I find the best way to understand the dream is to try to get your head back inside to try to get back inside the pre\nTake a look at what is really going on when you do that you\nIt's a little symbolic you can fill in some of the gaps\nWhen you learn the technique of cream reentry of going back inside a dream\nI I and once we understand that I think one of the songs you are playing though something about living a whole life and play and plus the the in your dreams I mean once they understand that we're having tremendous experiences\nAnd can live days or weeks in a in a dream in a few minutes the tick tock time we can begin to grasp that whatever we bring back from the dreams is only partial and may be confused we might need to go beyond our first memories of the tree and bring back more in order to understand what's going on\nWhat is more prevalent to loosen dream free cognitive dreams just normal regular dreams what pops up the most well\nA lot of people are done seen yet to understand how to come lucid dreams the idea of listed dream of becoming very popular since that movie inception and on the ideas childhood you couldn't make love to anyone in your dreams and you can be Superman that set for said there's been a sort of adolescent quality to some of the\nOf the fat the loose of dreaming but listen dreaming is actually easier than most people would make it for themselves but many fond memorize ways of waking up in fact you're craving inside of dream because your hands if you can stick a finger through your I'm the kind of stuff as I said earlier the easiest way to lose the treatments to start up loose and stay that way\nSo I don't know how common listed breathing is amongst the population of the moment\nAt the moment I Do know that probably everybody is having pretty talkative dreams but only a few people are aware of that yet only a few people have woken up to it I think it's it's routine I think that we do in the night whether we know it or not\nScout ahead of us so some aspect of consciousness checks up what lies ahead I think that's going on all the time but I think many people have yet to wake up to the fact that they can do it and could use it\nSo regular dreams or what regular dream so people I mean the Greenspan a whole spectrum they are big dreams a little dreams a little dreams that I'd rather routine processing of what went on the day before commentary on how you said yourself and how fast you ate the night before then there are the big dreams\nWhich of the dreams of what you feel that you have received a message and she might kill yourself in the presence of the highest source of wisdom oh you've gone travelling you know you've gone to a distant galaxy or different time period or a place where the dead or alive so\nThe point is that all of these avenues of knowledge and adventure open to everyone all the time the only thing that prevents you from getting in on this\nIs is perhaps your reluctance until now to make time in your life to amend the more of what's going on in the night to write that down keep a journal that's basic practice keep a journal writer don't give it a title notice you'll feelings around the experience to run a reality check asked\nWhether this could happen in the future once you're willing to do some simple things like that you're on the way to becoming a more active treatment here to find it scary to power and expand your life and all sorts of ways\nTo go to Thomas and the whole year California Hi Thomas\nI charge thank you for taking my call Robert ... work that you are doing you know I wanted to tell me Robert um [noise] you know you talk about you know we get tired at night we close our eyes when we go to sleep\nWe have dreams and in the ... not totally\nMan maybe even mentally time travel but then a night us over we open our eyes and is it possible you imply that is\nThat we are stepping from one dream state to another that we are stepping in prom night to oh waking dream during the day a dream and watch\nReality is maybe plastic malleable um Mm\nA day I'll dream and watch reality is maybe plastic malleable um where we can not just mentally travel mentally time travel but actually like the shopping men and women around the world\nThat cycling travel and physically time travel because they are aware that\nReality as a white can dream as opposed to a night during I was wondering if you had a comment on that you seem to about that\nI I Love your statement Thomas yes I think we do step when we come out of the freedom of the night into the dream of the day I think would be to step from one stage unconditional treat me into another one I think the\nWaking life is also a dream in reality you might be more plastic and now they're both can we make a loan so we talked earlier about how your your your tensions the energies you carry the attitudes you carry good a shape your reality\nThe physical possibility of time travel or shape shifting et cetera is of course is is his feet under debate among scholars and scientists and and their traditions of it in different so many lineages\nAs you imply whether time travel is a physical possibility either for certain kinds of primal Sherman all with the technology of the future\nI don't know but I Do know I mean I don't know from my experience I don't think I physically stepped from um time into another though I felt very very much on the edge of it sometimes\nI don't know where the shaped shifting in the way the Germans connect with animal spirits central is physically possible for those people today but I Do believe it probably was physically possible an earlier stage of human evolution when the human animal divide was not as absolute as is today\nBut anyway leaving aside those are areas which fascinating to think about and the stuff of good stories\nI'm absolutely certain that you are right when you say that to come back from a dream of the night in the day is to move from one stage of dreaming to another actually I often feel Thomas this is my step from ... from one room into another from one landscape all from one willed into another\nI have a sort of just so feeling okay I was there doing that that reality now I'm back it as the body in the bed\nI get it out of bed I get off the street and I try not to forget that we might have more opportunity as we go out in the street or out in the day to change things to the vet and make healthful choices and to participate in the construction of reality that we sometimes a lot of\nDreams is just so powerful Robert I think my gosh they're they are I'm dreaming of the way that we wake up this is one of my postal mantras when I used to be my bumper sticker on my car when I had bumper stickers on my car I made I made\nOne but said wake up and dream because to me dreaming is not fundamentally about what happens during sleep I valued sleep creams highly including the ones you don't ... do not want that night show you exactly what you need to know you thought we can\nDream in other ways and wake up to the deeper reality and how the ways waking sometimes without dreams but like sleep workers doing with other people tell us to do trying to fit in with their expectations

my first question what they are noticing some trains that seemed to have a scene with moving parts square that is moving parts\nSay like the second half of the Titanic movie where a DiCaprio is trying to find his way out of the ship is oil is moving parts\nAnd they still has that theme of the still wants to stay with us girlfriend in the movie uh yeah you know he still has hopes about the relationship so the idea of a dream showing moving parts\nAnd my second thing just as you're talking now I was thinking of a I had played a lot of basketball and I never focused on shopping and I noticed\nA\nCouple of times I block shots that word near the top of the back porch so I had the big shopping high\nEnergy good jumping ...\nYeah and this was correlated to going to the gym a lot more and I wasn't going to the gym so I could jump higher you know is basically concerned with scarring a lot of points or getting a lot of assessed\nSo I Can't ... scream about shopping and I never really thought about shopping when I played a lot of basketball so what's\nThe idea of a dream bringing up the aspects of something you did a lot yet didn't focus on while you were doing it and why would a dream to that it's OK maybe like a singer you know always son to a certain type of song or or in rock\nAnd I've springing up another type of a singing you know\nHer interesting ... I mean I'm thinking if I if I Am a boomer player I I'm not doing at this stage in my life but here I Am jumping and high as I used to do in in my dream\nMaybe the dream is preparing me for jump jump in life of a different kind where is the next tide jump I might want to take in my life it might be a new form of activity might be a new form of understanding\nWhere am I going to be a slam dunk in another field of activity in life so that we might be making an analogy between my ... my great prowess or on the basketball court\nWith these jumps at the gym that it lies ahead but the the moving parts of the Titanic analogy is interesting is not a lot to go on but if I if the moving parts make me think of that you know emotional scene from the movie\nI might wonder again where in my life my

through a panicky kind of thing and say I'm finished and uh this is a way it's going to be of course my sister had let go of my hand a long time before that and God only knows where she was [laughter]\nBut ah I was gone after a while for that and I'm not going to breed redress I Can't breathe anymore\nAnd I'm just going to drown that's it and I was down there a long long time I really

[noise] ah I wanted to tell you that it was a glorious experience and I've had many that was really one of the first\nAnd uh I learned a lot from that I learned not to let my sister teach me how to swim for one thing that's probably in the mail message from that\nExactly it's just I got to tell you the same thing happened to me when I was a kid except I didn't have an agility experiences with my father's brother my uncle was the twins\nAnd we're walking in a lake and uh I'm side by side next to my uncle and uh I you know in this leak him just like you don't I when I must have been about eight years old Joyce and I'm going I and I thought this is it I'm dead\nEnd no way back to haunt me\nBack up my pop right back up and then my uncle didn't even know I went under just kept walking [laughter] ... was the weirdest family but I thought that was it for me it was a strange feeling\nTrucks I wanted to tell you I don't know if you ever went to my website but I always watch the time\nOh thank you I was that the world Trade Center when nine eleven occurred because my husband and I had an apartment very close we're like a thousand feet from some of the world Trade Center and we moved there about a month before buildings came\nDown yeah we\nShare a month and on the day we moved and Jack and I looked up and the world Trade Center was\nTowering over our little building on liberty court and ah I said you know we said to each other boy this thing comes down we're finished well exactly a month later they'd come down as you know and we were we had to leave the building and because it was unsafe to be there so many people in that area had to leave\nBut we came back a few days later when it was safe and I had the most phenomenal experience and that's my website where I'm\nGoing to happen I I I actually had gone to sleep and that was awakened entitled to go on to the living room\nAnd to help people to cross over because they were coming through that had created a portal in my building and in my apartment and the people who were had just died were coming through and being released out into the onto the harbor by the statue of liberty and that was Battery Park\nSo that was one of the many incredible experiences I've had and thousands of people see they just kept coming coming I guess you know\nAre you still love that area Joyce\nNo we saw that apartment when my husband passed away and then now I'm In Florida\nBut uh just like so many incredible things have people would just try to remember some of the things that happened to them I think most people say well if I was just and you know something that just happened but write them down recording your dreams as I'm sure your your next guest has got to tell us\nBut write everything down and try to analyze or you're experiencing I'm the best way to develop your yes pay\nIs to try to remember and to try to record what you're experiencing and it will really happen that way and open up more of that consciousness it'll be able to help other people as well so that's that's my primary recommendation record your dream to record your experiences\nI had a I don't know if I should if you ready for me to tell you another one of a one my phenomenal experience is about a\nLovely yeah sure absolutely\nTruck thank you I had never heard of\nOne my phenomenal experience is about a\nLovely

eighties so\nI was at Islam is Terry and it was phenomenal and I came back into my body brought me back\nAnd as I was waking up he said to me don't forget my name and I had never heard I couldn't

was a lot of things gone but I went to his website and that was blown away because he has written\nMaybe a couple of hundred books that are free anyone can\nGo to listen extremely\nCell and just

calls will will do some readings Joyce with everything that you do it in your field what would you say has been the most fulfilling aspect of what you do\nI think the media makes it hard to say maybe I'm ... where people are hailed when they receive messages Miller drugs and they realize that the people are not really just dead or ... or whatever they may be thinking\nBecause really I Love church and religious organizations but they don't do is a big favor or they don't say that person's doing really well so I think that would be my primary methods for people to know that when you cross over ... shouldn't\nGo in to replace a grief let them be joy for on the other side and enjoy the alien wellness with them so that that's really important for medium ship brings and that ability to let people know that their loved ones are doing fine\nDoes the spirit ever come to you and say the monies in the bag under the shoe box\nYeah yeah it's a lot of things and spirit\nOr if you ask before you go for this applies to everyone before you go to sleep at night you ask say please tell me if you continue to ask where is it usually you get an answer if you ask me maybe three times four times she should get an answer just it really hang in there with it and be diligent in your request\nKeep asking we were talking about spirit photography and you've got some of them have you taken the pictures or are they just been given to you\nWell when my husband was here he took a lot of pictures here we've had a camera eye to eye on his neck I took a lot of pictures so I have a lot of spare photography I have a lot of or I have a lot of where things going on and it's so interesting George maybe you can tell me that the reason why we're this comes out on film but it doesn't\nCome out with just the human eye thing at a wife has such a difference do you think\nIt's a huge difference in it's very strange because for some reason the camera picks up goes or just about everything that you can see\nWith the human eye I mean I guess were restricted to to see things in a certain level where the camera digitally and otherwise picks it up\nThat's right and it's so odd and each one of the cell phone or really to the same degree that irregular ah thirty five millimeter camera with with a present it's the same thing so I have yet to figure that out spirited not tell me why but other than the fact that the uh\nThe photographer scientific photography has the ability of the eyes just not have and that's the only answer I could come up with so far is not good [laughter]\nHow do you know you're not being tricked by some demon or something that's that is trained that deceased person somebody charitable\nThat's a great question because if you do any kind of spirit work or you have any kind of messages or you have anything at all you always have to have a blessing for a few tests the spirit you say really are you of God and that's really what I Would say that's what I Would recommend everyone thing before they become involved in this kind of work at all\nSo you always say are you of God and that's what I Would suggest and then team is kind of come in and they will not come in or if you have any kind of threat around you or you're afraid of anything you know that they will not get past that barrier and if you're religious you could say the name of Jesus Christ or whatever you can relate to\nHave you ever witnessed an exorcist\nNo other than the movie which I did not like because books fell off the shelf by themselves very unsettling so it's not a place that I Would want to go to I I Try to avoid darkness and\nYou don't play with the ... board no and I know your feelings about the reach of Gordon I agree with you I have a\nPicture in my seven steps to having book about my ... I did a terrible thing when my son was young says teens are ... and my brother that we're using a weed you brought in my living room and I was sitting on the couch watching them\nAnd we were all very young at that time and my husband took a picture of it and you can see over my shoulder looking in the window behind me from outside a team and say oh really that's in my book seven steps\nSubscribe to the phones next up Greg in North Hollywood, California November twenty six Nineteen fifty seven November twenty six Ninety seven bridge got a birthday coming up I grabbed out\nA way Hey Greg pointed to test your second building because of the past few decades have met the psychics and maybe a handful of actually came up with predictions by saying like a\nYou know what what's going on a criminal or going around [laughter] well that's how I got there and all this but uh the others have worked off of the strategy saying oh you should be speaker and this and that so I'll tell\nYou should be anything but I'm telling you this I Will say one thing about you you have\nA sign of a Scorpio so you'll have secrets and you'd be a great detective and you're always looking for the solving mysteries I Will say that to you and you know you you do it very well and you basically very skeptical which is great because that's how you get answers and true so great to somebody I can do for you\nYeah I'm Wondering if you see predicting wise or something coming up from a career or a my income wise change or to make it better [laughter]\nWell you know what I just mentioned that you love mysteries [laughter] have you ever done any kind of forensic sciences or technology or anything along those lines I detected work anything like that\nNo I Do watch a lot of these uh game shows where you've got to get the words\n[laughter] oh that's a good start well I used to own a new career\nI'm not really I I've been in a career but then it's freelance or independent contract work with a you know sometimes it's slow or just depending on\nWhat I Would say to you is if you want to find out what's really a sole purpose and I feel that it's discovering mysteries you should really solid along those lines out just kind of a study forensics for bed and when you're not doing construction and you're going to find that you have a whole part of your brain that is really exciting [noise]\nYou're honest person and you love honesty and a lot of people in this field and honest so thank you saying that Greg\nGreg Coleman everything works out for you speaking of honesty Joyce did you see something bad will you tell that person\nHas to be honest but you have to cook it and I don't know what you mean by bad like\nMainly like an accident or an accident and I think I'd tell them about maybe you can avoid it\nYes I had a very very very bad accident a few years ago because I did not listen guy\nTold me not to go out for twenty four hours and I was all set to stay home but someone came on and said don't we have to go the beach we have to do that for that or who really horrendous accident so guys who will tell you and if you're not told and you had the accident anyway that was supposed to happen like you charge I don't believe in accidents\nNo and you know when you lose look back at the movie the Christmas carols with Scrooge is looking in the window with the ghost of the future says spirit or these things that will be or could be ... and that's that's an interesting question do you think we have the ability to change our destiny\nI think as you raise your consciousness grow in a awareness and you grow in truth and love and light and understanding you absolutely can't and that's why we're here with the it's a school this is one big school dj origin you know it\nAnd tear for lessons you too well you know you have to experience something really nasty and bypass it\nLet's go to bone in Wichita, Kansas ...
