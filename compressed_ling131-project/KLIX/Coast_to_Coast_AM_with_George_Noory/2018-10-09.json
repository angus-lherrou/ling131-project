Eighteen eighty nine [noise] world's fair\nAnd that's a fictional account [noise]\nWe don't know if it happened or if it didn't happen but it's a new Disney movie okay so all of them in in his so called fictional secret society where time travelers according to the movie and they banned in this world to go find another world where they were going to organized a utopia outside in a different universe a multi ... now\nThe thing about this plus ultra group is that\nNikola Tesla of course lost all of his stuff and it was Donald Trump's uncle that she's dead on behalf of the FBI and the Donald Trump's ankle or had been involved with a lot of things just prior to World War two include including a you know the Manhattan\nProject including a another number of other things that his uncle John was involved with and Trump said well I owe all of my intellect to my uncle John\nGee Trump well here's the thing about plus ultra and this is why I Wonder if it's truly a fictional secret society and whether or not they are secret societal time travelers this is why mar a Lago\nHe's a Florida resort that has been considered the second home to President Trump what's interesting about this ... this whole area in mar a Lago is that there are titles on the wall and those tiles say\nPlus ultra on them and Donald Trump likes to stay in these places where he's called the king now coincidentally there was a report at a recent video turned up or Stanley Kubrick who's the director of two thousand what a space odyssey had described the end seemed to a filmmaker to what two thousand one is ... she was about about an old man\nThey stayed in this very posh hotel and that he was about to take a leap into another round of time listen to what he says to this uh filmmakers

I've ever put her ... her ... or ... or ... or having sort of have proper girls are rather broad now for a group or a front runner\nI rely\nOn his own land\nA lot of her\nHer own style ... [noise] uh\n\nA ... right after a crime or a man and how it happened how long\nAnd hard hat on our on her driver how ... how that happened and I have no right to have like on a long time [noise]\nUh I haven't I don't know how to run\nAround on a very a burnout parent a replica a\nMock attack for However I'm an actor and her her no one would have had died from I don't know quite how I don't know why not [noise]\nMy power and whatnot now\n[noise] I don't know what we now are you know and on I haven't gotten any way when they could have happened and how many [noise] um\nHow how in the world and how I Am\n[noise] um\n[noise] you know a long time and I\nKnow [laughter] how come out a way I have to like what happened when I go back out on a on a townhouse\nSo what is describing the ... how he transforms over time waiting in a room it's kind of like a zoo bit the aliens or whatever they may be the God like these of energy he says\nHey created is to make him feel at home like a palace is it a palace and he's waiting for the years to pass\nAnd then he goes into another realm where he comes back to earth as sort of a Superman or a king or leader okay\nAnd so I I look at the parallel there of what he says is the mythology because I've read Joseph Campbell and he talks about the Mona mythical hero we've had many presidents over time including Brock Obama where they said that he was among the mythical heroes very strange about\nYou know Obama's father not knowing much about his father kind of like Superman you know not knowing much about his father that kinda thing but with Donald Trump\nIs like what do we know about his article what do we know about his father what do we know about his family what do we know about his relationship with Nikola Tesla what was it that he found\nIn those papers that were seized by that alien group or the government the FBI and why is it that he likes to stay in the U.S like what Hoover talked about this this place where plus ultra is all over the title\n[noise] and plus ultra is a fictional [noise]\nTime traveling secret society where H. G. wells Nikola Tesla Thomas Edison and Ray Bradbury and all these visionaries were a part of it it makes you wonder does believe tomorrow in this truly a predicted program and\nThat I can actually tell you one better in terms of this idea of a parallel universe sweat blood has wanted that they may holding tracked\nUh I don't know go ahead tell me what kind of likes yeah marble exactly uh-huh\nWhat's one of the weirder concepts Saudi around last holdout forty years ago though and the whole ... Saturdays\nTo my doctor strange uh nope segments dang\nThing what men thing yeah the mutants\nNo or patches swap outside the little town outside yourself Florida that was called an excess of all reality it's\nUh-huh this is a multi first I'll play\nWell and yeah it is really weird and it's like we were saying earlier when everything went down with Trump people are protesting Trump's policies and he wasn't even president yet\nThe remember that yeah that was weird\nYeah they were all out there and when you go up to somebody and say well why are you protesting well we're protesting Trump's policies well he's not president yet I mean he got elected but nobody knew of his policies but yet they were protesting his policies before I even had a chance\nTo see what his policies were they were already saying what he was before he even did anything and that's why you thought was weird it was almost like they had the cart before the horse or the or the effect before the cars and now the causes happening\nThe effects are now echoing again and reverberating again into protests the resistance of starting up again it's just like some echo in time went back\nAnd forth and it's all back to that you know that lock would novel about\nA there's such a roar in the streets of New York at the hotel on Fifth Avenue\nHas a lot we have to guard the hotel on Fifth Avenue\nReady to throw the power of socialism I'm surprised you mention a leather pays or possible predict a program that was a little more optimistic of that thing ever\nPoverty of socialism I'm not surprised Jonah leather pays or possible productive programming that was a little more optimistic and I think ever delegate looking backwards and what's that rebel and he's looking backward oh oh I'm going to have kind of weird yeah when I turned out of my sons says\nWell I I I was just pointing out that she was because he was the number of allegedly a member of plus ultra sets all ...\n[noise] I don't know but they don't\nGet points to adjusted I appreciate your calling it let's go to Steve in North Carolina high fever and ground zero\n[noise] hey how you doing first off let me say I'm a radio guy myself I've been in business for Twenty years I Love your show you do a great job that you so much I appreciate that and\nUm but ah H E mails I I always figured him to be a time traveler in fact when he when he wrote a time machine back in the late Eighteen hundreds he describes a nuclear war before anyone could even imagine that I I mean the first time we had a a a bomb was in the forties\nAnd he described\nIn Eighteen maybe five it out [noise]\n[noise] well I I I find that interesting because he was talking about it and then of course things to come or where he was talking about a war that would break out in Nineteen forty and it would be an evil dictators would run that more but wasn't until Nineteen forty one and this happened and of course Hitler was the was the guy\nAnd and also if you see the movie\nOr things become it's all about the power of the air or the power of the of the flying machines and how the flying machines will advance to a point where uh they would use them in warfare in the aviation would be a concern in the ah the idea of space being a battlefield would be a concern\nRight ... it's amazing how how it came to be an and uh like I say that there is no way that you could just imagine that stuff in the late Eighteen hundreds he he had to be he had to see something\nYeah I mean he he was a visionary for sure but\nIt all goes back to whether or not there is a plus ultra group that actually existed sit there were a visionary that were time travel is like Tesla and and do some pie pole and all these people are overtime and Ray Bradbury and ... and all these guys whether or not they were involved\nAnd whatnot they didn't do to some other place where they were able to skate this world and maybe testing was one of the guys that made this possible and John Gee Trump was one of the guys who knew about it as well and maybe even Donald Trump knows about it to\nBe out there like I say you're you're you're blowing my mind that I [laughter] it's just amazing how this all comes together I mean I ... you know\nSomething something up I mean what got me though is I accidentally stumbled upon the mar a Lago to that because I was thinking to myself you know there's gotta be something more to this and when I saw plus ultra on the tiles at mar a Lago I thought wow this is this is too much\nRight [laughter] right yeah it's crazy man or either\nThe recall the show tonight appreciate it say about it it's going to beat in Texas Hi Peter on ground zero\nApplied so quickly\nA lot of trying to burst and bubbles here I Am a logical type type person but I\nDon't doubt or the law that that things secret societies ... mother like a da da de ... a political conversations and could at lot of other worthy or a\nLaw go where you have a ... the the plus all Shaw on these tiles could not just be I I don't want to say coincidence but more so a coincidence\nOf his uncle and understanding the formation that his uncle had\nSure it's all it's all I guess it's all a coincidence of course it can be all coincidence but you know look when you're located coincidences and you can name three four five six coincidences it seems a little bit weird when you have the pattern going on and\nAnd while what Laquan wrote may have nothing to do with ... it just certainly all seems a bit I mean most of it's all based on fiction every writings in literature okay we'll get to Maryland it's a movie that talks about plus ultra as a secret society we have\nA lock would writing what he wrote about with regard to Baron Trump in the last president we got all these things that are kind of secret instantly synchronous sickly or mesh together may come together in such a way it's beautiful and it's secret in stick and yeah it could be all one big coincidence but boy it's one hell of a coincidence isn't it\n[laughter] it is a hell of a coincidence or just like it so I like the people in the ... all the time it's just not one visionary to the level of one of the coolest visualized and it just always do with their storylines and it just to to to pick up in a moment here or a book here uh\nWell I I can tell you that Laura law go at it had been built long before ... soldiers showed up in in a film by Disney\nAnd you realize that\nTrump is attached to John John sharp and then we still have a the the the the\nIt was so that was ... was John ... a member of ...\nI couldn't tell you guys know way\nMore than ... a real secret society or is this something that was just made up and it's just coincidental that plus ultra happens to be plastered all over mar a Lago\n\n... and and I I Would I Would say that my ... right but it at the same time it's people probably just pulls pieces to or what they what they know worlds and how long ago with the house price in la la though is long before the movie\n... I mean the movie came out a lot of the year or two ago I mean our law go back just a few years ago yeah I mean so I mean mar a Lago ... been a long been around a lot longer than that that was like Trump second home before he became president so\nYou know that that's something that ah it's just odd that the king as they call him is in a power or palatial area where it's kinda like what Cooper talked about an old man is in an area\nThat's got all of this beautiful nice and neat stuff where he's like you to do and then he's whisked away by these guys came to tease and then he sent back to earth to become a Superman [noise]\nI mean covert knew a lot about secret societies he knew a lot about what was going on behind the scenes\nI mean I'd wide shut the perfect example in the film we did that was basically revealing a lot of stuff in the background [noise]\nStuff [noise] but I just I just figured I'd I'd I'd pitch and thought this was more how how the the logical Thailand and then you mentioned it earlier someone can come out entire life there's a short book um that I I think that's an amazing I\nYeah [laughter] yeah they could just as if they could but you know even when I went to snow they [noise] I Know even though I don't like the ... so he said well fact check this snow I did and they said it's partially\nTrue I don't know I don't know what part is partially true [noise]\nI don't know if I Believe ... three thirty seven hundred will be back what do you think [laughter] [laughter]\n\nWhat happened you used to go hours without visiting the bathroom now it seems like you're constantly getting up to\nYou know this is not okay listen the makers of super beta prostate the number one prostate formula are introducing a new one to a pill super beta prostate piece three advanced with three key ingredients that are great for your prostate if like taking three prostate supplements and want to celebrate we're sending free bottles to men\nWho want to cut down on bathroom trips yes your first thirty days supplies free pay shipping and handling just dial hounded two fifty on your mobile phone and said a key word not OK early research suggests that an ingredient in ... three advanced may help support an normal prostate sauce combine that\nThey can do whatever it is when I got a phone call when my little at the grocery store you'll ... you'll listeners\nLobby WWW dot he was ... first choice for news and talk on the radio\nHe was way over the John Kerry yellow York's [noise] news then talk on the radio dishes use radio ...

and on society as well he writes books that explore the wonders of the world of tomorrow and delights audiences all over the planet with his vivid presentations on the future of working life\nIn areas on the coast to coast looking for love your cover on this book by the way Byron\nWell thank you very much and thank you for having me\nSo a lot of people are concerned that that the world of robots is going to take over the planet take take our jobs and do everything else is that something for us to be concerned about\nI don't think so um you know I think people's worries fall into two big buckets and one of them is what you mentioned which is 'em robots taking people jobs\nBut um other tests to my website you take to try to figure out if if your job is at risk\nAnd it it records all the answers and very very few jobs actually cut a robot take over I mean you try to just imagine one being a plumber or I'm a kindergarten teacher or a hostage negotiator or\nAny of the thousands of other things people do and and and that are so no I don't think that's a a real concern at all I think\nWe build these tools to increase our own productivity and we were all kind of better off because of them\nLet's talk a little bit by run about artificial intelligence\nThese tools to increase our own productivity and we we're all kind of better off because of them\nLet's talk a little bit by run about artificial intelligence and I ... what is it and how are they able to make these things so smart\n[noise] well that's a great question what is it is is more complex than you would think because nobody agrees on what intelligence means\nAbout what what they what people mean by the term are two very different things that may have nothing in common so they either me or what you see in the movies so commander data of Star Trek or see three ... or\nA that would be an a machine that can do everything a person could do it's created it can teach itself new things\nAnd we don't we don't know how to build that nobody knows how to build that and that's called a general intelligence or\nIt is a computer program that can do one thing very well they can identify stand in your email they can route you through traffic and that we know how to do pretty well and the way we do it is really quite simple you take a bunch of data about the past\nYou get the computer to study it and make projections about the future and that doesn't sound all that interesting\nBut that's in essence of what we do\nWe're just a lot better at it than we used to be because computers are faster we can collect data much easier and the rest so we're now able to just do a lot of things to really look smart um by just using these simple simple techniques which are called machine learning\nOur our government's so far advanced with artificial intelligence that they're doing things that would just curl us if we found out what they were\nWell there's certainly that potential you see we we used to all have some amount of privacy or just based on the fact that there are so many of us can't follow every person you can't listen to every phone conversation\nUnfortunately with artificial intelligence the kinds of tools we are developing to do very good things like that didn't apply cancer or something like that\nCan be used to to to to follow people voice to the to text so now a every phone conversation can be recorded and it can be turned into text uh computers are as good as humans that reading list so every camera even if it doesn't have audio can read lips as well as a human\nI'm a ... you know you have a a device that tracks where you are and again all of these things ended up themselves aren't that technology is but they certainly can be used in aggregate to profile everyone and you even have places in the world\nUm you know China has implemented a kind\nOf a social score yeah that's right you\nRun a red light you lose the ... if you go to an anti government rally you lose four points if you write a pro government blog you get two points and uh if you if you get low enough you don't fly on airplanes anymore and you do to 'em\nAnd and do you do your kids don't get into good schools and you don't get any may not even exist [laughter] who knows right\nI Hope it doesn't come to that but but it just shows that these technologies really are a habit capability of of of of being misused of course hopefully in in a country where you have a lot of transparency and you have\nGovernments that you know you have a Republican but this is governed by laws the price of liberty is a total vigilant Senate so the price of privacy is the same that we just have to make sure that the laws are in place and forced that done\nBut Senate so the price of privacy is the same that we just have to make sure that the laws are in place and enforced that don't allow that to happen because it's certainly something that is technically quite possible\nByron is every tell them the telephone conversation smart phone conversation being recorded or listen to or even though Ninety nine percent of them are probably mundane and don't mean anything but what are they being listened to\nI don't know I don't know but I I just couldn't say the technology is it a point where they could decipher you know what what what that many people are saying and then it can\nAh it doesn't have to understand that and the way the human understand something that decides to look for patterns and combinations of words along with um ... and\nAnd and just kind of build up the abstract profiles on people I mean all I'm saying is is it is it is a potential way to use this technology which can be to do so many good things\nAnd you know I've got mixed feelings about this too because on one hand or a let's say that there are a group of terrorists talking about bombing or something and the computer you know is is set up to pick up code words like ... or whatever\nAnd so it finds this uh on one hand it's an invasion of privacy everybody's privacy\nOn the other hand they may have been able to stop something from happening if they follow through with it and they go in you know catch the perpetrators I'm wrestling with myself Brian ... by run in terms of if it's OK or not\n[noise] well it is it ... it is a new enough problem that we kind of don't have a societal consensus on how to deal with it we don't we don't have kind of norms you can find you know the federalist papers that addressed that topic\nUh an hour that's going to have to be a conversation that we have over the course of the next several years about about what what we want\nAll right well stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come right back by Reverend Reese with us his book is called the fourth age we're talking a lot of high technology folks and what it does his website is his name linked up for you at coast to coast am dot com we'll be back in a moment don't\nTouch you dial never missed a detail of the show or a gift to sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free it goes to ... dot com\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I'll say this what what they're worried about a was ... when she died earlier which is that kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence\nAnd that's we don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a supposition and that is that people are machines if if\nYou are a machine and your brain is a machine in your mind as a machine and it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a new chemical you\nAnd then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um I find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley\nI'm On my part cost about it I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that\nAnd yet when we take surveys on my website asking essentially the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country doesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe your machine because eventually we'll probably build a mechanical version\nIf you don't think human beings are just machines\nThen no than a machine could never do what a person can do\nTechnologically how did they make artificial intelligence work the way it does just with chips and the little things that they do I mean to me it's amazing that they can put this kind of ... brain power on a little computer chip\nYeah it it's staggering who really is um\nThe thing is is that when a computer can play chess someone to computer complete go and when the computer can play poker and and do all of these things the way human does it ... you tend to think that it's thinking like a human is but but there really is a quote anybody home there's nothing there but does any thinking at all it's\nIt's one reason zeroes manipulated in memory turned on and off\nAt the speed of light um it's done with what's relative it's interesting the techniques we use for it official intelligence we'd been writing about for forty years\nBut what's relative it it's interesting the techniques we use for the official intelligence we'd been writing about for forty years since just we've never had the machines to do it but it isn't some thing there is a thought experiment called the Chinese room problem\nAnd it's about it it goes like this there's this there's this rumor that's full of these books and there's a person in this person is called the library and then it's important to note the librarian doesn't speak any Chinese\nPeople outside the roof slide questions written in Chinese under the door to this Chinese to this librarian the librarian picks them up looks at the first character and the question goes and finds a book with that on the spine\nLooks up the second character that sends him to another book to another book to another book to another book\nUntil it gets to the end of the message the last book says write this down any copies these symbols he doesn't even understand and besides the back under the door and the person who submitted the question looks at it and it's brilliant it's perfect Chinese since perfect\nAnd so the question is does it was the library and understand Chinese those are those the library and understand Chinese\nDid too to a lot of people in Silicon valley the idea that it can converse in Chinese but doesn't understand it doesn't make any sense but to a lot of people know delivery and doesn't know if they're talking about Colorado coffee beans\nAnd the analogy is an apt one because it's all the computer does it runs a set of determining stick processes in memory\nIt spits out an answer and it doesn't know it's playing chess it doesn't know any what it's talking about it doesn't know anything\nAnd so you kinda have to ask is the computer thinking or not does the computer understand anything or not or by my way of looking it doesn't it doesn't understand anything but other people other people say if it can do everything that that's something that does understand can do then you just have to say it does\nIt is just mind boggling and it's getting even better or is it not the technology every year\nAbsolutely computers do this thing where in a very simple short and they double in power every couple of years brought on top of that we're collecting data faster than ever before right now there's Fifteen billion devices connected to the Internet many of which can I collect data\nThere'll be eighty billion by twenty twenty five and all of those who have all this data coming enemies faster computers and so it's it will only get faster and then if you think about it if you think about it the Internet the mosaic browser cannot twenty five years ago a literally in in Ninety three\nAnd all that did was like computers talk to each other and that was it and that somehow changed our world and that created a twenty five trillion dollars and well\nA million new businesses it up into I mean it did everything that that imagine a technology that practically makes everybody smarter than they were before you go to bed tonight everybody on the planet wakes up with ten more IQ points\nThat is going to be more transformative than the mere Internet which just connected a bunch of machines together this this is machines think\nReason they show emotion Byron\nThat is an open question a it is even an open question whether you want them to\nI don't I'm not sure I'd want them to\nShow the first question is do you want them to simulate emotion uh there there's a couple of different sides to that you know I have a desktop device that I talked to and\nYeah like emotion uh there there's a couple of different sides to that you know I have a desktop device that I talked to and I interrupted and I tell it to stop in a way I wouldn't do a person\nUm you had you had students had kids in Japan and there was a a robot they let loose in the mall and these little kids would bother would beat it and the robot learned that if it's all a bunch of short people kids without a tall person around an adult it needed a run off to a tall person because\nThe kids would abuse it now when I asked later the kids said they thought it was feeling distress so they even though like it was in turn allies against you wonder about about a kindergarten teacher you know that the robotic that\nUh the raising children on the ... the ... you you just start with that do you even want them to have human voices is that the noble the machine somehow or does\nYou know we've had the car way to these things called human rights\nA to a point where we say there are certain things you cannot do to any human being and because there's something special about the human being and and do we kind of want to make things look like humans that we do abuse and throw into a scrap heap and\nAnd and destroy without a second thought what that is suddenly had ain't nothing effect on people now the question Ken they feel emotion a that is an open question we\nWe have we have something called consciousness which is that we experience the world\nWe feel warmth a computer measures temperature that difference whatever that is that you feel the warmth of something\nLike computer right now we don't think uh can we can measure temperature and even if you make a program that plays a person's screaming at the temperature gets over five hundred degrees nobody believes that computer feels that pain nobody believes that sent\nShaping up or sentient now the interesting thing is we wouldn't know it if I'm if they did really well you wouldn't know if a treat the pain and you share half your DNA with the with the tree\nYou should know DNA with a computer and so we wouldn't really even know if they ever if they ever developed a emotions\nAnd even if they claimed that they did that could just be in a way a program running that you know the the\nThe program reasons that it can can achieve whatever objective it wants by making this claim I'm so it it's an open question it all boils down to do you think emotions in the end are mechanical I mean our our ... again it's a punchy back to the original question are we machines and therefore\nOur experience of emotion is just something mechanical\nWhat happens in these machines Myron go road and they start doing things to us to screw up our lives on purpose\nWell I'm\nA little help from two thousand one space on\nRight I mean look\nIf it ever happened uh we're completely vulnerable of course\nYou know if there were eighty billion devices attached to the Internet you know smart other news just carnival alone and override their safety protocols I mean\nThere is so many ways a malevolent machine would want to um would be able to inflict harm\nThe the interesting and and to you kinda have to say what would that happen and it can happen in one or two scenarios either through Canada's programming machine just does it doesn't have any intent at all\nUm or getting the machine somehow develop goals\nIn just does it doesn't have any intent at all um or getting the machine somehow develop goals or the tone that are different than ours and perhaps in conflict with hours and ... and pursue those goals against those\nThey're um they're open questions I mean\nRight now though it doesn't feel like you know I ...

I think anything that multiplies human ability is\nYou know with ... with a few exceptions\nThe idea if you could make people more productive that's always good if you don't think it is then you should support a law\nThat makes everybody work with one arm tied behind their back because instantly you create new jobs it'll just take a lot more people to do anything uh but our productivity will plummet and so that's what technology is just like a third arm it means you can do even more\nLet's take some calls here for us by Ron let's pick it up by going to Jeff in Tennessee welcome to the program they're going to start and hey Jeffrey go ahead\nOf Taliban before I Love the outdoors thank you Janet ... not once or twice that that's something that is fitting out and fire [laughter] and I and I tell you what play dialing back down and show\nYou know what I'm saying that don't say that but what what's wrong film\nI they say well now that added they play the jobs I mean the technology that taken out their wife\nWell Byron you're saying that it creates more jobs right I mean look at\nYou can look at the un unemployment numbers in this country are you know good I mean they're they're down a there are some people who say the workforce participation rate is lower which are the number of people who actually are looking for work\nOr almost all of that can be accounted for by a baby boomers retiring\nI'm ... you know technology always empowers people to be able to do more there's this kind of like an infinite number of jobs you you can make a job instantly the minute you take something a lump of clay\nAnd you apply labor and technology to it you make something worth more a vase and whatever value you were able to add that to wage\nAnd because technology lets you do more technology increases wages it it's really rough when it when it happens in a localized area and ah so you you get pockets of places where it takes a long time for it to kind of shake out and and that's rough and I think we should do a much better job kind of\nFacilitating that\nUp because you know if you can say well it's all going to work out\nAnd and that's that's hard and and so we we got to be very mindful of that how we train people the kinds of safety nets we we provide but turned against technology to say somehow knowing how to be more productive is bad for for people or I think it's a hard case to make\nNo I'm opposed to and I've said this before driverless trucks I don't want to displace truck drivers or they're hardworking dedicated people and I don't trust a driverless truck I just know what do you think of that\nUm I think that's one of the biggest kind of a myth\nThat a is there is going to be a huge\nA shortage of truck drivers I think that that goes\nYou know without kind of without saying first of all they're kind of facing a demographic disaster that every year the average age of all the truck drivers is going up because everybody's like you know young people don't go into it because everybody's like there's a future in that because of self driving trucks\nSo most knowledgeable people in the industry are predicting we're going to have this this great shortage of them and even when we get over the technological hurdles then when we get over the legislative hurdles\nThey they still are only going to be able to do part of of the hall\nI still don't want to see a driverless truck jeeze put it in Los Angeles traffic it'll go crazy [laughter]\n[laughter] well I agree there's a long way for the technology to go it's interesting that thousands of people die in car accidents and a president but if there's one accident with a driverless car it makes\nIt's a huge anyway in in in ...

robot may not enjoy a human being or through inaction\nAllow a human being to come to harm to\nA robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except for such orders would conflict with the first law three a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law so what he's saying is is robots\nCan't injured human beings at any cost\nThat is kind of like in conflict with they all of you know soldiers that are robotic\n[noise] yeah yeah that's true that's true\nYou know the the the walls are are are literary device so you can tell a story they don't actually get us very far um [noise] you know if I'm going to do something dangerous potentially aren't myself 'cause the robot according to those laws intervene and\nYou know if I'm going to do something dangerous\nPotentially aren't myself 'cause the robot according to those laws intervene and stop me ... ... if I if I order a second dessert and I got a few extra pounds on me that was the robot say no you can't have the desert because that's gonna hurt you got to save you got to protect\nExactly monitoring your blood glucose levels are too high or whenever exactly\nExactly so like from a practical standpoint the real challenge with robots is no two people\nKind of agree on what moral behavior isn't isn't and even if you just say well we're just going to pick you know Joe\nAnd make use Joe's moral code for all the robots even Joe's moral code is like full of provide those and while you don't do that unless it's this but\nIf they're all they're all of these if if sin and that so we don't really have a way to make sure robots that have ethically and like you said there's a lot of incentives for them not to\nLose a robot out there called ... which I'm going to try to do an interview with Sophia because it talks and you know it's styled after a woman but uh I'm going to call it in it because it's a robot but you can ask\nA question it'll give you a response isn't that bizarre\nI'm unfamiliar unfamiliar with it or you know I think if you ask it a question just asking what's bigger a nickel or the side and they'd probably does a no no no I mean it\nIt it it'll have an incredibly narrow range of things that he can talk about uh if you ask anything like um you know a wide as Mr T. pity the fool or a\n... anything just asking anything uh aside from how do you feel or anything like that decides\nTo get anything about life anything weird he won't be able to comprehend I'm\nEven something like the kind of thing that you might ask or any other person you meet\nLike um\nGive it the simplest problem you can the these systems there there's something called the Turing test which basically says if you can't tell if you're talking to a person or a a machine like through text that you have to say the machines thinking at least that's what the test says if you read the transcripts\nOf actual\nThings that are trying to pass that you would do with one question so they had to put all these rules like you can't ask about current events and you can't ask about\nAnd you can ask the city can escape this and even then we've never had anything this past this\nI'm Sylvia looks good because it looks like a person and if you take something that looks like a person and you give it a person's voice and it says words you're kind of in the back of your head going to say oh it that's really thinking right right it's if you if you say no that's just\nYou know that that is not if they made it look like I'm\nA vase if all of a sudden the illusion would be appropriate would\nAlign sure and I always thought maybe they had somebody hidden away in a corner talking through her and it was really them talking\nLike no no um it's a chat

grade science test\nA like that's the big thing it turns out computers have a hard time with common sense problems we don't know how it is that we ... people [laughter] right right well let's do this thing we do know how to get machines to do what's called trends for learning\nYou can take something you learn in one place and apply it elsewhere and we don't know how people do that\nYou can train you could show a kid a little kid for pictures of the cat that ... that child knows where the cat looks like\nAnd if they see one of those makes cats we got to pay oh they'll say look a cat without a tail even though they never even knew there was such a thing right you still like thousands of cats to train a computer and the computer would never say oh that's a cat without a tail just got fed

modification of what's been going on for the last sixty\nYears with computers they you know the the technology keeps\nExpanding any spending because of the way people program them so I just really extension of ads nothing new but how does it that that they think mankind is going to be eliminated okay because you had to have people to service these machines you have to have people that can provide electricity to run the power lines to run the power plants\nTo do all this stuff how do they think that a I\nIs going to eliminate mankind is going to be a planet full of machine is a you know I keep hearing this hyperbole over and over and nobody can tell me how they're going to do all this you can't even get a ... machine to walk right now let alone climb a power pole and provided that Christie are going in trouble shoot a machine is broke and\nYou see in their world the machine will replicate itself by rebuilding itself I don't see that happening Byron\nI I agree I agree with Larry

you talking about a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world\nMake believe [laughter] it's coming true isn't it\n[noise] it it it it definitely is coming true it it it was funny I um when I was sitting with my publisher she was asking me about some of my photographs and I said you know some of the creatures and then that I that I get and these photographs looked like they ... out of movies that I've marketed\nAnd she goes\nOh my gosh you're living like the real world of may leave I say different that crazy during the day I'm and make believe and then at night\nYou'd comes true it comes to [laughter]\nHave you ever gone to the point where you were scared or you felt threatened\nYes I did what happened will times yeah you know and we can start going weird hair in a minute if he won two\nBecause some of the things I encountered um are are strange and some are scary and\nYou know I found at times um and and this is where the Claire sent in really that that gift comes in to convict very handy um\nWhere I can feel and if there is a ... a bad entity and evil entity that is around and I learned something really important for folks to understand and and that is if you if if they find themselves\nWhere they have it goes in their house and they feel like they've encountered something and they they feel that fear and their body all they have to do\nIs be in charge because they are in charge because it's the fear\nThey're looking for and so if you stand there and go get out of my house you are not allowed in here believe me can you say you can use any of the tools that you want that to their ear human\nI'll see we're not allowed in here believe you can you say you can use any of the tools that you want but to exert your human dominant is like its dominance like you\nYou can get rid of a seven like that and that's what I found because I started clearing people's homes and I started weirdly because I again my Oklahoma upgrade um upbringing I was raised in ... and so I knew the Lord's Prayer hadn't used it for really long time I'm\nGoing to work for you\n... what's really interesting is that's another way that I could find if there were um you know dark spirits around is it I Would start saying though I like I start saying well Lourdes for over and over and if any point in time I forget where I stand ... there's something there\nYou're like a magnet it's kind of well maybe [laughter] ...\nI mean we all are telling the truth while I was gonna say do you think everybody has this capability but you know we're ... we're argue unusual you know\nI think that we're all born with different gift that we're able to tap into Josh I have a friend that is the most incredible medium you will ever meet in your life and the specificity of the messages that she gets from the other side are detailed as addresses that you've lived in in your life\nWhen from the number of into the street name so I think everybody has something different you know it perhaps I have you know\nA ... few weird capabilities in in in in the world so yeah I think probably I Do\nYou actually because urine to of course media you'll be more ... you boom boom ghost when you were experiencing this how come\n[noise] you know I think any time you encounter something new in your world right and your kind of yeah becomes your reality you want to see he he he's a want to know you're not the only one and I think I was looking to see how common are on\nCollege specifically the photograph did you get the answers\n[noise] um I started to I started to understand and that's when I started to actually talk about it after that and it was the talking about if that really kind of ease my nerves and then [laughter]\nAnd then of course I turned to the movies and there are some really fabulous movies that are based on true accounts and one of them is that movie the witch\nAnd did you do you have and see the which\nI have not seen you haven't\nSeen that there's a scene in which it it was based on the Salem witch trials like before the film was true\nAnd I'm James van ... who is the kind of friend of mine is the producer and and he did a lot of work at the New York public library pulling you know an original pamphlets from back in the day\nAnd there's a scene where the father or the and families circled around I'm the son who is um a possess and he says everybody must say the Lord's Prayer so they'll start saying the Lord's Prayer than the two twins\nAre saying it and then they fall on the floor in concert shaking um because there was a there was a a like a\nEvil entity that was around and I later talk today about he's like oh yeah that's the Lord's Prayer is how it was like a\nDividing rod to find them to know\nAnd and I'm like oh my gosh that's been happening to me [laughter] so it's weird how things happen without instructions\nOh and and I'm like oh my gosh that's been happening to me the [laughter]\nSo it's weird how things happen without instructions I think that's a really interesting part about all of this\nIs that all of us to sort of happened to me and there was no instruction book [noise] you know I was able to identify what goes

seventies\nOr an Italian security guards and peers them Freda\nAnd he was called upon the house that look like the word burglar or to get you got onto the scene and\nIt's full of alien creatures but he claimed that he was abducted and several years later after his abduction a man outside of a gas station with a silvery shield and strange metallic suit on\nA that was described to be the greening man came and told him that the you know everything's going to be All right and aliens come in and seeing him and apparently this man it's been seen throughout the ages and kids in a New Jersey's law and\nUm [noise] the blackout man\nKind of seems like it might be on the same\nWavelength of them said that the man's name was Andrew to hold\nA man that he was an alien um or maybe it's time travel or he doesn't really know what he was but he wasn't directly through\nAnd ah if you if you get a chance you know check out the breeding man it's a very strange uh currents that happens and no one really knows how to place and I was wondering if your guest\nI'd ever heard of it and she adds in check it out\nBecause we do that and then we will check out the green mill I have\nNot heard of of him I'm

looks like what we've seen in movies looks like looks like and movies that I've marketed 'em and\nYou know it's a really interesting concept because it's the one that gets people really uncomfortable because so many people actually believing aliens that just don't believe they're here\nAnd I was asked the other day it's like well do you actually believe I said how can how can I not how can I not believe you know it it was in my backyard\nI Wonder if these movies ... of these movies you dealt with are coming alive\nWell here's I have a different philosophy what if it's possible that those that are actually making the movies are seen them themselves what of Walt Disney saw all of those creatures that he put in his movies\nWhat I call them fantastical that's what I used\nTo work in a way to create you know then created them when he saw them basically\nThat he created when he saw him I mean what is that what if this is an has nothing to do with me was that they actually do exist and those that that create um actually I also see them somehow\nWell some of the great directors or our lives to white Spielberg and people like that if you ever run into them ask them\nYou know I'm the

technology in the workplace and on society as well he writes books that explore the wonders of the world of tomorrow and delights audiences all over the planet with his vivid presentations on the future of work and life\nIn areas on coast to coast looking for love your cover on this book by the way by run\nWell thank you very much and thank you for having me\nSo a lot of people are concerned that the world of robots is going to tell\nWell thank you very much and thank you for having me\nSo a lot of people are concerned that the world of robots is going to take over the planet hey you take our jobs and do everything else is that something for us to be concerned about\n[noise] I don't think so um you know I think people's worries fall into two big buckets and one of them is what you mentioned which is 'em robots taking people jobs\nBut I'm not a test on my website you take to try to figure out if it's your job is at risk\nAnd it it records all the answers and very very few jobs actually cut a robot take over I mean you try to just imagine one being a plumber or I'm a kindergarten teacher or a hostage negotiator or\nAny of the thousands of other things people do and and and that are so no I don't think that's a a real concern at all I think\nWe build these tools to increase our own productivity and we we're all kind of better off because of them\nLet's talk a little bit by run about artificial intelligence and I ... what is it and how are they able to make these things so smart\n[noise] well that's a great question what is it is is more complex than you would think because nobody agrees on what intelligence means\nAbout what one thing what people mean by the term are two very different things that may have nothing in common so they either me or what'd you see in the movies so commander data upstart truckers see three Maria or\nA that would be an a machine that can do everything a person can do it's created it can teach itself new things\nAnd we don't we don't know how to build that nobody knows how to build that and that's called a general intelligence or\nIt is a computer program that can do one thing very well they can identify spam and your email it can route you through traffic and that we know how to do pretty well and the way we do it is really quite simple you take a bunch of data about the past\nYou get the computer to study it and make projections about the future and that doesn't sound all that interesting\nBut that's in a sense of what we do we're just a lot better at it than we used to be because computers are faster we can collect data much easier and the rest so we're now able to just do a lot of things that really look\nSmart um by just using these super simple techniques which are called machine learning\nOur our government's so far advanced with artificial intelligence that they're doing things that would just curl us if we found out what they were\nWell there's certainly that potential you see\nWe we used to all have some amount of privacy or just based on the fact that there are so many of us can't follow every person you can't listen to every phone conversation\nUnfortunately with artificial intelligence the kinds of tools we are developing to do very good things like that then apply cancer or something like that\nCan be used to to to to follow people voice to the to text so now a every phone conversation can be recorded and it can be turned into text uh computers are as good as humans that reading list so every camera even if it doesn't have the audio can read lips as well as a human\nUm your you know you have a a device that tracks where you are and again all of these things ended up themselves aren't bad technologies but they certainly can be used in aggregate to profile everyone and you even have places in the world\nUm you know China has implemented a kind of a ...\nIn aggregate to profile everyone and you even have places in the world um you know China has implemented a kind of a social ... yeah that's right you\nRun a red light you lose a point if you go to an anti government rally you lose four points if you write a pro government blog you get two points and uh if you if you get a low enough you don't fly on airplanes anymore you do um and and you do your kids don't get into good schools and you don't get\nAny may not even exist who knows right\nI Hope it doesn't come to that but but it just shows that these technologies really are a habit capability of of of being misused of course hopefully in in a country where you have a lot of transparency and you have\nA government that you know you have a Republican but this governed by laws\nThe price of liberty is sort of vigilance in it so the price of privacy is the same that we just have to make sure that the laws are in place and forced that don't allow that to happen because it's certainly something that is technically quite possible\nViolence is every tell them the telephone conversation smart phone conversation being recorded or listen to or even though Ninety nine percent of them are probably mundane and don't mean anything but what are they being listened to\nI don't know I don't know but I I just said the technology is it a point where they could decipher you know what what would that many people are saying and then it can\nAh it doesn't have to understand that and the way that human understand something it decides to look for patterns in combinations of words along with um actions and\nAnd and just kind of build a bill obstruct profiles on people I mean I'm I'm saying is is it is it is a potential way to abuse this technology which can be to do so many good things\nAnd you know I've got mixed feelings about this too because on one hand or a let's say that there are a group of terrorists talking about bombing or something and the computer you know is is set up to pick up code words like ... or whatever\nAnd suicides this uh on one hand it's an invasion of privacy everybody's privacy\nOn the other hand they may have been able to stop something from happening if they follow through with it and they go in you know catch the perpetrators I'm wrestling with myself Brian in Byron in terms of if it's OK or not\n[noise] well it is it and it is a new enough problem that we kind of don't have a societal consensus on how to deal with it we don't we don't have kind of norms you can find you know the federalist papers that addressed that topic\nOr an hour that's going to have to be a conversation that we have over the course of the next several years about about what what we want\nAll right well stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come right back by Reverend Reese with us his book is called the fourth age we're talking a lot of high technology folks and what it does his website is his name linked up for you at coast to coast am dot com we'll be back in the moment don't touch you\nDial ... detail of the show or a guest and sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free it goes to ...\nAnd that's we don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a supposition and that is that people are machines\nIf if you are a machine and your brain is a machine and your mind as a machine and it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you\nAnd then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye view of a hundred and two hundred two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um I find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley\nI'm On my part cost about it I I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that\nAnd yet when we take surveys on my website asking essentially the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country doesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe you're a machine because eventually we'll probably build a mechanical version\nIf you don't think human beings are just machines then no then the machine could ever do what a person can do\nTechnologically how did they make artificial intelligence work the way it does just with chips and the little things that they do I mean to me it's amazing that they can put this kind of ... brain power on a little computer chip\nIt's staggering really is um ... the thing is is that when a computer can play chess him on the computer can play go and when the computer can play poker and\nAnd do all of these things the way human does it ... you tend to think that it's thinking like a human is but but there really is a quote anybody home there's nothing there that does any thinking at all it's\nIt's one lives in the rose manipulated in memory turned on and off\nOr at the speed of light um it's done with which relative it it's interesting the techniques we use for it official intelligence we'd been writing about for forty years since just we've never had the machines to do it but it isn't some thing\nThere's a thought experiment called the Chinese room problem\nAnd it's about it it goes like this there's this there's this rumor that's full of these books and there's a person in this person is called the library and then it's important to note the librarian does it speak any Chinese\nPeople outside the route slide questions written in Chinese under the door to this Chinese to this librarian\nThe librarian picks them up looks at the first character on the question goes and finds a book with that on the spine looks up the second character that sentence him to another book to another book to another book to another book\nUntil it gets to the end of the message the last book says write this down any copies these symbols he doesn't even understand and besides the back under the door the person who submitted the question looks at it and it's brilliant it's perfect Chinese since perfect\nAnd so the question is does the librarian understand Chinese those are those the library and understand Chinese\nDid too to a lot of people in Silicon valley the idea that it can converse in Chinese but doesn't understand it doesn't make any sense but to a lot of people know delivery and doesn't know if they're talking about Colorado or coffee beans\nAnd the analogy is an apt one because it's all the computer does it runs a set of determining stick processes in memory\nIt spits out an answer and it doesn't know it's playing chess it doesn't know any what is talking about it doesn't know anything\nAnd so you kinda have to ask is the computer thinking or not it does the computer understand anything or not ah my my way of looking it doesn't it doesn't understand anything but other people other people say if it can do everything that that's something that does understand can do\nThen you just have to say it does\nIt is just mind boggling and it's getting even dead or is it not the technology every year\nAbsolutely computers do this thing where it in a very simple short and they double in power every couple of years but on top of that we're collecting data faster than ever before right now there's Fifteen billion devices connected to the Internet many of which can I collect data\nThere'll be eighty billion by twenty twenty five and all of those who they had all this data coming in and these faster computers and so it's it will only get faster and then if you think about it if you think about it the Internet the mosaic browser came out twenty five years ago a literally in in Ninety three\nAnd all that did was like computers talk to each other and that was hit and that somehow changed our world and that created twenty five trillion dollars and well\nA million new businesses it up into I mean it did everything that that imagine a technology that effectively makes everybody smarter than they were before\nYou go to bed tonight everybody on the planet wakes up with ten more IQ points that is going to be more transformative than the mere Internet which just\nNow everybody on the planet wakes up with ten more IQ points that is going to be more transformative than the mere Internet which just connected a bunch of machines together this this is machines think\nReason they show emotion Byron\nThat is an open question a it is even an open question whether you want them to\nI don't I'm not sure I Want them to\nSo the first question is do you want them to simulate emotion\nA there's a couple of different sides to that you know I have a desktop device that I talked to and I interrupted and I tell it to stop in a way I wouldn't do a person\nUm you had you had student you had kids in Japan and there was a a robot they let loose in the mall and these little kids would bother would beat it and the robot learned benefits all bunch of short people kids without a tall person around an adult it needed a run off to a tall person because\nThe kids would abuse it now when I asked later the kid said they thought it was feeling distress so they even though like it was internalized that get you wonder about about a kindergarten teacher you know that the robotic that\nUh the raising children on fake empathy you you you just start with that do you even want them to have human voices is that the noble the machines somehow or does you know we've had the car away to these things called human rights\nA to a point where we say there are certain things you cannot do to any human being and because there's something special about the human being and and do we kind of want to make things look like humans that we do abuse and throw into a scrap heap and\nAnd and destroy without a second thought would that in some way how they numbing effect on people now the question Ken they feel emotion a that is an open question we\nWe have we have something called consciousness which is that we experience the world we feel warmth a computer measures temperature that difference whatever that is that you feel the warmth of something\nA computer right now we don't think uh can we can measure temperature and even if you make a program that plays a person screaming at the temperature gets over five hundred degrees nobody believes that computer feels that pain nobody believes that sent shaping or sentient\nNow the interesting thing is we wouldn't know it if I'm if they did really well you wouldn't know if a treat the pain and you share half your DNA with the with the tree you should know DNA with a computer and so we wouldn't really even know if they ever if they ever developed a emotions\nAnd even if they claim that they did that could just be in a way of program running that you know the the\nThe program reasons that it can can achieve whatever objective it launched by making this claim I'm so it it's an open question it it all boils down to do you think of motions in the end are mechanical I mean our our ... again it's a punch you back to the original question are we machines and therefore\nOur experience of emotion is just something mechanical\nWhat happens in these machines Byron go rogue and they start doing things to wants to screw up our lives on purpose\nWell I'm\nA little like hell from two thousand one space on\nI mean look\nIf it ever happened uh we're completely vulnerable of course you know if there were eighty billion devices attached to the Internet\nWhat happened uh we're completely vulnerable of course\nYou know if there were eighty billion devices attached to the Internet you know smart other news just turn them all on and override their safety protocols I mean\nThere are so many ways a malevolent machine would want to um would be able to inflict harm the the interesting and and to you kind of have to say what would that happen and it can happen in one or two scenarios either through Canada's programming machine just\nDoes uh it doesn't have any intent at all\nUm or getting the machine somehow develop goals or the tone that are different than ours and perhaps in conflict with hours and ... and pursue those goals against those they're um they're open questions I

I was thinking about that movie late do say veto where the guy with\nThe star was working on the beach and they had the boy helping them with his papers and you know if it's really a reason to be at an office most the time and truck to an office one when he could just get on the computer and do the work or on a beach [noise] [noise]\nWell that's that's great stuff I'd like to I'd like to talk to all three of those things\nI'm to the first one you know you mentioned corporations and he's been ...\nIt's very interesting to me the large companies don't usually make these leaps and the of the original do companies uh I used to say only ones left and then it was just listed GE\nAnd so none of the companies were on the dollar originally the big powerhouses or they're you know sometimes a new technology comes along and they just don't adopt at blockbuster you know a streaming video came along and they were like yeah we'll we'll just wait and see\nAnd you mentioned them and I'm a Polaroid the same story which was digital photography\nAnd they didn't didn't they didn't catch on doors right blockbuster has another one\nExactly with regard to drones I agree with you we're we're going to have to work that out and you know where we're in such early days that uh but yeah there's going to obviously have to be some kind of like customs is going to have to be laws is going to have to be all kinds of stuff we don't have because ah that's very real\nWorking remote you know I I kind of hope so I I don't know that I Would say a blanket thing for\nFor every single person on the planet like because you can just ... careers that you you can't like the uh electrician or a ballet dancer or you know anything that requires a psychiatrist or anything to require a a kindergarten teacher requires you to be present in any in any way\nBut for people who are the information industry then yeah it was just there was a series of commercials on I don't know if you remember it in the nineties that\nSomeday you will you know send to facts from the beach someday you will and all of the things in those commercials coming from\nThe army did you stay with us by when you come back and take some final calls in a final chance next on coast to coast than\nSafe secure in private download my city has a lot store today and get when you're free\nMcGrath and hope you can try to come aboard stuff so I had a large top hot dish needles killer who stopped taking kind of horrible\nIt was just incredible feeling that I Will be full of just ... when I have the auditor and to know how much later something amazing how which will taste while I was out actually contract about staggering about what they did what you can check that out on top\nOf that if you kind of war actually made a major result started coming for ... it kinda barbaric ... excuse the pun ... like\nThat works for a\nA Richard astro here we're talking about the power of\nWaking up your immune system who says he'll this gentleman's hard perhaps the immune system can be called one of the bodies fears is powers to he'll visit\nC.

Reese with us author of the fourth age Byron\nIsaac Asimov three laws robotics let me quickly go through them and tell me how they would really transform into artificial intelligence won a robot may not injurious human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm to\nA robot must obey orders given to us by human beings except for such orders would conflict with the first law three a robot much ...\nYou've been to it by human beings except we're such orders would conflict with the first law three a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law so what he's saying is is robots can't injure human beings at any cost\nThat is kind of like in conflict with they all ... you know soldiers not a robotic\n[noise] yeah yeah that's true that's true\nYou know the the the laws are are are literary device so he can tell a story they don't actually get us very far\nUm you know if I'm going to do something dangerous potentially aren't myself 'cause the robot according to those laws intervene and stop means ... if I if I order a second dessert\nAnd I got a few extra pounds on me that's the robot say no you can't have the desert because that's gonna hurt you got to save you I've got to protect\nExactly I'm monitoring your blood glucose levels are too high or whenever exactly\nExactly so like from a practical standpoint the real challenge with robots has no two people kind of agree on what moral behavior isn't isn't\nAnd even if you just say well we're just going to pick you know Joe\nAnd make use Joe's moral code for all the robots even Joe's moral code is like full of providers and while you don't do that unless it's this but if they're all they're all of these if if and and that so we don't really have a way to make sure robots have ethically\nAnd like you said there's a lot of incentives for them not to\nLose a robot out there called ... which I'm going to try to do an interview with some fear because it talks and you know it's styled after a woman but uh I'm going to call it in it because it's a robot but you can ask\nA question it'll give you a response isn't that bizarre\nI'm unfamiliar unfamiliar with it uh you know I think if you ask it a question just asking what's bigger a nickel or the sun\nAnd it probably doesn't no\nUh no I mean it it it it'll have an incredibly narrow range of things that he can talk about uh if you ask it anything like\nUm you know a\nWide as Mr T. pity the fool or a ... anything just ask anything uh aside from how do you feel or anything like that decides to get anything\nAbout life anything weird ... it will be a blue hungry and I'm\nEven something like\nThe kind of thing that you might ask or any other person you meet like um give it the simplest problem you can\nDo these systems there there's something called the Turing test which basically says if you can't tell if you're talking to a person or a a machine like through text that you have to say the machines thinking at least that's what the desk says if you read the transcripts of\nActual things that are trying to pass that you would do with one question so they had to put all these rules like you can't ask about current events and you can't ask it up\nAnd you can ask ... get theirs and even then we've ever had anything this past that I'm Sylvia looks good because it looks like a person and if you take something that looks like a person and you give it a person's voice and it says words\nYou're kind of in the back of your head going to say oh it that's really thinking right right it's if you if you say no that's just you know that that is not if they made it look like I'm a vase if all of a sudden the illusion would be appropriate would launcher or not\nThat that is not if they made it look like I'm a vase if all of a sudden the illusion would be broken wood\nLauncher and I always thought maybe they had somebody hidden away in a corner talking through her and it was really them talking\nLike no no um it's a giant ball with voice in a in a animatronic robot move\nThat software get better and better and better to the point where you can ask you to mundane question ended laying in being able to answer to\nGrow very close to you know and so there are people who are working on that there's a thing called um there there's a thousand Center for artificial intelligence in Seattle found about Paul Allen\nWhere they're trying to get the shooters to be able to pass I think six grade science test a like that's the big thing it turns on computers have a hard time with common sense problems\nWe don't know how it is that we ... people [laughter] right right well let's do\nThis thing we don't know how to get machines to do what's called trends for learning you can take something you learn in one place and apply elsewhere\nAnd we don't know how people do that you can train you can show a kid a little kid for pictures of the cat that ... that child knows what a cat looks like\nAnd if they see one of those Manx cats without a tail they'll say look a cat without a tail even though they never even knew there was such a thing right you still like thousands of cats to train a computer and the computer would never say oh that's a cat without a tail just got ...\nLarry in Houston, Texas again is going to hear Hi Larry go ahead\nHey thanks for all you all do 'em as is I've been attacked for computer repair I guess that was a field engineer in Nineteen eighty two for a large corporation\nFrom a meaning to Superman is the main frames all the way up to now I'm a network engineer my question is all this hyperbole about how am I which is just the modification of what's been going on for the last fifty\nYears with computers they they you know the the technology keeps\nExpanding expanding because of the way people program them so hey I just really extensive ads nothing new but how does it that that they think mankind is gonna be a lemonade is okay because you have to have people to service these machines you have to have people that can provide electricity\nTo run the power lines to run the power plants to do all this stuff how do they think that a I is going to eliminate mankind is going to be a planet full of machines or you know I keep hearing this hyperbole\nOver and over and nobody can tell me how they're going to do all the as you you can't even get a ... machine to walk right now let alone climb a power pole and provide electricity or going in trouble shoot a machine that's broken\nYou see in their world the machine will replicate itself by rebuilding itself I don't see that happening Byron\nI I agree I agree with Larry as well uh you know its reasoning for fictional evidence it makes a good movie you know the the the movie uh hey everything in the future is really good you know that doesn't get ... dollars\nA something's got to go wrong and something's got to you know a hundred people and Will Smith has the bottles something and and so you see that or not but you're right the the range of things robots\nCan do and I can do is is actually quite narrow but uh but as you keep saying right now how how would that change over the change in the future\nTom in Bozeman, Montana and the wild card line Thomas go ahead\n[noise] yes uh I'd like to ask your guest good question or already a while not a question like that make is eight and I took this class\nThe machine for since last year and we went through all the laws of birds quarter or a bad it is dangling that ball and you know what is the first like ... or ... but we ...\nEvery once in the computer\nAnd what I what we came up with in the end what is it can hurt you guys want to leave my wife\nIs the goal but things like the human does\nWell and unfortunately the computer can do that at this point", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "09"}
