showed her like I\nHad no idea what it could have been what I saw that movie and I was just\nSo you saw something moving away from the moon was heading towards Mars I mean there's a red dot in the sky and that there's that that you see the red dot and this guy right when you look to the southern sky\nRight yes directly across from it I was ... and I didn't mind about two o'clock from the moon when you say Yes sir yeah okay\nSo the ... it's about two o'clock for the moon you see the you you see it there and then you said you saw something pull away from the moon\nIt looks like something just looked like a star or something just took off from the loan I I never said I don't know how to explain because I'd never seen nothing like it\nI just I felt like they showed like or partner what I've seen it just it just it moved away from the moon is directly yes or was it just know they look like a star I thought it was another part of this guy or something that just put it a little did I Know there's a a a meteor shower an area that night but it was that it wasn't a quick made it like\nThere isn't it supposed to be a meteor shower tonight I heard there was supposed to be one but last night

supposed\nTo be on here and says that it's a night but it wasn't like that it was just a slow steady stream it just it looked like I don't know how to describe it like a rocket just took off from the

I mean it is kind of strange that everything that's going on and everything they're trying to hide from us and uh and I'll I just thought I'd bring that\nUp and mentioned that since you're all that's all I appreciate\nThat yeah it's a very strange night and any theory or demean you know everything is all about uh right now hypothesis and speculation everything's hypothetical until we prove the number of things but what we do know is is that\nTwo of those ah telescopes were shut down ... rock and I did not go to the I.

countries\nThere are no human rights you know we talk about you know this country waiting banners of human rights and you don't want him to you know a take a stand against a various countries because there's human rights abuses by\nThe countries in which there are no human rights at all like you know watching federation like China ah and certainly you know the Gulf states are led by Saudi Arabia where beheadings and had shopping\nOh yard it's great to be with you\nHave things changed since the last time we talked about student loans during that they've gotten worse I bet\nOh hell yeah they they have indeed uh gotten worse ah we're probably at it and I think I was on about a year ago as we've added around maybe a hundred and twenty five billion onto the tab\nWhich is now the city and officially it about a one point five trillion um but quite frankly it's certainly a significantly higher than that even still there's a lot of loans that that don't get counted\nSo let me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you know you've got an option here and that is I'm going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm gonna walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school and I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nWell no it's it's a fair question a and you know in the case of automobiles we have Lehman lives right if the school provides a you know at the end of the car doesn't work then you know we can take it back well obviously that option doesn't exist for student loans [noise]\nUp but what is really missing from student loans that people I think probably many if not most of your listeners aren't aware of\nOr is that nearly every fundamental consumer protection that exist for every other type of loan has been stripped from student loan for example student loans\nHave no bankruptcy rights are there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans a fair debt collection practices truth in lending laws these things have all been restricted or remove\nSpecifically for student loans and most uh most blatantly for federal student loans George so the thing was that the federal government makes are the ones that are most apps and of the consumer protections that I just mentioned\nWhat if they did something like this that they had a guarantee that a student in the his or her chosen major\nUh would be guaranteed a job at a certain salary when they graduate and if they don't get that job for whatever reason the economy jobs aren't available they get that discounted author student loan so you know the ...\nYeah that's a that's a that's an interesting thought and in fact in some a first world countries in the nation or something like that in fact happens Australia for example um you don't have to repay your student loans unless you are making a minimal ah annual salary I think it's forty thousand dollars or so [noise]\nUm [noise] that could work a ... and you know there's a lot of pretty interesting ideas on how to pay for college out there\nBut I can tell you that what we have now today is the most predatory lending system that this country has ever seen a you know the founding fathers way back in the day or people like Thomas Jefferson George Washington they were being pilloried by British banks and merchants\nOr so after the revolution when when they wrote the constitution actually around the time of the revolution [noise] um they demanded uniform bankruptcy laws and they did this ahead of the power to declare war\nHas the power to raise an army and many other very important powers [noise] ah so the founders you know are they require bankruptcy laws for uh\nIt's been taken away from student loan absolutely we are going to take calls next hour with Alan and those of you who have student loans definitely check in with us and want to see how things have been manageable for you when you do that when you call it the student loan scam give me that definition oh\nSure oh well you know when it becomes financially viable in fact when it becomes financially preferable to the lenders for the bar or to fail to uh be able to repay the loan in other words to default on the loan\nThey wanted to fold don't that's\nRight if it becomes more financially lucrative for them when a loan defaults rather than remains in good stead\nWell that's a defining hallmark of a predatory lending system and we're seeing that throughout the lending system for the collection companies and the services and the guarantor ours are often are the very same companies by the way they would much rather see a default than a loan the remains in good stead\nSo this is you know in stark contrast to even say credit cards where\nYour credit card companies are thrilled if they get back even you know ten cents on the dollar on a default\nA but it turns out that ah the lending system can make far more than a dollar for every dollar paid out on a default in fact I'm all for a loan for federal student loan default and gets rehabilitated\nThis alone can easily double or triple and the agents that I'm compelled to borrow or to what's called rehabilitate these defaulted loans they\nGot a sixteen ... percent commission right off the wall so you know where they can make the three hundred bucks over the course of ten years for service you know healthy loan\nThey can make ten twenty thousand dollars in a matter of four or five six years on a defaulted loans that they can build a bar or to put through rehabilitation and so the financial incentives that under ... a federal student loans system are just\nCompletely perverted and it's been turn I mean really federal student loans have essentially been weaponized against the borrower\nExplain the process of salted loan in how the lenders make more money how does that happen and let's let's use a student loan four year college fifty thousand dollars as an example which is not unheard of and by any means so\nA student goes out borrows fifty thousand dollars or his parents are her parents borrow fifty thousand dollars and then they default what happens\nSure that's a that's a good case a good ... easy numbers to start with so I'm fifty thousand or student loan when the student graduates let's say they they give it their best shot and after maybe two two and a half or three years\nOr they're unable to make payments they lose a job or or whatever happens so with two hundred and Seventy days of non payment [noise]\nUm the student can expect to learn to be thrown into default so the fifty thousand dollar case that we're discussing here would probably defaulted somewhere around ... let's say Seventy five or eighty thousand dollars what with penalties and fees and capitalize interests that are slapped onto that loan\nVery quickly that would escalate to say a hundred and Fifteen twenty twenty\nFive ... hitting the ball or is responsible for that\nYes yeah the borrower will begin getting demand letters for payment and fall for roughly let's say a hundred and twenty five or so thousand dollars oh my God\nSo what the ... what the lenders system will do will say oh you're into fall on your loan big trouble you know the federal government has all these Orwellian collection a power as we can follow your for the rest of your life [noise] we can garnish your Social Security check you know you can't run you can't hide we can get you fired for\nBoy meant we can have your professional license suspended we can even have your driver's license suspended in some states\nWill be taxed too you stuff like that\nThat's right yeah um you know your income tax returns will be garnished et cetera so huge amounts of power that none other uh no other lending system has are brought to bear on the bar or\nSo ultimately they will wind up um hopefully the government hopes I'm going through a loan rehabilitation so this is where they make payments for about for ten months typically none of those payments go towards alone this just goes directly into the pockets of\nThese third party agents that ... this rehabilitation\nAt the end of the process they wind up signing for a much a new are much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars\nWell these agents I get a sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or\nThese agents that that compel them to do this loan rehabilitation get a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus it does it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nShe's in the ... these agents or collection companies\n[noise] well yeah these agents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's the ... systems agency [noise] uh and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well on these these companies own servicers they own collection companies\nAnd they also own Gehring tours so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before a President Obama\nSo these companies make out like bandits they would rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than\nAh than alone the remains and just good said and I should probably say here George to all the people listening out there do not rehabilitate your loans it's all horrible idea a according\nTo Moody's these defaulted loans that rehabilitate they default again three to four times and they just\nKeep growing oh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loans if that's the fault again\nAnd that happens something like eighty percent of the time\nThen the whole process starts again\nTo stay with us Allen let's talk about if there's any recourse here and again we'll take calls next hour with Alan calling U.S Coast to coast signing up new ... ... email newsletter unit today it goes to ...\nThe cool articles videos Dr wallich and pharmacists men recordings kind of critical Health News dot com where you can also order our premium quality products or you can call eight five five nine for nine seven\nTwo three four to talk to a real live competent critical Health News dot com human eight five five\nNine for nine seven two three four\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nThomas Jefferson one said there are two ways to conquer and in slavery nation one is by the sword the other is by debt and you sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is there\nWell what happens more often than you would think George is\nThey will receive a summons from a an agent of the federal government and maybe they get it maybe they don't if they don't get the ...\nAnd then they become subject to arrest so in the state of Texas for example in around Houston one of the federal district there people are literally being hauled out of their homes by swat teams and and and forced to uh to come into court that way\nTo deal with their student loans I kid you not\nDo you mean if they're not properly served by a process server the sheriff or a private process serving ... company if they're not served ... you're saying they can go and get them anyway and take them in the ... in in the court\nWell that indeed is what is happening in the state of Texas certainly [noise] uh in just this one federal district or they had plans on arrest gene between Thirteen and I think Fifteen thousand people [noise]\nUh the one case that we know about ah the gentleman at an original I think it was a three thousand dollar loan and they hauled this guy in literally with a SWAT Team and uh they wouldn't let him out until he agreed to pay something like seven or eight thousand dollars\nWhich included you know penalties interest in court costs in fees or the federal marshal and the court et cetera um\nThat's debtors prison back again\nWell that's right you know the uh the founding fathers or even people like Thomas Jefferson flirted with a debtors prison James Wilson actually spent\nFounding fathers or even people like Thomas Jefferson\nFlirted with a debtors prison James Wilson actually spent time in debtors prison [noise] uh that was what the founders were trying to avoid when they wrote the constitution and demanded bankruptcy writes ahead of the power to declare war has the power is an army but it looks like we're sort of headed back in that direction at this\nGod that's crazy now does anybody have any recourse so let's say that they're having trouble paying their student loans\nThey all fifty thousand now they want to pay the ... the let's assume that's what they want to do but you're saying because of the ... the fifty becomes a hundred and Fifteen thousand and if they default on that grows even more can't they just cut a deal on the ...\n[noise] well um they can and here's the deal I'm [laughter] it's really no deal at all um the federal government typically will settle on a defaulted loan if the borrower pays one hundred and twenty percent the value of the loan at the time that a default ...\nWhat kind of settlement is that\nFor most people it's a completely unworkable settlement you know people were having trouble paying on their loans in the first place uh to think that they can write a check for a hundred and twenty percent of the value of the loan wanted to follow that is free unrealistic for most people [noise]\nUh so that you know the government has got you where do they want you on the student loans they're essentially is no recourse and that's why I started to student loan justice dot org so many years ago you know I had worked in government lending in other areas and and I had never seen anything like that\nOr you know this this student loans system really just made my jaw drop and um I think the founders are looking down and shaking their head at this point you know this is exactly the sort of situation they wanted to avoid this was the sort of tyranny that that was thrown down on us by the queen [noise]\nUh so I can only hope that the people out there listening who this is happening to will realize that you know this is our our constitution that's a ... a truly at stake here\nAre you seeing and also people are losing their licenses driver's licenses because of defaulted loans\nYeah there is about sixteen states with laws on the books now that give them the authority to rescind revoked suspend a professional licenses driver's licenses and across the board people who um who work under federal programs\nCan literally be fired ah from this public employment and for the case of default the student loans this cannon is happening as we speak\nThere's this cross a park party politics I mean what did President Obama do about it what is President Trump tried to do about it are they doing anything about it\n[noise] it absolutely crosses all party line so I mean this goes way beyond Democrats or Republicans\nAh unfortunately the past say three presidents really have only made the problem worse or under Obama or Obama essentially federalized the lending programs so that where before\nA bank such as was mentioned at the top of the show a great legs Sallie Mae now let us after a where they were making the interest on the loans now the federal government makes the interest on the loans and by the way the federal government profits something like Seventy five million dollars a year\nWhich is more than any corporation on earth on the lending program\nNow Donald Trump solve this and actually decried the fact that the government was making such an obscene profit on student loans you know before he even ran for president shortly before he said why is the government property not student loans if this is nonsense you know all the places that the government shouldn't be making a profit\nAnd shortly before he said why is the government for offering on student loans this is nonsense you know all the places that the government shouldn't be making a profit you would think student loans would be it a and indeed this sort of echoes the the words of President Lyndon Johnson back in Nineteen sixty five\nYou know when the higher Education Act was first signed into law and these loans or the lending system was created President Johnson said you know these loans will be free of interests\nWell how far we have fallen from those uh those days I'm so unfortunately you know those ... don't Trump's rhetoric was really good\nBut since he's been in office he's done this as bad or worse than any of than Obama certainly than than Bush before him\nA et cetera so who would Donald Trump is hired someone named Betsy devices who herself had stock in to go on collection companies [noise] ah and you know frankly I don't think President Trump is really even thought about the student loan problem for more than about twenty seconds [noise]\nUh so I have I hold out some hope for him a but at this point I have to say he's been he's been as bad as the previous presidents\nHired in Nineteen Ninety eight you could a file bankruptcy wipe out your students that what happened\n[noise] [noise] well that's right uh so what happened was um [noise] some of the people who were very well connected in Washington and they saw the money make making potential here they lobbied Congress\nAnd they brought it out these very rare examples of people who you know went from graduation to bankruptcy court and they said look at what the students are doing and we can't have this we have to take bankruptcy away\nAnd so um so yeah Congress ah ... ah took away bankruptcy rates in in Nineteen Ninety eight they became essentially permanently unavailable what we now know though Georgia's that back when they said this was happening\nFar less than one percent in fact about three tenths of one percent of students were actually discharging their loans in bankruptcy this is less far less than the average for other loans\nSo there was never a good premise for removing bankruptcy rights are and the fact that we've had to suffer under this big government predatory lending program for so long\nIs really one of the most one of the most vicious ironies of this whole thing of ... this is a problem that Congress should've fixed many years ago and that they haven't yet is just a true crime against the citizens\nWere with Alan ... student loan justice dot org linked up and goes to goes the dotcom his book is called the student loan scam you're on some kind of a nationwide tour these days tell me what you're doing\nOh that's right um you know thankfully we have a bipartisan bill in Congress has called HR twenty three sixty six [noise] uh and this bill would simply um delete the one line of federal code\nThat may student loans treated differently from all other loans in bankruptcy proceedings so this really gets to the core of the problem and ah by by getting this bill passed or we would immediately see a dramatic decrease in the price of college\nAh we'd see a dramatic increase in the quality of college and I should say the quality of the job that the government does administering the program [noise] ah so this bill is very important and we're hoping to very much that Congress might pass this before the end of the year when the session expires\nA lot of people would prefer not to have to file bankruptcy they just don't like the stigma or is there anything else that we can try to do or get past legislatively\nPrefer not to have to file bankruptcy they just don't like the stigma or is there anything else that we can try to do or get past legislatively to fix some of these student loan

I'm a conservative everyone knows\nThat I'm the guy that almost won I lost a four to three split decision in the shadow case I'm pro life pro gun I'm a sport right conservative it as Rush Limbaugh and most of it's not even the liberals want a free hand out okay but the college tuition is technically and legally attacked because it's money go into an arm of the state government college and were being over tax\nThat though the liberal as a matter of fact the price\nOf college is about ten times when you adjusted for inflation what it was back in the fifties and here's the thing okay we spend a lot of money on our military and it it's too much really we spend a lot in you know even as a conservative we spend a lot of money on Social Security\nBut we can only ... those things a little bit the on the third or fourth thing is probably the tax dollars are being used to make er Yankee call his lungs and we don't need to spend any money of that not only does it put the tax dollar on the hook\nAnd it's going to crash the dollar like Greece or Venezuela Georgian\nAnd I'm Alan by the way I'm Alan was good enough to make me the leader of the Florida group and\nI Hope I'm he'd gotten on an equal talking a little too much in this and I\nI Know all the reason is here's the deal OK almost ten percent of the total that his college debt and it's going to crash the dollar that the only thing if we get rid of that you would let him get a credit card Idaho okay with the loans but let them get a credit card it'll save the tax dollar and it'll save the student is college will drop like a rock\nAnd the I I look I Love my rates man 'cause I'm a conservative and they provide jobs in hospitals and police\nCan hear it can get and I and I would vote for Trump if I had a chance to get a look and he can get bankruptcy repeatedly for millions in bailout can handouts\nAnd if all these rich banks and these colleges can get the rent on the students looking here that that that that those are the two beneficiary and here and\nThen okay and they use these are All right we got your point there Gordy Allen\n[noise] you know I I he said a lot there but I appreciate all his points and he's exactly right\nYou know if we can throw seven trillion dollars into Afghanistan and Iraq [noise] I think we can throw maybe a trillion\nHer show at the student loan problem but but more importantly from conservative point of view [noise] you know if the government was to drop out of the lending system tomorrow I think on balance that would probably be\nA good thing it would return prices back yonder rational levels uh and you know it would it would um really clean out a lot of the sort of socialistic uh nonsense to spin allowed allowed to creep into the system but ... but ... but um\nA lot of the sort of socialistic uh nonsense that's been allowed allowed to creep into the system but ... but ... but in particular it would it would lead to lower prices\nLow you with all the debt right now Alan would you are just a white pit clean\nWell I Will say that if at a minimum bankruptcy protection is or not restored so that people can go to a judge and according to the wisdom of a judge I'm settled that debt according to their means if that does not happen\nThen we're looking at something like a full on jubilee soon you know the Democratic and I'm a nonpartisan guy but I Will say that a democratic socialist particularly in New York are starting to win elections on the promise of canceling all student debt\nAnd [noise] you know I don't think that is maybe the best solution because there are you know forty percent of the people are out there are able to successfully repay their loans but that is exactly what we're looking at very soon if at a minimum a the bankruptcy writes that the founders demanded aren't returned\nDo when you do have salaries and teacher salaries and things that you have to keep the university going which should be reasonable right\n[noise] yeah that's right um you know my best estimate is that the colleges are so flush with cash right now there are so badly overcharging their students by and large\nThey could probably suffer eight thirty percent if not forty percent reduction in the student loan income that they're currently receiving and still be able to keep their doors open not have to lay off one person a and you know be able to service all the students that they do today\nSo I think there's a lot of capacity there for price reduction in academia\nUm [noise] so yeah I mean ending the student loan program tomorrow would I agree probably be pretty devastating to a lot of schools [noise]\nUm but certainly there's got to be a middle ground [laughter] you know and with bankruptcy back with the department of education having to contend with the same bankruptcy laws that every other Linder has to contend with [noise]\nAh that would go a long ways towards compelling them to crack the whip on the schools to lower their prices improve their quality and decrease the amount of time that the students are having to stay in school now to get a degree\nFirst time caller mark in Provo, Utah hey mark go ahead\nWell George you said they can't uh they don't force you to take student loans but when I started school I was on a full scholarship they've been paid for my books but the federal government makes you go to student loan counseling and so I went\nAnd I told the lady I'm I don't know why I have to even be here among full scholarship and she told me Will Hunting if I were you I Would borrow as much as you can put it in the bank and earn interest on it\nOh boy I Would love to sue her this\nDid you end up doing that oh yeah and then life happens the money disappears yeah you know over fifty thousand dollars just in interest on my student loans and loan balance is a hundred and three thousand dollars a gallon Heather pay it off I Will die owing money do they harass you mark\n[noise] no I'm right now they've got me on some ridiculous thing where uh my payment is zero [noise] um I did a double major in a minor and uh some point I did need student loans but uh the irresponsibility um I just I I Would have never tasted that crack had she not pedaled it\nTo me exactly exactly well what do you think Yellen these these loans are\nOn the students way ahead of any scholarship or any other um any other aid that where you don't have to pay back I mean the college and some of the colleges are making money on these loans by the way they're they're making these loans and then reselling them a private banks and stuff\nSome of the colleges are making money on these loans by the way they're they're making these loans and then reselling them\nA private banks and so the colleges are in on the action as well and it's it's it's just disgusting [laughter] you know I might actually add um the repayment program that that a mark is on a it was probably the income based repayment program\nSo bunch of government programs out there that sound like they are forgiveness program so there's public service loan forgiveness ... there's income based repayment\nBut what all everybody out there needs to know\nIs that all of these programs are failing the vast majority of people who try out for them so we now know that the success rate for the public service loan forgiveness program where\nYou work for a you know if you work in a college or a hospital at a nonprofit get your lungs forgiven only about point three percent of the people trying for that forgiveness are actually getting it\nSo the rest are being disqualified and they're being left owing far far more so mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments well interest continues to accrue on that loan so so that loan is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about a ten percent chance\nThat mark will make it through to the end of that I'd be our program\nAnd actually get the loan for given a and I might add that any amount forgiving under the I'd be our program is taxable income so you were twenty five years\nYou get a nice little things in a sense of the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals or probably even exceeds the amount that you were originally borrowed [noise]\nSo the federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that has you know she can to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a\nThat was gonna say they are obviously know how to make money doping\nThat's right you know it was [laughter] ironically was bankers that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and uh many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nUh they have no public a benefit the inspiration they jettison all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many years ago\nEllen we're gonna come back and take final goals with you in just a moment

hurting or helping the economy\n[noise] [noise] oh I I think it's clear that it's hurting the economy at this point uh you know interest alone on one point five trillion dollars more than Ninety billion dollars a year or so that money that\nIt was a you know business formation a auto ... you know other ... big ticket items that improve the economy [noise]\nUh so certainly is hurting in that respect a and you know it's it's also hurting in a number of ways that are really harder to quantify you know when you've got forty four million people\nA straddle or you know strapped under ... this these sort of debt levels deeply the sort of oppressive type of debt [noise] um this really can make people do bad things um you know make people do things for money that they wouldn't otherwise do\nI'm also forces a lot of people into the underground economy a and certainly those people pay no taxes and and et cetera so [noise] so it's really hurtful in many ways that are maybe not a parent or to the naked eye\nLet's go to Paul Fresno, California to get things started here west of the Rockies ball go ahead sir\nHey I'm very grateful you take my call thank you very much Georgia now them [noise] um the graduated from college two thousand Fifteen just before it closed down [noise]\nI'm I'm One of those fortunate case who are that one point three to aloe with talking about that actually got um most cars that were given I uh got thirty four thousand thirty seven thousand that I got you know that I owed forgiven\nWow how'd you do that and regulations and\nI appreciate that thank you\nWell I I did a little bit of an hour away or there's something called a that you'll finding and what that is is that like a lifting of\nPretty much like a course of your book or a trade the trades you chose yeah and what it is is um if it of course who are the reason they're in the situation is because they falsified job wait for it so if you are from a certain time period to a time period at the end of the school I'm\nPretty much that's when they committed a that broad so\nIt actually took me from I Would have to say December two thousand Fifteen to around August of two thousand at sixteen to get it all but given\nWhat I did is I actually wrote Kamala Harris email um she surprisingly bonded um but the the avenue that I went to get all that we give out of the right a cover letter or I submitted a\nPretty much what the cover letter I had to put a bloody ought to then I had to pretty much just\nPut it all out there what I'd gone through no that that's the transcript\nHad to uh a cover letter transcripts and pretty much all the information that I actually had the group that I went to college\nYeah it was the fraud that that got it reduced I guess right\nAh yes so that's one of the main things I put there because if you see many of the hill college commercials whipping they promises life long job placement of cooking [noise]\nSo what how I false advertising yeah the exactly so when the schools shut down there goes your call ... ... there goes your life like long job placement at the right you got that right or interesting Alan isn't it\nThat you know and that's a good point and I maybe I should have brought up as some other potential there is some breaking news now where if you went to particularly for many of the for profit colleges they get caught lying just like the just like Paul mentions\nSo they'll misrepresent their job placement rates and you know say oh you know average earnings for your degrees this much and these could be lies and so there actually is a rule that was put in place by the Obama administration where\nIf your school ... ... you then at least on paper you have available to you an avenue called defense to repayment where you at least theoretically you can get your loans cancelled and I I think I'm Paul is probably one of the very lucky few that has seen does work successfully for him [noise]\nAh but I Will say that even just yesterday um\nFederal court struck down an attempt by the department of education to\nSort of delay and slow walk this ... this program so as it stands now today there's a bit more hope for people who were lied to by their colleges are then there was a a couple of days ago um now I Can't say for sure what the results of this will be\nBecause believe me the department of education has no desire or intentions of forgiving anybody's loans if it doesn't absolutely have to ah you know under gunpoint practically by the legal community but [noise]\nUm but there is a bit more hope today than there was before so if you you were lied to by particularly for profit college or you may may may possibly have some avenue for records you know so\nYou know with all these credit card fraud that's out there and just credit slot indeed I mean if you get a letter from a collection agency for some debt you don't even remember could be yours maybe it's ten Twenty years old if you ask them for a copy of the ... and they don't provided to you they're up a creek aren't they\n[noise] well that's right and you know similarly per student loans we find a lot of a private loans the underlying note uh well first of all the loan has been bought and sold so many times that whoever says they owned a note\nActually does not owned the note and they have no business collecting on that long\nI'm ... now there are other there are some avenues of the the lenders can go to they can\nSay that the note was lost and they have other avenues to prove that is a valid note but that certainly is something to be aware of\nAnd I should also say people who have private student loans are not federal student loans they do have statute of limitations so somebody comes up to you Twenty years hands and starts demanding money from you for a private loan than almost certainly that loan is not\nLittle suspect ...\nSuspect um and you want to look into the statute of limitation laws that govern that particular alone depending on where you live or where you took up alone\nAnd it's going to pat Minneapolis east of the Rockies Hi Pat go ahead\nI worked in a Social Security office for a while and I figured out that at at least one of the agenda is is the destruction of the Social Security program because there are families with co signers\nOf grandparents and parents and the student none of them are ever going to get any Social Security and all the question and I think Justin alright if if I own a house and co signed on one of these student loans\nIs that does that lean on my house so that when I die instead of my air is getting at it's collected for a for a student loans\nThat goes to the lone first doesn't it\nWell that's a yeah that's a great question um to her first point\nYes Social Security wages are being garnished as we speak for student loans and what is even more disturbing I see legislation out there right now it hasn't passed yet\nBut I see legislation out there right now which offers a loan forgiveness in uh in return for people for going\nTheir Social Security when they when they reach retirement age ah so there are some people at work in Washington DC very busy trying to figure out how to take away Social Security benefits down the road from student loan borrowers\nInteresting is that what did you have one other thing that you want to say\nFamily's already where longtime generation the grandparents and parents and the kids they're never going to get any thoughts scary but my question is that if you have if you want to help the students and tear

um well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has had ... says in these sorts of situations only as little as possible and we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't\nFrankly we don't even know where the eight tip is still an ongoing project I I think people like who Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission\nIt still continues he of course all though he's resigning from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going now other people I think have disputed that and certainly we have been told that the\nFunding plug it has been polled well I was on his head so it doesn't matter you can continue approach jak\nWith you know using can count on resources which is absolutely true but you know it is it is a mystery what do I do suspect that happened is if it is\nStill an extent program it was probably changed titles again this is typical government um alphabet soup territory\nWe're not even a hundred percent sure about the name of of a tip Lou has said it said phones aerospace threat identification program a Pentagon press officer said one time it's advanced aviation\nA threat identification program and then we learnt that\nA tip them in part from another program called advanced aerospace weapon system application program so it's it's an absolute nightmare to try and\nFind out what the things even cold let alone whether it's still running and and you know that you're dealing with some pretty secretive stuff when they wouldn't even come clean about the name of the the program\nThe course of course is still interested you know she's still funding a lot of projects\n[noise] again we don't know and the problem is that um we we know that the Robert Bigelow guard I'm ... I was going to say through through um his his friendship with Senator Harry Reid but that's not\nThat's not entirely correct and I don't want to do in the service here he beat for the ... contract quite\nQuite openly and legitimately and through the the standard contractual\nProcedure and he'd go on a large chunk of that I tip work but of course justice the the government requires that people selling their the secrecy oh it's\nSo Robert Bigelow and and um his organization had everyone on a non disclosure agreement so actually the people involved in this work what kind of um stone twice\nSo to speak they had they had to have government security Herron says but also the commercial non disclosure\nAgreement so so again there is a lot of this story that we don't know and that's the other thing in in aliens at the Pentagon and I've seen a lot of\nYou know you pick up the the media um you reports of this you go on to the blog some forums you see\nPaint again I've seen a lot of you know you pick up the the media um you reports of this you go on to the blog some forums you see a lot of speculation\nI was always taught at the ministry of defense you know when I was doing analyst way for example in briefing you must always differentiate between ... you know and what you're saying and\nThat looks a skill that everyone practices when they they make films documentaries but I Try to be rigorous on by accident and winnowing speculating I say I'm speculating and when I'm not I'm not so\nHopefully even though there are large parts of the story we still don't know I'm only ... where we don't know that these things\nAnd what's the bottom line what you're really going on which as\nWell [noise] I I didn't want to I I don't want to get too far into spoiler [laughter] I think one one thing that I can say which I think it's a pretty good summary of of what I think has gone down [noise]\nIs it I Would say their flaws\nAnd I use that would deliberately I Believe a faction if I can call it died within the U.S government and some of those people were permanent employees\nAnd some were ... and this believe a fraction who put the phenomenon was absolutely rail and and they were to write and that of course\nDidn't entirely know what to think of it didn't rule out the possibility that they were dealing with something extraterrestrial paranormal\nAnd actually then I Believe a faction became or or certainly interacted with an overlapped with with a tip [noise]\nAnd they effectively I I guess gotten the chance to use those those beliefs and those hypotheses within government\nWe've taxpayers' money and and that of course gives us in an interesting opportunity to find out about the asked because and I hope we'll we'll have time to get into this late but but there is now of course talk of congressional hearings to to get to the bottom of this but\nBut the bottom line to answer your question is is that I think there was a believer ... they made them move they came up against some road blocks couple of different road blocks one road blocks was simply going to a point where you know they they looked at this and\nAnd they investigated but because they didn't get a definitive on so the feeling was that they taking it as far as as they couldn't what else can you do the other sort of road block but they had this is very controversial because they have\nA cold is a religious road block from from some senior people in the Pentagon who find play for the UFOs and the paranormal with demonic and therefore didn't didn't think what we should be having anything to do with that\nWell what do we do\nDo we won't live [laughter] oh\nWell I mean um it it was study whatever the laws but I I as I say that there were people in the ... who who is deeply conservative religious beliefs\nLead them to think that that they are dealing\nDeeply conservative religious beliefs\nLead them to think that that they are dealing with what they don't make a demonic phenomenon here I might come up I've come up again there's a couple of times in in the u._k. as well at the ministry of defense in fact one of\nOne of my bosses was I'm a you know they're pretty extreme with the S.\nAnd in the the the individual who wrote the detoxify intelligence assessment on on UFOs in the ministry of defense carried name project ... he\nWould not want to go to go too far down that road he had some plenty old beliefs as well and there's a passage in the Bible\nIn the ... so I think it is where it refers to say as being the print some power of the air and so I think he's where a lot of these conservative religious people get the idea of UFOs might beat the Mona\nCan and there were a lot of religious folks Nick that believe that\n[noise] yeah and I think it it's frustrating in a sense because and and it's almost comic Klee ironic in another way that\nYou know you have a bunch of people in the Rio de da da and and in the u._k. and the ministry of defense you got a bunch of people who thought yeah this we're dealing with a real phenomenon\nAnd we should be investigating it researching it in a ... a scientific manner and we come up against skepticism you might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect\n'em ... skepticism is ... bookstore to Nicole or intellectual\nA human that skepticism but I think most people I associate with that concept it's actually it's a deep probably trying to leave your trip and skepticism itself I mean it to to have effectively was so cold UFO skeptics in the Pentagon\nUm say that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things demonic quality just in one sense it's swapping one arguably fringe belief\nFor another so we'll these ... these people wouldn't skeptics told they would believe it but they would you believe us in some some great Warren having with angels and demons\nNick we're going to take a break we'll come back in ... more right here on the coast

a human species\nWell this is a problem we grappled with a lot at the ministry of defense and and then fight the um law to oils in in the world now in a ten year program to the last find release them\nGo heavily into the question all the way that there is or isn't a threat and how could you tell and who should make that assessment and in fact um it it gets quite fracture\nUm between different divisions in the ministry of defense and and some of the the that does make quite amusing reading as as the intelligence people are telling some of the other people you know who do you think you are to suddenly put yourself into the role of of of an intelligence analyst\nAnd and you know you know what your job and um what what the intelligence people\nThey they made a a kind of analogy um they said I'm\nA ... if if you don't mind I've actually gone to document in front of me home please give us some quotes from there yeah this is this actually haven't officially been released yet I'm there will be tonight it will sound like I'm the same can them critical question is\nDo you pay is represent a possible threat to the defense of the well we could argue that assuming for the sake of the argument that something exists they have never shown any hostile attend intent and therefore kennel\nAssuming for the sake of the argument that something exist\nThey have never shown any hostile attend intent and therefore kennel represent a threat however Russian aircraft attempting to penetrate the u._k. I defense region in the Cold War never showed hostile intent but they certainly represent a threat though is\nThe only logical conclusion that we can come to is that we do not know if you ate pays represent a threat to the defense of the realm\nAnd so this this is quite interesting because\nUh parts of the the ministry of defense was saying to parliament the media and the public knows there's no evidence of any threat here we we look at these things to see if there is a very different interests but no no no threat\nAnd yet in two of them were classified documents saying well look we just don't know we have not yet made a proper\nAssessment and so we we can't tell\nWe simply can't sell well what about the alien abduction phenomenon I mean wouldn't that be some kind of threat\n... it would be if we could absolutely say that it's it's physically rail and not not some sort of combination of hoaxes and psychological delusions and and and other\nMisunderstood phenomena beat the other thing is of course we don't really know what's going on some of the people who claimed to have had these abduction experiences say that it's really really traumatic and and suddenly researchers like about Hopkins type Jacobs where we are always saying\nYou know the whole style and it's it's a threat on the other hand people like John Mack and and some of the other people who take him on new age and spiritual view of this talk about healing and things like that\nAnd he goes back to the idea of who who can really say I mean this sounds bizarre but in millet treat 'em there is actually in a way Asian for I'm working out with all of a threat to our knowledge or rather this this is a kind of them we don't know the values\nBut intelligence some military circles\nAnd we say that threat is defined as being a a construct of capability plus intend so so you look at the capability you look at the intent and then you would count whether there's a threat and if there is\n... ... ... what kind of a threat it is well we have\nSome idea about the capability of you I pay and and again the the file the ministry defense files state quite clearly you know pizza maneuvers\nWay in excess of anything though when we've gone so the capability we we know has a higher value what we don't have any idea about the intent if the if there is an intelligence behind this phenomenon frankly we don't know what it is we don't know what it once\nWe it may be unknowable in the u._k. the astronomer royal\nTo march in Greece speculating about extraterrestrial intelligence and and uh gender and motivation said it may be trying to approach to try and figure this out he said it might be ... the analogy would be trying to explain quantum mechanics when you find the\nWell we don't know what it is we don't know what they want what can you categorically saying that it's happening\nI Can't say that abduction is happening no I I don't know that what I mean she was a well\nWhat I can say is that there there seems to be strong and credible evidence that\nAnd I mean there's the patients visitation uh well\nWhat I can say is that there seems to be strong and credible evidence that you pay a rail that they do routinely penetrate are already defined region I'm In the u._k. the U.

never met\nMore to greet meeting that would have been just to be able to see you two guys together\nYeah that that would have been interesting I think um I I tell you who I did me recently ah Lu I was

that's that's interesting\nLet's go to Diana in Manhattan up there in New York City Hi Diane\nHuh I Love your show in a long time then we're thank you\nUm my great great grandfather my maternal great great grandfather was the mayor of a small city in Spain and ... send me whether this would have been in the mid nineteenth century\nThe people there were totally use to UFOs flying all over the place about them and called them all means no one was afraid of the things I took them for granted it was just part of their lives so unless you're taught to be afraid of these things you're not really in favor of them\nDid they ever talked ... about ... visitations and abductions or anything like that than anybody ever see occupants up close states\nOccupants but nobody was abducted did they ever describe what they looked like\nA you know because my grandmother the granddaughter of this man told me this and uh you know she wasn't there at everybody in the town when she would go to visit her grandparents everybody would say oh you have to see the news you know you'll love\nIt [laughter] what do you think may not a big deal you know\nWell it's it's a great a point which is of course he goes back to this this thing that I think a lot of people in this field do no I'm the idea that this ...\nNineteen forty seven is of course crazy I mean people have seen strange things in the sky since the dawn of time but I think the other interesting thing about this this call and these these familial recollection is is the fact that\nYou know these these phenomena are always interpreted through the lens of of personal belief system and culture\nAnd it is interesting when you come up against couches where where this this thing is is almost to call in place but it's it's like oh yeah you know that that's the thing we don't necessarily know what it is but yeah it's it's real\n... real let's go to Andy Norwalk, California now why Andy Glyn\nHi George you agree hatred and Mr call it's a real honor I listen to many times and you're very um [noise] informed and entertaining to listen to um I have two part question if I may uh first of all are based on all of your knowledge of\nThe western powers all of the NATO countries in for that matter let's say the eastern bloc countries ... how many [noise] as long as you've been following this how many uh aircraft and uh pilots have disappeared and this guy while pursuing so called UFOs\nAnd are based on your response I I have a second part a final question if I may okay\nNicky with us yeah sorry I thought you were going to hit me with pot too straight away while we're waiting for that one of the one\nI'm now I'm going to found a little bit skeptical on on this I Would say the on through his last run then a lot of things that I've I've read in in the UFO and tentative belief communities\nI mean I've seen some people talk about pilots going missing and and you eh fires and I think you know unfortunately flying is an inherently dangerous um occupational certainly laws in in the early days in a lot of\nLot of action off just disappeared because they crashed now now of course then you have do you have some kind of the cases like a ... ... the mentality case he didn't disappear of course but he crashed\nChasing a UFO which skeptics say with the planet Venus we coming off of cost to the fortieth anniversary of arguably the most famous disappearance of all time involving a UFO Frederick ...\nOh yes and that was strange I think we'll actually tell you to weigh in Australia right\nYes I absolutely over the or is it by trade I think all the time has been straight maybe the best straight is part of the past month say excuse me I'm geographically challenged in that particular part of the world but\nUm but yeah I I don't buy into the room as that that I've heard the pilots were\nWeb crashing and disappearing or all the time as a result of of that we had a case in the u._k. tragic case involving a pilot who who just ... off into the sea\nIn Nineteen Seventy it was\nDuring a night exercise\nAnd some people years later I tried to attribute to us for a story on to that but I pulled out the board of inquiry oil which was about two inches thick I went through every single paper in the file and I couldn't couldn't actually substantiate any of these\nUFO rumors so I think I think the ... question is is very few women do you okay go ahead\nSo I ... so I think I think the answer the question is is very few\nNurse came into your okay go ahead and say\nOh okay so the second part question based upon your your response to twist a as you probably know during the Eisenhower administration there were so many aircraft\nThat we're a suddenly a malfunctioning falling out of the skies and uh yes in some cases just suddenly disappeared that the Eisenhower administration gave the order\nTo stop the pursuit the aggressive pursuit by American aircraft obese UFOs and secondly I spoke to Dr Heinrich before he passed away a Chicago radio station for about a five to seven minutes [noise]\nAnd I asked them what are the chances of a life or not existing on other planets and not coming and visiting us um and he said impossible that that was his response impossible [laughter] so I I appreciate your perspective\nI Do personally believe\nThat they dominate the skies any time and every time that they come a within our airspace there's so many thousands tens of thousands and God only knows maybe millions of years ahead of us\nThey could be entered to mention all they could be surgical are both but I don't think we're much of a match\nAnd they do have air superiority and [noise] I Do appreciate the honor and pleasure talking to both of you\nIn the appreciation or will set by the way and\nAnd and he made a really interesting point which goes back to something in the British Intelligence assessment Paul check on the line and that was a I I don't like to call it amusing but ah I it was kind of\nPoignantly amusing maybe the ... there was a marine about the flight safety and safety implications of U. A. P.\nC. which goes directly of of course to the point just made and there was a recommendation in ... report and it said I don't have it in front of me but but if I typically\nA pilot's encountering you a pay should take no action apart from trying to place the object is done in other words you know whatever we dealing with here don't mess with that\nDon't mess with it at all we're going to take a break pretty soon that can come back with spinal phone calls but I also want to talk with you you've done a thriller out called blood brothers don't you\nYeah I Do a kind of a different thing for you\nYes I I'm a big deal though I'm best known for having run the UFO program I did a lot of other things in my Twenty one years at the MIT and my final posting within the direct her to defend security we did a lot of counter terrorism and things\nI've written fiction before I've written to siphon novels about alien invasion so I decided to write a thriller about terrorism and counterterrorism and the intelligence agencies it's our turn Kendall now and uh it's it's going straight to a paper by on I think November Fifteen\nGood lord brothers that's the name we're going to come back and take final goals for Nick pull in just a moment on coast to coast the\nYou kind of war that's where he made a good result started coming for ... it kinda barbaric ... excuse the pun ... works beautifully\nA Richard astro here we're talking about the power of waking up your immune system says he'll this gentleman's hot\nThe immune system can be called one of the bodies fears is powers to he'll visit C.

latest book is an action thriller called the blood brothers and how do you get the book Nick\nWell its own candle at the moment I'm a I'm comes out in paperback in November but it's on Amazon so so basically I just don't give it to Amazon and look up blood brothers make pope or it's on my Nick ... website on the books\nSchober in your opinion uh assuming we're being visited do you think most of the looks like these so called mainly in Gray's people describe or do they look like gosh what do you think\nWell it's a tricky question because I think the media I kind of like to have this this kind of\nTroy you or me or whatever you call it of of the alien gray and then it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy because I think um you know when people say oh I've seen one of these aliens ... gray lodge had\nThey go home and shaped by it gets reported but when when somebody says they see something that doesn't quite fit the mold maybe it doesn't quite make the cod or get the coverage but in my experience when people report entities just as when they report UFOs they come in all shapes and sizes\nAll this sure do what you but you saw almost saying then that people basically the year this year this and then they think they see it\nYes I think ... plays a big part in this but here again who who can say what um what technology if we are being visited by a civilization in let's face it the universe is nearly fourteen billion years old\nImagine what a civilization which you say a million years head start on us money to be able to do in terms of you know hiding themselves masking their true appearance\nA deception I it's unimaginable so so again I think we're in this territory where ... we I should vote we think we see and perceive may be very different from the reality of what's going on and they may ultimately be unknowable\nTo us true species of our town level of development what's your thought of the propulsion system that\nWell it's it's clearly are\nGoing to be some something exotic I guess we're in in sort of Star Trek Tara tree and in one sense of some sort of foster among the light\nTravel again there are some theoretical physicists working on this sort of thing trying to figure out whether it would be whooping\nSpace time whether it would be using wormholes I suspect gravity is going to be the key to this um gravity I guess of all the fundamental ... as the one that we\nKnow at least to bow often and therefore it's the one where we're perhaps more likely to make quantum leap breakthroughs in terms of of science and technology\nThat's going to go the phones again let's go to Alex in Rochester New Hampshire and to get things started Hi Alex welcome to the show I think you sound a credit card\nThis is again let's go to Alex in Rochester New

side who for the whole experience\nVery scary very creepy had a very predatory feel that you believe that it's possible that some of the and talented extraterrestrial visitors 'em might possibly be eager evil or negative possibly demonic not all of them but maybe I'm\nWell I again I think it takes us into this territory of water are we dealing with even if we didn't leave some\nSomething real do we really know what it is could can we really a scribe human emotion to it the problem with all of this if we can only come at this from an answer ... point of view and we tend to to be\nKind of you know very black and white I think you know our thinking sometimes we see it in politics we said in religion\nYou know it's glass half empty glass half full dude I aliens fan aliens and and you know one has to one that does this actually come from whatever it is that you're interacting with or does it come from your own cultural background belief system\nMhm perception may be influenced by by documentaries that was science fiction or whatever it may be I I don't I don't like to take anything off the table I mean I I I tried to be open minded with all of this\nAnd I think earlier in the show I said that there is unlikely to be one single neat solution to the U. S. mystery\nSo I think you know when you ask me what might be out there I don't think if there are other civilizations in the cosmos which I firmly believe that there are I don't think it's going to be a question you know there's just one other civilization um therefore you know are they good or bad\nI suspect if we share this cause most we share it with with a whole bunch of different civilizations which which may have absolutely different points on the mall spectrum if I can call it that\nUm I guess the late person's way of saying that would be you know there's probably good aliens outlet but knowing I'm how true is take extraterrestrials and and even more restless yeah with with the various intentions\nWas no question about it and you know I'm so convinced that in this vast universal bars and maybe even the multi burst that'd be probably more more ... is the same\nWherever you go you're going to have the same elements the same complexity you may have water you may not but generally you probably will if you're close enough to your star your son you're going to have things heat up a little bit\nI think there are millions civilizations throughout the universe the big question is how did it start and you know let's take religion out of it you have to do that for for just a moment what what do you think was the cause to jumpstart for life\nYou know but you have to do that for for just a moment what what do you think was the cause to jumpstart for life\nI have no idea I I mean I think it's if if you throw ... nobody knows\nNo no if if you throw the dice trillions and trillions of times they eventually maybe it'll it'll come out right but but much smarter people than me with relevant experience in biochemistry and and all related field have\nHave no idea frankly they ... they have some hypotheses but we haven't yet manage to to create biological life I think I'll be controversial I think we'll create machine intelligence before we actually

Melania Trump's plane was forced to\nReturn to the joint base Andrews due to a mechanical issue\nA few minutes after take off those the board the plane observed that didn't have a smoke coming from the cabin and smelled something burning Secret Service agents rushed to the front of the plane and the press were handed wet towels old over their faces in case the smell was too strong\nThe plane landed safely at Andrews shortly after nine am eastern time\nShe was on her way to the Thomas Jefferson university hospital in Philadelphia to meet with families affected by a syndrome\nAfter the brief stop back at the base of the first lady departed once again for Philadelphia oh well it took seven minutes with the Saudi journalist ... to show the two apparently die a Turkish source who has listened to the full audio recording of the Saudi journalist last moments\nCause Yogi was dragged from the council general's office at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and onto a table of his study next door horrendous screams heard by witnesses downstairs\nThe screaming then stop one could show the who was last seen entering the Saudi consulate on the October second was apparently injected with the yet unknown substance Dr John Curtis online columnist dot com with us it's clear somebody killed this guy John\nWell it's pretty gruesome I mean ... macabre I mean that the Saudis look you know they're they're very serious over their drug or repressive you notice about if these Middle Eastern countries\nThere are no human rights you know we talk about you know this country waiting banners or human rights and\nYou know wanting to you know I take a stand against a various countries because they're human rights abuses by the countries in which there are no human rights at all like you know watching federation like China ah and certainly you know the Gulf states led by Saudi Arabia where beheadings and had shopping\nYard it's great to be with you\nHave things changed since the last time we talked about student loans during that they've gotten worse I bet\n[noise] oh hell yeah they they have indeed uh gotten worse ah we're probably at it and I think I was about a year ago as we've added around maybe a hundred and twenty five billion onto the tab\nWhich is now a sitting officially it about a one point five trillion um but quite frankly it's certainly a significantly higher than that even still but a lot of loans that that don't get counted\nLet me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you know you've got an option here and that is I'm going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm gonna walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school and I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nWell no it's it's a fair question a and you know in the case of automobiles we have Lehman lives right if\nThe school provides a you know at the the car doesn't work then you know we can take it back well obviously that option doesn't exist for student loans [noise]\nAh but what is really missing from student loans that people I think probably many if not most of your listeners aren't aware of\nOr is that in nearly every fundamental consumer protection that exist for every other type of loan has been stripped from student loan for example student loans have no bankruptcy writes a there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans\nA fair debt collection practices truth and Wendy inlaws these things have all been restricted or remove\nSpecifically for student loans and most uh most blatantly for federal student loans George so the feeling was that the federal government makes are the ones that are most apps and of the consumer protections that I just mentioned\nWhat if they did something like this that they had a guarantee that a student in a his or her chosen major\nUh would be guaranteed a job at a certain salary when they graduate and if they don't get that job for whatever reason the economy jobs aren't available and they get that discounted author student loan [noise] so you know that ...\nYeah that's a that's a that's an interesting thought\nMental and they get that discounted author student loan so you know ...\nYeah that's a that's a that's an interesting thought and in fact in some a first world countries in the nation or something like that in fact happens Australia for example um you don't have to repay your student loans unless you're making a minimal ah annual salary I think it's forty thousand dollars or so [noise]\nUm [noise] that could work a ... and you know there's a lot of pretty interesting ideas on how to pay for college out there [noise]\nUh but I can tell you that what we have now today is the most predatory lending system that this country has ever seen\nA you know the founding fathers way back in the day uh people like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington they were being pilloried by British banks and merchants\nOr so after the revolution when when they wrote the constitution actually around the time of the revolution [noise] um they demanded uniform bankruptcy laws and they did this ahead of the power to declare war\nHas the power to raise an army and many other very important powers [noise] ah so the ... you know are they required bankruptcy laws for a very good reason and this is exactly what's been taken away from student loan\nThat's all they were going to take calls next dollar with Alan and those of you who have student loans definitely check in with us and want to see how things have been manageable for you when you do that when you call it the student loan scam give me that definition our\nShare of well you know when it becomes financially viable in fact when it becomes financially preferable to the lenders for the bar or to fail to uh be able to repay the loan in other words to default\nOn the loan default don't that's\nRight if it becomes more financially lucrative for them when a loan defaults rather than remains in good stead\nWell that's the defining hallmark of predatory lending system and we're seeing that throughout the lending system for the collection companies in the service there isn't a guarantee tours are often are the very same companies by the way they would much rather see a default than alone the remains in good stead\nSo this is you know in stark contrast to even say credit cards where your credit card companies are thrilled if they get back even you know ten cents on the dollar on a default\nA but it turns out that ah the lending system can make far more than a dollar for every dollar paid out on a default in fact I'm all for a loan\nFor federal student loan default and gets rehabilitated\nThis alone can easily double or triple and the agents that I'm compelled to borrow or to what's called rehabilitate these defaulted loans they got a sixteen ... percent commission right off the wall so\nYou know where they can make say three hundred bucks over the course of ten years for service you know healthy loan\nThey can make ten twenty thousand dollars in a matter of four or five six years on a defaulted loans that they can build a bar or to put through rehabilitation and so the financial incentives that under this for a federal student loan system are just\nCompletely perverted and it's been turn I mean really federal loans have essentially been weaponized against the borrower\nExplain the process of salted loan in how the lenders make more money how does that happen and let's let's use a student loan four year college fifty thousand dollars as an example which is not unheard of and by any means so\nA student goes out borrows fifty thousand dollars or his parents are her parents moral fifty thousand dollars and then they default\nWhat happens sure does or doesn't\nThe numbers to start with so fifty thousand or student loan when the student graduates let's say they they give it their best shot and after maybe two two and a half or three years or they're unable to make payments they lose a job or or whatever happens so with two hundred and Seventy days of non payment [noise]\nUm the student can expect to learn to be thrown into default so the fifty thousand dollar case that we're discussing here would probably defaulted somewhere around oh let's say Seventy five or eighty thousand dollars well with penalties and fees and capitalize interests that are slapped onto that loan\nVery quickly that would escalate to say a hundred and Fifteen twenty twenty\nFive years in the dollar is responsible for that\nYes yeah the borrower will begin getting demand letters for payment and fall for roughly let's say a hundred and twenty five or so thousand dollars oh my God\nSo what the ... what the lenders system will do will say oh you're in default on your loan big trouble you know the federal government has all these Orwellian collection a power\nAs we can follow your for the rest of your life [noise] we can garnish your Social Security check you know you can't run you can't hide we can get you fired from your job if you work in public employment we can have your professional license suspended we can even have your driver's license suspended in some state\nGentle be taxed to you something like that\nThat's right yeah um you know your income tax returns will be garnished et cetera so huge amounts of power that none other no other lending system has are brought to bear on the bar or\nSo ultimately they will wind pipes um hopefully in the government hopes I'm going through a loan rehabilitation so this is where they make payments\nFor about for ten months typically none of those payments go towards the loans just goes directly into the pockets of\nThese third party agents that oh this rehabilitation\nAt the end of the process they wind up signing for much newer much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars\nWhile these agents and get his sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or these agents that that compel them to do this alone rehabilitation\nGet a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus he says it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nHe's in the ... these agents or collection companies\n[noise] well yeah these agents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's the ... systems agency [noise] uh and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well on these these companies own servicers they own collection companies\nAnd they also own gear into horse so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before a President Obama\nSo these companies make out like bandits they would far rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than\nAh than alone that remains exit good said I should probably say here George to all the people listening out there do not rehabilitate your loans it's all horrible idea a according to Moody's\nThese defaulted loans that rehabilitate they default again three to four times and they just keep growing oh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loans if that the phones again and that happens something like eighty percent of the time\nAgain stay with us Allen let's talk about if there's any recourse here and again we'll take calls next hour with Alan calling U.S Coast because they are doing a new recoup zone or read email newsletter\nDogs love it try super make official al by to get one free at dynamite dot com I N o v I Can't [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nThomas Jefferson one said there are two ways the cocker and in slavery nation one is by the sword the other is by debt and you sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court the there is no way to win is or\nWhat happens more often than you would think George is\nThey will receive a summons from a an agent of the federal government and maybe they get it maybe they don't if they don't get the ...\nAnd they become subject to arrest so in the state of Texas for example uh inter around Houston one of the federal districts there people are literally being hauled out of their homes by swat teams and and and forced to uh\nPeople are literally being hauled out of their homes by swat teams and and and forced to uh to come into court that way to deal with their student loans I kid you not\nDo you mean if they're not properly served by a process server the sheriff or private process serving ... company if they're not served ... you're saying they can go and get them anyway and take them in the ... in in the court\nRuled that indeed is what is happening in the state of Texas certainly are and just this one federal district or they had plans on arrest gene between Thirteen and I think Fifteen thousand people [noise]\nUh the one case that we know about ah the gentleman had an original I think it was a three thousand dollar loan and they hauled this guy in literally with a SWAT Team and uh they wouldn't let him out until he agreed to pay something like seven or eight thousand dollars\nWhich included you know penalties interest in court costs and these were the federal marshal and the court et cetera um that's debtors prison back again\nWell that's right you know the uh the founding fathers or even people like Thomas Jefferson\nFlirted with a debtors prison James Wilson actually spent time in debtors prison [noise] uh that was what the founders were trying to avoid when they wrote the constitution and demanded bankruptcy writes ahead of the power to declare war has about ... an army but it looks like we're sort of headed back in that direction at this\nGod that's crazy now does anybody have any recourse so let's say that they're having trouble paying their student loans\nThey all fifty thousand now they want to pay the fifty let's assume that's what they want to do but you're saying because of these these ... fifty becomes a hundred and Fifteen thousand and if they default on that it grows even more can't they just cut a deal on the fifty\n[noise] well um they can and here's the deal I'm [laughter] it's really no deal at all um the federal government typically will settle on a defaulted loan if the ball or pays one hundred and twenty percent the value of the loan at the time that it defaulted\nWhat kind of settlement is that\nFor most people it's a completely unworkable settlement you know people were having trouble paying on their loans in the first place uh to think that they can write a check for a hundred and twenty percent of the value of the loan default is free unrealistic for most people [noise]\nUh so that you know the government has got you where they want you on the student loans they're essentially is no recourse and that's why I started student loan justice dot org so many years ago you know I had worked in government lending in other areas and and I had never seen anything like that\nOr you know this this student loans system really just made my jaw drop and um I think the founders are looking down and shaking their head at this point you know this is exactly the sort of situation they wanted to avoid this was a sort of tyranny that that was thrown down on us by the queen [noise]\nUh so I can only hope that the people out there listening who this is happening to will realize that you know this is our our constitution that's a ... a truly at stake here\nAre you saying that also people are losing their licenses driver's licenses because of defaulted loans\nYeah there was about sixteen states with laws on the books now that give them the authority to\nRescind revoke suspend a professional licenses driver's licenses and across the board people who um who work under federal programs can literally be fired a from this public employment on in the for the case of default to student loans this cannon\nFederal programs can literally be fired a from this public employment on in the for the case of default to student loans this cannon is happening as we speak\nHis his cross a park party politics I mean what did President Obama do about it what is President Trump tried to do about it are they doing anything about it\n[noise] it absolutely crosses all party line so I mean this goes way beyond Democrats or Republicans\nAh unfortunately the past say three presidents really have only made the problem worse or under Obama or Obama essentially federalized the lending programs so that where before\nA bank such as well as I mentioned at the top of the show a great legs Sallie Mae cetera where they were making the interest on the loans now the federal government makes the interest on the loans and by the way the federal government profits something like Seventy five billion dollars a year\nWhich is more than any corporation on earth on the lending program\nNow Donald Trump solve this and actually decried the fact that the government was making such an obscene profit on student loans you know before he even ran for president shortly before\nHe said why is the government for offering on student loans this is nonsense you know of all places that the government shouldn't be making a profit you would think student loans would be it a and indeed this sort of echoes the the words of President Lyndon Johnson back in Nineteen sixty five\nYou know when the higher Education Act was first signed into law and these loans or the lending system was created President Johnson said you know these loans will be free of interests\nWell how far we have fallen from those uh those days I'm so unfortunately you know those for the on Trump's rhetoric was really good\nBut since he's been in office he's done this as bad or worse than any of than Obama certainly than than Bush before him\nA et cetera so who would Donald Trump is hired someone named Betsy devices who herself had stock in student loan collection companies [noise] ah and you know I I frankly I don't think President Trump is really even thought about the student loan problem for more than about twenty seconds [noise]\nAh so I have I hold out some hope for him a but at this point I have to say he's been he's been as bad as the previous presidents\nPrior to Nineteen Ninety eight you could file bankruptcy wipe out your student that what happened\n[noise] well that's right uh so what happened was um [noise] some of the people who were very well connected in Washington and they saw the money make making potential here they lobbied Congress\nAnd they brought it out these very rare examples of people who you know went from graduation to bankruptcy court and they said look at what the students are doing we can't have this we have to take bankruptcy away\nAnd so um so yeah Congress ... ah took away bankruptcy rates in in Nineteen Ninety eight they became essentially permanently unavailable [noise] what we now know though Georgia's that back when they said this was happening\nFar less than one percent in fact about three tenths of one percent of students were actually discharging their loans in bankruptcy this is less far less than the average for other loans\nSo there was never a good premise for removing bankruptcy rights are and the fact that we've had to suffer under this big government predatory lending program for so long\nIs really one of the most ... one of the most vicious ironies of this whole thing because this was a problem that Congress should've fixed many years ago and that they haven't yet is just a true\nAnd I'm calling just west side of student loan justice dot org linked up the coast to coast am dot com his book is called the student loan scam you're on some kind of a nationwide tour these days tell me what you're doing\n[noise] oh that's right um you know thankfully we have a bipartisan bill in Congress has called HR twenty three sixty six [noise] uh and this bill would simply um delete the one line of federal code\nThat make student loans treated differently from all other loans in bankruptcy proceedings so this really gets to the core of the problem and ah by by getting this bill passed a we would immediately see a dramatic decrease in the price of college\nAh we'd see a dramatic increase in the quality of college and I should say the quality of the job that the government does administering the program [noise] ah so this bill is very important and we're hoping very much that Congress might pass this before the end of the year when the session expires\nTelling a lot of people would prefer not to have to file bankruptcy they just don't like the stigma or is there anything else that we can try to do or get past legislatively to fix some of these student loan issues", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George
