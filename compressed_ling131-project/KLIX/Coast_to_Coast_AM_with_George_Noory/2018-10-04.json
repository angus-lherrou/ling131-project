I think there's always been profits that have told us stuff over the millennia yeah and I think one of the big things that we've overlooked\nAs one of the big people that we've overlooked over the years as a profit was gene Roddenberry\nAnd one of his biggest things was the prime directive right it was an affair with a plan so what are they going to do they're not\nAnd see they they are going to come\nThey'll send a robot that God by going to return they'll send the ... and see what's going on\nSo center they'll send their emissary first and what's an angel in Missouri what you know it it's like back in the day they called the ... but they were emissary is and what do we do we don't send humans out do the work of exploration of asteroids I mean we've got right now we got jumping probes from Japan\nOn an asteroid we've got a rover on Mars okay got you know we're going to send robots out into space to do exploration who knows maybe I mean our technology is pretty damn primitive\nBut who knows maybe these alien grazed worm robots that they are robots or they are synthetic biology\nLooked like synthetic life forms their their their life forms they breathe they they they think they do things but they're not you know they're not biological they're not like a great\nGreat great or just ... they're just clones and you know I'm ... hit on this one night and then she was talking to you about the graves yeah or they have no soul yeah that's because they're born in space\nWell not only that but they're just you know and and what is it all in the house said many times you said\nAnd I think she did this when we were interviewing her a I had to go back and review that interview we did an interview with her when we were in ... and she interviewed over Skype with us she wasn't there\nBut she wanted to go on the show when we were there and she was bringing up a these these thinking robots and these alien technological marvels and she was saying something that affects you say that the biggest concern the aliens have\nWe're the biggest interest the alien raise have he's an interest in our consciousness that they don't have\nTo say why didn't they said in our soul yeah basically are so that they have any advance in our souls rains are born in case they have no soul right are they interested\nAt us because we have a little light in Seoul\nRight and they're wondering how is it you know they're wondering who is this some synthetic technology was created by an intelligence far greater than us you know can you imagine Bailey and saying that about us saying wow you know you know we're we're tell you that we're after that it works out\nThere they're a creation of the garden to write God's word but you know you were talking earlier about cargo calls and stuff right as far as I'm concerned the cargo calls on this planet go back six eight thousand years because our\nReligions today are based on what was left after the God rest his world right\nBut see we have to get us now thinking about this we go back to the ancient religious hammock religions and they had technologies most of the arc of the cabinet that was the technology right\nThrow back even before the amber hammock religions Yazidis some Marian you had that the Vatican\nMine is I mean remember do ... in China's\nRemember what ... said about the atomic bomb he says this was the first atomic bomb that was made in modern times he says\nThat phrase I always found that amazing that either aging houses that eight thousand years ago or writing a valid tax six eight thousand years ago and they didn't write poems birds they wrote flowers\nInvestigating him when I get from it is that they see us as an advanced\nModel of synthetic intelligence\nWhere they see us as an advance modeled them have something that they don't and that's consciousness and I think this is a because that was I was reading a long time ago you know what do the aliens they become your what do they want for us ... they don't\nThey don't want 'em ... they don't want\nTo some of the building blocks for live because it can be found all over the universe\nThe only thing they could think of would be a two things water and coral filled because corn fell I think is unique to planet earth and water when they can get water anywhere usually in space we have probably the purest form where the foreign may need for either fuel for sustenance for some reason they need water\nFor the other one would be either they look to us for the Jeff ... meaning the aliens come here to eat us or they're here to examine as and they're here to look a silver because we have things that they don't have\nAnd they're wondering how we've been made and they also feel the same way about some animals that's why they you know the alleged Cato mutilation ideas they they they see us in the experiment on us and in some cases they have mutilated people or they have taken them and harm them\nIn the meeting with animals I you know it's not just how big it mutilated horses and beer sheep other animals get mutilated the same way cows do so we have experiments going on with these creatures because they don't understand how were made and why we were\nWe know what a brain is being with a computer brain is they know how a synthetic Bobby's operate but whoever's program them have this as a keen interest as to why we exist and they don't know why we access\nThey were were you derive that from because that's what we do to lower forms of life right we use or a lower life forms or we experiments\nOr maybe they don't see us is lower life forms they see and says some higher unattainable life form and they want to take it apart and see how it works\nWell I mean look all that as possible but I\nI think we we have to assign to the concept of God what level of intelligence is God is God's spiritual synthetic or biological and\nI'm just saying that it's may not always be the case that biological create synthetic\nWhether these ... guys biological clock meaning that if he's biological or if she's biological then what we have is a limited God or we have a group of them died and they were just the remnants of there's a a a they're a creation that\nThey created us they died and now we're here to take the stewardship and many people who are afraid to say well we can't play God that's the point we should because\nThat's why they created that they created us to grow in nature and they are they create is to grow in it intellectually and that way they would basically leave us to do what other civilizations have done in the past\nAnd that is grow and then of course they get to a certain ah do you know they get they get to a certain level where they can't go any further either die off or they then branch out into space\nSo how do you handle the argument which came first the chicken or the egg\nI've heard it's the chicken but then again I don't know\nI Would say it's they both happens at the same time and because it's a creation and go back to the the age old question of who created a God\nAnd so therefore you could say it would be whether you say God is biological or God is spiritual intelligence or synthetic intelligence you always run into that argument\nBut what was the right biology by biology in our sense would be limited would it not\n\nYes way there would be less limits on synthetic\nTechnology there would be less limits on synthetic technology am I correct\nYes and then but then I Would say after that there would be even less limits on spiritual intelligence if you want to recognize spiritual intelligence\nBut that is something that they're doing with pen side gets him thinking about that for a moment they want to know everything and I guess I could use the parlance\n... they're wanting to everything has got in it but I mean by that it does everything have a consciousness of everything spirituality to enter does everything have ah some sense of being\nThat see and so that's exactly where I'm going because in order to determine that does everything have God in it you first have to determine what God this is Scott biological sense headache or spiritual wow so I'll leave it at that\nWealth and then of course I think that's going to be the big question future used to be you know where did we come from why are we hearing where we're going now it's what God do we have been watching it over us as a biological God is the synthetic God or is it a spiritual God and it'd be spiritual than all the power to this guy\nHas ruined everything in the planet\nEverything in the universe and it's immense it's in the men's intelligence that covers the entire brain and the various dimensions become permanent brain\nYes ... and I think he's a ... explains that God has a spiritual intelligence because\nIt's become from that brain yeah ... and I think he's a ... explains that God has a spiritual intelligence because\nThat would explain that Dodd is everywhere said it's not\nGoing to have the same limits as biological and synthetic which is limited to\n... you know travel and transport in a body if you're a search on television you don't have a physical form to transport so you know be everywhere at every time\nAnd so once again being the attainment of spiritual being comes after death beat payment of of what you do with that spiritual being after death either determine whether or not you're going to go elsewhere what's that\nSays is that what we mean by a soul isn't that in fact uh our spiritual and challenges it because it's something that that doesn't really have a solid form\nIt goes with quantum in mortality and we talked about going to be more dollars before have we not yes they did they have some sort of transmission in some sort of broadcast it only our machinery whatever it may be organic or whatever we want to call it may be some form of synthetic intelligence\nIs picking up on that signal and when that when our bodies breakdown that signal gets taken from that body and goes elsewhere and transmits elsewhere\nSo whenever you have to solve for example complex math follows you first have to define the terms it so that's what I wanted to do to like\nPull jak thank you it it it it basically makes the discussion even more fascinating thank you so much if I can I\nCan I yeah that that that uh once again brings up a some very valid points about you know we have the hallmark card version of God\nAnd you can and I I don't mean that an insulting way what I mean is is that we have had God simplified for us in the Bible\nSo all we know is God but due to basically determined\nThat type of God\nHe she or it is it would be either biological synthetic\nOr spiritual\nConsciousness is the most valuable thing in the University of this is what the synthetic intelligence with the techno signatures one from earth\nThen obviously this is what he meant by being made in the image of God we have\nGod's consciousness could we have the God consciousness in each and every one of its in that we are potentially use it\nFor good things and not use them all the time for bad things\nIn abusing that ability

to them and I can see\nSo much potential if people would just stop listening to this ratings the rating horrors of of a mainstream news\nAnd just wouldn't talk to each other\nAnd they don't talk anymore John that's no problem nobody touch screen they argue but I've\nActually found the people in the red states more willing to talk than I Do the people around me who call themselves progressive [noise]\nAnd I live in the deep blue western Washington part of what Washington state and uh it's uh it's intriguing to me because of the thing that I did back in January of this year I I put together a\nA this forecast which is the main essay at the end of ten predictions twenty eight team that you just mentioned and uh I was just reading it again after many months\nAnd I can't really say that I Would change anything that I put it is a that was basically is happening is a\nA level of if you're gonna defined it\nBasically is happening is\nA a level of if you're going to a defined it in planets there's two major planets and astrology and political strategy either play right now one is a is Iran is and just recently come in to tourists\nAnd then there's also newly into its home sign of Capricorn is centered and long story short it's a struggle you're honest finds itself in the ... sign which means it's dealing more with focusing on personal needs and desires and expectations\nWhereas the the earth the sign of Capricorn Saturn is is the arbiter of the establishment of the bigger powers bigger than the individual and so you have a long story short it's it it\nFavors the establishment more than it favors those who are resisting the establishment\nUm because Iran us into horses in its fall and it's in layman's terms that means um this this ruler of Aquarius is in the least comfortable sign\nThat it's translating through now last time it did that was back in the early thirties and when it did that coming into ... or is it ... to ... major changes in political astrology it brought the German Third Reich into being under adult Hitler [noise]\nAnd it also uh aged Franklin Delano Roosevelt new deal to destabilize establish a banking ideas and things that were restructured that\nIn in a positive sense created a this this longest a profitable wealth a period of the ... in history [noise]\nUh that happened because of the reforms of the banks those reforms has slowly been shipped part by Reagan and Clinton and his two terms and Bush and now we were almost back to where we were almost the same time demographics of the of the separation between the few wealthy and the\nMajority who have not so much wealth\nIs almost exactly where it was in uh Nineteen twenty eight just before the crash\nAnd so we are repeating a cycle and uh so the the issue is their Iran as if ever I saw something that expresses itself in in Iran is in the fall the revolutionary the innovator the person with the original thinking\nIt's affecting a what's called the resistance to the current situation in the White House and and it is a it is expressing itself\nWith great passion and unpredictability button its negative it's about destroying from getting the house by\nGetting the Senate back but for what it's not really defined itself is what we know what the resistance is against when I hear all every day here because I live in the very heart of it here\nBut but we I always keep asking them I understand your problem there but what are you for\nAnd if and if you follow this pattern\nWith much more energy to it then it happened before because I remember this happened in Nineteen Ninety six when I was telling people couldn't believe me after Nineteen Ninety four and the Republicans won the house and sent back I said don't go a Clinton is going to be reelected in Ninety six I was on a show in Portland\nThe five hundred thousand Oregonians watched it and the man who had a meltdown said your\nYou fix I was on a show in Portland\n... five hundred thousand Oregonians watched it and the man who had a meltdown said you're absolutely crazy that can happen and of course four years later I said well no it will happen because\nIf you're ... anybody but Bill Clinton you're you're you're you're fundamentally a you don't have anything to replace him except you're on tearing down and then what and it won't work um it didn't I see it ten times worse now than it was before at least that\nAt least and and it's being I mean it's being the people of this country are being so terribly played by the corporate owned media news\nThat it is really quite and it's classic um you're on us confusion and its fall and tourists you know where you should be grounded you're just you're your emotions your attitudes are just a lot of mud or sign some muddy place a swamp the muddy place\nAnd unfortunately it plays similarly to the chaos that was happening in Germany it plays to some kind of savior that's going to come\nAnd save you from your cells and you know I've been how long long time first with art and then with the huge orange I've been\nTalking for twenty five years now about how the danger of fascism rising again in the world and America being one of the leading places for it\nIs really a hand now it's um it's not going to be when I look at when I look at the situation on the six was November it's most interesting [noise]\nWe have a unique thing happening where you are on us as going retrograde its back going backwards and in the sky which means that it's a time to recollect where you've been and go in and kind of resolve what is the mechanics of what you're doing on the outside world [noise]\nEspecially if it isn't working and you're honest is leaving tourists around or just shy of eleven o'clock Pacific Standard time on election day and starts backtracking into areas that what that means is that if\nIf red voters threat American voters go to the polls early especially in a lot of the areas which will be in early times\nOn hold on for a second John already at the break we'll come back and we'll talk more about this will get into some of his top ten forecasts for this year she how close he's coming and uh also march twenty third you live in Everett, Washington\nApple TV grown past us ... dot com and download the U.S loading the apple and Google Play and I do ... dot com and says why now that the U.S all ...

view some advisor dot com for some home projects and they are really good you just put in what you're looking for and you get a number of different vendors and names and ah they're all qualified and pick the one you want but superb workers by the way John ... with us\nAs we talk about prophecy productions John we've got to get into your two thousand Eighteen productions how many have come true already\n[noise] well uh there have been a number of the more the most shocking than my my ate proxy what I did is is basically short a chapters that takes a team and then look at it fully and\nWant to give us some headlines of of the of the ten real quick\nYou say they were the the definition of the year being the year of acceleration\nThat definitely things have intensified that way the second prophecy was a year out of ... the last ... effect style that looked at a play between Iran and Jupiter that made it possible for actually the government to come together and have more common ground\nBut that petered out by may ...\nAnd that seemed in a way where there was also the third prophecy will Trump be impeached or not in twenty eight team and it looks like that's definitely happening [noise]\nUh I've always said that both candidates and twenty sixteen\nEighteen and it looks like that's definitely happening [noise]\nUh I've always said that both candidates in twenty sixteen were afflicted a astrological early both had the danger if not or if they did not survive their first two years in the first term they may not survive the term in office that means leave office\nNothing nothing of physical or violent nature I see in this\nBut that they could leave in scandal or something like that so you know we're we're entering a point now where the president will be two years in office at the end of January [noise]\nSo ah it will really be very interesting to see what happens in this mid term like I was saying before that the first half the day goes to the red states and the red voters say get out early they vote early\nIndeed is really going to probably be decided in a week or two while people are doing their absentee ballots\nBut there is a possibility for a surprise to happen in the west the delegates that the legislators that will be a battling for dominance in the house of representatives\nWill uh see a surge towards the blue in the afternoon so it'll be interesting to see those battles states in the west\nThat uh might see in eleventh hour or close to the polls are turned around so with that um you know if before I go to the fourth prophecy I Would simply say about President Trump that\nIf he survives this um these two years he will I still see has the potential to be a two term president ...\nWhat's what's so hard for the polarized people in my family of readers it's like I have this family they're all arguing at the table with each other and I'm just quietly watching this and try and taking notes yeah taking off and it's like I mean literally is a large family members and\nOther things are are getting quite involved and passionate about it and I'm going well [noise]\nUm every everybody watches their own tribal news and this is classic Iran is in its fall and for us\nUh they're they're they're just watching the news and there's assuming that the other side is hearing all this and this is going to change their mind the truth is both sides of tuned out each other the red the red side watches Fox the little blue side watches MSNBC and CNN\nAnd the Twain shall never meet so this the other thing too that I look very carefully and it is that so many of the Democrats who once felt white working class Democrats that really went and voted for Trump because they've been neglected for a few presidential cycles [noise]\nI Do not see a change in their opinion they're going to hold with Trump until six fear if he's a two term president according to my interpretation of the astrology they're going to give them a chance when I talk to them and the red states I see it's very clear that they're not going to budge\nAlso the other thing that once again Democrats are overlooking is the power of the evangelical vote I said a very strong you know I said ten months before Trump was um [noise]\nUh elected I said the the big upset could happen through their um and so it's it's\nMy sense is that they will I don't really honestly see a lot of budging a lot of moving it's almost like it's it's the musical chairs that we've had before where it's the same numbers even if the Senate goes to the Democrats at the same number of seats\nJust switching back and forth and in that there's\nIn any significant legislative advance so it's it's just more and I my sense is the next two years are going to be even more\nThis functional than anything we've seen before in is almost unbearable now\n[noise] well it's I I hate to say to everybody across the United states coast to coast but we're entering a period we're not we're not the end of this this this crisis that's going this evolutionary challenge that's happening to the United states in the world\nIs just going to get more intense and we're not at the point yet where people are ready to break out of their tribal identities and actually think of a way to get out of this merge and say it's going to have to get much worse and frankly astrology a saying that\nYou're not going to see it a tide shift until the middle of the next decade\nOr we're we're we're just entering the worst part but we're not even to the other side of this this veil yet we're not even close it's going to get much worse in what's going to happen was kind of brings me to the issue of Kavanaugh and all the small fighting about that [noise]\nIs it I said very clearly in my back in August eleventh in my articles than that Kavanaugh would be picked that um [noise]\nI I think people are stabbed pushed in that and I think the thing that most people on the left are afraid of is really not the thing they should be looking at according to their needs\nIf you look a cabin on the stars and what he's done his record I don't think there'll be way it has any danger any of the social issues are going to be upset by this Supreme Court no I I don't think so\nA lot but I tell you these this time with the Iran is and Saturn the defining planet so next year and into twenty twenty\nThese these planets the way they're positioning the way they're going to move in and out of harmonious affects and that means harmonious two major corporate establishment will to power [noise]\nThat you're going to see with a man like Kavanaugh he will he will vote a hundred percent in favor of the corporations\nAnd you're going to see this creeping coup d'etat of corporate uh hedging Miami which started with Citizens United in January of twenty ten this will be resolved crystallized by some time in twenty twenty when Saturn is about to leave\nA Capricorn it's a sign and go into the sign that the last time it was in an Aquarius those were the great masses and sometimes violent\nCitizen mass revolutions like the French Revolution that's the last time it happened\nAnd so it's possible that after twenty twenty but the American people or or the working people people started really starting to get riled up about situation or they will be basically and completely corporate elite control the United states\nAnd so that's that's my call I Hope I'm wrong I Wish I was more [laughter]\nYou recently run the History Channel will you know the so called the last hope in the Catholic Church of course has been under fire for all kinds of atrocities when Lee ...\nHee huh it was um [noise] it was a unique experience and and it's put me in a position that that show

religions will see the other side of the prophecies the part the door it's been ... to you know and there's indications in prophecy\nAnd Christian prophecy even that shows that what's on the other side of this revelation will completely changed the concept and leave behind even the identity of what it was because\nIt was to be Buddhist all of that will be left on this side of the door and what's on the other side is completely different that's all I can hinder right now\nI I Can't let the night go by without asking you about the middle east and we'll start taking phone calls and winding up here for you what's your take cynically on what's going to happen in the middle east with Syria and Iran and this whole situation\n[noise] well it's unfortunately with all the things we've been talking about specifically since twenty fourteen when I alerted yuan coast to coast and everybody about how we're now in Cold War two point Oh yes\nAnd how it it follows the prophetic a place where the flashpoint as the middle east I mean one of the one of the ten predictions I made and ten production for this year was how we'd come much closer to a a war with Iran that's happened [noise]\nUm Syria is an ally of Iran and is always long story short the\nThe not Saddam's prophecies that are quite clear about this is a look to eagle kings of the north get pulled in this as a Russian double eagle and the American bald eagle ... countries get pulled in because of their allies their vessels [noise]\nWhich are described in an anagram as Arab vessels Bob are a dying Rob in in French at that that kind of a rebel against their their their masters and drag Russian America into a war\nAnd that can happen with the issue of Iran even last few twenty four hours it there we've rescinded a peace treaty that we've had with Iran since Nineteen fifty five [noise] of course it was with their dictator the shah of can you over through their government two years earlier that was democratically elected and\nThat doesn't get told you in the u._s. press\nBy most of the decorations I Love their yeah see I took him down to help the British Petroleum veteran retain a Iranian oil [noise] and then they helped train the survivor which is as worse as bad as the stop all in Germany and terrorize the people as one of the reasons why the Islamic\nThat's why they turn the shah ...\nYes and so so there's bad comedy here and we're basically blindsided to our side uh in this and we need to take a look at how we kind of gotten here comic ally\nNow so so we have a situation with ... which really got me concern in August where it's last province where fifty thousand al ... affiliates who we've been supporting\nCity in Syria for a few in\nSyria yeah we're going to make their last stand against the Syrian Arab Army and the Russian air force\nAnd the Turks were also involved what happened in eleventh hour just before it started is um ... organ of ... the president of turkey and water and food and got together and made a pact\nTo not do the offensive to create a buffer zone a demilitarized zone and take the time to do something to help the people the three million people half of which are are are\nAre refugees all crowd that area and I was a horrible you know what what's good about that is it's it's an attempt not to have this thing happened I Know from my sources that there were a lot of uh the real red staged and film the White Helmets who are basically al ... is a A R [noise]\nUh had already taken children and use them in some gassing attack that's this story I'm trying to track down and we're going to be broadcast is still ... started as a once again\nThe attack that's this story I'm trying to track down\nAnd we're going to be broadcast is still as he started as a once again another false flag that Syrian regime had chemical weapon buys them and that would have caused ah [noise] you know we have thirty Russian warships says this time around\nAnd then a near equal number of American ships crowding the eastern Mediterranean long story short we have a lot of military potential in a tight area that if a miscalculation happen it could get serious\nAnd and so and then one thing can lead to another into a nuclear confrontation I mean the missiles of\nThe missiles of October in sixty two can become the missiles of October twenty Eighteen or twenty Nineteen\nUm his strategy kind of points to and some of the deadlines Nostradamus gave to along in a short deadline if if we kind of move up what may be the official start of the Cold War when the Russians announce they achieved a parity in March first this year\nThey delayed they're putting the delayed his address to the nation Russia and then he so he could see what was the military changes the rules of engagement was going to happen with the Americans\nHe I I actually quoted a lot of this speech and it shows it's very interesting look at how we've been an arms race again with Russia because we pulled out of the ab a missile treaty\nAnd which was a seriously destabilizing move to unilaterally do it for a long story short they had to create a new system of of weapons that could be a deterrent to was surrounding Russia's steadily with a anti ballistic missile batteries\nTo basically be able to shoot down their missiles so they couldn't defend themselves a very very destabilizing move a highly report and\nSo the Russians declared in March first ... pretty much we're in this Cold War and they have now made a parity you know interestingly enough fruit and drops ten billion dollars off the eighty billion dollar budget of the Russian defense\nThe same time Trump adds another thirty seven billion to something that's past seven hundred billion if you add the other sides to it were really spending one point one trillion dollars [noise]\nUh on defense spending in our military ironically it's half of what the US people produce monetary lead GDP every year which is exactly what happened at the same time when the Soviet Union collapsed\nIt was paying half of its money into its big military and they collapsed\nWe're doing the same thing so uh it's it it reminds me of prophecies of amber asserted his spirit was channeled by stereo hunts and ... who is considered the Swedish Edgar Casey in the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nAnd um because he channeled similarly in France and he ... he would say things like that you'll see the one side you know the Cold War over there and Russia have become more free in America will become more like the Soviet Union and police in this economic sense\nThat's true uh with more censorship it's happening to alternative voices you know the that's also a ... I Would say for my own experience with journalism that we're definitely looking more and more like the Soviet Union I grew up with that in the country I grew up with\nNo that's true in in ... and the last minutes we before the break them will take final calls next the half hour you're writing a book about celebrity\nNo that's that's true in in ... and the last minute before the break them will take final calls next half hour you're writing a book about celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain who committed suicide and that this this intrigues me why are you doing this\n[noise] well I've been watching Anthony Bourdain since two thousand five I've learned so much about his unique\nRebellious but really an unorthodox way of\nKind of dragging me along to see the world many of the same places I ate in in my travels ... it's kind of taking us through a journey through the stomach\nTo really meet with people when people break break bread they they they it it's a connection that's all it's all I was saying earlier in the show how we can we need to talk to each other rather than polarized will\nHave a big bank would have all the red Republicans with blue Democrats break bread together like Anthony would do so anyway I watch the show I also saw\nThis brilliant man his doing what a lot of potentially brilliant people and you can also seeker a spiritual speaker in a true sense because he wasn't buying into\nEasy a rationale of belief he was really questioning things on course seeing the world like he was he was seeing the darker sides of it as well\nAnd it wasn't a surprise to me that he committed suicide because I feel as much as I Love him I also had a similar things issues in my own\nLife really let's talk about that John when we come back in the moment the double take your calls have you on hold just hang right there\nNever was a detail on a show or a gift to sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free it goes to go see 'em dot com [noise]\nVisit sleep number dot com slash story to find one near us you\nKnow commercials sweet video on demand TV channel completing devoted to him the best movies on us losing to the conspiracies\nAnd suppressing science it's called us\n...

George story with you John ... with us we'll get to your calls in just a second I just have one more area to talk with John about in he's writing a book about\nThe late celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain and boy you sparked my interest John because it sounds like you had a very a similar situation what happened\nI did it's really a a tale of two suicide a and both of us committed suicide the reason I Am speaking to you is because my experience\nWith suicide was a spiritual suicide rather than the usual what I call mundane suicide hata most people encounter\nUm basically in the mundane suicide I contend\nThat you end up with your pain destroying the body mind that you're that you're mystery of Seoul is living in but in the suicide that happened to me the one that I was in the mundane league going to do [noise]\nI saw my misery and my pain commit suicide and I remained [noise] and\nSo this is one of my most intimate autobiographical tales of the whole other dimensions of my life for all these years I've never known this\nYeah I was I was I was walking through a golf course in San Pedro California I just come back from India and I was still in the tender opening kind of broke out of my shell of\nMany lives being with my my teacher in India for the first time and when I came back in the world the world that was not a place that supported this kind of individual flowering and I was having a very bad day\nAnd so I was walking down this beautiful beautiful golf course adjacent to the ...\nAh overlooking Santa Catalina island in San Pedro cliffs and as I was walking it just dawned on me says I could just keep walking or beyond these cliffs and plummet down three hundred feet into the rocks\nAnd I was going to do it because suddenly ice had this amazing unexpected experience of\nLife and death suddenly being very tangible unclear it's got to see how\nThey're really one there really there are plenty of compliment trees or in our fear they're a play of terror and opposites but what was happening to me the feeling was that try to describe it but it's beyond words really beyond belief\nIndeed it was like um it was descending on me faster than myself and I thought okay this is happening because I have made the decision to throw myself walk over this cliff\nIf I turn away from this I'm going to lose this amazing experiences overtaking me this mystery of life meeting death\nSo I saw this little eucalyptus tree and I sat up against and I said okay for throwing myself over I just wanted to feel this and take this with me over the edge\nAnd so I sat there just going inside and feeling it at some point I felt this electrical energy just rise up out of the ground through the roots of the tree and throw me forward face down into the crab grass or I just began sobbing sobbing and suddenly\nAll of that thank God all of that so that otherwise I wouldn't be killing ... no not at all and uh\nAnd and there was this moment after I cried it all out I turned and there was a little eucalyptus tree and it was just shivering it sleeves and the Santa Ana wind and it was just this moment where I realized the sky the earth tree\nExistence love me existence sees everything that's created out of it as a phenomenal creation rising and falling as something absolutely integral\nSignificant [noise] and I had this feeling that\nSo much of what society does to make us feel insignificant when you go in even at that moment of life meeting death insignificant becomes\nIn significant I it's so the story is really an ... it's a it's a jump from what I usually right about what's a whole other level of talking about these things that I haven't done since I did last month I as a book back in Nineteen Ninety nine\nSometimes my these books you see I I don't write these books they right they use me to write themselves and\nI had no idea until Anthony Bourdain died\nHow deeply he has his suicide how much he was loved and how many many people were shot in the story I talk about the moment that inspired me to write this book I'm In a cashiers line\nAnd there's this old lady and she's doing something looks like she's never done before she's pulled actually a magazine out of Iraq and looks at it and it's the people magazine a van seaboard Dane and I watched how she touched his cheek on the picture the way she did it was so\nIntimate and beautiful and that's when I realized yeah I Love him just as much and I think I think I understand what he was going through he was not a man to bullies or in\nFairy tales and imaginary stuff and that Santa Claus is going to save him from his ends\nAnd all that it's really pretty practice and and and and people like that when they die and I always feel there's a person that has the ...\nAnd I as I have been in my private life which I'm sharing more and more now in this period especially now when there's so much turmoil when there's so much\nI'm a mixed and polarity my inner life now as a meditate or is now coming more and more into my work because it is this still ... point this center of silence and peace in the cycling of life that's becoming stronger and stronger that\nIs what I can share with all of you to meditation the science of self observation\nIs is what what more and more I always thought my my work with evil more and more and it's still prophetic but it's going to have more of my own authority through my own experiences\nSo huge on let's take some calls here in the ten minutes we got left Thomas in Iran with John Home Tom\nHi George thank you for taking my call and John while [laughter] it's hard to follow your sharing of your experience on that but my question John yes for a person to walk in the world to be a participant in the world\nHow can they develop their own centered ness so to speak such that they are on a foot dead on effect yet on touch my personal and planetary astrology\nWell what I can only suggests and I think only anyone who's honest and heart to heart with anybody is all I can suggest as my own experiences the meditation techniques that I've been using since Nineteen eighty [noise]\nAnd uh so my answer to that is if any of you listening to this resonate with what I've been saying [noise]\nEspecially with the issue of suicide in life meeting death [noise] um I Am on a path where I can say there is a way to look beyond and not be touched you can be passionate and deeply into life but you're not overwhelm jury you can be a Buddha and the market place but not of the market place of the world [noise]\nAnd that was what my teacher taught

some of our guests are that it doesn't exist but tonight you'll find out that the double Israel\nAre good friends that she crane they'd been creating some superior radios for a long time and when I Need a radio with the best reception an audio simply turned to see crane you can trust them with everything the CBC Radio too weak\nHappens to be one of the best damn of FM radios made today and what the two we can hear our show with better clarity designed to receive long range am and FM stations and\nMake those weak signals stronger the high quality audio from the CBC Radio too we can be adjusted for ... voice clarity and good musical performance to radio is also widely in a crisis situation believe me the two he has the weather alerts and during a weather related emergency\nNo issues in emergency tone that sets off a loud alarm on the two weeks and you know head for cover it's one of the best and few radios with the two meter hand banned\nThe two meter hand band provides reliable cross town communications throughout many areas in the U.S making that ideal for merge itchy communication as well\nIt also has of course one of the great things about the crane a free catalog take advantage of it so get information about the ... radio too we and the new any well she claimed catalog by calling ... one eight hundred five two to eight eight six three\nThat's one eight hundred five to two weighed eight six three or go to see crane dot com\nSo we're going to see crane dot com [noise]\nWay and I know that they don't commit suicide some of them right they try\nIt's ridiculous I mean I kinda believe technology is working against us like a neutron bomb when a neutron bomb explodes it doesn't make a big explosion but the neutrons penetrate to building an arm or an underground and bunkers\nAnd it kills everything from the inside the buildings that left standing perfectly no damage at all and I believe that's how these demons wanted destruction in any form to any human I mean really I mean look at every single country hate each other out there they're ready to bomb each other for almost nothing but anyway real quick to always my dad moved to New Jersey\nI think in my career as a special ed teacher\nOr ice that work with kids who didn't have any qualities attributes of characteristics that normal people have this war began to feel like I was blessed George ... uh you have to work with these kids who appreciate that that's when I started trying to pay back\nFor just being almost I said a prayer life I always had a prayer life but I saw it apparently this is a prerequisite for white had this operation\nI mean it's for kids that had nothing going from I even had some kids in my classes I had these terrible Kansas and I would draw for them and they always they want the joy so that would give them like coloring books in crayon and they would try so hard to keep this\nGoing on in in the lines are with the numbers for him but some of them has says terrible it's your Kansas a day with\nThrough all of our show coloring they threw him out federal law was in school you were out\nWhile I was just it was ... yeah I mean the special ed teacher had different classes you know and just happened to be in these classes it was yeah children like that okay or whatever we clean it up for them it was nothing to rule because they did that all day long so that doesn't mean anything to them\nEr and er so anti but you know where they learned a skill that they were never going to use the you know there was no really cure for them back then even tell you just really no cure\nSo as a special ed teacher had a lot of time in my hand and the kids need to two hours for lunch for the teacher said with help feed them or there's no papers to correct the bigger kids that had in the ... in the room it used to move back as long as I enrolled us you know when you see a tractor trailer pull up to a warehouse and they put out there was only in roles\nAnd they put the boxes on them to shut them down and you know there's a lot of them don't you know\nYeah so this is me this school supply I enrolled us in my class sideline up the kids I take to fill it can get a box but it on the island role he was flooded out to the next kid maybe because they would open it up is flooded down to the next day they put something into the slide down to the next ... tape it you know so that's what they did if I had plenty of time\nSo George I know how to Boston so I had bought into the nightclubs and I believe this is a real prerequisite of what why they steam and came to this house\nWhen you're doing one or two jobs John\nYeah I mean it is that being a special ed teacher didn't take up much of my time at a two hour lines I didn't have papers to correct you know so I decided you know it gets going to do this too\nSo um yeah so uh uh ... you know people at night that they're looking for fun now a lot of um real estate and the people but there was a certain percentage of people out in the dark side of things these people like a little wickets you don't have looking for costs to alcohol or drugs or commit adultery ... anything they can get their hands on\nAnd the good points and these people were atheists they went to the costs a little bit make sure I can get along with anybody I can relate to anybody\nAnd this type of behaviors enemy bobbing factor but to us over the years I noticed that a lot of these people die from accidents car accidents overdoses suicide Kansas and [noise]\nAnd I bought it with these people in ... and I knew them you know but I felt that these people like ships in the night without a runner any way than I Would take him to do with the wind was blowing that was fine with them and they died this state that I thought nobody should\nDie they were the last rings unusually high\nYeah unbelievable and so um yeah I just didn't think they know how to live I mean that's another thing is focused and the teacher has it teaches you to know that I self you know as I said to me is\nI'm not trying to be somebody else knowing their self means do you the truth about you you are what they do look at what you do in a life what do you do then analyze what you believe about this stuff you might find it's completely different person here I mean I have one friend I Try to get through this quick because I Know we want to get into\nHis name is Chris he was a bartender he worked right alongside and he was an atheist and the just to make fun of God used to make fun to see just used to make fun of the Virgin Mary\nAnd smoke and drank every night seven nights a week I didn't feel well they went to visit a doctor and he found you're already had fought states can't oh so he couldn't work anymore so I tried to visit in between my you know going from the school my school job and my night job or how we work together I mean it was like a friend you know I Know you had all these problems but\nYou didn't know what\nI Know it had this ... yeah it's about forty is in a in a few months and he died within a few months but I Would go visit them and I would try to talk to him about God but he wasn't interested at all he was even more bitten out George because of the diagnosis he had whereas I he died in such a terrible state he died in the state no one should die and uh\nI I felt like helpless form now in my religion George were told that people fall into\nTrouble state he died in the state no one should die and uh I I felt like helpless form now in my religion to has been told that people fall into hell like snowflakes from the sky especially if there's no one to pray for them\nSo I started praying for him and all these other people that I knew in bonded with and I felt they were friends of mine and I would ask God you know don't send these cells to hell with them as you go to hell until I finished praying for them no matter how long ago it gives me on this planet no matter how many grains of sand they still got left an hourglass that's what I was going to do\nAnd I believe now that was the prerequisite of why this demon creature was compelled to assess my house and a bill that mosaic fill your piece by piece right down there every single detail\nNo object what we can really will let me ask you this little John did this demon follow you to the house basically or was it already there\nAbsolutely not absolutely not I've never had like a and I've never you know I never had ... invited to speak to here I never had to say on\nI never use ... or I never use terror cause I mean I I Believe that opens the door for a creature like this to come in and I don't think anybody does that because I now I think if you allowed to speak to come in Hillsdale you harm I think if admitting him it was worse you know the only other time it has\nNo there's no doubt if you view invited in each call me\nYeah that's what I Believe now but you did in science is\nAbsolutely nuts or as I've learned a lot from it I learned that it is and has a methodology able to discuss that too but the only other really other time [noise] ah well you know I thought that I worked at night 'cause that's why I wrote that book anyhow that's the best selling book and it was very interested in any of that do have some funny stories about the rapper Chris Brown\nThat's that's the topic we don't touch [laughter] we don't let which we don't we don't get into that topic oh okay [laughter] so anyway people only one or two was basically what you've seen on the outside but go ahead\nYeah OK study on the other time that I ever knew\nAbout a person who encountered the demon that I Believe was because my brother my brother Paul he we had this a rare a if a blood disease that runs in the family and my my dad was unfortunate to get it and it kills them very early in the sixties they had a heart attack and died at the same day so I'd rather it was unfortunate for there to get it\nAre you okay you get that she has me are you are right yeah what was the bloods was Louis\nOh I haven't I I've been checked with that yeah oh yeah ah the doctor who well let me tell you what happened to call you and I'll tell you so probably breaks up and he has the same symptoms my dad had\nChest pain say dollars nine one one they ... they come and they take 'em to the hospital and\nAt the hospital he dies on a hospital bed and when I went to visit him later on he says to me than if you know and I heard that he died on hospital bed that's what the doctors told me sit down and when I died on a hospital that I left my body he says I left my body and I watched that doctors\nFrantically it and they're ... trying to get me back to life again if they'd be late and not on comedy he just didn't\nYeah and er alarms going off and said like when I talk about that fifth fifth\nThat spiritual dimension he stepped into that for him and he was still so he's still thought he was in a hospital room because he could see what was going on with his body isn't that hospitable he said to me\n... ... ... and it and then there was a dark side of that room he says and demons came from a small team is not like big ones like three foot four foot tall he came to me\nAnd it was grabbed me and was shot in a totally into that talk area of the room which I which I say is the 'cause they say they overlap sometimes and I believe that's where we overlap him at fifty\nAre dragging him into that talks romance and I finally got back last year was able to get back into his body\nAnd he had to make daddy why didn't even though I'm not really that big of a person that you know I don't understand ...\nWhy would even think I mean I was like oh I really don't know uh I don't know if anybody but no I Know that you know all of us are right at the same way like I said you know got a religion of confirmed in our religion\nHe was too but he dropped out and okay and they go to church anymore okay he met a woman he didn't really married live what okay again I tell them you know you\nGot it or you never get them or religion get anyone to your kids have in fact one one prayer maybe like a ... not well I well I don't know maybe get a kick and yet but sometimes when you when your passion to that ... mentioned you know that\nThat we're at overlap somehow on John we're at a break but we'll come back and talk more\nThe

we'll come back to coast to coast joined you know where he would you is the devil has approached you were going to take calls next dollar withdrawn you can join let's pick up the story about your brother your brother it's a time what happened\nYeah so I'm just to recap uh I mean this is probably the only other time I've ever had\nAn encounter with a devil that I Believe that you know I Know my brother wouldn't lie to me about it and he wasn't really a bad person I mean okay he left his religion like we talked and then he he won't he didn't get married so any rate has kids they didn't have a religion so\nUh you know I felt that made me but he said you know to me what you know when I died on that hospitals that\nI left my body I watch the doctors frantically trying to get me back to life again with the ... the latest and the nurses running back and forth sticking things my aunt and they could hear the alarms going off but he was in that like that dimension that overlapping to mention I guess\nAnd he said there was like a duck part of that room which probably never was there when he was in the hospital but when he was in that overlapping mentioned there he even came for him and he actually what why did demons ... man I was I really don't know why\nWhy you know I just don't know how to explain that either I I never had this problem I'd never had a problem like this before I before I had this adversity in my house but um I Wonder about it a lot but he's a uh like he said it's completely a one hundred and eighty degrees turn man he's a very religious man now\nThis is extremely scared the heck on the mood in\nA can of better believe it I mean to actually be dying dying and then leave your body\nAs something if he's going to remember how may still young guys only like forty years always got a lot of life I had him up but he now has a very religious person but uh he encountered this statement but the one that I found it was a very different like I tell you that the un\nSays you know what was the first episode so huge on the ... demon showed up what\nThey all K so uh let me explain to I live in New Jersey like the middle of New Jersey right Nicole ... area I have a house that's on like an acre property\n... Hoboken argue\nAlthough [laughter] pretty far from the fact that our though oh are you from Hoboken enough\nNo signature was oh\nOh yeah that was born in Brooklyn that that that far from home but now I live in New Jersey\nSo oh yeah so I just wanted to say because I had a best selling book I was able to retire and I didn't have to work with those I Love those kids believe me but I ... I I stopped working but may not have to work at ... I guess you just stop\nAnd I stopped attending at night and I love are tending at night but er and that but I stopped but I still know about those people that are still pray for those people and that's a big ... big prerequisite of why I had to separate Russia but now I'm In New Jersey now I'm doing fine you I have a very uh elaborate prayer life\nUh I I retired from my by my job as a special ed teacher retires are not working at night and I miss those people a lot too and I have this nice house and the time they were ... okay about a hundred and fifty feet from the street is on a hill you come in to the house\nAnd the the garages are under the house and you fill your car into the left and you go into the garage is and is the fact that we're there to commit to the garage and then between the garage George and the ... is this big indoor and\nThor the as you come into the garage and then between the garage George and the basement is this big indoor\nAnd other ... I had three boys here growing up and I think a little bit bigger they wanted to a little more room so I had the basement finished and uh I cut it in half and I had the apartment bills down there so my first why\nThat's all he wants to more space that he moves down there yeah you have your own interests\nYou pull your wants to come and go as you want to say yes yeah so it's\nNice so then he goes to college and he moves out thick and boy wants as Hartmann and so he takes it he goes to college and moved out my third boy he wants to had a farm and he ... he was in there he he was here this whole time so he's a U.S and when I had\nThe he was the smart one free rent\n[laughter] yeah well I didn't mind us believe that we have this big house and then like when he ... he was in college he moves out but he got a job\nAnd then he said you know can I moved back home I just wanted to set my own business has to come back home because I mean we are it's a big house and my wife has this empty nest syndrome sure you know what I mean so and I like having a a company to somebody to come upstairs and have dinner where you once in a while and when he was telling me wasn't home that much but he's moved out since then he got a great often took us but anyway he's here the whole time\nSo that the upstairs at self and their basement\nYou come in that that I enjoy the steps that go up to the kitchen was a big kitchen they okay if you're in that case and you can almost hear that door open and close and then next to the kitchen is\nLiving on that show I said most of the time George and uh that's what I like I I go to the gym in the morning then I meditate than in the afternoon I meditate in at night and meditate so I have a pretty long for life and I took I did get back to my artwork because I Am good at it as a small little town that God gave me you know so uh\nI'm doing that and everything's fine to it for years and I've been praying for the last cells that I felt were lost souls every day for years and I was like I said I'm going to do that until whatever time I have left here so everything's fine\nAnd then a bank yeah\nSo then yeah I'm sitting I'm sitting in the liver and that I enjoyed downstairs I'm by myself and I hear that I enjoy ... slam lucky you normally wouldn't even hear it from in the in living memory I have a slam like it never was slammed before and I'm thinking to myself\n... ... and you know somebody's open\nOh absolutely you in the house at twenty five years you know every noise in the house you know so I'm thinking to myself what what's out there but I I don't think my wife could even if he came home and ... like I don't even think he gave a slim that do that hard and\nMaybe my son can I don't know why he was doing that let's say at a car accident or with a girlfriend broke up for them or something like that so I'm thinking what is that so I get up\nI go to the kitchen I look downstairs usually when somebody comes in down near the puts up with in a lifetime feel still talk to you so I go into the room and board and I have a a surveillance system here I said look into the cameras and they roll back the cameras ten Fifteen twenty minutes I said nobody was on the property\nI look at the cameras that face the garage doors nobody nobody open those garage doors I look at the camera that faces that during the back nobody went through the backdoor\n... and er which you know what you do strictly heard it open\nOh absolutely slam no like slant\nI didn't know it at the time that we can discuss this\nThis creature was using his methodology army and had a message wasn't it was telling me that wasn't here for social call that wasn't passed through with no explain that in a minute so I go I look in the cameras nobody was on a property in the basement I got I got bars on windows but you can get out as a you know if there was a fire in a house seat this on lock them and jumped out\nSo I Know he couldn't get anybody if somebody was trust me I think I couldn't see them so I Do I turn the lights on in the basement I go down to the basement that looking everywhere\nYou you pretty convince you think somebody's in the house don't you Oh absolutely absolutely\nI've only problem is but when I'm looking around I feel like I've been in the past twenty five years I feel if menacing\nTotally but I've only problem is but when I'm looking around I feel like I've been in the past twenty five years I feel if menacing sinister I'm In is like the only word to describe it it's like evil like an evil\nJust then I ... it was\nYeah a looking everywhere I look under the steps and look anyway somebody could squeeze himself into behind a washer and dryer and my son's room under the bed in his closet you know and the furniture to him I look I look I'm afraid to take a look and I still have this horrible feeling [noise]\nSo I'm thinking well I I Know I looked at some satisfy looking to the cameras nobody came and nobody broke in but I still have this really menacing finished the feeling that come upstairs and I sit down and I'm thinking about it\nAnd then I you know and then all of a sudden I hear this wording steps between the basement and and and and the kitchen\nAnd here's something I really heavy because like I could hear when my wife comes up the steps a hundred and twenty pounds my son comes up to ... hundred and Seventy pounds I Know what those steps down like where I guess something very silly crossing those steps and thinking to myself I just shut down you know nothing was here\n... coming up to ... ...\nYeah I feel something very heavy slowly coming up the steps I get up again I go over that I look there's nobody there so I'm thinking\nWe were you harmed her own armed at this time I have I have a a registered gun you know you do okay [laughter]\nBut I but I didn't say anything so you know what I mean I looked in the cameras that look through the cat was if I were to fill us something then I I I didn't feel like a you know but I don't think I was wondering if I had that feeling of something very menacing sinister\nAnd I think it is but could this possibly thing but then I Try to shake it off us 'cause he like I'm just the guy I don't think that's you know it's\nGoing to have you on where you convinced that was this creature demon in the house\nWhen it actually I actually had the ... but I Want to try to build up to that before actually tell\nYou we're running out of time so we're going to get some really yeah\nTo educational jak day nine eleven I haven't bought are so

I met a lot of really beautiful people from Arkansas\nAnd it always strikes me as somebody who is a free wing neither blue or red in my in my tribal political identity that seems to be polarizing the country as your report said\nWhere's than ever before um but when I actually go out on my blue range into the red range of Americans I meet really decent beautiful people\nWho and I listen to them and I can see so much potential if people would just stop listening to this ratings the rating the horrors of of a mainstream news and just wouldn't talk to each other\nScreen may argue but I've actually\nFound the people in the red states more willing to talk than I Do the people around me who call themselves progressive\nAnd I live in the deep blue western Washington part of what Washington state and uh it's uh it's intriguing to me because of the thing that I did back in January of this year I I put together a\nA this forecast which is the main essay at the end of ten predictions twenty eight team but you just mentioned and uh I was just reading it again after many months\nAnd I can't really say that I Would change anything that I put in as a that was basically is happening is\nA a level of if you're gonna defined it in planets there's two major planets Mr allergy and political strategy either play right now one is a is Iran is and just recently come into tours\nAnd then there's also newly into its home sign of Capricorn is centered and long story short it's a struggle you're honest finds itself in the ... sign which means it's dealing more with focusing on personal needs and desires and expectations\nWhereas the the earth the sign of Capricorn Saturn is is the arbiter of the establishment of the bigger powers bigger than the individual and so you have a long story short it's it it\nFavors the establishment more than it favors those who are resisting the establishment\nUm because you run us into horses in its fall\nAnd it's in layman's terms that means um this this ruler of Aquarius is in the least comfortable sign\nThat it's transferred him through now last time it did that was back in the early thirties and when it did that coming into tourists it did two major changes in political astrology it brought the German Third Reich into being under adult Hitler\nAnd it also uh aged Franklin Delano Roosevelt new deal to destabilize established a banking ideas and things that were restructured that\nIn in a positive sense created a this this longest a profitable wealth a period of the ... in history [noise]\nUh that happened because of the reforms of the banks those reforms has slowly been shipped part by Reagan and Clinton and his two terms than Bush and now we were almost back to where we were almost the same kind of demographics of the of the separation between the fuel all the and the\nMajority who have not so much wealth\nIs almost exactly where it was in uh Nineteen twenty eight just before the crash\nAnd so we are repeating a cycle and uh so the the issue is their Iran is if ever I saw something that expresses itself in in Iran is in the fall the revolutionary the innovator the person with the original thinking\nIt's affecting a what's called the resistance to the current situation in the White House and and\nIt is a it is expressing itself with great passion and unpredictability button its negative it's about destroying from getting a house that\nGetting the Senate back but for what it's not really defined itself\nWhat the resistance is against when I hear all every day here because I live in the very heart of it here but but we I always keep asking them I understand your problem there but what are you for\nAnd if and if you followed this pattern\nWith much more energy to it then it happened before 'cause I remember this happened in Nineteen Ninety six when I was telling people couldn't believe me after Nineteen Ninety four and the Republicans won the house and sent back I said don't go a Clinton is going to be reelected in Ninety six I was on a show in Portland\nFive hundred thousand Oregonians watched it and the man who had a meltdown said you're absolutely crazy that can happen and of course four years later I said well no it will happen because\nIf you're ... anybody but Bill Clinton you're you're you're you're fundamentally age you don't have anything to replace him except you're on tearing down and then ... and it won't work um it didn't I see it ten times worse now than it was before at least that\nAt least and and it's being I mean it's being the people of this country are being so terribly played by the corporate owned media news\nThat it is really quite and it's classic um you're on us confusion and its fall and tourists you know where you should be grounded you're just you're your emotions your attitudes are just a lot of mud or sign some muddy place a swampy muddy place\nAnd unfortunately it plays similarly to the chaos that was happening in Germany it plays to some kind of savior that's going to come\nAnd save you from your cells\nAnd you know I've been how long long time first with art and then with the huge orange I've been talking for twenty five years now about how the danger of fascism rising again in the world and America being one of the leading places for it\nIs really at hand now it's um it's not going to be when I look at when I look at the um situation on the sixth of November it's most interesting [noise]\nWe have a unique thing happening where Iran is is going retro grades it's back going backwards in in the sky which means that it's a time to recollect where you've been and go in and kind of resolve what is the mechanics of what you're doing on the outside world [noise]\nEspecially if it isn't working and you're honest is leaving tourists around of just shy of eleven o'clock Pacific Standard time on election day and starts backtracking into aries now what that means is that if\nIf red voters thread American voters go to the polls early especially in a lot of the areas which will be in early times\nOn hold on for a second John already at the break we'll come back and we'll talk more about this will get into some of his top ten forecasts for this year\nShe how close she's coming and uh also march twenty third you live in Everett, Washington just circled on dates for two thousand Nineteen will tell you about that later to [noise]\nLines ... dot com was born I not only guarantee you love our blind I offer a feeder free guarantee meaning if you belong to don't fit for any reason a remake them free of charge you

fifty percent off any order just use the code coast that check out that's blind stirred dot com lines T. E. R. dot com\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nBy the way I've used home advisor dot com for some home projects they are really good you just put in what you're looking for and you get a number of different vendors and names and ah they're all qualified picked one you want but superb workers by the way John Hope with us\nAs we talk about prophecy productions John we've got to get into your two thousand Eighteen productions how many of come true already\n[noise] well uh there have been a number of the more the most shocking been my my eighth prophecy what I did is basically short um chapters that takes a theme and then looks at it fully and\nWant to give us some headlines of of the ten real quick\nYes they they were the the definition of the year being the year of acceleration\nDefinitely things have intensified that way second prophecy was a you're out of ... style but look at a play between Iran is in Jupiter that made it possible for actually the government to come together have more common ground\nBut that petered out by may ...\nAnd that seemed [laughter] in a way where there was also the third prophecy will Trump be impeached\nTwenty eight team and it looks like that's definitely happening [noise]\nUh I've always said that both candidates in twenty sixteen were afflicted a astrological early both\nHad the danger if not or if they did not survive their first two years in the first term they may not survive the term in office that means leave office nothing nothing of physical or violent nature I see in this\nBut that they could leave and scandal or something like that so you know we're we're entering a point now where the president will be two years in office at the end of January [noise]\nSo ah it will really be very interesting to see what happens in this midterm like I was saying before that the first half the day goes to the red states and the red voters say get out early they vote early\nIndeed is really going to probably be decided in a week or two while people are doing their absentee ballots but there is a possibility for a surprise to happen in the west the delegates that the legislators that will be a battling for dominance in the house of representatives\nWill see a surge towards the blue in the afternoon so\nIt'll be interesting to see those battles states in the west that uh might see in eleventh hour or close to the polls or turn around so with that um you know if before I go to the fourth prophecy I was simply say about President Trump that\nIf he survives this um these two years or he will I still see has the potential to be a two term president ...\nWhat's what's so hard for the polarized people in my family of readers it's like I have this family they're all arguing at the table with each other and I'm just quietly watching this and try and taking notes yeah taking of it's like I mean literally is a large family members and\nOther things are are getting quite involved and passionate about it and I'm going well [noise]\nUm every everybody watches their own tribal news and this is classic Iran is in its fall and tourists\nUh they're they're they're just watching the news and there's assuming that the other side of the hearing all this and this is going to change their mind the truth is both sides of tuned out each other the red the red side watches Fox the little blue side watches MSNBC and CNN\nAnd the Twain shall never meet so this the other thing too that I look very carefully and it is that so many of the Democrats who once felt white working class Democrats that really went and voted for Trump because they've been neglected for few presidential cycles [noise]\nI Do not see a change in their opinion they're going to hold with Trump until six fear if he's a two term president according to my interpretation of the astrology they're going to give them a chance when I talk to them and the red states I see it's very clear that they're not going to budge\nAlso the other thing that once again Democrats are overlooking is the power of the evangelical vote I said a general minister and I said ten months before Trump was a\n... a elected I said the the big upset could happen through their um and so it's it's my sense is that there will I don't really honestly see a lot of budging a lot of moving\nIt's almost like it's it's a musical chairs that we've had before where it's the same numbers even if the Senate goes to the Democrats the same number of seats\nJust switching back and forth and in ...\nTo create any significant legislative advance so it's it's just more and I my sense is the next two years are going to be even more this functional\nThan anything we've seen before and it's almost unbearable now\n[noise] well it's I I hate to say to everybody across the United states coast to coast but we're entering a period we're not we're not the end of this this this crisis it's going this evolutionary challenge that's happening to the United states\nAnd the world is just going to get more intense and we're not at the point yet where people are ready to break out of their tribal identities and actually think of a way to get out of the urgency it's kind of have to get much worse and\nFrankly installer Gees are saying that you're not going to see it a tide shift until the middle of the next decade\nWe're we're we're just entering the worst part but we're not even to the other side of this this prevail yet we're not even close it's going to get much worse in what's going to happen was kind of brings me to the issue of Kavanaugh in all those all the fighting about that [noise]\nIs it I said very clearly in my back in August eleventh in my article send that Kavanaugh would be picked that um [noise]\nI I think people are stabbed pushed in that and I think the thing that most people on the left are afraid of is really not saying they should be looking at according to their needs [noise]\nIf you look a cabin on the stars and what he's done his record I don't think there'll be weighed it has any danger any of the social issues are going to be upset by this Supreme\nCourt no I don't think so a lot\nBut I tell you these this time with the Iran is and Saturn the defining planet so next year and into twenty twenty\nThese these planets the way they're positioning the way they're going to move in and out of harmonious affects and that means harmonious two major corporate establishment will to power [noise]\nThat you're going to see with a man like Kavanaugh he will he will vote a hundred percent in favor of the corporations\nAnd you're going to see this creeping coup d'etat of corporate a hedge in Miami which started with Citizens United in January of twenty ten this will be resolved crystallized by sometime in twenty twenty when Saturn is about to leave\nA Capricorn it's a sign and go into the sign that the last time it was in an Aquarius those were the great masses and sometimes violent\nCitizen mass revolutions like the French Revolution that's the last time it happened\nAnd so it's possible that after twenty twenty or the American people or or the working people people started really starting to get riled about situation a there will be basically in a completely corporate control the United states [noise]\nAnd so that's that's my call I Hope I'm wrong I Wish I was more [laughter]\nYou recently run the History Channel will you know the so called the last hope and the Catholic Church of course has been under fire for all kinds of atrocities lane leading ...\nYou know it was um [noise] it was a unique experience and and it's put me in a position that that show [noise] uh\nI mean to you have to kind of talk about something that happened and uh [noise] for my own sake of credibility I I'm Sorry I even have to\nYou have to kind of talk about something that happened that uh [noise] for my own sake of credibility I I'm Sorry I even have to say it but I'm the show [noise] ah shook", "show_name":
