the reason why he founded delivery beacon project consisting of about ten proprietary global websites media projects such as the liberty beacon TV a project and partner Web sites across the planet\nRoger or he has a lot of concerns about what's going he's been on this all day long probably more so than\nI have Roger thank you for coming on ground zero\nThat's just like oh you\nKnow I'm doing okay I'm I'm a little flustered because I mean there's just so many things happening and trying to keep track of all of it um and it's really hard to make heads or tails of somebody who is still under investigation what are your thoughts on what what are your thoughts of what happened today\nYour your last just before you bringing the let's put\nThat and I I I listen at the beginning of the show when you had a caller in who couldn't even answer or identified basic ... anybody\nWho's following any of these ships they would need to have and yeah I heard the fresh pitchmen your voice but I'm going to tell you something right now it's going to make you laugh it's going to put a little bit of stress relief in your life because they're so slowly listen you talk about\nHow did they get sort of those you know what the hell do they do\nSo my senior editor Googled sorrows and it came up with his house and aerial views and everything\n[noise] really [laughter] wow [laughter] so yeah that is ... possible to finally find out how to double right I guess\nThat's what he has of course he has multiple holes across the planet so it's like a shell game okay mhm [noise] All right now you asked me what I thought I don't think there's much I can add with\nWhat you described what your guest described this this is these are all the pieces but what we're being forced\nIs Microsoft will will be kept away from is the Mac world view what people need to understand is when you talk civil war you talk Revolutionary War and you talk global war when did you talk your period [noise] nobody goes into war with a pistol\nAnd go into war with a pistol a rifle a machine gun a tank of battleships an aircraft carrier sure you're getting my point right\nAnd what you wish you were gay and one place and really sooner has that engagement started to draw attention then you start another engagement in another place you create confusion spread out and you spread thin\nResources okay and you instill that feeling that everything is going crazy as it sounds familiar to anybody\nWell yeah I I Would go I Would say that what you're what you're describing is a you know as you say you're ... you're spreading out\nResources you're spreading out ah information you're you're killing one side of the information spectrum ... only give birth to another site this is a full on asymmetrical warfare asymmetric warfare and that's why I think it's important that we point that out\nWhat your ex exactly right I published an article today called freedom's worst enemy today is the mainstream media\nBecause [noise] what again most people don't understand is as a civil wars your describing and we can find Lenny Lipton a test that it will pass okay but what you're describing\nIs um face to face one that continues\nGlobally is and then just civil war\nOkay there are factions fighting here anybody who believes that even Trump can get in to office the highest office in this way without having to somebody's way me and I would've used a different metaphor but we'll stick with rain for right now I'm is an idiot\n... would never happen okay so we're looking at one faction against another and they are playing the American people like a Stradivarius\nWell this is why we're here in the instability of of the political discourse is one of the first signs of civil war the idea that violence is the only way to somehow or change the discourse is part of civil more all of these sanctions are part of civil war and the only reason why people don't think we're in civil war\nBecause he didn't happen the way they were told it was going to happen we're not having an armed conflict right now\nBetween America and the Americans just shooting American Well I mean American should Americans every day or Chicago or it seems to be a highly climbed written with guns going up and things happening like that but when we have bombs in the leadership of we have people who have to a plan or day around mob\nBut if you step back and look a mass majority of all these\nThings are ... they're not fleeing perpetrated by the same side but they all have goals those goals are and you had to get this over and over again is it is Leyland that over and over again they are for the manipulation of you and I this is\nThe program ignorant dishes why you get so frustrated tough talking to people the way you do why the liberty we can get so frustrated but we still get up tomorrow and do it whenever I got this wrong ...\nYou you have an Indian see this is the thing I I don't think\nYou know civics our siblings are no longer talk they don't understand most of the younger generations don't understand that they don't understand what the casting ... terrorism is\nWhich would be the idea of ... in terms of stoking the fires to Catholic terrorism 'cause we're communications are twisted in order to incite the riots drove the violence\nAnd we can argue that the president does then we can argue that the media does if we can argue that Hillary Clinton is doing it and you want to hear what's what's really creepy because you know what is trending on Twitter right now\nStill had to make America great again bomber CDs hash tag\nMay go bomber M. A. G. A. bomb or make America great again they're not calling him the make America great again bummer because they're attributing it to Donald Trump they're attributing it to the Republicans they're pushing it\nTowards the conservatives saying the conservative was responsible for the bombings today and and yet none of that we've done when the shootings took place of the senators nothing was done that\nRice and but now we have trending on Twitter the mega bomber this is this is amazing and there was no there's no evidence nothing uh nothing has been released in the public of any kind\nOf a a evidence saying that it it points to a conservative or some right wing extremist or something but now it's already turning on the Internet that it's the make America great again bomber this this obviously happened today as a way of creating ... for the masses and they're falling for it\nAnd it's coming even stronger when the um on these migrants get to the borders or the border of the United states if they are allowed to and I have a strong feeling they will be allowed to because Trump will just put to test [noise] um if you take a look at and they'll say that is happening right\nNow and you stop to legalize okay that\nYou and I think close to the same age\nWe never seen anything like this\nThis is the most exciting time to be alive in America and please do not ever confuse the word exciting west enjoyable\nRights because they are not spend on it but they are exciting we are looking at and we have a president who get their\nWay back when okay a President Trump who declared a state of emergency mhm now if you look into that state of emergency that basically will bring in a state of martial law\nWell her talking about how he inactivity reenact the emergency powers yes he did that on September eleventh or did that after September eleventh and uh and even jak one of our callers called in and he reaffirmed that to us he says yes theory and preventing after they did that when do they do they did the tests to the emergency system in every cell phone\nWhich was another a way to get people thinking what's happening now you see after\nAll that took place you see the writing riots were happening in in Manhattan see the riots were happening here in Portland and then from there we now have the the bombings or the the rice and being sent the bombings now that have happened I said that there would be a final blow\nI didn't know what to do or how to call it or want to point out to be the final blow\nSomeone sent me a headline today that even the Daily Beast it talked about everything from Kavanaugh on with the rice and and now the bombs were the final blow and I might figured while either they listen to me or or they may sent the headline out to try and confirmed that it would mean using when that happened\nI I totally I totally agree I totally agree with everything I totally agree that we are on a press that were standing there right now we're looking at a world that is teetering\nBy what most people also need to understand is not only did it clear that state of emergency okay I'm going to say some things that are purely my opinion and they're not conjecture that based on that but this is what I see what I predict may happen All right\nWe have what could be as many as five hundred million guns in private hands in this country\nThat is more than any military and more is that most military combined on the planet part of the reason why the United states has never been taken over is because a\nLot of things like that exist on the planet how many what percentage which is figure of those could be as many as five hundred million guns belonged to gun toting conservatives who are huge\nTrump followers\nHow many of them look what welcome US Marshal law if they show called out of control and set up a Democrat progressive in ...\nI agree to a certain degree but here's something else okay so while you're talking about the guns\nDid you know the other side is talking about collapse of the economy just to make Donald Trump look that they'd be willing to sacrifice the economy so we have one of the willing to take up arms we have another group that's willing to sacrifice or at least destroy the economy\nIn order to prove a point about Donald Trump\nEconomy's going to go down in a way\nAll of us who look know that there is going to be something that's going to there's going to be a reset I'm not telling that it's going to be in six weeks later than six years there is going to be legal monetary reset and one of these days you like to see how the we will discuss that that is a there are so many polls out there and say\nSo there is going to the ... the only thing is what I heard five will look I'm very good sources to the liberty Begich is that when Trump got what they collapsed economy by the second year of Hillary's first term\nWhen Trump took office realized how much more money it sucked out of your pocket my pocket and basically decided at that point\nA lot safer less what exists now that there were lots of collapsed the economy and shell Trump left office now there's a lot of conjecture but this is what I heard this is what I see\nNow take a look at what's been happening with international thanks for the last couple of days to take a look at their stocks\nTake a look how many of my jumping out of windows\nI look at the point is dropping because of the geopolitical tension Jupiter going to end on right now is hurting us the stock market but I don't know if that's going to be a major collapse but I over discussions today\nFrom a from a ban is man you are our radio station is in bankers hall it's all the bankers surroundings I was over hearing a lot of businessmen today and they're just saying ah you know be ready for a tanking because uh you know in and I\nActually heard a banker used the word civil war he says the civil war we're in right now is going to collapse the economy and we need to be prepared for gas prices go up advice to go up and the economy to fall and I said well I'm going\nTo have those all the Federal Reserve will collapse the economy it won't be there ... politicians it won't leave those puppets who sit on the board of directors or the feds it will be um or a child so on and so forth to work will come down when the economy goes down and they won't be and it can do about it except\nThat I Believe Trump\nDoes have a plan and again that's another show but I think he expects within the either the end of his first term or they're going to the second time to see a major global um bubbles pop spanking horrible\nYeah there is certainly something that uh you know the economy is ah one thing that I've avoided it ignored because at one time you could say yeah we're gonna see a major collapse and another time they'll say well where did that collapse coming from and usually if you if you get really really directed you get really defined it's a guarantee that nothing's going to happen\nSo I'm I'm standing by and watching the the slow trickle down fall of what we have going on with the the violence the symptoms of violence the problems we're seeing a certainly are are part of what I said before\nA with regard to how the military would define a the the began the civil war ... self infringe national poor polarization with obvious\nNew meeting place for resolution increasingly divisive press coverage and information flows weakening institutions notably Congress and the judiciary fell out or abandonment of responsibility by political

magical powers that everyone has ... believes that we all can heal ourselves with magic can protect ourselves from evil entities\nHer fight against the dark forces allows her to help others with solutions to empower their lives and here she is on coast to coast Kurt Russell welcome to the show\nWell how George thank you so much for having me on I Am so grateful and honored to have the opportunity to share my information\nAnd you would consider to be a good which aren't you\n[laughter] well I I Hope so [laughter]\nAs opposed to a ban which I guess but no you're you're you're an upbeat person you're you're friendly you care about people ... you know how did this all start for you how did you get involved in witchcraft well\nYou know I started working with a ... and she's also happens to be of I I consider her to be a very powerful which end and she wanted me to magic and instead of doing the work for me because you know she I feel like her\nBut I I feel like whatever she does with the only just so amazing but instead of doing the work for me she empowered me and and taught me how to do it myself\nSo I just you know I picked it up really quickly and I I mean the rest is history I feel very very confident with with what I Do you know with the spells it I've been executing so that's how I got started it was\nIt was more about healing and then that's when she just introduced me to it and now I feel like well I probably don't need a healer because I'm\nI'm using magic as a form of healing\nHave you ever ... along she'll but\nNever and I want to make that very clear that I Will never ever ever cast a spell to hurt anyone um to try to bring love my way to try to win the lottery [laughter] it's not what\n... what would ... if you can't learn anything [laughter]\nYou know I think that the power of our minds because I have discovered the one thing I have discovered with magic is\nThat ... my mind is more powerful than I realized so I think that when we start healing on so many different levels\nThat we will be able to tap into unlimited amounts of financial abundance and spiritual abundance so I I mean maybe at some point you know maybe I Will\nConjure up a money spell and work that\nBut right now I've just been focused on doing the um healing and an crossing and reversals\nWhen you talk about magic would you what are we talking about we're not talking about David Copperfield we're talking about something oh sure\nAbsolutely and it can be used by anyone I think people you know use magic every single day with the power of their minds so when I talk about magic\nI'm simply chanting spell and when I work my rituals I chance between anywhere between one and two hours I don't just trying to say was I really got along I really do\nI mean I think my neighbor's probably think I'm rehearsing for\nJimmy intense ... chips or get an idea what you're doing\nUm [noise] well when I exercise my house is kind of fun because you have to put on like this magical persona so all the uh negative negative beans leave this house like what would you say what is it I Know it I Know it I Know it I'm just a little nervous George\nBush for talking millions of people run\nExcited though I'm so when I exercise my house because I Do do a house ... every single month to keep out the entities in any you know opportunists that happened to be sure crossing by\nAnd I will say um [noise] negative beans leave the house never to return I cast you out I test you out I test you out so I Will do that while I'm throwing charge salt water and the candle and every single corner of my home and it's really really works and then I'll ward all the windows\nYou know the the feelings and the floors and everything else so um that's fun it's really really fun and then when I when I chance spelled like when I Do want crossing rituals which I think everyone should learn how to do and and you do it very often\nIn a real capable of learning\nAbsolutely I think that we are we have become very lazy\nAnd we are we have I mean we have given our power away to not only our friends and family but to the government and its you know we just we don't want to do anything else I feel also that we've\nWe feel very entitled we feel like everything should be given to us and so this is one of the reasons why I'm an extremely grateful that my ... didn't do the work for me\nBe given to us and so this is one of the reasons why I'm extremely grateful that my sharman didn't do the work for me\nWhile I got to tell you it is it is indeed magical when it works isn't it\nIt really is and I have not only felt results but I have seen results that actually creeps me out [laughter]\n[noise] well I got to tell your ... demons Savage\nI have I had to fight them off or do you do with her\n[laughter] yeah I Do I have a sword and Maya demons layer well it's it's not as tragic as that but I have had one experience and I I Will share that with you I Would say about Nineteen Twenty years ago and this was my first experience with a real\nLive Damon and this wasn't like a portal it was in my house and came out and you know wanted to play it was actually a demon that was summing up by a very evil some federal and he sent it my way\nWhich is on the medal I said I simply don't is it ... is a religion and um they can either be good or bad I don't know much about this on the idea of religion but I Do know that there are some powerful sunset or some sort of you yeah ... it's a religion or pick and so they work\nWith magic and they work with the ... shots which are different spirits\nAnd so this son battle had sent a intentionally of course sent a demon my way and this was after I had had her reading with them a psychic reading and of course I was so naive and I didn't know I didn't know anything about the cold or anything about metaphysics I was just you know whatever just living my life\nAnd I that same evening that same day in in the evening\nI um [noise] as soon as I turned off my life so I Can't even blame it on a train as soon as I turned off my light [noise] um I was ... down to my bed [noise] and I was terrified I I didn't even know what it was because I didn't know anything about demons and um\nIt was\nJust like I couldn't move so my first reaction was to pray the Lord's Prayer out loud and it didn't work so I you know after a few words my job locked and I felt like I had something\nShoved into my now ... with us sicker Russia will come back and talk about the demons and just a moment of coast to coast

I mean nobody knows what you're going to do in that situation so I just fall and as soon as I\nI made that adjustment in my mind right I said I'm going to fight it felt like it just peeled off of me and at that moment with my right arm I just hung up on our and went up\nAnd I'm not kidding George I felt a hairy leg that is insane it's so crazy I didn't really tell anyone but it just like it flew away obviously\nSuch a risky it is so freaky and I didn't even tell my mom because I Know she probably wouldn't believe me but I did go back to that psychic woman that look like what happened but yeah it's so freaking and I will say it never happened again after that time so I Know that this man some and that even and sent it my way but I did not\nSleep without the light off for about three months after that it totally terrified me\nWho is who is susceptible to demonic possession em em situations like that\nWell you know I'm not going to list does it say the obvious ones like people doing drugs or having a cocktail\nOr drunk or shine yeah\nWe're we're going to the cubs are the cemetery it you know and having a cocktail at midnight [laughter] but I Will say that um there is one reason I think that\nMany other were you ever to laugh you don't have a check which uh which should have a check your email [laughter]\nYou know a which is actually a wise woman so [laughter] that's the definition of a witch but yeah I think you [laughter] I'm\nKind of wanted a chemical sensor [laughter]\nI Can't do it even if I tried [laughter]\nUm so one of the reasons that I think is not so obvious um but I feel that can be helpful to many for them to understand\nI'm considering we all lived thousands of lifetimes I'm and I'm Glad I haven't remembered and the other um some of these lifetime so we were not the best of people and um it's very possible but this is my theory that could be wrong but I have proof for my ... who kind of confirmed\nUm my you know my thoughts about this um it's very possible that some of these people these victims who are experiencing what is known as karma so they can be\nYou know harassed and molested in this lifetime with a team and the danger with in in a previous life time now this is the thing I think most people don't consider the people who make packs with humans in this lifetime\nUm the demon the pet is is usually for the life of the demon and that's usually a long time I mean I don't think I've ever heard of a demon die unless you like\nYou're just a moment but a little hard exactly\nThere's thousands of them so it makes sense if you think about at Georgia it makes sense that like people make a pact with the demon that that's going to be for the life of the demons and what's going to happen when we read incarnate and the demon is going to probably harass him and molest him now that's one one theory and I can say\nWith confirmation that it's it's it's probably very true because my ... has a lot of cases it seems like it's more common these days\nHas a lot of cases of of people who are being molested harassed and just you know possessed by demons and what she does and she's\nBecause ... journey into their past lives and nail it and nine times out of ten these people\nHave made tax would demons or they were maybe a big powerful black which\nAnd you know I don't know it's it's it's different for each of them but for the most part they were doing things that they probably shouldn't have been doing and so she does is she just breaks that agreement that they can finally be free\nAnd um I think this happens to a lot of people and I think most people for those that are listening if you find yourself in the situation and you know these demons or not bothering your neighbor it's probably a good idea to contact a qualified sharman who can really just put an end to this\nWhat are these dark for she wants corrosion what what do they want\nThey want our light and they want to destroy humanity\nDuty we'd also\nAbsolutely and I'm sadly a lot of black magicians will cast spells against people who they feel they can steal light from and it can do this collectively with a bunch of people um and they look into us however they do it\nAnd what this does it will make their incorrect magic more potent so this is what it is extremely important especially right now\nUm to to really really really really clear ourselves on a daily basis and do vanishing rituals prayers and and healer our homes and everything else because I I don't know I've been hearing more and more cases\nOf of the human intrusions in people's homes but also how the demonic forces can definitely um manipulate our thoughts\nLet's go to the phones for you know camping in Redding, California started I guess go ahead\nHi George how are you are good thank you

just fucking out or the vice from her she was a witch but not a good way to know and I mean she might even have to do\nBut I told him I said do you think that it's possible that this person could have put a curse on me and he looked to me and said absolutely\nWow she obviously when they broke up did not go peacefully did she\nKnow and actually she helped him move into his apartment and it was like

we know enough to say that it's a\nIt's an awful lot of energy available to men universe and you know I've gone to the sequence of I you know huh how long\nThe G ... summit in the universe and you know come to the sequence of I you know huh how long does it take to get someplace South Korea's nearest person on almost kind of stuff and\nShe the universe crowded or you know it takes a while to get here and there you don't grab get on your bicycle and go to the next stories [laughter]\nWhat we've learned a an awful lot about how ... ... what's going on in terms of energy creation it's not just the stars\nWe know how the stars work we used to live in a hundred years ago\nAnd it stars or him and some burning gas and of course what else could they very\nWell or they could be we're fusion going ... in the norm is leading graders source of energy and therefore in greater ... as an danger [laughter] energy there is a good word it's a great danger from all ... fabric going on out there\nWe still don't know whether our carelessness with how we act to or to others war is still a way of life for a place and so glad that we haven't had a nuclear Holocaust despite having the capability\nWe've been very fortunate\nYeah I mean when we know there it is out there on occasion a ... down here [laughter]\nI'll sit down and we bought a political say we've\nLost some great supporters and you saw the G ... from the astronaut force a Gordon Cooper believe that he had seen something gr Michel ... probably the best astronaut for us\nOr to be a believer in in that are we with a new crop of astronauts if there are any anymore are we getting that kind of support any more\n[noise] you don't hear about um what do you don't know ... on the other hand\nI Would say the great majority of people look so the notion that this herbal life out there that some of them might be coming here and when you find out how many planets there are that came as a great shock through a lot of people one point six planets star gotta be crazy\nAnd that may be conservative\n... yeah ... that may not be letting the actual number but it changes our perspective hurt should change our perspective about ourselves and also\nThe age of the system you know we're not talking about the life began a few thousand years ago it's at least a few million years ago\nAnd that makes a big difference and how important they are fair not the first or low second or ... you know ... there's been a buildup of knowledge of awareness of what's going on out there\nAnd you know I had a long a slogan for a long time progress comes from doing things differently than who predictable way\nAnd I'm waiting for the next step the behind beyond nuclear fusion but\nThere's a heck of a contrast between you know burning what an umpire burning coal\nAh two nuclear fission a nuclear fusion\nAnd ooh ... naturally being the kind of ... through your weight on how to use a lot of energy for killing hey I'm from we're going to do ... for a device on column atom bombs column H bombs et cetera\nBut we're also learning when we can make use of energy for a good if you will\n[noise] but we're also

happen soon partly because [noise] the worst things on this planet are that are at a ...\nTo ... to decide on a course of action is beneficial for the planet or talk about meat too low when there's a lot of the planet you know I'm kind of knew what's good for me and not for you and if it's a chair explains their land\nThere's still plenty about going on in the military budgets of may be shrunk a little bit but ah we're still looking toward a strain on the strong arm approach to getting things done\nOr go in and land and proclaim yourself for the ruler of nine oh everybody else is doing it\nWe we haven't decided how to use it um majority of the energy available for the benefit of mankind\nOr we want power to take power for ... from getting power and\nWe've got some lessons to learn a we teach our children but you can always have which won't help much as it might be nice for you and may not be nice for some other people who are who you interviewed or trying to do them and\nSo it is fortunate that we have and have a a great more imaginative restraint jewelry and we'll say it's hard to imagine\nYou had a H bombs on the planet for a lot of the years not one has been used against a society [noise] so that's a sign of hope restraint\nGosh I Hope so passion I Hope so David ... you know David Jacob spring Oh yes none of them for a long time\nDavid ... is a believer that whatever's happening here it's not a good thing that there's you know some evil evil ETs out there do you what do you think of that\nWell I Can't prove to you but there are not evil tease out there on the other hand I have to point out or you don't have to be much more advanced than we are to be capable of destroying almost everything on a\n... if you put your mind to it and there isn't it amazing that we haven't done a couple of thousand nuclear warheads sitting around the world and none of them have been used\nThat's remarkable Newt is shown restraint I'm not saying that makes it was great guys but as the first step toward good senses to restrain from using all the killing tools you have how about helping to ...\nAnd ... so I I'm an optimist orange a you always had then\nWhy not life is good at math to work at it are there are bad things in the world of course for sure we\nCan do something of that and so uh\nAre there are bad things in the world of course I'm sure we can do something of fat and so why shouldn't I be in the ... um and\nLike I say restraint seems to be the word the uppermost than many leaders mine's recognition if I get them they'll get me and look good a white guy yeah why\nDon't we hear too much about ... abduction cases anymore gosh you know in the seventies and sixties that's all we heard\nUs right now we I think we take it for granted but there are aliens or maybe we put your haven't talked\nTo any live leaders or maybe they stop you there yeah maybe they got all and me a raccoon enough is enough ah\nAnd it might not be surprising people I I have a great

far we get to your calls as well stance with us we're about twenty more ... more minutes or so\nStand you wrote a book with Kathleen Martin was the niece of Benny Hill called captured which is still for me one of the greatest UFO stories of abductions I've ever read\nIt is one of the reasons I got into this business because one look magazine came out with the interrupted journey or the story of Barney and Betty hill I mean I was just mesmerized even at a young age\nHow would you categorized that case the Barney and video case\nWell I I think it's a very important case and for several reasons I'm\nOn the people are are not talking about people who don't have a reputation when I'm Talking about people who are trying to seek it turns into her attention to say that he was a social worker or respected member of the community\nShe had a mixed marriage with Barney ... she was white that was very unusual in the early sixties\nIt took guts for them to come out that's right and they were very concerned about what the ...\nEarly sixties it took guts for them to come out and that's right and they were very concerned about what the reaction would be a\n... this was in the early sixties and you know you got to say if you're going to have people who set a new standard of what's going on you got to have people who can handle the heat's speak\nIt's unfortunate that Barney didn't live terribly long tide will Nineteen sixty eight\nI guess and I'm a buddy I'm Around a long time for ... for which I Am glad\nAnd uh it was a good case to set the ball rolling so to speak on the whole business of abductions and interactions with Italy\nNot sensationalize I mean let's face it stand back and you say betting Barney where specimens for something [laughter] yeah\nAnd they weren't ... treated but they certainly weren't going on for the glory and claiming all kinds of not see things as being part of their interaction with the ... ah [noise]\nAnd you know\nI I was fortunate to have the opportunity to meet them early on [noise] on my ... and I was very impressed uh and I was impressed by something else uh the media and in that case I mean K in Pittsburgh biggest station in town and uh\nUh you know I I that's where I made my view and on the air so to speak\nAnd they called me and told me that they were bringing Betty and Barney into town and told me where they were staying\nAnd which is very unusual yeah and I contact with them we had dinner together or just the three of us and I had a chance to you know one on one kind of thing and I was very very impressed and I had known what to expect because I hadn't dealt with stuff like this I mean\nIf it was a little bit crazy story aliens you're grabbing a couple a an interracial couple\nIn those days you were just getting into this Neal aren't you well yeah I mean you know you've done is pretty early on was early yeah\nIn the sixties and live a longer in the sixties or seventies or eighties [laughter] that's right no\nTill I was very fortunate to have met them one on one so to speak and I saw them at conferences I didn't get too many meetings with for a new cars he died within two years when I first met him a lesson that\nA very who's gone on and of course I work very closely with that he's nice Kathleen Martin and we've done three books together and ah\nAnd that's been a pleasure to a is often you find it can break with people who are have co written ... books will will with other people but uh we seem to be compatible\nYou you you too clicked and she's great in in the field and you follow due to a ... she's super prison\nIn ... when I was that Twenty one year will reporter who interviewed you\nOne of the other interviews I did was with Dr Benjamin Simon who who is the psychiatrist who\nWho studied Betty and Barney hill and then I'll I'll always remember this because he was in Boston I interviewed him over the phone I'm In Detroit and in ... you know I'm I'm obsessed with the story\nAnd I asked him I says\nIt's known I'm In Detroit and in the ... you know I'm I'm obsessed with the story\nAnd I asked him I said so what do you think Dr although they're telling you the truth or not what do you think he said I I don't know if the story happened or not but I Will tell you what I Do believe\nThey're they're not lying whatever happened to them both of them on under hypnosis separately to the same story and they they believe whatever they saw happened to them\nAnd he said based on that I cannot say what happened but I can tell you they aren't lying to me in a what an amazing story\nYeah ... we have to remember that the doctor Simon ran a facility for three thousand shell shocked war veteran yes called the ...\nBefore anybody would get involved and stuff like that\nYeah and he had learned to use a nose as as a means of bringing guys who had terrible experiences you know your buddy said on of next year battle [noise] ah that's traumatic to hate but weeks\nAnd so he learned how to handle this and so they were very fortunate and winding up in his hands and you know I I I'm Still not sure exactly what he finally thought about the whole business\nBut he surely thought that these people are not wine that's right there was not looking for attention cetera et cetera\nI was impressed with him and uh I was impressed with better than Barney to a foreign aid ideal forties and uh\nUh unfortunately but they they they were they had nothing to gain a mixed couple in the United states in the early sixties ... was not parading itself around the world when they were asked to come out so to speak to resist the reporter for the story out\nMuch to their surprise that relief or they were treated fine\nUh and they found out around the world and that's the thing that I have a look I lecture to Nineteen countries it's given me a pretty good handle on one of the people and think about the subject of flying saucers aliens or you know visitors from someplace else\nAnd I

Amazon [noise]\nWell I didn't know anything to a couple of years to a lady in Scotland and not performed a deliverance over her and she had contacted me a couple of weeks later\nAnd asked me if I knew about this the Mandela fact in and these changes and specific changes\nIn the king James Bible and I said no I have not and she sent this video and I thought to myself you know I'm busy I don't have time for this just sounded so ridiculous to me and I was ready to just believe that video and move on I was annoyed\nAnd I\nI felt that God just stopped me right in my tracks and just sit and watch this and I watch the video and I said okay I'm going to prove this wrong right now I have for King James Bible one is in my travel bag that's Twenty years old it goes everywhere that I go over the country and another one\nPulls one is in my travel bag that's Twenty years old it goes everywhere that I go over the country\nAnd another one is a hundred and fifty seven years old and it is in the top of my closet in my office and I pulled them all out or late I'm On my desk and the first thing on the video said that Isaiah eleven\nSix have been changed now Isaiah eleven six is one of the most popular scriptures in the Bible it statues are made of it paintings a song Elvis sang about it I it is the scripture that says in the line and she'll lay down with the lamb you remember that\nGeorge Bush do are classic\nFor anyone out there right now if you're listening in and if you think what I'm about to say is talk of a madman turn or go on line to King James Bible dot com or Bible Gateway whatever it is and and punch up Isaiah eleven six and now it says\nThe rules [noise] road rules that\nNo longer says the lion she'll lay down with the lamb it says the ... ...\n... ... it's in writing it says I've never heard of that\nAh at George when I saw that and I saw that in my Bible I nearly fell off of my chair I spent three years in Syria biblical studies\nI Know the scriptures and when I saw that I'm telling you right now I couldn't reconcile that I just couldn't believe what I was seeing and there it is\nAnd again don't take my word for it if you're out there listening or get a hold of a King James Bible or punch it up on line and you'll see it for yourself\nYou if you go and look at your own Bible a hundred and fifty seven year old one yeah we do bullets said the walls\nAbsolutely and I've taken pictures of it and it's there that is what it is bizarre George it's I have no actually the only explanation and I still don't understand it and I have it in the in the new book the only\nThing that I can take over this perhaps this is linked to CERN which is the Large Hadron collider\nWhich was French boy yes in the work they're doing I Believe they're opening up portals she dimensional doorways I mean I I remember\nAs a kid the lion lays down what's the lamb\nYes then if you can get Tom DVD or somebody to watch out for you and show you on screen what I'm saying and you'll see it for yourself and your it's shocking it's really shocking to see it because anybody\nWho is heard that scripture you know it by heart it's one of the most popular scripture than the entire Bible and now it says the world\nCan you find it anywhere where it says the lion leaves down with the lamb who's just moved all over the place\nIt is the wolf in every Bible now however a friend of mine uh he has a YouTube channel ah ah\nHis name is Chris and I thank you very much for finding this for me he actually found and his YouTube channel is a become one that can see\nHe actually found something for me out of an older encyclopedia of biblical encyclopedia and he found the passage with the lion and ... that is the only place that you will see it as something I had it will be in my new book stranger than fiction\nThat's it everything else George says the wolf\nI Wonder if it's going to change if he doesn't look at it every day for example it one day it's going to change to the move some uh\nOh it wouldn't surprise me one bit and\nChange if he doesn't look at it every day for example one day it's going to change to move some\nOh it wouldn't surprise me one bit and furthermore the Lord's Prayer is now change what happened to be okay but the Lord's Prayer is our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name I Can't come there will be done on earth as it is not going to happen give us this their daily bread and forgive us for trust passes\nAs we forgive those who trust pass against us for the latest nodded the temptations delivers from evil for the kingdom and the power and the glory forever more right you've heard that a million\nDollars that's okay it's changed now so now it's our father which are in Aspen\nI never heard it like that yep how you came on my will be done in her\nIn or near where we use as in earth you know you live in our feet is there some\nThing that changes these things\nYes and I do believe without really knowing the answer and even if I saw it in front of my face I don't know I wouldn't know what I was looking at\nA but I Do believe that it is sun and the the way of quantum computers that are working in concert and I think that it's er and that opens up the coral and see the way computers\nSomehow some way whether it is some way as crazy as all of this sounds I assure you it's true that they have this ability to go back whether it's going back in time and changing this\nI don't know but I can assure you of this for anyone out there who would say oh well\nThis is just the Bible's that or you have to make these changes coming off the printing presses and all that I'm Sorry I'm Talking about a hundred and fifty seven year old Bible that has changes in at a Bible that's been in my possession for years\nThat has changes in it now so that can't be resolved we be in human understanding we can't resolve that and another thing that I find very interesting\nIs that the Lord's Prayer I have it on paper and a frame on my wall that was changed to what I just told you are but yeah\nI have Lord's Prayer that it's carved in a stone in my home and that is not changed and it has not been changed so it's interesting to note that what ever this technology is\nApparently it cannot make changes on something that is in stone\nWar of some type of metallic substance or something like that another bizarre things George ah do you have any Roman numeral clocks in your home or do you have a watch with Roman numerals\nI think I Do I think I Am a couple of watches what's that\nOkay well I Want you to look at this the Roman numeral Nicole's all turned upside down ... what is what has happened to them\nAs this this effect has now turned them opposite so they're upside down now so where you would see a in the five o'clock position\nYou know that would look like a of V. that's now turned upside down to where it looks like in a weird\nAgain for anyone who thinks that this is crazy talk just look at your watches or your clocks and and and another ... and I've taken photographs of this as well and people from all over the world are noticing this\nAnd they and other interesting thing I have some watches with Roman numerals that have been affected and changed yet I have a clock a Roman numeral clock on my wall in my living room that has like metal\nChanged yet I have a clock a woman the clock on my wall that have like metal and for the Roman numerals and ...\n... you know we're going to have our inch to pull back on our website as we get some new software and I'll be able to pull people instantly bill and I would love to pull people on the lion lays down with the lamb and see how many people say that they agree that's what it was\nAnd then compare it to the statistics are ... or ... overwhelming people would say that it that it was low lying lays down with the lamb\nNo question about I mean the wolf is ridiculous it doesn't fit there's no way when you say that it just it makes no sense odd George when you look at it it just looks so uh it's not right now let me ask you the\n[noise] the the E. S. you're familiar with the correct drug Enforcement Administration\nWell it's interesting that you say that because it was known as the drug enforcement agency that's why they were ... agent and now it is the drug Enforcement Administration\nWow why Bob see I've always thought of it is that we're going to come back with more built another moment on coast to coast day I'm your phone calls with Bill beans big caught and the Mandela fact\nDo have a photo that you think would interest because because door you were always the hunt for unique an unusual images for a photo gallery to submit your image simply go to coast to coast am dot com than most over the media button on the upper navigation bar you'll see the submission Amish [noise]\nIron works shakes had rhino safe dot com American Made an antique styled our saved our part art part furniture and all security\nAnd if you like the classic look of our rhino hire more saves we also feed your beautiful matching tool just and furniture\nWith hundreds of thousands of satisfied customers and to a huge network across the U.S we've built our reputation on having the best built best looking and most convenient safe with great surface and warranties and you can get online financing so go with the best\nAnd get style convenience security and true peace of mind with rhino safe dot com today not sure I Know save dot com rhino safe dot com\n[noise]\n\n\nThen we'll come back to the coast to coast our special guest bill being as we talk about big food the Mandela Effect and your calls as well bill would this fall under the Mandela sect category of the actor jak collapse\nPeople thought he had died he's dead now but during his day when he was very much alive everybody thought he was dead everybody you talk to his would that be part of the Mandela sacked\nI tell you a George\nI Would venture to say yes I mean it's not just jak Polanski or the Reverend Billy Graham\nAh Nelson Mandela that's how the you know what the name came from Jim Neighbors and various other\nUm stars like this or politicians or that or or you know people that are Reverend um [noise] somehow we all had it wrong and all these people had the died years ago and you know a lot of those\nFolks that died in more recent years here and are there are people swear that they remember funerals for Billy Graham and televised specials and things of that nature and it's\nMind boggling and and really interesting that I could say is that\nThe the apple is a master of confusion and division so where there is confusion there is division because if I say to you\nWell George I think it used to say this or whatever and you gotta no no no it's always said that\nNow we have confusion and division is going to come in and I really believe\nThat the source of this is demonic in nature and this is the ... I Can't take this in my opinion is part of the strong delusion and the great perception that has come on the earth I've had debates\nWith Bible scholars on other shows about this topic and they swear that none of the scriptures have been changed it always said the wall fan all these other things that I'm an agent for the devil for saying this and\nIt it's mind boggling George and anybody that knows me and you know me well enough\nGot his first in my life I Am an agent for God I'd go all over the country helping people to be free from demonic garbage but yet they're\nAgent for God I go all over this country helping people to be free from demonic garbage but yet there were people die in debates against me on things like this that just said no way you know you're twisting the scriptures around and nothing could be further from the truth\nWhat did they say the devils greatest trick is Rob making people convinced that he doesn't exist\nYes absolutely\nAnd it's uh I'll tell you this is where we really have to [noise] and and I am poor people out there here what I'm saying\nA now is the time to really get close to God and ask God for discernment to know what is right and what is wrong with his true it is not who is true who was not\nBecause we are in an age of deception and it is only by the power of God and the guidance of God and the protection of God that we're going to get through the things that are here and the things that are coming\nIt's actually kind of scary that so many people the great majority believes in one thing and then there it is clearly in black and white something else and we swear up and down that they can be\nYeah it's incredible it's mind boggling it truly is and ...\nPeople are free to believe what they want it's not my job to try and twist somebody's arm into believing something but it is my job by the power of God\nAs a matter of God to speak truth and when something like this comes along I Can't remain silent on it because I feel that I have an obligation to people\nTo tell the truth and as disturbing as this is I'm Sorry it's the truth and people need to get ready and prepared for this\nLet's start with the bones Joe truck driving in Indiana they're going to start an age oh go ahead\nGeorge good thank you this myth that stuff is free the man is free you can only as a\nLike a I remember it is still alive under the live must sell to I don't know it's kind of all of my mind\nBut uh that's the whole effect because I think that's a that's in the actual like material world is not just like who the quotes there's a couple of famous movie line so late change from her some song lines\nAnd like ... or something like that but like there's a place like there's a tree over close to my house there that I don't like the family or any names of people who live there ... there and all of a sudden there's this fact\nKidding [laughter] that's funny\nOh this is talk of hours or so I I just wanted a pop up there so\nAll right so you would that be part of a Mandela Effect where everybody doesn't even recognize the tree and it's their\nGeorge there are people that are reporting stuff like that that they're seeing a you know things\nThat were never there before they're they are seeing I'll give you another example for breeze you know that that the air freshener for breeze yes how would you spell that I'm\nA I'm just guessing but it's I Would have said F. E. B. R. E. Z. E.\nYeah that's how it was and that's not how it is now they've dropped the knees so it's that the P. R. E. Z. E. for breads now\nAnd ah you know barren Bernstein bears is now parents staying there than Mr Rogers do you remember this George it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood it's a beautiful day in the

you see in an old movie it could be two hundred years old for all I Know yeah but if that's please the lion and the lamb has changed to the wolf all freak out\nI'm going to have her checks changed you'll have to let me know and I'll guarantee you that it's changed so I'll guarantee you on the air right now in front of all these millions of listeners that you will find when your mom hope is that Bible she is going to find that it has changed\nNow how does it physically change if we all agree that it was the lion in the lamb and it was there in Princeton black and white hot and they basically change\nThere is some type of now this is coming down to quantum physics in my opinion and this is way out of my league it's it's way above my understanding and picking\nOut of your pay grade as we said in the navy now way above\nBut ah I really truly feel\nThat it it must be a combination of this CERN device which opens the poodles up\nAnd the the way of quantum computers that work in concert with that and somehow that now again this is quantum physics thing ... that says hey I had all these different things that are so far beyond my understanding\nBut that is the only thing it would have to be something that are really is on the border of supernatural\nThat kid come into a person's home and a factor objects that are in ... possession or in one home and all through these things that is the only\nWhat has changed with what is it hasn't changed bill but we have been moved into another reality or that is not ours but it echoes hours in that all reality words the lion and the lamb ... we we have somehow been moved out of it\nI have thought about that and I've studied on that but what brings me back to a more sinister a in ten is that when you read some of the scripture changes George some of these are absolutely evil and Monica ... some of the things that are put in here now\nCar which if you're Bush [noise]\n\nCould be the most expensive night of your life getting pulled

manufactures its board sent a letter along with the board to president Grover Cleveland force for his wedding gift and this I Know and we know this because they took the opportunity to send\nThat vaccine letter over to the Boston Globe who got published I mean there are masters of PR yeah now what do you think president Cleveland it\nWell I Would guess chip to board\n[laughter] listening as we said the letter comes to them and it says honored sir we take the liberty city by express today an article for manufacture which is attracting a great deal of attention call though which board\nPresident Cleveland kindly wrote back and said I acknowledge was saying the which board which you sent me as a wedding present\nI accepted as an evidence of kind ceiling and friendship and can a moderate fourth ingenuity but hardly think that I needed to test his powers to disclose the path in forecast the future\nWhat he did take it I knew he was he took it he took it are we sending back\nWell there's no there's no history of that now we don't know where that board is but let's just tell you what happened fast forward a few years\nFor four years and years now Eighteen Ninety and a group of businessmen and one business woman\nGot together and came up with it they're on board version of it and they got it named and talk about this woman here her name is miss Helen Peters not worthy\nAnd they consider her a gift tax psychic and she said at the board and the message came through and it said they asked what should we call you wish we call this tool before this device\nIt's spelled out we job they they decided let's go we just so ... so they needed to get it patented so in Eighteen Ninety they went to the U.S patent and trademark office allies rub on the attorney for this group went along with miss Helen peers they sat down at the board because they had to prove\nTo the patent officers that this tool works everybody kept saying no I'm not going to do\nThis no I'm not going to register is not this this is ridiculous finally the head guy came out and said okay you don't know me I don't know you if that thing there could spell out my\nName is George what do you think happened at ... and sure enough and the ... came alive\nNo didn't spell out his name was somebody on the planet ... were you probably would choose them doing something or did it work why it's so I\nKnow you've got to have your hands on a plan shattered after that yeah you have to so it's spelled it out they didn't know him and it was that you know that's how the story goes so\nThis woman miss Helen Peters not for the uh is really critical and crucial to the naming of the board and also to get a patent it and a lot of people didn't know about her till about six years ago when Robert merge the chairman of the board of the ...\nHi my story than letters about her and so if we were honoring her just last month and a Denver, Colorado and gave her beautiful gravestone with everybody everybody's and that was hard at are buried in her plot their names are on it\nUm she was just on her she was just lost to history but we resurrected her and her family was so grateful and thankful and and now she's got to be well no and she's going to go on the heritage and a group of people who do tours in his grave yard\nIt's called the Fairmont cemetery and Denver, Colorado and she's going to be remembered and recognized for her contribution to this device forever\nHow do you explain to somebody called on the show a couple of years ago and talked about how to get rid of all we gee board\nAnd the proper way he felt and it was to burn it and he said as he was burning it she could see little sparks come read offered and screams she heard screams coming out of the board you believe up\nWell okay so you have the story is right and again I'm gonna I'm gonna references again we all have our stories based on our perceptions belief\nOn how you view the world her own fears or own desires and so I don't mind is a powerful thing it can create many things that we have and truly measure and understand and we don't fully understand awareness or consciousness and how we might even affect our rules they're creating their manifest yet I'm going to say that this story but what I Will comment on\nSome board don't work very well because they might be made I made the night and the worst thing to do it really burn a board I mean you could sell that on ... could have said to us at the ... society will take them and we'll refurbishing and sell them they've given to a loving home that really wants to protect us the history and heritage of these devices\nTearing what's the oldest board you come across\nWell for me and my oldest for the circuit Eighteen Ninety to Ninety three board so I got a ... sized started being made in Nineteen Ninety One in production minds when you're after that\nStarted how do you explain this back in St Louis when I'm doing my night talk show must be Nineteen Ninety seven Ninety Ninety eight\nSomebody gets me a weed you board I've got it in my studio\nAnd I'm going to do a little bit with them and I've got a producer there and this ... board is in the studio with me that I never had any technical issues with in the studio all of a sudden everything is going wrong\nWhat commercials I couldn't play him because the computer board went though the board that monitors middle my voice levels that was all screwed up the lights were going out I didn't know what was on and what was off it was weird\nAnd I finally told my producer Howard at the time I said I Would get this thing on the year he took it out and within two minutes everything pop back up working on the computer the board everything and I want this is weird\nAnyways what I didn't know what the time was Howard\n... widow news guy named Daryl and hot word game Darryl Luigi board he said it doesn't Georgia doesn't want those you take it\nAnd so he took it as a gift I didn't know that and um you know I did my show or within works and that was fine\nUh about two days later Darryl is no longer employed at the radio station which was kind of strange what he's gone then I Want boy that's weird\nAh again not knowing that he had the ... board I I run into him about a week and a half later is at a restaurant and I went Darryl Hawaii I'm Sorry I heard you're not one of those in the morning when George nothing has gone right with me ever since Howard gave me the weeds you board\nI got fired I lost my relationship I Can't get a job I I\nHow do you ...\nWell it's always all too easy to point the finger at something out there than to look at yourself you know maybe it's falling down any way on a path of not doing very well working there or maybe he wanted\nWell what about the studio thing with me in the beginning\nWill you know we want to blame the law by something that you want to make it mysteriously don't want to look at something logically first\nIt was ironic that it it's\nVery ironic I ... I have to give you that George but I got to say we we we ... the the the poor because it's so controversial\nAnd it just causes all kinds of meetings and and visceral reactions in people we've really got to look at um what's really going on inside herself and what's really going on in the world around us and not just quickly jumped to say the board did it but that\nHappens too often because it's almost easier like end is to blame for that external and to think that's the reason now now hold on is another way to think about this too\nWe create a lot of things we could just have the thought in our mind that uh we ... board is scary dangerous bad and then we can draw those things to us just for the power of our mind just from power of unconscious mind and then spin around and go I told you the it's like self fulfilling prophecy\nI don't know I don't know you know all these years I've known you Karen you haven't been able to convince me yet to use the region board\nI Know it that happens sometimes\nI mean would you be wrong could you be wrong\nThen there's something very wrong about\nWhat aspect of it\nI'm sure that it can conjure up people's spirits let's say\nI'll say that you can counter anything evil in your mind because I think evil exist in the heart of humanity I hate to say that evil and then people there's evil all over the world look around it's people cause evil\nBut what I say is evil is not a force outside yet we can draw these energies to us we could draw other evil people too if we can have evil things happens and they are real bad evil things\nBut doesn't if they mean just because you get a piece of wood our cardboard or there's numbers on a piece of paper or letters that that's going to cause any problems so I I I for my world my life in one of experience with this tool and away from the tool\nI'm convinced that you cannot now but having said that people have their own beliefs and their own beliefs will still become a self fulfilling prophecy if that they truly truly choose to find\nI mean do you recommend ... as a board game\nI recommend it if a child wants to use it I the best thing to do is to not go don't do that because they're going to want to do it and sneak what better thing to do is say hey what is it about the ... why would you want to use it what ... what do you think about it what do you like about it what do you want to know about I Want to\nGo to come through that they want they you know what they want kids like touch though\nOf course some adults do too I mean look ups populist go shows are and colonel investigations and I think the best thing to do is say well if it goes into what's that going to do for you how's your life going to be and how the conversation I don't know where that conversation is\nGoing to go and it may go where you decide to for example I live in southern Cal you may decide to go take a child out of the queen Mary and go on one of their investigation\nOn hold on a second

and dot com and it's linked up for you don't have to worry about spelling ... we've got the link for your coast to coast am dot com as well Karen you mentioned that the using the board\nIs somewhat like a permission to explain that\nWell we have the ability to interact and reach into the ...\nYou're so more like a permission to explain that\nWell we have\nThe ability to interact and reach into the unseen dimensions is from when we came up where we go again I definitely believe in an afterlife with it for life and in between lives and so I I came into this world as a very young child scene spirits having imaginary playmate\nHaving positive experiences with them as well and I knew there was something is so much more and for me the wage war became kind of my lifeline to have those connections and continue him throughout my whole life [noise]\nUm so it becomes just that permission allows me because my allowance becomes my\nA gateway or becomes just a channel I used to do what I actually can do I mean I did this as a child\nBut sometimes we put that stuff away as we get older and grow up and were told not to do that not to talk to beans that aren't there imaginary playmate and go to school and I was told those things\nAnd so I found myself putting them away but this was the one tool that worked really well for me to be able to have those communications and to this day I'm I have communications of that I used to have the child but and I could do it on the board in off the board and I know it's not the board that lets me do this\nIt's myself with my ... my beliefs about those abilities my allowance of those buildings to come through and this again just becomes that kind of a door that threshold that left me moving does rounds\nAnd interact with them how often do you use the board\nNot as much as I used to I'm doing a lot of work George direct channeling I'm with my voice or writing off the board more often than um he's the board but I use the board would say about once every two weeks will be twice a month\nI might go as much as an only doing it once a month but I I prefer to work with a partner at part of the very busy is probably scheduled himself so when we do get together we'll do a session on my last anywhere from three to five five enough hours\nHaving said that I Do a lot of ... a sessions for my YouTube channel where I Will do answer people's questions and let them have readings [noise]\nUm and I do live shows like that like I'm doing one on Halloween evening as well um so I I I really try to interact with people with the tool and when I'm not using I'm most of the time talking about writing about it or answer people's questions about it\nWhen you are in trouble with the weeds you board does anybody for go\nWell yes [laughter] yes they do I ... yeah you\nKnow you can always hide him um and I do to help my boards I always have a traveling more with me and if I don't have one forgot one which has happened all you've got to do is get a piece of paper right the letters down put the numbers down yes or no way you go with a coin\nWhile the rest of the several hours going to fly by so let's get some calls him for your Karen Angie in Ohio welcome to the program high energy\nI thank you for taking my call we keep on going [noise] right right well\nWhen I was a teenager I had a boyfriend that he could do out of body experiences and his family was really religious and they didn't like the things he's a practicing they put him in a home for a while while and to me if I had a we ... and I had and I\nActually I Do he said well if you talk to me I can leave my body and I can come visit you so one night me and my girlfriend or a baby I'm president of her [noise] and after they went so that we decided to try it and it was a really calm quiet night it was warm\nAnd the windows open the front door of phone you know it was\nEarly eighties we really nothing to be a free ...\nAnd we're trying to talk to him next thing we know we heard a weird noise and the front door the screen door open and there was no way an open so we jumped up and when he claimed the door locked it and just\nThey're like oh my gosh somebody tried to come in\nThe next day he called me cause for good behavior he was often make calls so he called me and he says why just shut the door on me so what are you talking about he gives you tried to talk to me last night I came down and shut and we're on me at that that that I get rid of the weeds you overlook\nThings Angie grudge\nYou Angie [laughter] that's it I I Love when she shared it and what I've learned about the border over the years is that you don't you can talk to people's higher sales you can talk to people that are still alive you can talk to animals that are alive or deceased so it's a it's what it is it's really are you're communicating with their consciousness you communicate with that part of themselves that exist\nLike the higher self that exist beyond their corporate ... existence or experience and these are these other dimensions of a person so I don't want that doubt that you can do that I as I have done that myself\nAnd that one didn't have a real bad Andy do it\nYou know and I think she just pooped herself because it is kinda weird at first we started doing this and you go wow I thought that person is still alive isn't a board of the use of the deceased person will no I've learned that this board can become your cosmic phone\nI I use it as a cosmic phone like I Would have wireless phone I dial on the frequency through my intentions through my thoughts through my feelings and then I can tap into connect\nBecause I trained myself over these years to all these different things that are in and around and for me I use it for personal growth self development and helping people with the closure from Greece or just evolutionary expansion\nGene truck driving in St Louis gene go ahead\nAging or Georgia or is it like Michael ... talk to your parents with all due respect I'd like to disagree with you know they just record you know what do you say that\nWas only on the board is things that are coming out of you and you really can't buy that because as you were talking about their patent applications that people who never met this man we're able to use the board and the more shoulder you know these people have no idea who you one\nReally there was a more jealousy thing coming through the board and the man before they ever got there and you know were warned not to have communication we're spirit because it is that people will go on\nAnd living social by the ... not anything I really believe that you are going on in the end you back with evil spirits and they will continue to do that\nGo ahead of journalists react to that thanks jewel\nYeah thank you Jane I'm so listen when I'm Talking about abilities we all have a six sensibility we have the ability to be intuitive and path to gut feelings your heart feeling we'll talk about it and you're got or he had a\nHe has sneaking suspicion something was right or wrong that's the abilities and how that turns out anyone's life we often have will have dreams of prophecy will have I'm sort of like something just doesn't feel right here or gosh I've known the person for years\nIt's those things I'm Talking about when I was born people use the board on this level of using the Ford you're able to bring out your own six sensibilities\nSo these people using the tools were able to tap into that\nWeather is they're eating motor using or subconscious mind which includes these abilities of psychic abilities or medium ship or um even just tapping into just your your knowing this\nOr that can cause a spirit now I'll I'll dress the second part of that he talked about you were told not to do this often told not to do things that will keep us in control and keep us down and so what I found is we are told you have to have an intermediary to talk to spirits if they mean marry an imaginary to talk\nFine then I have a direct connection to all these beans which has been nothing about loving and beautiful so with all due respect you and I disagree with you but I think we both can have an opinion because you're going to find George that's the extreme and on the other extreme you'll find people in the middle to and that's OK\nPam's with us now in Washington

careers are welcome to the show\n... how do you like to thank you so much for having me on I Am so grateful and honored to have the opportunity to share my information\nAnd you were considered to be a good which aren't you [laughter] well\nI I Hope so [laughter]\nAs opposed to a ban which I guess but no you're you're you're an upbeat person you're you're friendly you care about people absolutely no how did this all started for you how did you get involved in witchcraft well\nYou know I started working with assignments and she is also happens to be of I I consider to be a very powerful which end\nAnd she introduced me to magic and instead of doing the work for me because you know she I feel like her healing um I ... I I feel like whatever she does with Kelly just so amazing but instead of doing\nMe and and taught me how to do it myself [laughter]\nShow I just you know I picked it up really quickly and I I mean the rest is history I feel very very confident with with what I Do you know with the spells it I've been executing so that's how I got started it was\nIt was more about healing and then that's when she just introduced me to it and now I feel like well I probably don't need a healer because I'm I'm using magic as a form of killings\nHave you ever ... along she'll but never\nAnd I want to make that very clear that I Will never ever ever cast a spell to hurt anyone um to try to bring love my way to try to win the lottery [laughter] it's not what\n... what would what good are she knows that if you can't learn anything [laughter]\nYou know I think that the power of our minds because I have discovered one thing I have discovered with magic is\nThat in my mind is more powerful than I realized\nSo I think that when we start healing on so many different levels that we will be able to tap into unlimited amounts of financial abundance and spiritual abundance so I I mean maybe at some point you know maybe I Will\nConjure up a money spell and work that\nBut right now I've just been focused on doing the um healing and I'm crossing and reversals\nWhen you talk about magic what do you what are we talking about we're not talking about David Copperfield we're talking about something oh sure absolutely\nAnd it can be used by anyone I think people you know use magic every single day with the power of their minds so when I talk about magic\nI'm simply chanting spell and when I work my rituals I chance between anywhere between one and two hours I don't just trying to say I really am wrong I really do\nI mean I think my neighbor's probably think I'm rehearsing for\nJimmy intense ... she'll get an idea what you're doing\nUm [noise] well when I exercise my house is kind of fun because you have to put on like this magical persona so all the negative negative beans leave this house like what what is it what is it I Know I Know it I Know it I'm just a little nervous storage\nNervous for talking to millions of people write\nAbout excited though I'm so when I exercise my house because I Do do a house ... every single month to keep out the entities and any you know opportunists that happened to be sure crossing by\nAnd I will say I'm negative beans leave this house never to return I cast you out I test you out I cast you out so I Will do that while I'm throwing charge salt water and the candle and every single corner of my home and really really works and then I'll ward all the windows\nYou know the the feelings and the floors and everything else so um that's fun it's really really fun and then when I when I chance spells like when I Do and crossing rituals which I think everyone should learn how to do and and do it very often\nIn a real capable of learning\n[noise] absolutely I think that we are we have become very lazy\nAnd we are we have I mean we have given our power away to not only our friends and family but to the government\nAnd it you know we just we don't want to do anything else I feel also that we've we feel very entitled we feel like everything should be given to us and so this is one of the reasons why I'm extremely grateful that my sharman didn't do the work for me\nWhile I got to tell you it is it is indeed magical when it works and isn't it\nDidn't do the work for me\nWhile I got to tell you it is it is indeed magical when it works and isn't it\nIt really is and I have not only felt results but I have seen results that actually creeps me out [laughter]\n[noise] well I got to tell your ... demons Savage U I have I have to you fight them off or do you do with them\n[laughter] yeah I Do I have a story to my ... [laughter] well it's it's not as tragic as that but I have had one experience and I I Will share that with you I Would say about Nineteen Twenty years ago and this was my first experience with a real\nLive Damon and this wasn't like a portal it was in my house and came out and you know want it to play it was actually a demon that was summing up by a very evil some federal and he sent it my way\nWhat's on but I I think it's ... is a religion and um they can either be good or bad I don't know much about this on video religion but I Do know that there are some powerful sunset or some sort of you yes on ... it's a religion okay and so they work\nWith magic and they work with the ... which are different spirit\nAnd so this ... battle had sent a intentionally of course sent a demon my way and this was after I had had her reading with them a psychic reading and of course I was so naive and I didn't know I didn't know anything about the cold or anything about metaphysics I was just you know whatever just living my life\nAnd I that same evening that same day in in the evening\nI um [noise] as soon as I turned off my light so I Can't even blame it on a train as soon as I turned off my light [noise] um I was ... down to my bed and I was terrified I didn't even know what it was because I didn't know anything about demons and um\nIt was just like\nI couldn't move so my first reaction was to play the Lord's Prayer out loud and it didn't work so I you know after a few words my job locked and I felt like I had something\nShoved into my now stay with us or commercial will come back

unreal and our website is linked up at coast to coast am dot com right now we'll get your calls in just a second with her courses so we're talking about this demonic situation and you said it wasn't going well\nAnd dot com right now we'll get your calls in just a second with her commercials or talking about his demonic situation and you should have wasn't going well what was happening\nSo I Would point I was pinned down on my bed and\nThen all of a sudden what it felt like hours of course all of a sudden I fell on my ear going up and down I don't know of as a pall over the world than most for it but it was going up and down on my left ear and so it was really really crazy so at that point it was either fight or flight and I obviously couldn't sleep because I was pen down\nSo this wave of courage just came over me and I just thought you know I ... I mean nobody knows what you're going to do in that situation so I just thought and as soon as I\nI made that adjustment in my mind ... I said I'm going to fight it felt like it just peeled off of me and at that moment with my right arm I just hung up on our and went up\nAnd I'm not kidding George I felt a hairy leg that is insane it's so crazy I didn't really tell anyone\nBut it just like it flew away obviously\nThat's a risky it is so freaky and I didn't even tell my mom because I Know she probably wouldn't believe me but I did go back to that psychic woman that look like what happened but yeah it's so freaky and I will say it never happened again after that time so I Know that this man some and that even and sent it my way but I did not sleep\nWithout the light off for about three months after that it totally terrified me it was\nWho was who is ... to demonic possession em em situations like that which I don't\nWell you know I'm not going to list does it say the obvious ones like people doing drugs or having a cocktail\nOr drunk or shine yeah\nWe're we're going to the ... the cemetery it you know and having a cocktail at midnight [laughter] but I Will say that um there is one reason I think that\nMany other were you ever to laugh you don't have a check which uh which should have a capital you\nKnow a which is actually a wise woman so [laughter] that's the definition of a witch but yeah I think you [laughter] I'm\nKind of one of the ... that's right [laughter]\nI Can't do it even if I tried 'em so one of the reasons that I think is not so obvious um but I feel that can be helpful to many for them to understand\nI'm considering we all lived thousands of lifetimes I'm and I'm Glad I haven't remembered and the other [noise] um some of these lifetime so we were not the best of people and um it's very possible that this is my theory that could be wrong but\nI have proof ... who kind of confirmed um ... you know my thoughts about this um it's very possible that some of these people these victims who are experiencing what is known as karma so they can be\nYou know harassed and molested in this lifetime with the demon the danger packed with in in a previous life time now this is the thing I think most people don't consider the people who make packs with humans in this lifetime\nOn the demon the pet is is usually for the life of the demon and that's usually a long time I mean I don't think I've ever heard of the game and die unless you like you're\nJust a moment but a little hard exactly\nThere's thousands of them so it makes sense if you think about at Georgia it makes sense that like people make a pact with the demon that that's going to be for the life of the demons and what's going to happen when we reincarnate\nAnd the demon is going to probably harass him and molest them now that's one one theory and I can say with confirmation that it's it's it's probably very true because my ... has a lot of cases it seems like it's more common these days has uh\nPermission that it's it's it's probably very true because my ... has a lot of cases it seems like it's more common these days\nHas a lot of cases of the people who are being molested harassed and just you know that possessed by demons and what she does and she's very gifted she will take a shower Monica journey into their past lives\nAnd and mail it and nine times out of ten these people have made packs\nWith demons or they were maybe a big powerful black which\nAnd you know I don't know it's it's it's different for each of them but for the most part they were doing things that they probably shouldn't have been doing and so she does is she just breaks that agreement that they can finally be free\nAnd um I think this happens to a lot of people and I think most people for those that are listening if you find yourself in the situation and you know these demons or not bothering your neighbor it's probably a good idea to contact a qualified sharman who can really just put an end to this\nOne of these dark for she wants to ... ... what do they want\nThey want our light and they want to destroy humanity\nDuty we'd also\nAbsolutely and\nI'm sadly a lot of black magicians will cast spells against people who they feel they can steal a light from and it can do this collectively with a bunch of people um and the book into us however they do it\nAnd what this does it will make their incorrect magic more potent so this is why it is extremely important is actually right now\nUm to to really really really really clear ourselves on a daily basis and do vanishing rituals prayers and and ... our homes and everything else because I I don't know I've been hearing more and more cases\nOf the demon intrusions and people's homes but also how the demonic forces can definitely um manipulate our thoughts\nLet's go to the phones for you know jumping in Redding, California started I just go ahead\nHi George how are you are good thank you hike at I'm losing my voice so I Hope you can hear me now are so good okay Hi Curtis Hi um my husband\nAnd I both slowly that I have been cursed by his ex girlfriend\nOh boy [laughter] [noise] [noise]\nIt wasn't but a year\nAfter he and I got together [laughter] than an accident occurred with me and I brought it up to him a couple months later and said\nYou know do you think the the person is because I I mean just looking out or the vice from her she was a witch but not a good way to know\nAnd ah I mean she might even our food at all but I told him I said do you think that it's possible that this person could have put a curse on me and he looked to me is set up so early\nWhile she obviously when they broke up you know doing a peaceful way that you\nKnow and actually she helped him move into his apartment it was like God open the door for me to leave my ex husband before that you know in a permit became available was perfect timing I
