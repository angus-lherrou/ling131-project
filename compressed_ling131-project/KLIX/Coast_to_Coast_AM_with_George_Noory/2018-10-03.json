biological or chemical agents\nFor two of his staff or our coastline anything about a stomach pains and laws and I think they are in a ... like um [noise] this is perhaps\nLike rice and it always seems to me [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah absolutely\nWow wow somebody needs to watch Breaking Bad or something right possibly be a bit on the right to have you visited rice and I gave you feel like you have in the blue yeah that yeah it is I mean come on [laughter] I\n... it was that glass that gave you [laughter] [laughter] [noise]\nI look at the end of Breaking Bad it's a great show anyway well lately and I thank you for that it sounds like they're doing damage control now really doesn't it\n[laughter] I guess that's what it was a I was very shocked to hear that because usually lose out of Ted Cruz's office is it is what it is yeah uh but then again I forgot that just goes to a local affiliate which is all by who knows who\nThat control but who knows her and a lawyer is going to allow their mouth is going to be choreographed will script yeah there's a lot of areas or whatever yeah Mr Cruz will never said a false inflation downstream will\nLikely out I mean it's like it's like passing a message from year to year to year to year eventually somebody says we'll put the kibosh on this idea that people would panic if we find out the cruises office was hit by rising because they don't understand rice and\nAnd all they have to do is take the time to uh talk about how rice and spread than what it does and how it's made and why it's made and and why it is not always the best thing to use the murders somebody but it does work if you give them enough of it they'll kill them it'll kill them\nSo tragically or kids or to or allowed states to set a chemical agents to murder trials us on maybe a little layer of people from a very popular a\nBio chemical agent to they're evil Dade\nProbably inexpensive and to make two good has made with castor bean so you know was\nVery it was very shape yeah reason it just it it was extremely cheap\nAlthough from what I understand or uh even though he was using the middle east at times I guess the the Middle Eastern or uses of this uh this toxin they avoid it because it doesn't always guaranteed ... basically a makes people very thick but there's always guaranteed that they went to the middle kill you\nSo yeah I mean it's badly if you ingested is deadly if it goes into your bloodstream inhaling it isn't always a a killer for you that does cause a lot of problems over you probably wish you were dead but yeah rice is one of those are the real strange chemicals biological agents who when they use it it it it's either way fifty fifty so\nAnyway for a second about what you just said in the middle east\nThey don't rely on a very much because there's a guaranteed kill right so what does that tell you that it's just a today or was perhaps it's our job is perhaps for folks that just bought a guarantee kill they just followed attention or a little shake up the right place\nIt was the domestic it was a domestic political move I can promise settle for them or I go to the domestic terrorism is taking a page out of the nine

up REX eighty four cable or ice or and garden plot and you'll know exactly what's going on\nLike All right I that's all you have to say I I'm not sure about the five other Wal Mart or stores that are closing\nAnd little news ... that's that's an old news you can talk to you talk to Alex Jones about that you want to go to it's going to ... in Texas said your name is Ellen\nSad time by how are you a fan like Iraq contact and the guy that and I found out about you that had cats and I want to talk about as far as I Do not even like killing on tests\nNo I don't follow up to a non because I made it to a I made a a decision McEwen on is a ... and that a lot of the algorithms of users and basically it's figured out how to use the algorithms\nTo actually be very accurate in movements by the White House and also in other areas because like it or not the powers of cue are smarter than they think they are in ... in Kew is paying attention and that's why you does what it does\nOkay 'cause I was just passed a law that says he said that and she refused to hand every therapy and that's the FBI and it says why justice K. level like oh\nWell I'm sure after they investigating a lot of fans like of course a there are a rumors of course that she with her father of course has ties to the CIA I mean there's all kinds of things but that doesn't necessarily negate her testimony it only makes us wonder about how the testimony\nOr is being a is being delivered and through what purpose or through other means and how the memories are are so a vivid and cabinet was aren't so vivid\nBut then again you know there are so many things about this case but just think from both sides said uh you know like I said the way it's going to the FBI is is going to make sure that all the teaser crossed the doctor or on the I's are dotted\nAnd then they'll give the report probably tomorrow or Fox News just confirmed their source said tomorrow I had heard tomorrow we even talked about this the ground zero lounge on Saturday somebody said tomorrow we have a lot of people who attend the shows that are in fact I had a guy who introduced himself to be used with a D O D\nWe we have people from all walks of life in all colors and all ah intelligence is walking in through the door when I speak at night\nSo uh we got the word that when the would be the David wrap up I've been to wrap up build they'll bring a boat like you bring a vote about as early as a a friday or Saturday and the FBI does not have to tell us anything about their investigation what they found\nI think George W. Bush is going to have a huge ... or ...\nThey say it and like oh yeah he's ...\nHe's been making calls 'cause he knows cabin audience vouch for cabinet [noise] I I think that maybe you could make a difference in Washington but as far as the court of public opinion I think that we're so for so I'm uninformed about all of it and ah and we're in our party lines are are mesmerizing us and and creating this\nThis uh this by a situation where whatever happens no one will be happy and you will certainly see probably the repercussions of this over time if not the same day or days afterwards the protests will be hat and there will be some fighting going on I'm sure\nAll all of\nUs at you I mean yeah I'm well I'm used to it I mean you've probably is al ... you're overreacting now I mean when you get on a train you know with a bunch of women wearing pink cats one morning and wondering what the hell's going on\nOr when you have to plan your day around riots or when Ron and I have to get hotel rooms in the middle of the night because the whole city smells of tear gas uh yeah you get pretty used to it and the end the bombs bursting in air\nI mean we're like on the sixth floor I mean yeah Ron can tell you the story about hamburger runs you know so here we are we're late at night were told by the boss or we're gonna have to report on the riots in downtown Portland\nAnd all the staff is hungry\nAnd I said well we can order pizza no not going to order pizza because the delivery guys won't come to the right areas so what does Ron Dewey knows if a place he does have a food cart nearby that sells burgers he goes down to get burgers these coming up and he has a whole bag of burgers with him a officer stops him and says to him what the hell you do what he says I got a talk show host\nIt's up to St Louis the cop knows who I Am because I got to get the burgers have declined the staff because they're all hungry so just what Ron walks past the cop caught fire as a flash bang into the air and an almost ... is the poor guy\nI mean here you have poor Ron you know getting everybody hamburgers means happy 'cause he's ... he's avoiding you know the the gunfire and the bombs and then some ... decide they're gonna blow something up over his head and we're right the window is like six four so whatever was shot up ... heard here so I got the the less of it but he got the most of it\nAnd so you know yeah we we're we're right in the middle of it that's why I guess you know you called the show ground zero 'cause we're right in the middle of it all when it goes down and then we see how you know the crowds act and how they react\nSo anyway ah you know be be ready for anything tomorrow and I'm not saying they're you know the world's going to blow up I'm not saying the world's going to end tomorrow or\nAsteroids looks like a skull is going to hit us no I'm not saying that I'm not declaring the world ending but what I'm saying is be prepared for anything be prepared for detours in traffic be prepared you know just be prepared to deal with anything that may come down even if that\nThat test tomorrow to Eighteen pm eastern time sends a message of hey we're in\nThe

encountered them are hitting all fours who would\nLook like a beer to me did that\n[noise] yeah but a little different or I'll give you this is this is really a strange encounter a this was called the balloon is citing the balloons citing this guy had been given a gift certificate by his new wife for his birthday for balloon right\nHe always wanted one I bet\nA he was afraid of heights and his wife didn't know it [laughter] so that [laughter]\nThat they came one day when a to meet up with this balloon is out in the field and uh he was scared out of his which split the he fought through it and they went for a ride and here's the guy\nOr to try to keep the balloon as low as possible and the guy kind of weight to them and said you let me know when you get really comfortable and he said there were about five hundred feet drifting over this uh farmland immortal and what\nIs what happens which is really a unusual they got to a point in their flight they were all the people in the ... with them by the way a it was like just him and his wife there were probably a five or six people in their [noise]\nThey got to a point where the pilot or the balloon lowered the balloon over all wooded area so that the gun ... was scraping the branches and they came down and did that and everybody was cheering and everything you know we're trying to grab belief off the tree\nThe branches and they came down and did that and everybody was cheering and everything you know we're trying to grab belief off the tree and all of this\nThen he'd lifted it back up again\nAs they made it across the next field he did it once again he lowered it down and they just moving slowly along scraping the tree up and they all started cheering now he said you'd think they won the lottery the way the people who are carrying it on and it's gone Bola [noise]\nBut here in where the big foot comes in\nWhen they're scraping over the second series of trees that was bordering a field\nBusting out at the tree line as the balloon is guided along gliding along comes this big foot he starts out walking quickly looking over his shoulder and the guy said I Swear he was looking directly at me\nEverybody said look at that and one lady snapped a picture of the thing that kept quiet and you can't control the balloon this fellow said that after this thing think took several you know very long and fish strides walking\nIt hit the deck on all fours and took off he said it looked like a racehorse at the Belmont\nRaise you see that's unusual isn't it\n[noise] well I I mean you know I've heard of this I I have a story and one of the books that cold along came a spider\nWhere these guys were hog hunting so here we go back I told you I had some accounts of a federal log on to these guys were hog hunting and they were sitting in a field or coming up on dusk\nWaiting for the wrong to come down out of the trees that were already some out in the field they were in the tall grass\nAnd the grass was sporadically patch and all the words they were clear areas and areas of high glass of grass\nWorking away around this field they sure what he described as a furry army how might\nSticking above the grass that's what they were looking at all these shows like this dome of black for they were watching this thing moving through the grass in spurts similar to like a spy to want to move quickly and stops moved quickly and stops\nFinally they catch this thing causing an opening between two patches\nAnd it's heading towards the hogs that they were looking at which we still far away when this thing came into the opening he hid it looked like at ten or twelve foot long spider on four legs with the head sticking up what they saw was the head\nIt's go read into the bushes or the or the grass on the other side making its way towards lodge\nAnd as they were watching this thing it go up and one that stood up they knew it was a big foot and this thing made a lunging leap like Superman dive on to one of the Hong ...\nSome type of quick moving in on the ground and left the field with the hog under its\nAll bizarre story William we're going to come back and take promise phone calls next on the coast to coast\nOf the perks of being a ... or is that you can participate in our twenties when we lived in sessions who or read the transcripts leader\nAnd last time we talk to you told us about China's plans to build huge solar farms which could spike silver demand we also talked about California being the first state to require new homes to have solar are there other states\nMany are in the process but the latest trend is community solar what's that [noise] that's where cities install solar panels and homeowners share the power Minnesota's doing this and if it's successful the program to the community solar expand nationwide even globally\nAnd as you report says without silver there would be no solar\nExactly that's why some experts are calling for one hundred dollar silver and according to the world silver survey demand is already exceeding supply it's starting to get excited\nKevin our listeners are passionate do you have anything you can send them so they can learn more we do

thing really looks like the real McCoy is is in Pennsylvania now in a circle Eighteen Seventy they're all just one big caught up in the ... and and the second question is you mentioned that some men that\nShot a big foot what happened after the break ... was shot why would you go down like I should have what kind of weapons is a day of who\nHe is an answer your first question no among familiar with the uh two big foot in Pennsylvania [noise] uh but I have a number of historical accounts one of them was quite an ... interesting\nUh that came from a photograph taken from a a a grandparents' house after the ... final grandparents had died\nIn which was depicted a work camp in Virginia at the time uh that was set up a after Roosevelt's had established a\nUh the protection of the parks [noise]\nUh they they needed to start making ... an access to these parks and structures so people could go in there and stay in a bathroom facilities in ranger stations so they had assembled this civilian\nCore of workers\nAnd these guys were in there basically roughing it in the wilderness\nIn these newly protected uh a wooded areas that were to become a national parks and they will regularly having encounters with what they called the hairy men are in fact the one in ... account in a one of my books called the hairy men\nOne of these things came into the camp and tried dragging wanted demand off of this caught\nAny other men attacked it throwing a handout taxes and grabbing guns shooting at the thing as it ran a out of their uh encampment\nNow the odd thing is about these things [noise] it seems that shocked on fire has almost no effect on them are in fact in one account called the pheasant hunters\nThis guy hit this thing at twenty twenty five yards with both barrels of a seven and a half lead shot and he said the thing didn't even flinch and kept running through a briar patch\nOr in answer to your second question about a big puts being shot or in my account called the bullet this guy was hunting in um I think was Idaho at any rate he came to an area or in the woods\nI was hunting in um I think was Idaho\nAt any rate he came to an area or in the woods where he was confronted with a mountains in a ridge line on three sides in front of him\nAnd he ran across what he described as a corn to taught me that sticks he said this thing did not randomly form there in fact there was nothing about this pine forests that lends itself to having missed quantity of sticks and branch bows oh bows and branches\nFormed in this type of thing any inside had about a two foot deep a layer\nOf branches as well as well for me what he thought was like betting so his initial thought was that hunters had built this thing as like a shelter when they were out there but that was shown that change on this line that he had initially seen coming into the place he was now seeing\nA dark figure standing at the ridge which started to charge in his direction down the hill\nNow he estimated that this which line was about a Fifteen hundred feet\nAbove the valley that he was standing in and he said that the ... that this thing was running down the hill was impossible for a man to do when this thing book to the base of the ridge\nHe estimated now that it was about six to nine hundred yards away from his position and at the time he was a hunting with a vintage Korean War vintage em on car being as it got closer he leveled the site on it and pumped around over its head\nThinking he would scare it it kept running he described this thing as looking like the cop in the Terminator movies when that that uh cyborg or whatever the heck they called the Terminator robot was a posing as the police officer\nAnd how he was running relentlessly with the arms pumping and like nothing could stop them\nEven load is gone fired a second round dad he was sure he hated it had no effect on them into kept running\nHe fired a third and fourth round and if things kept coming at him now was closing in he's squeeze the trigger on the fifth bullet which is why unnamed destroy the bullet and it finally dropped\nAnd when he walked up on it he got closer we shot it with another round he got even closer to he realized the thing was was not moving in that it was gone\nAnd he left it where it was now here's the thing George\nFirst of all this guy shoot this thing is self defense he's in imminent danger or this things coming at him like a bat outta hell he's shooting at this thing and the bullet seem to be having having no effect on them\nAnd yet when he's short lying on the ground he conceded that had been more to do was multiple blood patches where these bullets had actually hit it\nBut why these\nThings can ... you know we all know if you go hunting if you don't have a moose or no or deer if you don't get a good long shot or hard shot some type of solid organs shot\nThese things can run and hunters to lose their uh Corey not being able to find it because they can go for miles or you know they could just disappear on you if you don't get a good shot\nBut these creatures it seems like to me if you are going to take one of these things down it's got to be a head shot\nIt's got to be in the neck or the ... or something\nWow well I mean what are you going to do Georgia\nRhino R. by the way I've looked at the picture of that Eighteen seventies syriza Bigfoot\nOr they didn't have photo shop in those days you very very intriguing picture\nThey got a couple of these are old hunters with the big flood or they're holding him up or he's obviously dead but it's huge

great program for you tonight Steve ... and informative engaging speaker delivering compelling provocative programs\nTo businesses universities diverse organizations he's an independent scholar researcher futurist in the fields of energy and environmental policy as well as a former engineer and business executive with thirty plus years of experience in fortune one hundred and private companies\nHe's the executive director of the climate science coalition of America which is an independent non political association of scientists and concerned citizens\nFocusing on informing all of us about the realities of climate science and energy economics his book outside the green box\nIs in my hand right now Steve all come to the program good to have you with us\nOh very good night to George and great to join you\nI was just mentioning climate week with just wrapped up in New York now and what do they do anyway [noise]\nWell they they had a lot of people there are a lot of dignitaries their goals from the website where that they were run it to a race ambition reduce climate change and accelerate climate action or some big notable Tony Blair former prime minister England spoke bond Ki moon from the United nations\nUm actor Hugh Jackman\nA whole the rain man\nOver in spoken are so quite a quite a bit group also a big public relations steel claim a five hundred and thirty five million people were reached and three hundred and news articles written\nSo a a kind of an interesting thing but uh I Would uh and and a lot of folks there I think believe that if they change a light bulbs they can save polar bears\n... if we all drive electric cars we can stop the oceans from rising and if we build a wind turbine towers we can make the storms less frequent and less severe and George we live in a in a modern age of superstition or there's really no empirical evidence to support those sorts of beliefs\nSo they are definitely man made global warming proponents aren't they they are well I have never been a fan of that because you know I I think one Steven I think you agree more polluting the planet there's no question about that and we need to fix that\nAs ... million to fix that's\nCorrect I don't think the pollution is causing what they say man made climate change I think we're in solar cycles a I think this this planet or has been warmer during the dinosaur days and we didn't have cars and all the carbons in the atmosphere and anything like that\nAre at least for periods of the last ten thousand years when it was warmer matter of fact it was about two to three degrees Celsius\nA geologist eight thousand years ago when we've been gently cooling since then although the temperatures go up and they go down and ah you know the other thing about pollution as you say we were so many people are conflate ing with a cold real air pollution that can harm people or harm the environment\nAnd things like carbon monoxide nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide mercury particulates with carbon dioxide which is a voter lists harmless invisible gas\nAnd when I speak to groups I like to say to them what to cannabis growers know that the climate scientists apparently don't know\nWhy do you believe there are so many moons man made climate change\n[noise] well it it's a bit of a long story back in Nineteen eighty eight Dr James Hansen of NASA came and testified before Congress and they it was on a very hot summer day and he said he was Ninety nine percent sure\nThat the earth was warming in humans were causing as he was a computer model or and or within a year and a half the United nations form the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change\nAnd just three years later we had forty one nations and the European Community signed a treaty saying they would reduce greenhouse gases\nSo in my opinion of the first thing is that the the world kind of jump to conclusions quickly on this but uh you know for the last uh the thirty years or so\nThe computer models have been predicting very fast warming and we haven't seen it a temperatures have warmed just a little storms are stronger the polar bears are doing fine\nAnd then the second factor though is I think a much of this is being driven forward by momentum by money uh we have a wind and solar and biofuel industries we have dean says sustainability at the university's vice president sustainability corporations\nAnd there are over there is over two hundred fifty billion dollars a year spent every year\nOn renewables to try and stop the planet from a warming so the first is the world jumped to a conclusion second is there's there's just a huge amount of money momentum behind all of this\nAmazing what's been going on lately the last couple of days I've been talking about here's one or two degrees affecting everything what's going on with that\nWell you know that is really remarkable to I uh Jay Inslee a governor of Washington state just to post an article on CNN quote how to show Trump you care about climate change\nAnd he's made statements saying that the forests are a lot warmer and that's why we're we're seeing these forest fires well we've had one degree of warming in the last hundred and Thirty years one degree\nYet and I think it came from the sun well I Do too\nBut that come straight from the climate research unit at staying in England they the number one authority on this one degree so so in the last decade maybe we've had a tenth of a degree in ... in Washington for a son to say that all these forest fires that caused by a tenth of a degree change I mean that just doesn't make any sense\nSo people need to get a little perspective there's probably other bigger factors at work um the way we take care of our forests ah for example\nAre you concerned Steve that we're headed down the wrong direction here with climate change\nOh absolutely this is a tremendous miss allocation of resources as you say there are there are major pollution issues to be solved\nToday eighty percent of the world's wastewater is discharged untreated into lakes rivers and streams the ocean if you remember a few years ago and Brazil the swimmers didn't want to swimming in the water\nBelieve in the first water treatment plants down in Brazil so that's a real problem we need to solve we have two billion people trying to live on to US dollars a day one point two billion don't have\nA a electricity we have two point five billion without proper sanitation millions die from disease yet we're spending all this money to try and keep the planet from warming and the bottom line is the planet is dominated by natural factors as you say oceans whether driven by the sun\nIt's unlikely that we're going to be able to make a measurable difference with all the things they're doing in California and everywhere else on global temperatures\nThere's no question that the you know the the the groups that are pro or con what's happening with climate change keep butting heads\nBut I'm beginning to see at least more scientists beginning to feel the way you do that we're dealing with a different kind of climate change\n[noise] well if you again if you look at ... at any of the well any of the uh the predictions about climate change and you see a lot of articles he saw articles written about uh\nUm what was Hurricane Florence mhm and last year we had a couple of major hurricanes ah we had Harvey hit Texas\nAh we had another one hit I think it was Irma hit Florida [noise]\nBut if you look back at history this has happened before we've had a twelve years since Nineteen hundred when two or more major hurricanes have made landfall in the United states and these are this is really nothing new\nA hundred and Seventy hurricanes made landfall during the twentieth century\nOther and and if you look at the actual evidence you don't see this storms are either getting more frequent are stronger\nOr the U.S government also has data on a droughts and floods if you look for the lower forty eight states over the last hundred years there's no indication we're seeing more floods are more droughts we have more droughts in the Nineteen thirties [noise] we have three times the polar bears that we had a uh in Nineteen sixty\nSo the dire consequences are just not occurring as people are predicting and people still write these articles but they never showed data comparing the past to the president\nWhen we come back let's talk specifically about your new book outside the green box Steve ... linked up the coast to coast team dot com I spell it for you first name Steve G. O. R. E. H. A. M. dot ... dot com\n... the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available Rawhide bone in now enjoyed ... on demand anywhere anytime good acoustic ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast will take your calls next hour regardless of your thoughts on whether those global warming and climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box told me about the title first of all\nSure well that's a ... this is a book or that tells you what's your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and um one popular business a phrase years over and over and think outside the box so the title was think outside the green box\nBecause businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxer sustainable development there they are forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment and so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse\nA which are overpopulation the idea that humans are growing too fast and and are populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nOf the third is climate destruction uh and the fourth is a resource depletion\nThose for fears are really at the basis of all of a our state and federal laws about energy I'm a and they're taught in the universities and taught in a high schools\nBut if you look at the actual trends you find out that none of those really is a significant problem they've all been exaggerated to a very very big extent so\nI discuss the Fort Worth more than that I talk about what happens in is happening in different industries\nOr energy materials agriculture or et cetera but it's a fun to read it say a color paperback and a fellow at of course I'd bars and a lot of great quotes and also but uh\nEight hundred notes on the back so people can go deeper by the way for its size it's a heavy book [laughter] well I don't know about that but in lots of reasons for legal put it that way also hired a cartoonist got a nice\nThe blocked [laughter] well I don't know about that but they're not in the ... you know put it that way also hired a cartoonist got a nice cartoon at the front of every chapter which kinda summarizes some stuff in the chapter so it's a good read\nMore with climate change with what's happening I'm a I'm told that the United states today is the world's largest oil producer again have you on\nYeah that happened last uh last month or so we passed up Russia we had passed Saudi Arabia about four or five months ago amazed that could be temporary because Saudi Arabia's ... talking about turning out a lot of ... additional oil production but\nUh we're growing very fast the miracle of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has turned the U.S into the world's energy powerhouse [noise]\nAnd ah yeah we're the biggest producer of crude no\nNo I Believe in Thomas schools theory of abiotic oil that the planet is God in abundance of oil which was natural when the planet was formed it's not just made up of dinosaurs in plants\nI tend to think that way to a matter of fact the Russians have said that for a long time but we know natural gas can be created\nBy all sorts of things including a you know camels and horses and cows and everything else and and many people think deep within the earth of the earth also produces a materials like gas and other things I saw I think there's probably a combination of\nOf something that is fossilized fuel but the others others that do come up from the ... of the earth I Do believe that so I I Try not to use the phrase the phrase fossil fuels I like to use that come into the hydrocarbons instead\nPoint on who you know one of my simple theories on why the abiotic theory is the probable theory is because most of the oil that has pumped on this planet each way way down there oh yeah I'd like Lance dead animals get down there\nThey're finding now below twenty thousand feet of rock yeah some of these very deep wells they find oil and you got to kind of wonder the other thing is that a lot of it has been you know found in the polar regions too and in those regions tend not to have as much a plant life but\nI Know we have shipped shifting of the polls and other things that can occur but yeah I I Do think it's a\nIt probably is a combination of factors and maybe it is being produced down down in the ... of the earth what\nIs the argument about overpopulation and then it's a major problem for all of us yeah so\nNineteen fifty um we had this huge population growth rate or across the world and up and until\nIt got up to be about a three percent per year by Nineteen Seventy ... the big reason for that was we had declining um infant mortality had declining death rates as we solved all these disease problems\nAnd so bunch of people like Paul Ehrlich of population bomb fame said that hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death and the Nineteen seventies the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nBut they didn't uh first we had a global agricultural revolution and even though population grew to seven billion at it more than doubled or by two thousand and five we had triple the agricultural output\nBut the other thing nobody else saw is that the fertility rates have been dropping the fertility rate is a number of of ah children a woman will have in her lifetime and back in Nineteen fifty for the world each woman on average is having five children during her lifetime well today that has dropped down to two and a half\nThat's a drop in half and the reason is we have a society moving from an agricultural into a industrial and then a technological a sort of a state we have more women entering the worst workforce there waiting to have children they're having smaller families [noise]\nIt all occurred and the great news is that uh we're probably going to get the global zero population growth within about fifty or seven years and so we're getting to a soft landing on on the population issue\nAnd the benefit yesterday Steve in downtown Los Angeles or the red cross and our affiliates can't fly and as we were driving to get to the venue [noise] ah I saw things that I haven't seen in years you know because I spend a lot of time in St Louis\nI saw so many homeless people living in tents on the side of the room with more garbage in June strength strewn all over the place\nWhere his dad was in California in Los Angeles yeah I mean I'm looking at is\nHomeless people in in in the county of Los Angeles there are so that really is a tough situation\nWould you would you call wasted dumped everywhere or pollution [noise]\nUh it certainly is that it certainly is a litter problem as a minimum but yeah probably pollution you know the other thing though that if I might if I might comment the government of California keeps making housing more expensive you know you now have to every new residents has to have solar cells and I understand there they're going to want everything to have a electric car plug in\nSo you just had about twenty thousand dollars to the price of every home every residents of California does isn't really going to help the problem\nNo you're absolutely right more would you recommend that people start doing personally to combat the situation\n[noise] ... ... people and businesses or you know actually a waste is actually a pretty good news problem as far as what's going into land fills a vet piqued about Nineteen Ninety in the United States Senate is now starting to trend down\nWe're doing more recycling um but uh businesses need to reduce real pollutants that we touched on before I'm ... so for dioxide particulates et cetera\nAre not carbon dioxide um so uh the the efforts to reduce that really I mean again carbon dioxide\nIs what they're pumping into greenhouses in California to make their cannabis crop grow a bigger and faster it's plant food that's right or the idea that ah that CEO to as harmful is crazy and and people always show you these\nPictures that where you have this dirty looking air over China if you can see the error that's not causing global warming all of the major global warming gases a greenhouse gases number one is water vapor but it's the biggest greenhouse gas to his carbon dioxide three has a methane those are all invisible\nSo if you can if you can see the air you gotta clean that up but the greenhouse gases are are really not causing air pollution or so we need we need to get our our uh aims at the real pollutants air and water and and quit trying to stop the planet from warming\nSteve you've talked about in upheaval coming in energy and climate regulations what what kinds of people is this\nYeah well we've had a ... a basically a rate payer revolts now in Australia just this last summer in Australia um we had a a Scott Morris and take over as the\nUh\nThe new uh ... minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull was turned out and leading the opposition was former prime minister Tony Abbott who is called for withdraw from the Paris accords [noise]\nUm the prime minister Morrison says is number one priority is to reduce power prices while we keep the lights on wait a similar thing up and Ontario by the way both Australia and Ontario electric\nDoubled at the last ten years up in Ontario a premier dug for took over and within a month he had cancelled more than a hundred wind and solar contracts they eliminated I'm a ... the fourteen thousand dollar Canadian electric car credits\nAnd now we have five provinces opposing the Canadian carbon tax that California has said so we've got to write a paper revolts going on in California says they want to be a hundred percent renewable from the power plants\nMaybe it's a face maybe he just doesn't like smiling maybe he has autism and we can definitely do something to help\n... maybe it was all you need to find out more about autism no big joy both smiles by six months is one early sign learned the others that autism speaks dot org slash

you're right indirectly it is\nBut uh they're working other other places where we can inject water all all day it's that's a really a problem to be solved by geologist or they need to tell us where we can safely inject water where we can't and then uh and then will reduce the possibility of quakes\nSure possibility Steve that this entire planet should just have some horrendous catastrophe that

what we do with the sea level rise we've been doing that for a thousands of years uh there's really no evidence that we can control the climate we can do something locally with temperatures and

is\nAnd bringing up these these arguments that you do\nIt means nothing there's [laughter]\nIt it it's a boom warming is a very sexy position\nBecause people feel smart and that if I just you know say my balls or do whatever I'll say the planet and [laughter]\nI'm sure you've heard of before but a big thing that I Love to bring up in this totally discredited I liked Mr Gura to address this or the Ninety thousand cargo ships at sea they're pumping [noise]\nSulfur [laughter] to the era that must have a profound effect on 'em\nWell there is there there is an issue right now I'm cargo ships use fairly high sulfur fuel fairly for dirty fuel\nUm and I think the uh I Can't remember which organization is but the but the international organization I shipping\nHas actually agreed to uh go move to some different a lower so for fuel types and a lot of folks in the industry think that is going to be a problem it's probably a good step though so I'm\nGenerally in favor of moving to lower so for fuel overtime [noise] um there's a lot of people also talking about cutting greenhouse gases from ship so ... primarily carbon dioxide I think that probably is not such a good idea\nBut that is one of those real real ... to clean up we also need to do a little ah improve uh the problem with the litter of plastic and the oceans that's another issue\nThat we need to work out and I learned as Asian was the international maritime organization thank you that's [laughter]\nThat's it and they're they're predicting that the the increase is going to be huge or in the next several years by twenty fifty if no action is taken increased by up to two hundred and fifty percent that's a big jump the sulfur yeah [noise]\nUh possibly so yeah I I couldn't really comment on that but I think so I think that's

would be great but Steven they're going to want to make money on this some aren't they\nI mean one of the great points that I talk about it and the uh the second chapter of outside the green boxes the rise of democracy\nOr the United states basically was the first modern democracy now we have uh just about I think it's almost Ninety ... instead of ... that have a form of democratic government so it's going from zero to Ninety nations\nAnd with that you know we get the benefits of legal equality and freedom of speech religion rule of law lemonade show slavery\nWomen's suffrage personal property rights a lot of other things so the world is getting freer oh that's a very positive thing and it's all part of this idea that everybody is better off there's a lot of people going around saying the world's gonna collapse and we've got overpopulation we've got pollution we read all these terrible things\nBut people are healthier lives and and one aspect of that is the rise of democracy\n... what do we do with people's cars this to me is one of the most heartbreaking situations people who cannot afford\nElectricity or their gas or let's say the dead of winter and it's going to get shut off because they can't afford it what do we do with those kinds of folks I mean it's it's sad\nYeah that's a tough situation actually United States is in better shape than many European places because uh we have very low costs electricity um\nA price us here in the United states I often put up a graph comparing Europe almost all the ... the nations in Europe have higher or electricity prices and we have here in the United states we have the lowest cost natural gas in the world\nAre right now we're the biggest petroleum ... producer\nSo we should we said though that nobody nobody gets shut off during implement weather or can we say that\nI Am not going to get into that I Do think many of the the uh the utilities have that sort of policy that they're either not allowed to do that by law they have a policy where they're not going to do that during incremental\nAnd they tend to postpone things in the summer I think\nHold on steep we've got a break we'll come

question that most people want answered\nWell um there are many um\n[noise] you know I speak a lot to businesses and one of the things I I run across as they they tell me you're preaching to the choir [laughter] yeah but the funny thing is though they don't realize that the majority of us business thinks that the climate laws and the energy laws are foolish in many ways\nThe headlines or grab by a lot of the big companies like apple and Google and uh the political leaders but but the kind of the rank and file of of American business um thinks a little bit different but they don't realize that they're in the majority are so it's a little bit of a strange situation\n[noise] um [noise]\nLet's see what are some of the other major questions why why are all the climate models wrong is some is uh something that people come up with and that has to do with some of the assumptions\nUm are they concerned about anything\nWell they you know back in Nineteen Ninety the uh United Nations and the inter governmental panel on climate change predicted that a temperatures would rise three tenths of a degree Celsius per decade\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on climate change predicted that ah temperatures would rise three tenths of a degree Celsius per decade or with a mix of five tense and low of too tense and if you put those on the church\nThose rice pretty fast but over the last Thirty years we we fed much less than that so we're\nWe're below the estimates of the United nations that they made in Nineteen Ninety we're not seeing me the rice that was forecasted which basically says the assumptions of the climate models are wrong and natural factors dominate global temperatures\nLet's go to Joe in Long Island New York to the Rockies who had\nA state of interesting show uh actually I Want climate change I wanted to be warmer but I Want to call us students\nA and a comment a got a quick uh my first question what they are we just had a and in fact in Indonesia unfortunately and they said that they weren't really warned\nThat there was supposed to be a week and that was working with the people could have it all of this thing\nSo I I relate this to a ocean temperatures how well monitored ocean temperatures and the satellites come into play with anything to do with that my second question would be\nA political climate you know I always talk about the last couple of weeks twenty four seven as the uh you know Brett Kavanaugh are in his shoes and a and a\n... you know it does make me think that the senators\nDon't have time to study science neither or the interest and I really don't have a good grasp of science maybe they took along course thirty forty fifty years ago and science and never really updated themselves on their own\nUh and uh you know I don't want to pick on trial but he's already gotten blamed for the recent hurricane or in the Washington Post and then my comment would be uh you said the nuclear ... or a industry uh was traditional\nAnd I think it's a like a lot of people a potential disaster waiting to happen and I know it doesn't contribute to climate a big ... CEO to if you look at Chernobyl\nThat's still only buried at still active it's none of that contained nobody can go within fifty miles of the place all these years later\nSo uh you take New York for example you've got to the point right now and I'm a this big metro area or if something happened with that then what happens in New York City\nSo you got a whole bunch of things that are I think there were three of them one was what are we doing with ocean temperature measurements the uh the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has I think they're the ones who put out these diving\nUm a measuring devices I forget the name of them again but they have thousands of 'em out there now but\nUh they've only been deployed for about a twelve to Fifteen Years so we really only have data on ocean temperatures are from measurements uh over the last twelve to Fifteen Years before that it was just you know people take 'em and ships and kind of measurements are going around and those were very accurate\nThe um the thing you said about uh uh what's um let's see ... the third one was the nuclear plants I think one of the big issues with nuclear plants that they need need to solve its I Need to be able to shut down automatically\nWe still have plants so most of the ones that around the world that are relying on cooling systems in the cooling systems fail fail like happened with the Saddam in Japan and then we have a chance for\nProblem needs to be solved um the other big problem with nuclear is is just frankly natural gas is so darn cheap right now nobody will build a nuclear plant and I think the third one was um\nSatellites well you said something about governments and what's your question after reading too I I think you know ... or undefeated about\nFive times in the U.S Congress I think the majority of er and arguably more than half of the United states so members of Congress right now do not think global warming is a dangerous problem out most of those around the Republican side of course\nAnd as I mentioned we have we have we now have a climate revolt so if you will in Australia and Ontario so I think I think political leaders are starting to get it uh this has been a disaster crisis for more than Twenty years now and we're really not seeing the disaster so\nI'm hopefully I've covered most of your issues\nI think she's the biggest problem we've got as an ex learned from the sun that could wipe out our power grid in a rigorous useless forever that\nThat's possible probably a big explosion there again if the if all those ... go off in Antarctica and built a big bunch of ... the south of the of the peninsula down there that could be there's just many many things that could occur\nUm again we need to adapt as well we can and the biggest one is an ice age boy I like this warm weather folks I Do not want to see the start of the studies that\nWe've got we've got a guest Robert Felix who believes were in the early stage of an ice age\n... who knows Walter in Pennsylvania taken away well go ahead\nBy Georgia needless to say great to talk to you once again George\nThank you Walter\nGeorge junior up with all due respect Mr Gore on sounds a lot like a\nDr Kim ball ... George with all due respect to most of them I don't think that Dr Paul Ehrlich has been discredited though I think George I think it's just common sense\nThat the human population on this planet cannot increase out in the NIH them now\nGeorge we share this planet with myriad other species are not modern agriculture I may have a lot of kid a\nMan on the ancient a bane of all of them but a modern agriculture consumes much natural habitat in Africa the human population is driving Diyala he thought station just as in this country are\nYou know we have large in eradicated the great a herd of buffalo bites and\nOh so you know naturally you you couldn't have twenty million\nA great\nWhy shouldn't hers that used to be twenty million in a hurry you couldn't add them or they would be compatible with the agriculture wind up by some horribly wrong rehab law expansion fields of corn and soybeans in week so uh\nYou know I I just think it's common sense that the human population a decrease in them\nWell there comes a point Steve is they're not that you know you can't have a population of twenty billion people on the planet\nNo you can't and and you make good points well but the the the uh predictions are now that we're going to level of about ten and a half billion there is no doubt that we've radically transform the surface of the earth\nUh we're certainly have done that and taking over large portions of it and I think with sixty million bikes and at one time estimates are those days are gone there are some good news there are some good it was by the way Dr Ehrlich of one set of ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "03"}
