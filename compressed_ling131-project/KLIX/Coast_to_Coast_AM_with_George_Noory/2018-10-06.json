back into ... want to talk about the dream state what can be conjured up that way\nBut when someone puts a curse on an individual mhm does the individual what happens to them to do they feel something did they see I think\nIndividual mhm does the individual what happens to them do they feel something do they see I think some would put a curse on me\nWell when things start going bad and you don't feel good or your relationships go down to two were you lose your job and you can find a job um then they start thinking that's when you hear on the born loser I must have a cloud over my head [noise] uh if I didn't have bad luck I wouldn't have any luck\nAnd people don't realize that especially if everything was going fine in their life or normal in their life and everything starts going down the tubes and eventually they figure it out or they go to somebody or somebody that they know go\nShe but ... look for the last year what the heck's wrong when you then you start thinking about it and like I said it you know what nobody has to live like that you don't have to be a martyr do something about it have it removed\nIt's not hard to do you can do it\nAnd as long as you know ... actually if a person doesn't even believe they have a curse on them and I tell them that they do sit down in front of me I'll take this off of you they don't even have to believe it all they had to do is give me their permission\nMy grand daughter got a promotion where she was working and uh apparently she got a promotion over somebody who saw they were entitled to that job yet and she did it fair and square or you know decent and everything is great girl\nAnd but strange things started happening to her I mean things that would always go well things were really kind of screwed up and she called me up one day it's a papa\n... I think somebody put a curse on me and and I said already let's let's think about this for a moment ... who would want to do this to you or I mean you're good fun Persian you're nice person you don't hurt anybody\nAnd we started talking and she mentioned the promotion and she mentioned some people that they gave her the job over and I want a horse and I should\nOf a couple of these people is there one there that you would think would be capable of that and she said yes and sure enough it ended up being a person of who apologized and took the curse off apparently and everything's fine\nBut or stop sending negative energy to hurry they'll have war off ...\nSo my question is when someone does get hit by a Kurdish mhm how easy is it for that person to try to distinguish who put the curse on them\n[noise] that's a little bit harder and the main questions that I ask when I'm actually doing the removal is\nUm [noise] did you take somebody away from their spouse in other words that you have an affair with a married person believe you me a woman you know ... you get a man gets angry at somebody and they're going to find somebody in the nose\nA woman gets angry at somebody ... women meaner than men she's gonna curse that person and because she was hurt more ways than one and the job thing is exactly right you can't believe how often that happens\nAnd and but the bottom line is this who cares who did it just get it off\nHow do you get it off can you do it yourself you have to call Murray and when ... how do you get it off\nNo you can't remove it yourself but you can have a friend do it for you and again they don't have to believe that they just have to go through the ritual and\nSelf but you can have a friend do it for you and again they don't have to believe that they just have

because once the curses removed that doesn't necessarily stop the person that was putting it on they're not going to know it's off\nThe end there's so many different kinds of curses I mean there's one that that may be has to be do something at a every full moon or generational curses they just automatically go with generation to generation like the Kennedys you have to know they were cursed\nAnd so there's all kinds of different kinds but once it's removed most people as long as they you know I give him that Quincy to carry as long as they have that they never have to have a curse removed off of them again it does not affect\nThem as a matter of fact think about it ballplayers let's use um baseball players for instance\nOkay there's a game between the Cleveland Indians and maybe New York\nAnd so all the fans and the Cleveland Stadium every time there best hitter gets up the whole stadium is going to lose you jerk don't hit the ball given out and then they clap as he does its negative energy thrown on that person's\nOh yeah absolutely and that's why the home team has an advantage\nChats exactly right but that doesn't mean when they get on their playing to leave Cleveland that he left the negative energy here\nIt's going with him it's gonna be added on every other stadium that is not his home stadium so and that's why I Do so many ballplayers all kinds of all players\nWill her ballplayers in a slump let's say in his early\nGood a slump or they just you know they don't feel good they're out of sorts they're tired all the time\nAnd the other thing too it's especially

week I had a couple of incidents that are about the strangest thing for them fairly are saying wow\nStarted last Sunday I was sitting in the yard getting Sun Valley for an afternoon for little boys ten or twelve\nCome down to LA and that's it goes to a breast information to them in front two in the back right seconds later there's only one little boy on by Syrian who were the other ones go they disappeared into thin air and I was not drinking I did not drink\nThey just disappeared\nYes and I fear the second person out of town and then the other day or two later\nI think they did read it in their house\nDead rats gee yes and he died from extreme trauma he smashed flat\nIt's they sent they stop game and there's rat sir Yes sir his just flown all over the place in the house in the house and he died from the most extreme trauma\nWho is well who would have squashed him\nOver the place in the house in the ... the data from the most extreme trauma\nWho ... who would have squashed him\nI Can't I I don't know charge and less for thick and the cat uh\nYou know a cat wouldn't have squashed rap like that I just don't get it maybe it was like an algorithm may be started out with a cat slip than raw flipped out for a minute and I can't might have flip the field and\nHe would have taken him with him though I just don't get this weird\nAny you got some strange things happening over there\nYes it has been for a long time in the foot stepped up stairs in the air when all three of us mama grandma and me all sitting here and we all heard the steps of stairs\nWhile you know a lot of people hear footsteps like that strange things Tom thinks is houses hearted he says he hear stuff that will go there and in Frankfurt Kentucky used to the Rockies I Am\nI'm I joined Murkowski and I'm gonna say that even though I Know judge Kavanaugh was going to be on the court okay\nProbably outlined though\nI Am I Believe he well and I'm going to make a deal with them [noise] I saw a lot of misrepresentation and deception on both sides\nAnd he was there and joined in on some of that and manipulation\nAnd therefore I'm hoping that he will do what king Solomon dead and pray for wisdom and learn to love the truth so much that he could never\nJoined in any kind of manipulation of the truth he will learn to love the truth so much that maybe some day he'll be as great a justice on the court as judge Judy could be\nAn interesting take 'em all of that would you vote for him\nI Would have to do they do like Murkowski I he's not ready he might he might someday be the greatest judging we ever had on the Supreme\nMay he may end up with that indeed\nHe might do that as well because uh he's been through a lot\nBut some voters Saturday we'll find out tomorrow what's going on a Sunday night I'll be doing the program and we've got Dr John Curtis and Howard Bloom reacting in our news segment that's not the show when did our new segment to whatever happens or Saturday\nAnd we'll see what happens but the the odds are that he will probably get nominated to the Supreme Court and then we'll be voted on and accepted these already nominated\nBut the the odds are that um he'll be voted

want to say I was listening earlier and I was just wanting to say um [noise] we just need to really mellow out\n[laughter] when they really do there's there's just\nSo much a negativity and so much pressure in the culture right now that I I think it's just feeding this kind of\nMass anxiety and um maybe that's part of what what um you know I'll be talking about tonight with with the tower oh because uh\nUh tools like a heroin cards or believe it or not [laughter]\nI'm a very very helpful for remembering who we are and [noise] um letting go of all of the [noise]\nThe leash and programming constructions and opinions and a cultural biases and all of that it's it's a way of suspending all of that stuff [noise] and taking a deep breath [noise]\nTrue biases and all of that it's it's a way of suspending all of that stuff and taking a deep breath and receiving um\nThrough images through pictures that come to us from a really a mysterious place nobody knows the origin of the tower of cards tell you the truth we know some things about it\nIt ultimately the child is a mystery we know that it it it descends from ancient mystery schools and a ancient wisdom that it has been called the perennial philosophy [noise]\nUm but there is something I'm universally relevant for everyone in the ...\nHow far back as we've been able to track the terrible\nUh Thirteen Ninety I Believe is the earliest evidence\nOr fourteen twenty is the first full deck that we know about in the accounting and renaissance\nBut no one knows who the first desire was actually ... I I really like that I think it's part of what Cairo is ultimately it's it comes from the human imagination\nMaybe it was given to us from Bob song\nUh from above or from beyond or below [laughter]\nBelow or within and you know I'm a union psychologist so ah we've then is to place that I look\nLet's explain to her all the people who probably knew what it looks like but they might not know exactly what it is\n[noise] um it's a tool for self exploration it comes out of the Italian Renaissance um it's not it was not bought a to Europe by the gypsies as is often miss misinformed\nOr actually the gypsies chain quite a bit after the first tarot decks uh started to emerge ah in Italy and Spain um other places in Europe uh\nIt is a deck of cards um and uh in in some ways it's it's not clear which came first the playing cards at the terrible cards and actually if you think of a standard set of playing cards that is equivalent roughly to what's called\nThe minor are ... of the ...\nThe ... has an additional twenty two cards that is called the major are coming up and these are the cards um that people commonly uh think of when they think of tarot cards you know they have they have the magician\nRyan old card and a full and wheel of fortune and things like\nThat and that's your favorite car George yes it is [laughter] see her because of fascinated by it I Know I Know you are\nAnd it is it is an extremely a beautiful cards and the jets card as is the devil card\nAnd the tower ... usually three cards which people think are the most uh uncomfortable cards at the major are coming up but every card in the Cairo deck has a positive and negative aspect\nI'm In the modern tarot which is really my forte um has really moved since uh you know ... it can vary a cult oriented in the uh nineteenth\nTwentieth century in England with the er the society of the Golden Dawn and that's where the modern Cairo were really was birds with the weight jak or the Arthur wait\n... the writer weight tarot and what what uh what happened then was very exciting in the world of gyros that\nFor the first time the minor are caught I which are like playing cards a deck of playing cards each one of the tips or the miners are we're finally illustrated with rich\nDynamic pictures that tell a story before that time only the majors only the pardon the expression Trump Card\nMhm where we're going to talk about that yes only right\nBut I'm only those had pictures that you could actually just look at directly and\nUh get an impression of any kind of just kind of sense of what was going on there the miners before or the twentieth century um his head geometric design so if they're forced suits you know like my heart's clubs diamonds and what's the other one\nUh each\nRight those are equivalent to the Cairo the terrorists shoots of\nA cops sir words tentacles ... lawns and all of those minor cards she's had geometric shapes on 'em so if it was a seven of cops\nThere would be a just a picture of seven challenges on it say and that's all you had to go by now there is a very rich and dynamic a image that goes with the meaning of that card and\nUh there are probably six or seven hundred ... a new and different tarot deck today out on the market\nBut they all pretty much followed this the basic tarot convention so that it doesn't really matter which jak you're using and some are very out there even my jak is pretty out there\nYou are oh denying you came up with your own new\nYes correct um but it's the same architect so you know a card is in the car has an image and the idea is that with an archetype an archetype is virtually any exhaust the ball but\nIt's only known through an image tour archetype ... image\nShow or like Joseph cambell wrote a great book called the ah what is it called the uh uh ten thousand names of\nThe uh I Can't even remember what book I'm referring to put the idea is slate George\nA lawyer is late [laughter] I Love it though [laughter]\nBut the the idea is that uh every archetype let's say the cherry it uh where are the hero here with a thousand with the housing faces with whatever the name of that book is\nCan be a illustrated and many many ways you know one image that describes an archetype so that lends itself to artistic interpretation so\n... is also a richly interesting a visual art and different tarot decks emphasize different aspects of the archetype\nBut it's the same parka type or it's the same a principal I'm In ... when we talk about the archetypes I'm In a union since\nI'm we're with terror alerts\nThe types and these are called what you call you on the great a Swiss you know psychologists and philosopher center called the archetypes of transformation\nEuro with a thousand pieces that's thank you I think that was\nUm [noise] but it's it's the archetypes of transformation is what the major are kind of the ...\nThat means these are the images are the archetypes that are all about spiritual transformation\nAnd are not in a religious sense but more in a sense of um the uh the destiny of the human being the completion or the holiness of\nSocial Security benefits and additional

I think somebody put a curse on me and and I said Ari let's let's think about this for a moment ... who would want to do this to you or I mean you're good fun person you're nice person you don't hurt anybody\nAnd we started talking and she mentioned the promotion and she mentioned some people that they gave her the job over and I want a Hamas and I said\nOf a couple of these people is there one there that you would think would be capable of that and she said yes and sure enough it ended up being a person of whom apologized and took the curse off apparently and everything's fine\nOr stop sending negative energy to hurry they'll have war off ...\nSo my question is when someone does get hit by a Kurdish mhm how easy is it for that person to try to distinguish who put the curse on them\nThat's a little bit harder and the main questions that I ask when I'm actually doing the removal is\nUm [noise] did you take somebody away from their spouse in other words that you have an affair with a married person believe you me a woman you know ... you get a man gets angry at somebody and they're going to put somebody in the nose\nA woman gets angry at somebody ... women meaner than men she's gonna curse that person and because she was hurting\nIs angry at somebody women meaner than men she's gonna curse that person and because she was hurt more ways than one and the job thing is exactly right you can't believe how often that happens\nAnd but the bottom line is this who cares who did it just get it off\nHow do you get it off can you do it yourself you have to call Murray and when ... how do you get at all\nNope you can't remove it yourself but you can have a friend do it for you and again they don't have to believe that they just have to go through the ritual and and when do speak the whole last chapters how to remove negative energy anybody can do it you just can't do it to yourself\nUse every body susceptible to curse what about someone who's got so much energy and positivity and they put up the force field to block it and she'll look\nNo unfortunately the only thing that I personally know that his work forever because once the curses removed that doesn't necessarily stop the person that was putting it on they're not going to know it's off\nThe end there's so many different kinds of curses I mean there's one that that may be has to be do something at a every full moon or generational curses stages automatically go with generation to generation like the Kennedys you have to know they were cursed\nAnd so there's all kinds of different kinds but once it's removed most people as long as they you know I give him that Quincy to carry as long as they have that they never have to have a curse removed off of them again it does not affect\nThem as a matter of fact I think about and ballplayers let's use um baseball players for instance\nOkay there's a game between the Cleveland Indians and maybe New York\nAnd so all the fans and the Cleveland Stadium every time they're ... gets up the whole stadium is going to lose you jerk don't hit the ball given out and then they clap as he does its negative energy thrown on that person's\nOh yeah absolutely and that's where I go home she has an advantage\nChats exactly right but that doesn't mean when they get on their playing to leave Cleveland that he left the negative energy here\nIt's going with him it's gonna be added on every other stadium that is not his home stadium so and that's why I Do so many ballplayers all kinds of all players\nWill her ballplayers in a slump plug Shai Ben Bailey\nGood a slum or they just you know they don't feel good they're out of sorts they're tired all the time and the other thing too it's especially ballplayers look the dead fans that goes that hang up the stadiums you know\nYou couldn't walk up and stand next to LeBron James and a basketball game you would never get on court the guards and everybody would keep you away sure but gee if your ghost who's going to stop you know exactly\nWhat about the dream state visiting the dead and for other things\nOnce a person has crossed into ... they can absolutely come in and out of your dreams you could talk to them you can get all kinds of information from them you can get a hog\nA kid I mean it is so comforting to be able to talk to these people they look good they look

lethargic laid back it makes a huge difference you will see a difference and they do not retaliate or its negative energy is in the house it will help dissipated but\nThe problem is one says and then you've got to do it especially if it goes in the house you've got to do it at least\nEvery two weeks and you have to get the smoke everywhere because the one place you don't get the smoke is where they're going to be hiding\nBut if you had but the lady from Cincinnati hopefully you hit a minister or a priest come in and bless the house that makes a huge difference and much more than one because\nThe negative energy was pretty strong and one time is not going to do it\nNow I don't know if you could hear about when she was on the phone with us Mary and you could hear something like a
