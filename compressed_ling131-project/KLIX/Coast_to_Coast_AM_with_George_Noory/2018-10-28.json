... nuclear ... advance I mean I can handle the litter\nAnd he class about engineering and something like that but I Love engineers they really know the stuff\nThat's really cool they can just build something on a nothing\nI'm All right so that brings me to oh Keith from Virginia is back so he had called the um when we were talking with our guest last hour and it seemed much more appropriate to have money or for open line so\nI'm Glad you called back heat so you you had a friend who it was ... you were telling your story about how it is the surgeon had essentially experienced declined\nIs almost like a scientific revelation came into almost sort of divinely\nDelivered where he suddenly knew exactly what you do in this complicated surgery do I get that right\nOh that's correct because I understand that and um\nThat individual by the way and and\nAh thanks for having to get back on and sorry for not be a little bit a quicker and smarter with everything but um somebody very topics that he discussed and and that related to defend the things I wanted to say too but\nSure this gentleman Dr wrestling now and uh also had a a he relates to experience that of a failure or twice in surgery which his patients died\nAnd they were children and they later many years later a\nVisited him from the spirit world and delivered a message for him to give to their parents and so anyway this individual by the way is the same time I'm now from that in a at the age of Ninety three\nAfter having been a possible for the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints having left 'cause world renowned medical career a\nBecame president of a church in January of this year at the age of Ninety three and a an amazing man even if they um downhill skier at that age\nAnd um [noise] anyhow um what I wanted to get to was a I mentioned before a couple of things regarding astronomy\nAnd some other things in which things revealed by the prophet Joseph Smith gave a little bit more and hiding from time to time I hear things aren't coast to coast am that there can be perhaps a connecting and for ... informed that link\nAbout paranormal and things from traditional Judeo Christian teaching a that we find in and also in the Bible\nAnd and and that is a lot of the things that Joseph ... revealed or had to reveal to him I should say by a Jesus Christ and many other this or that he had profits\nAnd he brought about a lot of new scripture agent scripture as well as new scripture [noise] you know and and\nThey're going to get about thirty more seconds here so go ahead I said\nBasically to wrap it up be a turtle man is one concept that he spoke about it and he taught about and I wondered if you've ever heard of that book I just learned that recently by Truman naps and there's a very good Youtube video Joseph Smith and the recovery of eternal man\nBecause a lot of us principles seem to have\nBeen lost by you know the the church from the council on some of the scriptures had been boss said that were the basis of the creek\nWill have to leave that for\nA LDS scholars to sort out but it's interesting and I I I have a lot of friends ... mental make conversation and we're in ice tea\nThey measure pharmacist or want it all depends correctly and ended up in a jar container so they're all fishing out towards out or whether they come and get the order it would it have their own man right there\nYet but the thing of the the moving of the ... I mean it really is it's an amazing video in it for people that don't believe in in goes I think you'll enjoy it um but the scissors in the ... the ... in this little cup holder only district moving around\nAnd it's just it's not I mean you could almost making arguments like maybe the jar\nWas on its slanted surface or something and we couldn't see it from the camera angle and they're just having a good laugh but I don't get the thing with the the pencils and the than the scissors so yeah benevolent pulled her guys I'll go with that until it got any other theory to a a back in a ... show\nIs in Wyoming coast to coast Michele\nHow high the and I'm Sorry I'm jak that round I like all\nThe first things first the first things first if I can put you on hold and come back in a minute but that'd be easier\nAnd thank God I'm a first time caller longtime listener and a nice to have you what I was wondering\nWhy it's like I was raised as a Catholic and then like I showed the kind of walk away from that and explore other options and other things out there because you know I just I don't know that's that's the way I have inside an entire gas Michael I'm\nCloser to when you first got on he was talking about that you know that scientific side of him and and\nThe kind of sad that lady tell\nThem to read the Bible and now he's sort of changed his mind on it and it's a Christian so what I was wondering and I don't know how well versed jar with religious stuff exactly but um it's a little bit like I ... I Wonder how often when I'm driving down the road and how it can trust the\nAuthenticity of the Bible because [noise] you know [noise] I have often heard that a lot of the major story from it like the story of the fried and the story of a you know like a [noise]\nA savior our hero type figure being one of a virgin and stuff those steroids can be found in like ... that the call tax you know like ... ... attacks from like the marrying the abalone and get whatever predates the Bible so\nYou're talking about the ... you're talking about ... if you're talking about the story of NOAA for example um and there are some very interesting parallels\nIn the indigo diminish narratives should the news story [noise] um and you are correct in saying that there had been other traditions that had a sort of men God\nUm that was birthed by a human mother but from a a divine father and that that is it was just another version of that\nSo the question to me always is not this to me\nAnd this is where I think a lot of it in my personal opinion I Believe this is where some people get really hung up because I'm not going I'm not trusting the Bible because it has so many facts\nIn it I trust the Bible because of how many troops it has in it\n[noise] okay there's a there's a difference to me and there are ... that we know to be a worse\nSteering by right there there you you can count you can count on these troops that for example when you're good to others they will be good to you or even if they are good do you\nYou still have to be good to them because it only makes us is Jewish worse you know an ... so there are ... and and a lot of these stories to tell the truth is the actual facts of these stories it's always been less interesting to meet you so I'll be on survivor\nFilled with you know stories that can be found and other places and then we can still try you're saying like the other information on the bottom\nWell know here I Would say though is that even some of those other stories there are some of those things which you have heard that probably aren't true so there are some people who win Christianity was catching on over two thousand years ago\nOr ... other people started in ... like I'm emphasizing\nSomething from their tradition saying see were just like Christianity and so it was because of the rise of Christianity that they started to really promote the things that they said had pre existed that story whether they did or not there's really there really isn't always a lot of proof about that there isn't in the Egyptians\nThere's there's a little bit of a tradition of that but but it in the end does it matter\nI mean ... it's do you can you do live your life better does it improve your life that's the question and I think getting hung up on ... worrying about whether or not the Bible is a book of science\nIt does it improve your life that's the question and I think getting hung up on worrying about whether or not the Bible is a book of science there's a lot of people treat it like it's supposed to be a science book and it's not I don't think [noise] um and I think the stories are very instructive and we need to you know re learn from them every day\nHow how do you think of that\nThat's my best answer for you open it gives you something to chew on while you're while you're on the open road with a full tank of gas and it's a long time out here to things sound good [laughter] good will be ...\nBe a help you're a bad man the gym and you get where you're going well and thank you so much for joining in and I'm Glad you're was the first time I got to be there with you um I go to a adjusted who's in Texas on coast to coast Justin\nHey buddy hey\nHey and it's nice to be on my list them wherever they were actually call it in a have you learned to take it to the left everybody is I'm a the religious aspect but or do whatever you want to get the more scientific stuff yeah sure I'm not sure if a lot of people call it that Iran mosque interview a he had with Joe Rogan\nAnd I smoked ...\nYeah they they I think there are a little out there but uh I think somebody is um that logically advanced than the mind and have the means to do a lot pretty impactful when he said things about like a a guy and a stipend addict augmentation and stuff and uh I really thought it was a neat\nMetaphor they use than how human beings are pretty much augmented already carrying their cell phones around you know we have the ability to do the massive computations and access to any kind of data that we had that we want\nAnd all that and he said that you know in the very near future that could possibly be a thing that we could do hands free you know and uh you know what would that do maybe to the educational system would we go to school but we just take philosophy classes to learn how to think properly you know\nYeah well we need more of those but I think we need more of those I think I think I think philosophy would be we treat ... ... yeah I think we treat philosophy of some sort of exotic thing and it was really the first thing around which all education was built and\nHave you know it's just a fine arts credit that people just take\nJust have to write it because it can do it if it's not that it's dance you know or something so\nI can dance at least ... you don't have to\nGo [laughter] but you know to your point on on a mosque I'm a big believer in I'm In his technological ... solutions a big I'm big on sustainability um\nUh the Joe Rogan interview is troublesome because I think actually if you want to look at it in a different way all the time he spent talking about being depressed or you know his mental state for him over working and not sleeping enough and et cetera I\nI think that review much more of these humanness which we don't and we tend to think almost of Ilan must be some big giant slot machine\nYeah somebody in the whenever he's just he's a human being\nRight and he may be a slightly unstable human being these days I I own\nVenus is are you know at at everybody that that's a very intellectual always have some kind of inner struggle\nRight and so I'm a I I'm an investor actually in a very small way I'm In a couple of thousand dollars for the stock which took a hit after that Joe Rogan interview and uh and has recovered mostly\nOr something like that while the effect stock\nWell I don't know that though because I see my argument would be that Iran must we I invested in Illinois mosque mhm right I didn't and I invested in him I decided at some point probably\nIt's not his insurance but as a person\nYeah I thought that guys smart he gets it um and I think he's going to come up with cool stuff and it's going to make life better in the making a lot of money and so I bought on that basis so when I'm watching him in the interview\nI'm watching the wheels come off right I'm watching the wheels are going to eat and just like watching a Tesla the wheels are coming up it would be very worrisome\nSo I'm I I think anytime the head of a company like that become so synonymous with the product I think they have to be much more careful about how they live their lives in public that's my feeling on that but but I don't want to take away from him 'cause I Know I agree to use its own genius\nI think you suppose themselves a little more on it in on public but I think the thought process that everything is pretty consistent whether he was an even read it or not he claims that that's a that's a very\nSoon future you know blame it on the Web based in June of Nineteen you

S.\nPlaces just outside of earth's atmosphere remember to eat the Canadians first [noise] ah and ah and for for for good reason to uh this is that a time of year when you could probably get away with it in Roswell New Mexico so\nYou know start north get their actual aliens walking around Roswell\nThey might be able to blend in really well with the Halloween festivities that are coming up we'll talk more about that coming up and just a second and we'll we'll go around the horn\n'em to a couple of places that are celebrating Halloween on the way this Wednesday of course George Will have a terrific Wednesday night Halloween show but\nUh we'll also talk with the GW Oscar who's the author of a season with the witch\nAnd it's a whole book about the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts you might remember a show did a couple of months ago\nAbout uh the Salem witch trials and how historians have been changing their views on who were the victims or rather whether they were like really that much of a victim I mean it ... it was fascinating go back if you're a member of\nCoast insider and listen for it but coming up next our this is another sort of historical trip I think you're just going to love along the rails of America the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nOh this ... this is this is a great story you'll love hearing about it with Bill James who was a [noise] a writer and not just of um of general interest books like that but also he's a a sports writer\nOr in Boston and he was of course following very closely what happen tonight in Los Angeles we're not competing against he extended game that the Dodgers ended up playing last night\nUh it was like a double header rolled up into one single game uh but but tonight a little different uh both socks lead the series now three to one the Dodgers will get another shot at it coming up tomorrow night to send the series back to Boston three to two but\nBut let me just say if it hadn't been for that error I'm In the top of the thirteenth the bottom of the thirteenth yeah a ... this would all be over now their boss to be going home\nOf life afterwards anyway the experiments that inspired Frankenstein are up at coast to coast am dot coms a great story to read and and also this one to from the sun\nAbout [noise] they put a cover up that may have been exposed\nGoogle Earth blind spot over the experimental military base maybe where US government hides crushed UFOs that according to a defense insider you'll see more about that about the the ... test range in Nevada\nUm and what they had recently uncovered but but if they did\nWell then you know they would it would become the new Roswell I'm kinda happy with the old role as well and I'm very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who was needed Jennings who joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita anything so\nJuanita is the director of public affairs for Roswell\nI'm and she promotes Roswell as a travel and and you know as a professional opportunity and people move to Roswell all the time but this time of year where you get a lot of tourists to come in for the Halloween festivities so I just wanted to ask you what your plans\nWere for Halloween what do you do if if if Ross was kind of Halloween all year long in a way for some people with the discussion of aliens and invading armies and all of that is if it's if it's a Halloween all year long would you do special for Halloween\n[noise] um most people go out to grade arm which is a local farm and ranch community just about seven miles out of town where they participate in the corn main uh the great family ah the coordinates together like the hieroglyphics that\nWere supposedly on the U.S a spaceship that landed in Nineteen forty seven\nAt Eighteen get every single year and it is a great opportunity for people to go out and really try to experience a hunter feeling of getting our NFL life and you're a crash in Nineteen forty seven\nOther people go out care bottom earthquakes are\nAh which again has a mystery at the bottom layer and [noise] and it is our ten miles from Roswell beautiful a great place to our camp and things like that but\nI can I'm more more of the stars and the telescope and people getting dressed up and they feel that they become one or they may come down and\nAh you know it's just that that the area where there is something here that land it and they're trying to connect with and especially around\nHalloween and during the year after after our in July\n... so I ... I'll be traveling through Roswell I'm moving coming up I'm In ...\nThe vote in July\nSo I I'll be traveling through Raj will I'm moving coming up I'm In a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through Roswell on my way to\nUh my new position will be teaching it to Kansas State and my my ... my younger son and I always wanted to coat the Roswell right so we we we mapped out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of our way to dip down to the Roswell before we come back up again\nAnd seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people tour when they're out there anybody we're interested in in being able to\nGo to the crash site or ... or to go to any of the other locations that are ... to the famous story of the crushing Roswell were what can they do\nSo they can go to the rival on international year from him and Research Center which um is a great opportunity to really dive into their historical and the research a part of the clash\nI'm definitely what check out the library for those who are really the seekers and do you believe\nA in addition to that we have a UFO toward that is done by a local researcher he's been doing research on the crash and you're a first for over twenty plus years and he will take you to the exact locations of the timing of the incident\nAnd on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival for the first time last year that broke or families where the crash occurred allegedly they will take you out to the crash site where a Mac rebels rent a\nHouse is still kind of in in place and you can see where the crater landed in in the land and so those are just a couple of of things that I Would definitely recommend that people check out and um you know search for the troops themselves\nOkay so ... to use the word allegedly in there which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened you know something we don't know\nI I Do believe there are some people still are\nKind of on the fence and so we invite people to come and find out for themselves [noise] uh we you know there's a lot of research there's a lot of a local people here that um people can talk to you when you go into the museum\nUh the locals know who the tourists are because it is that her and you will come and walk down our main street and go into areas that one which is a great story I bring your camera to take pictures up in the ... visitor center we have to amazing alien so we'd decorate for each holiday especially now\nFor Halloween [laughter] he puts on a big fall festival with\nOur police officers and things like that for the community but um these they're about six foot aliens and ah people love to take pictures with them and they'll hear the story of you know our end point of the month his name is Bob and ... and uh you know people really come here searching for the truth\nWe as locals leave we don't want to say one way or the other we want them to figure it out for themselves and and you can research\nWell that'd be great thank you appreciate the let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in Raj well for the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the UFO days\nSo our population has doubled in size we're we're account about forty eight thousand and especially on the big anniversary of the festival\nUm you know we've hit close to doubling our size on average per year for tourism we see a little over two hundred and thirty thousand visitors that calming\nOur our eyes on average per year for Korean family over two hundred and thirty out and figure out how does your effort you're learning Research Center [noise] pretty good\nPretty good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts or and so I'll I'll bring in our next guest next but thank you honey to and if I'm if I'm driving through time I get a chance they'll say hello okay\nCreate their own care\nHoney to Jennings is the uh the the the director of tourism or public affairs in uh Roswell New Mexico a season with the which Jay W Oscar\nThe subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a J W let me just tell you very funny book you read this great sense of humor really enjoy all the sort of a comic asides on a serious subject because\nAnd we'll get to this second this is this is a very unusual place in America but it has an even more extraordinary place in the timeline of American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts\nThey do about a quarter of a million people that come to visit during the month of October is that about right\n[noise] yeah it's about right there are about forty thousand usually um have you on Halloween just how itself it's about a hundred thousand people come um and of course of the month than a quarter million so the massive amount of people that small city to have a set of orders\nWell I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drilled down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked\nHalloween insane [laughter] that's the subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative and we just get against a couple of weeks ago about a on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that\nUh that that there are other places around the world outside of Salem that had massive hangings and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\n[noise] yeah I always try to tell people that said I wasn't the first ever which trial wasn't the last one that was shot and do a trial wasn't the biggest one of the strangest for them you know there are [noise] you know the first for trout America you're a victim was in Connecticut and Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims of course yeah injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which has killed\nIt isn't it honestly it's really a problem today even in ... and I'm also developed countries are still being people being asked you for being what to do with the strange thing about that to me of course all of the planet that have had this problem just pretty much every day on the planet there's only one with the city and that's Salem, Massachusetts\nOf actually kind of wait wait a minute results product coming Kurt ... kinda barbaric ... excuse the pun well I think\nThat works beautifully\nRichard astro here we're talking about the power waking\nUp your immune system which has hailed this gentleman's hot\nThe immune system can be called one of the bodies fears this powers to he'll visit C. A.\nR. N. I. V. O. R. A. dot com\nOr call one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five\nThat's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nSo ah GW ... author of a season with the which I just had to look at some of those steps that we had mentioned\nMore vaguely two thousand eleven ... Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt linkage or England\nOr long ago turned its ... incident in which ten people were hanged in sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw in Sweden there's a witch memorial for the more than Seventy victims who were beheaded and burned in sixteen Seventy five\nIn Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused and that's just some of them and not even all that\nThe Salem that sticks out and so why why do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the craft\n[noise] it's it's really a mystery honestly even that's one of the big questions I had gone to the book and I think it's a combination of probably two dozen different factors honestly that gets Salem as which city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing\n[laughter] yeah that's a big part of it but I mean I'm not a big part of it that's a small part of it but there's about a dozen other reasons why kind of Salem grabbed onto that moniker and kind of held on to it you know over the course about two centuries\nBut it's kind of like you know you it's a moniker of shame ... right I mean it's not that's not usually what it holds onto you know that even you know it's we just talked to somebody from Roswell in and that that was an incident that was that happened\nThere but\n... and they they take advantage of that for you know tourism purposes and for whatever reason they want but it's like usually words you you don't hear about Chicago celebrating the fact that it was the home\nOf that crazy serial killer treated the same as world's exposition right you don't know did he do go on their way to put up signs and it happened here folks\n[laughter] right now they got through and I think to to fight for that one is that\nYou know the tragedy in Salem itself was both basically just to the court happened in Salem right it was a civic part of the trials right actual family members and the you know the people who really bear that shame over the course of generations around Salem the actual the actual stereo started next door in what's now Denver's\nWas at the time to film village fulfilling itself doesn't really have a ... kind of a generational connection to it it was just the sight of the civic proceedings\nUm and then on top of that today which city means way more than just the victim of a witch trials I mean the actual which is I live there today it means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween since ... sounds kind of become Halloween count as well so it's a determined which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today in twenty eight team\nYeah I guess and this is important in a ... this is great distinction can't help but feel do and sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering that does this really is about innocent victims of murder [laughter] that they were executed\nAnd did they protested their innocence until the end\nAnd there's a whole industry tend to build up around them now\n[noise] yeah not a big ... dealing with that responsibly as something that Salem is kind of ruffled with for you know probably two centuries and a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy that's kind of underneath underneath there for ... so to speak then part of it that's less connected to the tragedy it's more just around\nYou know a city identity and all these other kind of thing just become and and twenty a team\nWell go back to my central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nAh with with absolute pandemonium [laughter] it really is so they they don't celebrate Halloween day I mean they celebrate a season basically for that they felt it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first and then October thirty first I'm really glad over into longer than that\nSo if you want to experience Salem don't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year joined visit film at Halloween you're just going to get pandemonium crowd with a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city of failing itself\nIt's Mardi Gras basically it is it really is um your talk again a hundred thousand people\nThe city for failing to the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know five or six blocks\nAnd you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes of freaky each other out to you know go to go to bars watch the fireworks all kinds of stuff so you're you're definitely there for you know again Mardi Gras was a good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans\nNo Marta girl you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras\n[noise] um but ... and I imagine for a lot of times in October it's cold is which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get the same festivities educated Mardi Gras anyway but there's probably some amount of alcohol that's consumed during this celebration\nDefinitely actually right now or in the middle of a nor'easter so that you know cuts have anything to him right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween [noise] right yeah booze or the part of it but this is within the party\nOkay so you you mentioned haunted happenings but I mean the Salem known for being hunted either Salem witch Denver's former Salem Village or seen them are there were a lot of haunted houses were were there are there still visitations from the victims of the original Salem trial\nOh yeah there's all kinds of without around that it's it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again everything you need for what the classic ... idea of innocent victims\nYou have monsters 'cause of the film which trial then just involved which is in the story involves the humans and chimps and shaped sisters and goes everything we're in the trials for the big monster mass\nSee all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has you know four hundred years of history or up three hundred and Thirty years of history\nSo that is just you know a lot of people over the centuries so yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening in sound um ghost tours there's spooky places there's the other side of the executions you have everything you need to build the kind of spooky mythology around the city\nYou know you've been there most of these I should say you've been there right you go there so oh yeah all the time I was there two weeks ago\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seemed to be still situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but it's that's my fault so I I built a career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night at a band that asylum and murders things are all kinds of things and I've never had an experience\nSo my interest that that is more in the stories themselves you know until the day I have an experience my interest is more than the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know go the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me yeah\nLet's let's the best what's the best spooky story that post Salem witch trials that you captured while you've been there\n[noise] um well what are the one of the really creepy ones is one of the Boston stream of victims happened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real\nYou know real actual historical event that then I can reverberate and have kind of all around that Houdini also visited Salem and like escape from the jail they're so all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know ... kind of events happened in Salem that nothing to do with the witch trial\nSo all that kind of some kind of feed into that kinda cauldron of a of a mythology around Salem\nYeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was there somebody to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm ... ... was there an attempt to for him to do like ... or something while he was there\n[noise] no no it was ... or the building actually still stands it's a it's a condominium or apartment complex now but it used to be the original jail there there was real police station and he was just there doing one of those things that used to do and he was in towns are performing who go to a local police station or somewhere\nYou know scape as a PR move for his next big event so he wasn't down there doing or if it sounds busing but they're doing is a is a scape escape routine\nLike ... ... ... you you mentioned that there are still which is in Salem how do they get along with this idea of the the ... celebrating painted the victim who did these innocent people who denied that they were which is where do they how do they play into this\nOh it's great for my favorite elements of the founders of city in complete conflict at all times between you know tourists and historians and visitors and residents and the art museum and the which is which is that this really strange position where they call themselves which is a ... you know do a sincere religion around it but I have to deal with the baggage of\nLive your life

Illinois I saw the town where I'm home alone takes place I grew up not too far away from the the home alone house\nI'm ... and ... the mayor in around the turn of the century in were neck and one of the first mayors of the town\nI'm was murdered alone with his wife in their home in a crime that was never solved and they happen to live right by the railroad tracks\nIs that right yeah and it was a story I'd always been told by my mother because um she was kind of into the sort of thing where I get it and uh and ... the the belief was always that it was just some drifter who came off the train broke into the house\nRobbed them and then was able to catch a train and get up and they never found them [noise] um but when I was reading this not thinking wait a second that could be somebody else in the in the chart of demand from the train\n[noise] the ... it is possible we haven't we assumed that we did not find every crime that he committed we just we found those er which there were enough signature a sick segment or a characteristics of the crime that you could say with\nSome degree of confidence that they're there for him but they they may well committed and probably did commit other crimes that are we just did not have enough information about it but that that's a new and actually I I I've never heard that story before at all and if you hear about Penn scratching because at writing down\nWhen a murder that by the hundred years ago\nI tried to actually find out something this afternoon on it I couldn't um and I wondered whether somebody maybe from the Historical Society had more details but it was Saturday and I couldn't get a hold of anybody\nBut it made me think about it and so if I got something wrong or you know forgive me but it's worth a ... a poke anyway so how many people do we think\nWere murdered along America's railroad tracks by single perpetrator\nDemand from the train or who's anonymous for a reason or ... you know during this period\n[laughter] well what Rachel I did was we put the murders and vodka or there's a hundred percent ... at that his crimes were certainly have a Seventy percent\nYou put the murders and buckets right there's a hundred percent bucket that his crimes were certain ... Seventy percent bucket or forty percent ... percent bucket right and then we total up the numbers of murders and each bucket and multiplied them by their likelihood\nThat I'm a ... that ah it was a a criminal and\nThe murder the tone we came up with as a hundred and one that actually includes the two people who were murdered who were executed by the state a lot for crimes they committed and the the uh somewhere between four and nine people who were who were murdered by Lynch mob\nFor crimes that he either did commit or may have committed\nSubject to the actual murders and his own hands as opposed to murders for which he would be responsible\nIncluding the executions as murders because they were innocent um do we say somewhere around Ninety like a solid Ninety victims is guy okay that's right All right so ... ... ... a typical crime as you as you see the pattern\nDeveloping in the late ... uh nineteenth century early twentieth century what was this guy ...\n... ... this is along this could be a long after I got along with the person who could be a long trip because\nThere are a lot of things the tie them together the crimes happen near midnight almost all of the crimes happen within an hour midnight a family is murder most often a family including a young girl\nIs murdered without any warning and with no known enemies they live usually in a small ... at a town too small to have a police department [noise]\nThey live near the intersection of two railroad tracks\nThe I'm a very often bodies are moved there killing with an axe\nThe ax is found in the in the yard of the victims are on the art of a neighbor and they actually the ban then at the scene of the crime or handle is washed her fingerprints the house is locked up tight to all the windows are the window shades of\nPolls windows if necessary are covered with blankets so that you can't see it all the doors are locked [noise]\nThe or or something is jammed in the door [noise]\nSome devils getting a big win today are kind of fun a show at the we were just hated the interrupt you because you were doing such a great job with the explanation about the the similarities between the cases and I I think you were coming up to the end but I I had to cut you off because we had the heartbreak at the bottom of the\nPlayers graduated or after that because I was going to run out of the things to say but I was able to find\nThat hard to type ... that's like an extended like a little bit more of them aren't there what's that I said like thirty four of them aren't there or something I\nSaw the I got the um the uh the crime you normally occurred on Sunday night so you heard on the weekends\nUp until Nineteen pan the crimes almost all occurred and areas in which the primary industry was ball getting her one of the primary understood as those logging the or doors doors and windows ... shot I think I mentioned that\nThey um [noise] there's all the clarity a graphic pattern and the murders if one occurred just south of Portland the next occurs just north of Portland\nOr that that would be a link between them the uh uh one thing that is odd is that he would he would take our lap\nFrom inside the house turn the ... way way down low so they just gave up a little bit of light take the chairman a awful lap and set it on the floor usually under a table a and then carry the lap around with him as he committed murders\nAnd the other thing is that he would uh put poet blankets over the head of a ... person or a half a second before you went ahead with an axe are you there are a lot and they probably did that to keep the blood from\nFlying back and hitting hitting him if he was\nHurting someone the or a group quite a detailed pattern of behavior\nOr yeah very interesting and so this is starting in the in the late Nineteen century and go into the early twentieth century following along logging lines that actually would be consistent with where this murder happened it's not that\nThe town that I grew up in his logging town but it was in between logging towns and if you just go north up into Wisconsin where that line started um that was plenty of logging was going on um\nIn St for that matter Michigan just around the other side of Chicago so very likely could have could have followed a poet or another\nThing I forgot to mention there all the all in warm weather with one one possible exception there's one crime that he that he may have ... whether his first crime which was just an outburst of anger and not\nAnd not a plan to vent probably that occurred in cold weather but he had to flee through cold weather and after that he never murdered anybody cold weather it's always warm weather\nUm we're talking about America's most elusive serial killer and Ninety would he be America's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for the dubious crown\nIt yeah it it probably might be but I I had this discussion with my with my publisher which I Would have which was that they were going to want to say was the worst serial murder in American history or the first or something\nMurder is by its nature done in secret or the ... that in fact that is that is one of the earliest definitions of the word murder is a killing on it secret\nFear because it has done in in secret the facts about it are never fully known\nAnd are not ah not normally are fully exposed\nAnd uh you get a lot of different people who claimed to be the worst serial murder in American history I don't think anyone has a better claim to that disgusting title than the\nThis person but uh I'd I'd I wouldn't want to make it because the reality is we just can't document all the crimes to be attributed to a really anybody [noise]\nYeah I mean it's fair to say that if they were the most successful serial killer of all time very likely\nNobody would ever know about it and they ... they could have done these things using drifters or people without ... much in the way that\nYou know some serial killers have already performed but in the area of like ten to Fifteen victims or John Wayne gay see using runaways and other things that that helped him to elude capture for so long so\nBut the demand from the train is is he is he's called\nAny we have to call them that although we'll get to what you think you'd be discovered about this at in terms of solving the crime is a little bit later on almost don't want to because I don't want to ruin them so close to ... you know finishing I was reading all afternoon\nSeriously but then there's a couple of good football games I got distracted at dinner so the ... but this guy he nobody it it it it would be president isn't for us to just assume\nThat there was some national awareness of the killer who was lurking along Americans railways be careful if you have a home near train tracks now because there's a guy going in between all of these towns what kind of word was going out which\nAbout killers alone trains during this killing spree\nWealth of Eighteen Ninety eight nine ten eleven nothing at all\nThe ... and that this has to do with the organization of the a wire services at that time in Eighteen Ninety eight or wire services were at a very primitive stage and because that's true information had very little or ... of this guy had little ability to spread from town to town\nBy Nineteen twelve and a national wire services were were organized at a story that was printed in a small town somewhere it would be picked up by the Associated Press or your PI or\nOr the other wire services of that era and published all over the nation so after he had been killing people for about twelve years in October of Nineteen of love and all of a sudden there was a a sudden awareness that this was happening\nSo when he went to his most famous crime ... in June of Nineteen twelve everybody knew immediately that this is him either\nTerrible series that's been going on right for the first more than ten years that he was killing people nobody was connecting the dots at all even when logically they should have that\nEven though you you look at the crimes that there's a case in Virginia West Virginia where two crimes are committed six weeks apart the uh uh and and towns that it's a little less than eighty miles from one to the other as the crow flies\nAnd you and the crimes are extremely similar and there's no other crime like that anywhere in the United states and all the rest of the year\nYou would think that people would connect the dots but they didn't they are the first crime was was hung on the shoulders of a man our little who was later executed for and the second crime was it was investigated as a totally separate events\nAnd that was interesting because they were so close to each other but that doesn't just speak to\nThe lack of say the development in the Associated Press wire or it doesn't it's not just that it's also it speaks to the engine seat of the jurisdiction of sharing of a police departments and sheriff's departments and there was no national\nOr investigative a body of like the FBI yet so there was nobody that you would report these two anyway that was going to keep track of what was happening around the country at the same time\nThat's exactly true and that introduces a sauce into one of the major themes of the book which is the and you know I've been writing about crime for a long time ... I'm ... I thought I was fairly knowledgeable about it I was astonished to\nTo realize how backward and ineffective address additional system was just a hundred years ago it's beyond belief how primitive the investigative process war at the time of these crimes\nAnd what the man from the train did was to exploit the peculiar weaknesses of of the\nOf the criminal justice system to evade capture\nThey ah they knew that if he committed a crime and got out of town before the crime was discovered there was no no way really to to connect it to him and he knew that if he committed a crime in a big city the police were going to be all over it\nBut if he committed a crime in a small town that had no police force first of all it took them two weeks to get their boots on but but even when they ... they had no resources to come after him\n[noise] and and forensic medicine hadn't even really started yet I mean the the ... ... and ... this was um and then ... I'll even throw in another ... even in prosecuting that some of the things we we learn um is that even up until the Nineteen forties\nI'm juries were completely suspicious of crime science [noise]\nUm yeah and I ...

I'm a two little girls named Ida Lena still under went home with a more family the family of Henry More they walked home after the church service and and uh the little girls spent the night with a better friend the little girl was a member of the family\nOn the morning of June can know when it's starting around in the house the a and the uh uh his brother finally comes and breaks into the house finds a couple of bodies and runs out of the house scraping they bring the town marshal\nAnd he his name as as a Hank Horton Mr Horton courageously goes through the house you have to understand he has no reason to believe anything other than that uh a craze murderer is hiding somewhere in this house here at as a dark house\nOr he's holding it matches in front of him or with no gun to no form of protection holding matches in front of a front of his other himself going from room to room finding bodies\nTheir eight dead bodies in the house and in my log house in a small quiet mid western town the um [noise] uh and all of them hit the head with an axe the access found as it usually is\nNext to the body of a little girl the man from the train was a it was a pervert than he was interested in little little girls and the the little girl was usually found in a in an attitude suggesting that she had been a she had been outraged\nAfter death the I'm a ... in any case the crime was not there was a a great uproar as you can imagine what the crime was not solved a two years later\nWalker some came to Alaska and\nRealized that he could sustain a phony investigation of the crime by keeping people angry\nHe could keep donations coming in by keeping people angry a ... and he did that by accusing or a very prominent local set of them Frank ... of finance at a crime\nThere isn't any chance of the world the Frank Jones was guilty or that he had an any any connection to it\nBut this campaign to prosecute Frank Jones a divided Alaska and horrible and unprecedented way the city fought over whether or not Jones did it or didn't do it for several years uh and became\nA K better battery divided community we have families on one side of the line wouldn't play with families on the other side of the line they wouldn't go that they wouldn't shop if their stores they wouldn't uh wouldn't have anything to do with them\nThat this battle lasted in Alaska for even though a broker someone conventionally run out of town and Nike and seven pain\nThe uh um the battle went on for a long time and the hard feelings emanating from it persisted in the city I Would I Would say for two effects that that they presented to the present day\n[noise] you know you mentioned the piece about the the\nPerson in whipping up sentiment in making a false accusation to profit from it\nAnd even that creates a pattern for all too often how\nUm crime stories unsolved crimes stories are treated yet at the same time it it speaks to the fact that there weren't cold case police officers working that the crime still the crimes have been at that time\nMight have been solved by\nAfter that period of time by somebody reading a letter confessing or somebody knowing somebody that but it wasn't meant to almost literally like fall in their lap which again comes back to the\nThe power of storytelling and how ... just by keeping my telling a story the beginning middle and end of these events it doesn't matter how old the story is is that it will get people to listen again into reconsider again and most likely to connect\nAgain to that sense of outrage about what had happened and so you know a static police report won't necessarily you know anger people but when you start telling the story again people certainly yeah\nYeah that's right and and and they that's but also keeps kind of the idea of the murder alive it it makes it it gives you a sensation again it is it that is you know the core of sensationalism but it does it make it make you feel it again the fact that this crime\nIn happened had they had they built it you know any kind of memorial to the family had there been\nAny had there been what had the town done to try to come to grips with the fact that this murder had happened prior to even this con men coming to town or afterward\nThey um [noise] uh ... well there was I don't know that there was that type of sound about I don't know that anyone build a memorial to them [noise]\nI I'm for many years the Alaska authority that I Would say that still true today the ... the the chamber of commerce tribes pipes and below the worst of all if it was known for something else right right they are ... there there is a house\nWhere the crime occurred is still standing of his operated as a kind of of\nUh it's the it's a shows up on her a normal TV shows and people pay to take tours of the house\nThe um [noise] a lot if you drive around the less ... there's no sign anywhere that says where the houses are now there'll be a sign saying where the doctors houses but that but uh where the ... ... knowing for is not mentioned anywhere\nThe um uh that's not an appropriate I I I it goes without saying that that's not an appropriate memorial right\nThe uh I don't know that you raise an interesting question I don't know that in any of these cases there was a a proper memorial to the victims victims were mostly poor people most people without a without one and the more family was very\nWell why they are and the community uh thought well off and the vigorous efforts to solve the crime wore a kind of memorial to them\nOr by that I don't think there was any physical memorial to the\nYou know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers in ... where there is an effort to try to use it doesn't even have to be like a statue but it's interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economics peace\nAnd that explains everything you know that that's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of status or not or you know\nThe um the one of his rather than maps and trades crimes are the double murder in Colorado Springs it murder two families in what night an adjoining how the uh uh but if you if you go to that community where that happened now the people that area's still remember it\nStill they they could show yeah all of that that house right there um but it still has not forgotten or many places\nMany places where these crimes occurred it was so long ago that it's totally I'm absolutely forgotten but in some of it it's still quite well remembered [noise]\nSo I wanted you know I'm I'm going to make a sacrifice you because [noise]\nIt was really hoping to finish the book before the interview but I really want to get to the part about how you think you live narrowed down this suspect so let's let's go through that\n\n\nBill James the co author of the men from the train to the research with his daughter Rachel McCarthy James and by the way when I read more carefully on the back cover it does say that she lives with her husband not you [laughter] so\nSorry I got that wrong [laughter] um but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nOr you looked at these ah you looked at these murders\nAnd you put them in these different pockets you know the percentage that you believed were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then well there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that\nUm or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to how many unsolved murders\nWere going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nRight well the murder of an entire family and one of that is a is a rare of that was then and it is now but uh uh there are many many unsolved murders in that era\nYou know I mean does even as you mentioned they just weren't any investigative bodies and if they had one wouldn't the investigation wouldn't last for long because there wasn't a lot of funding but so is let let's let's go down this path of of the process that you used to try to actually\nNarrowed down to a name to a person I've I've seen this done a couple of times right there's been some very interesting attempts to to to name names with regard to Jack the ripper for example and including going through ships registries and finding whether or not there was a particular sailor that coincided\nWith the murders and white chapel and or other parts of the world that shared similar characteristics as the the crimes\nIn in England but it happened in Central America or happened in in ... and so they were able to try to find you know well this sailor went from this poor to that port in in each one of these ports there was a murder so it's it it's a ... it but you have to you'll have to START I mean it's not quite a needle in a haystack but it's\nIt's at least maybe I'm ... you know to to look at it broadly you're you're you don't even know yet what you don't know when you start doing a search like this so you you don't you know is it even possible that a name could even be found\nGiven the scarcity of information about you know people are public registries during that period\n[noise] Iraq and the Jack the ripper case I Am I read I have read probably twenty bucks jak river with this guy or whatever was that guy or exactly they are and I and my other book popular crime\nI'll be twenty bucks saying jak river was this guy or whatever it was that guy or jak with the er and I and my other book popular crime I made fun of the people who wrote those books um the uh uh because I don't I don't have much confidence that you can actually do that and to be Frank\nAlmost all of the arguments that Jack the ripper is this guy or that guy almost all of them are silly\nThe um I never really expected that we would find it convincing argument about who this who was doing the same I mean\nWe were looking gas and Rachel says that she did expect to find them but I didn't the um uh but when we walk the crimes backward a there is a crime in Massachusetts and Eighteen Ninety eight\nThat Rachel says the moment she saw it she knew it was him\nThe um uh and that was because I had told her that this guy would make mistakes and in his first crime he did make numerous mistakes that let everybody know who he was\nThe ah [noise] ah but the number of details that match up in the first crime to lead save Alaska\nIs is just it's beyond anything that you would you would a suspect was a could be coincidence and I'll I'll mentioned just a few things\nYou know at least you did you did you want me to give you the name or not it doesn't\nMatter the newly will do is go to the coincidence or go through the the similarities first\nWell ... the first crimes that were sort of publicly link where crimes in the Portland area\nAnd two crimes in the Portland area where we're committed rather obviously by the same man and the the tech the same detectives happen to be investigating him and thought this is the same guy I mean that crime a month ago down\nSouth for the the um uh that criminal had size six feet the um there's another crime in Maine in Nineteen oh two in which the\nCriminals there was there were a pair of boots prince that were central to the trial or again size six feet is a very uh the the so we we know that this was a small man\nWell it is recorded about man that we found that he did in fact have size six feet not speculation he did we know that we ... it was believed that he was small because I'm\nThe or a ... and in other places\nWhen he swung the acts the ceiling was very low the ceiling is only about seven feet high in the room where the murders were committed but when he swung the axe over his head he just barely grazed the ceiling if a person of normal size a person of\nA if a person a large man could not swing an axe over his head in that room without sticking it in the ceiling because of that it was believed that he had to be small he was five foot for the uh uh\nIt was suspected if you look at the blood pattern the way the blood flies off the ax you couldn't see clearly whether it's the guy is basically left handed or basically right hand and that's a pretty easy thing to see\nIt was believed that the murder and Alaska was left handed the man who committed the crime and Eighteen Ninety eight was left handed we had said that he had to be a well the the first stories about him say that he\nThat we had said that he had to be a well the the first stories about him say that he was an experience trap than he would travel around the nation on trains for a while and then he would settle down into an area [noise] we had said that he must work as a longer because\nAll the crimes for about ten years occur and logging areas the first story about him first stories about him specifically say that he was an experienced the longer\nThe uh uh the nature of the crime itself the special attention to the a ... girl a that was there and the first crime in the first cry he always kill the man of the house first and the a\nAnd ended with the murder of a young girl that's what he did and first crime the he always used the one side of the X.\nI never even I wouldn't say it I Can't say he never killed anyone with a shops I've backs but it was always his intention to use the blunt side of the acts in dispersed crime alongside of the acts\nAnd adds he would do in Alaska and many other places he left the acts on the floor beside the young girls that the uh so the crime dissed matches up on too many points for you to think that this isn't him\nSilly you started to look for signs for left handed pedophile nickel Seeley a tinder in Logar ax murderer\nOr ... ... ... ... how did\nYou begin to narrowly name out of that the when he committed first crime he it was obviously ... who ...\nFor his crime is obvious who had committed it 'cause he was living with the family which that's a common thing that cereal murders first crime he often kills people\nTo whom he with his directly connected and can be tied so we kill the first family and Eighteen Ninety eight everybody knew that who who had done it because he fled the scene and\nI Would say they were looking for is just that all of these other facts about the first about the criminal happened to line up with what we were looking for\nAnd the name that you believe is a new demand on the train\nThe ... the name that he was using their as Paul Miller the weather that we could actually he was a German immigrant or the or whether that was his actual name or not um is is speculation he could have been using a false name even that however there's no real reason to believe he was\nWe've found no I shouldn't say we found a friend of mine doing research on his own after the book was published found a the the ships record in which he had entered the country about an Eighteen Ninety\nThe I'm a probably a man named Paul Miller had entered the country I'm On a ... he was he walked with a sailors gate he you know if it was like it and then walk side to side the uh uh and the uh uh\nUh they they so if he had been in the German

I wasn't so much thinking in terms of\nBigger print evidence I was thinking that could lead somebody to find out where he and purchased the acts but you're saying in every home he picked up the acts from the nearby would pile and use that so whenever a type of actually had in the house that's the one he left behind\nWhich is another point about Nineteen ten and I think than it was very common for people to have an ax no yeah wouldn't mile outside their house oh yeah dogs are is why I connect to the story I grew up in a small town in the Nineteen fifties fifties Nineteen sixties ... at our house and I\nI chopped a lot of work with him to a to a burning out\nYou know my dad till the similar story but then he and his brothers you know they would have to fight over who's going to be

Chicago\nAnd the first time caller line for Bill James author of the men from the train very interesting Paxton\nGuys fascinating\nI'm an English teacher and naturally I I lean pretty heavily on coal this time of year and I I wanted to ask your guest village feet if you noticed any ... any parallels between pose a vision you wrote about and that says\nThat the murderer always has a guilty conscience and really tries to get caught and some of the more famous stories like the black cat where ironically berries that acts and his wife had right that's what he describes it\nAnd and when you least calm he is not going to be caught so you know he he at wall but the cat up into the wall and uh you know he tried to get him into the basement and said look how how the ... but he always cutting it given the whole way\nThey are a ... by the way while doing research on the crime book I I happen to find a a story in a Paris newspaper in Eighteen forty six of which is\nSearch on the crime book I I happen to find a a story in a Paris newspaper in Eighteen forty six of which is apparently the original story from which the casket with ... among the autos is based there are a poll also of course was it was a avid reader crime stories as as I'm sure you know\nThe uh anyway uh the answer is no ... is the absolutely was not trying to get caught in ... many many many serial murderers are sort of playing games with the police and sometimes they want you to know who did it\nUh but they just don't want to because I don't want to be convicted of it\nBut that that's one thing that's quite unusual about this man is that he had a very unusual a aversion to being ...\nHe didn't he wasn't he wasn't he absolutely was not trying to get caught and he was taking very intelligent and very well thought out evasive action not ever to be caught one reason he never took anything from a crime scene\nEven the you know if there was a hundred dollars sitting on a shelf there\nYou wouldn't take it because he knew very well that if he was caught fleeing a crime scene of playing a\nScene with or something that could be tied to that scene he a lot of people were executed for that the uh so no he was he was very nice to have a quite unusual extent yeah have a an aversion to being caught\nSome serious restrained from there and he told the guy who didn't have any money that the shoes and disciplines I'm Jacob Fenston as good a marine who's in Athens, Georgia until she goes for Bill James Marie\n... high ... in in ...\nUm well I was calling because I I was kind of curious first of all you got to stop talking about the acts and um my my brother and I we were investigating murder happened it was after the civil war in our family um\nAnd he was my great however many that grandfather that was he was killed with an act\nAnd then they think that his wife and maybe a fan did that but it ended up being a brother in law that was convicted of it and\nUm he was right out and I feel I guess they hope that some field workers would be blamed for it anyway and so we were investigating that and then my brother was murdered a year ago\nAnd then his son is in jail for killing a guy about two years I guess right now so it's just there's now a lot of it around but um and I was wondering you may you mentioned earlier about\nIf a person you know if they didn't make a lot of mistakes and that person that we believe that kept my brother he um he seemed to be [noise]\nHe was so far he's gotten away with it and then how do you find out about a person gets he's um you know where that found that the obvious one or maybe he had done this before you know what I mean he was\nBecause every little detail he sang she may have now like if you go in and\nThey were just it seems to perfect for the first time this is what you're saying\nI I certainly feel for you I'm very sorry about the loss or your brother meat\nAre and and uh I Wish there was only had to take it helped with the helpful to you but I I there really isn't\nI mean I I think as I said in our case we were just very fortunate to uh to find this treasure trove of information about the about the first crime they are but I I it's not something you can\nIf we if we could do it Rachel and I were to sit out the salt and other series of crimes like this\nAnd we ... we could ritual and I were to sit out so in other series of crimes like this we wouldn't it wouldn't happen for us it's because he wasn't something that happened because we were smarter because we knew we were doing\nThey were just the way the crime set up the way the story's set up that broke for us\nYou know I'm In Missouri but the Murray let's go to my ... in New York for a new genes and coast to coast am\nYes good morning gentlemen and when a delight to ah I see a ... year back in the saddle massive were good luck with that Web looking forward to it but I have um a a two part question with some comment\nAnd I'll listen I'm over the uh well it's not the ad in New York it's it's over the Internet [laughter] first thought is now we have especially with all these pages at at hand\nUh people at the FBI or consider that profile is so I like to know\nIf you put this in a more modern contacts\nHow a such a a FBI profile of might might slash this guy out much for the um also I like to hear more about and whether it's in the book\nIn terms of somebody in a sense that got caught up including the black people who um [noise] wound up not even going to trial but getting Lynch and the last part\nIs uh I I you mentioned about the state of the police at this time at the turn of the century [noise]\nThat saw the um [noise] uh\nI recently read a book by ... no ... it's called how the eye which became white this is on a Jacksonian Arab pre civil war\nAnd he actually describe the police besides the fact that you know they had to I was looking for a fugitive\nBlack folk but they off he described in as basically competing gangs are basically street gangs wouldn't volunteer fire departments\nThat had competing fights and and demonstrations and I like income that whether he's familiar with the gangs that came up as as a that fall and then the police and I'll listen over over the Internet thank you so much for\nYour for your most intelligent questions yeah I'm somewhat familiar with the firehouse gangs are from New York and brief civil war because they uh\nUh I wrote about them in the most popular crime or they were in a it was a woman this gets back to pose there there was a woman named Mary Rogers or who was murdered in a New York and I want to say in Eighteen forty five or thereabouts\nA poll home fictionalized says the murder of Murray rosy but the actual woman's name was very Rogers\nThe uh in the uh there was speculation that firehouse gangs were responsible for her crime for that\nCrime that they they it really is an odd thing that there were these fire houses that were really just just a a housing was assembly Joe's of pretty unruly people uh and they and they were kind of terrorizing the city\nSo yeah I I Do the that's an odd story isn't it\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nWe've got callers coast to coast we need to talk with Bill James give us a minute here's we wrap up the last question\nUm we talked about how there were in fact gangs of a fire departments and and I I think if anybody wants to know more about that too it's handy to go to you can watch the movie streets of New York right that Scorsese movie and they think\nThat there's a lot of that that's illustrated in there that's kinda cool but uh she left it because the question about what it if you had a modern police or FBI profile or take a look at this case\nI haven't had to do that because the that would not be in my nature I mean\nYou know but this is\nMy book is written to say that's what I think and if you think something that's up to you I I but I wouldn't ask you a job in Douglas and modern wellness profile or has spoken and written about Alaska or one of his observations was\nThat ah the um\nWell he had several observations about all of a crime that lined up with what we believe for other reasons one\nBut he had several observations about the ... the crime that lined up with what we believe for other reasons one was that the murder had to be older because he is extremely organized\nI mean it is on the chart of how organized is is burger this guy is unbelievably organized or\nThe uh and and also he he um he said that rubber when Kelley who was accused of the ... really couldn't have gone to a because his mind is very disorganized but also because\nHe was not physically strong enough um we know that the Paul Miller was physically extremely strong and extremely agile\nThe um uh so yeah there's something there's something there but not a lot I mean I haven't I haven't asked a profile or for his opinion I frankly wouldn't care what they have to say because you know they got their opinion I got my some of the book is about innocence accused of the crimes that I'll tell you briefly just one of those stories\nAnd murder in Maine and Nineteen oh to\nA man named Henry Lambert who was quite obviously MSN was accused of the crime [noise]\nHe was just a a he was a a a mock around me was I got a an an educated illiterate French Canadian\nWho uh who uh you know ... borderline homeless drank quite a bit\nHe was accused of the crime and it was in prison for Twenty years or before a a became a cause for lab in Maine and a very good lawyer eventually worth of work trying to free him and the free him the governor of the main eventually\nA grab it grab a full pardon to him on a on based on a ... on actual innocence a buddy that happened after he spent Twenty years in jail there are a lot of stories like that in the in the book it's quite on it's a terrible side effect of what happened\nTo the New York police are are not relevant to this story because they were by Nineteen ten in the New York city police were relatively organized relatively sophisticated\nNot relative to now but but relative to the places where these crimes occurred these crimes occurred in places didn't have a police department [noise] they they are they had like a city Marshall and that was it\nThe er so it's not it's not really the the uh not really that connected to my book\nYou know fairness um money just to illustration it in that movie of of how those gangs tied to operate within the government is the where everybody was buying for jobs even if the ... getting insights to keep them um and in the end by the way I think ... or ...\nIndoors what you've done I think you'd so I don't think you'd be a very proud of the way in which the what I Hope\nSo it's a nice you know it really did I don't think I think they would endorse it and I think they would find some interesting insights in there but there's no first time caller Jay does in Chicago on coast to coast am for Bill James days\nHow am\nI go ahead and say I'm I'm Glad to hear you back I call it calls\nThank you yeah thank you\nUm I have a couple of comments for Mr james you're a large and I think and you you um didn't do your homework Bill James basically invented favor metrics for baseball\nSo I have heard and yeah that that's his advisory capacity I Know I I had heard about that on Twitter but I I really I didn't want to get too deep into that ... to bring it up in in law had him for that but yeah yeah uh\nAnd I I really I didn't want to get too deep into that but I'm Glad to seal the to bring it up in in law had him for that\nBut uh yeah uh I I think he needs to be lauded for that is out of a visor who are paid advisor for the Boston Red Sox now but he basically invested ... so his entire life and I and what is China than about my this book\nIs I think you're kind of listen to the bar to play a I'll forgive him for that because I Love you I Will still broader point you think I'm missing I think you're missing [noise] you know that you're talking to a legend okay\nWell if a bill if I haven't even having a ... a appropriately treated you as the legend you are please accept my I'm up all that just put\nThe effort to say that the game it's awfully nice of you the idea of him before I go back to McCain but uh I my ... working in baseball and I appreciate your knowledge that and a protector crime comic\nI understand that I understand why you wouldn't want to make clean connected to what\nI just think that needs to be sad that he has a live in a bag and he's very very far more enjoyable to me throughout my whole life is at your hamster or you know you know what I'm saying though\nBut anyway the reason I call them is there a thing as time of year by you pointed out in Nineteen Ninety or eighty nine game was the first smarter than Boston around you are\nAnd and then I was curious I started thinking about what was the Martin Mars exporters and if there's any connection to them to\nSee it it's a fair question I mean the question we get a lot is a it could these be connected to New Orleans ... murders and and the answer that one is easy no they're absolutely not connected to New Orleans ax murder\nBut that Lizzie Borden case is not as easy to uh to reject because of a time and place\nHowever it's quite a bit different than our murders ... committed with a heavy acts\nThe ... in the middle of the night that Lizzie Borden murders committed with really a a hand hatchet hand held a hatch it in the middle of the day and and they do not have really any of the right on have very many of the signature elements of our crime so I don't think they're connected all by camp\nOr couldn't say that it you know an odd connection between the two crimes is that uh\nThat you probably know that in that Lizzie Borden case there was a man staying with the uh\nUh the board and family are on the night before they were murdered and he was a a farmer who had a farm maybe ten miles from Alaska so that's an odd connection\nA and a ...

Halloween festivities that are coming up we'll talk more about that coming up and just a second and we'll we'll go around the horn\n'em to a couple of places that are celebrating Halloween on the way this Wednesday of course George Will have a terrific Wednesday night Halloween show but uh we'll also talk with the GW Oscar who's the author of a season with the witch\nAnd it's a whole book about the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts you might remember a show we did a couple of months ago\nAbout uh the Salem\nWitch trials and how historians\nHad been changing their views on who were the victims or rather whether they were like really that much of a victim I mean it ... it was fascinating go back if you're a member of\nCaused insider and listen for it but coming up next our this is another sort of historical trip I think you're just going to love along the rails of America the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nOh this [noise] this is this is a great story you'll love hearing about it with Bill James who was a a writer not just of um\nOf general interest books like that but also he's a a sports writer or in Boston and he was of course following very closely what happen tonight in Los Angeles we are not competing against\nHe extended game that the Dodgers ended up playing last night\nUh it was like a double header rolled up into one single game but er but tonight a little different uh Bo Sox lead the series now three to one the Dodgers will get another shot at it coming up tomorrow night to send a serious back to Boston three to two but [noise] but let me just say if it hadn't been for that error\n[laughter] I'm In the top of the thirteenth the bottom of the thirteenth yeah a ... at this would all be over now the boss would be going home with a trophy up at the games over and for those of you that missed the first two hours of last night's show because you were following the game or you should to also go back and listen to it through coast insider\nA and in fact in the very first version of a robot before the ... version of a robot um the robot that has created\nIn the very first version of by robot which was in the late Nineteen thirties or sits down and reads Frankenstein and then has a better understanding of life afterwards\nAnyway the experiments that inspired Frankenstein are up at coast to coast am dot coms a great story to read and and also this one to from the sun\nAbout [noise] a a cover up\nThat may have been exposed Google Earth blind spot over the experimental military base maybe where US government hides crashed UFOs that according to the defense insider\nYou'll see more about that about the the tone Apollo test range in Nevada um and what they have recently uncovered but but if they did\nWell then you know they would become the new Roswell I'm kinda happy with the old Roswell and I'm very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who won needed Jennings who joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita can anything so\nJuanita is the director of public affairs for Roswell\nI'm and she promotes Roswell as a travel and and you know as a professional opportunity at people move to Roswell all the time but this time of year where you get a lot of tourists to come in for the Halloween festivities so I just wanted to ask you what your plans were\nFor Halloween what do you do if if if Ross was kind of Halloween all year long in a way for some people with the discussion of aliens and invading armies and all of that if if it's if it's a Halloween all year long what do you do special for Halloween\nAnd the people go out to grade arm which is a local farm and ranch community just about seven miles out of town where they participate in the core name or the great family ah the coordinates together like the hieroglyphics that\nWere supposedly on the spaceship that landed in Nineteen forty seven either to get every single year and it is a great opportunity for people that go out and really try to experience a dark out on the feeling of getting are in jail for life and you're a\nCrack in Nineteen forty seven other people go out care bye to my heart\nI wake up and ... and ... and and it is our ten miles from our for our whole a great place they are in camp and things like that that I can I'm more more of the star and the ...\nThey feel that they become one or they may come down and uh you know it's just that that theory of there is something here that land it and they're trying to connect with them especially around Halloween and during the UFO festival in July\nSo I ... I'll be traveling through rose while I'm moving coming up I'm In a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through rose well on my way to uh my new position will be teaching a Kansas State and my\nMy ... my younger son and I was always wanted to go to Roswell right so we we we mapped it out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of our way to dip hunter Roswell before we come back up again\nAnd it seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people tour when they're out there if anybody were interested in in being able to\nGo to the crash site or ... or to go to any of the other locations that are ... to the famous story of the crushing Roswell were what can they do\nSo they can go to the rival on international year from him and Research Center which um is a great opportunity to really dive into their historical and the research a part of the clash\nI'm definitely what check out the library for those who are really the seekers and did you believe\nA in addition to that we have a UFO toward that is done by a local researcher he's been doing research on the crash and your first for over Twenty years and he will take you to the exact location of the timing of the incident\nAnd on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival for the first time last year the baroque or families where the crash occurred allegedly they will take you out to the crash\nSite where a Mac rebels rent a house is still kind of in in place and you can see where the crater landed in in the land\nAnd so those are just a couple of of things that I Would definitely recommend that people check out and um you know search for the troops themselves\nOkay so ... to use the word allegedly American which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened you know something we don't know\nI I Do believe there are some people still are kind of on the fence and so we invite people to come and find out for themselves [noise] uh we you know there's a lot of research there's a lot of a local people here that um people can talk to you when you go into the museum\nUh the locals know who the tourists are because at the stature and you will come and walk down our main street and go into areas that one which is a great story\nI bring your camera take pictures stock in the ... visitor center we have to amazing alien that we'd decorate a for each holiday especially now for\nHalloween [laughter] puts on a big fall festival with\nOur police officers and things like that for the community but I'm the they're about six foot aliens and ah people love to take pictures with them and they'll hear the story of you know are employers the month his name is up and ... and uh you know people really come here searching for the truth\nAnd we as local we we don't want to say one way or the other we want them to figure it out for themselves and and you can research\nWell that'd be great thank you appreciate the let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in Raj well or the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the UFO days\nUm so our population has doubled in size we're we're a town about forty thousand and especially on the\nAll [noise] um you know ... ... ... ... are five on average per year for Korean family or whatever the hundred and thirty out and figure out how to dress code you learn every search center [noise]\nPretty good pretty good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts or and so I'll I'll bring in our next guest next but thank you honey to and if I'm if I'm driving through time we get a chance I'll say hello okay create their own care\nHoney to Jennings is the uh the the the director of tourism public affairs in uh Roswell New Mexico a season with the which GW Oscar\nThe subtitle is the magic and may have Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a J W let me just tell you very funny book you read his great sense of humor really enjoy all the\nSort of a comic asides on a serious subject because\nAnd we'll get to the second this is this is a very unusual place in America but it has\nAn even more extraordinary place in the timeline of American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people that come to visit during the month of October is that about right\n[noise] yeah it does that leave out right there are about forty thousand usually um have you on Halloween just how itself it's about a hundred thousand people come um and of course of the month than a quarter million though the massive amount of people for that small city to have a set of orders\n[noise] well I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked\nHalloween insane as the subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative and we just did a guest a couple of weeks ago about a on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that\nUh that that there are other places around the world outside of Salem that had massive hanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\n[noise] yeah I always try to tell people that say more than the first ever which trial wasn't the last ... wasn't the biggest one of the strangest for them you know there are [noise] you know the first for trout America you're a victim was in Connecticut and Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims of course yet injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that lives but still that's an extraordinary number of which has killed\nIt isn't it honestly it's really a problem today even in in um those are developed countries are still being people being asked you for being with us but the the strange thing about that to me of course is that all of the planet that have had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that's Salem, Massachusetts\nThat's which city usa so we'll get to that a season with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem and Salem at Halloween and the way um I like the rub zombie story in there in the book to and then coming up next our on coast to coast am\nWhat is that people need to keep in mind\nEnrollment in the right plan is not automatic with so many Medicare options that can be confusing my advice don't go at it won't get unbiased helped to find a plan that may cost less and cover more with lower copayments more choices like dental and vision and the freedom to choose your doctors with the enrollment deadline only weeks away it's important to act now\nOur health markets Medicare assistance as freight\nThanks Mike this is Michael method for health markets\nFor your free Medicare assistance called eight hundred six nine for forty five forty two that's eight hundred six nine for forty five forty to eight hundred six nine for forty five forty two\n[noise]\n[noise]\nSo the GW ... author of a season with the which I just had to look up some of those steps that we had mentioned\nMore vaguely two thousand eleven ... Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt linkage shirt England a long ago turned its ... incident in which ten people were hanged in sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw\nIn Sweden which memorial for the more than Seventy victims who were beheaded and burned in sixteen Seventy five\nIn Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in the late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused and that's just some of them and not even all that happened\nOne that sticks out and so why why do you do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the craft\n[noise] it's it's really a mystery honestly even that's one of the big questions I had gone to the book and I think it's a combination of probably two dozen different factors honestly that gets Salem as which city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing\n[laughter] yeah that's a big part of it but I mean I'm not a big part of it that's a small part of it but there's about a dozen other reasons why kind of Salem grabbed onto that moniker and kind of held on to it you know over the course of about two centuries\nBut it's kind of a you know you it's among a group shame ... right I mean it's not that's not usually what it holds onto you know that even you know it's we just talked to somebody from Roswell in and that that was an incident that was that happened\nThere but\n... and they they take advantage of that for you know tourism purposes and for whatever reason they want but it's like usually words you don't hear about Chicago celebrating the fact that it was the home\nOf that crazy serial killer seem as world's exposition right you don't know did he do go on their way to put up signs and go it happen here folks\n[laughter] right that is true and I think to to fight for that one is that\nYou know the tragedy in Salem itself was both basically just to the court happened in Salem right it was a civic part of the trials right actual family members and the you know the people who really bear that shame over the course of generations were around Salem the actual the actual stereo started next door in what's now Denver's was at the time to sailing village\nFulfilling itself doesn't really have a ... kind of a generational connection to it it was just the sight of the proceedings\nUm and then on top of that today which city means way more than just the victims but what's trials I mean the actual which is I live there today it means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween since ... sounds kind of become Halloween count as well so it's a determined which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today and twenty Eighteen\nYeah I guess this is important in a ... this is great distinction\nCan't help but feel do and sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering that this this really is about innocent victims of murder [laughter] that they were executed and did they protested their innocence until the end and there's a whole industry tend to build up around them now [noise] yeah\nAnd that is a big ... dealing with that responsibly as something that Salem is kind of ruffled with for you know probably two centuries and a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy that's kind of underneath underneath there for ... so to speak then part of it that's less connected to the tragedy it's more just around\nYou know a city identity and all these other kind of thing just become and into an Eighteen\nWell go back to my central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nAh with with absolute pandemonium [laughter] it really is so they they don't celebrate Halloween day I mean they celebrate a season basically so that they felt it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first and October thirty first um but really the blood over into longer than that\nSo if you want to experience Salem don't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year do you want to visit film at Halloween you're just going to get pandemonium crowd with a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city of failing itself\nIt's Mardi Gras basically it is it really is um your talk again a hundred thousand people packed with this\nFrom the city of failing itself it's Mardi Gras basically it is\nIt really is um your talk again a hundred thousand people packed to the small downtime with the city for failing to the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know five or six blocks\nAnd you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes the freaky each other out to you know go to go to bars watch the fireworks all kinds of stuff so you're you're definitely there for you know again Mardi Gras is a good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans\nMardi Gras you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras\n[noise] um but ... and I imagine for a lot of times in October ... which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get the same festivities educated Mardi Gras anyway but there's probably some amount of alcohol that's consumed during this celebration\nHeld definitely actually right now or in the middle of a nor'easter so that they'll cut him right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween [noise] booze as a part of it but this is within the party\nOkay so ... ... you mentioned haunted happenings but I mean is Salem known for being hunted ... former Salem Village we're seeing them they are there are a lot of haunted houses or were there are there still visitations from the victims of the original Salem trial\nOh yeah there's all kinds of mythology around that it's it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again\nEverything you need for what the classic ... idea of innocent victims you have monsters because of the film was trial then just involved which is in the story involves demons and empty and shapes sisters and goes everything we're in the trials for the big monster mass\nSee all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has you know four hundred years of history or up three hundred and Thirty years of history\nSo that is just you know a lot of dead people over the centuries so yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening and say on the um the ghost tours there's spooky places there's the other side of the executions you have everything you need to build the kind of spooky mythology around the city\nNow you've been there most of these I should say you've\nBeen there right you go there to oh yeah all the time out I was there two weeks ago\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seem to be still situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but it's my fault so I I built a career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the Bennett asylum and murders and all kinds of things and I've never had an experience\nSo my interest in that as more of the stories themselves you know until the day I have an experience my interest has more than the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know goes the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me yeah\nLet's let's the best what's the best spooky story that post Salem witch trials that you've captured while you've been there\n[noise] um well what are the ones that really creepy ones is one of the Boston stream of victims happened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real\nYou know real actual historical event that then I can reverberate and have come without around that Houdini also visited Salem and like escape for him to jail they're so all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know macabre kind of events happened in Salem that nothing to do with the with trials\nIt's all that kind of some kind of feed into that kind of cauldron of uh of mythology around Salem\nYeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was somebody to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm ... ... was there and it can do for him to do like ... or something while he was there\nNo no he was ... or the building actually still stands it's a it's a condominium or apartment complex\nHim to do like ... or something while he was there\n[noise] no no he was ... or the building actually still stands it's a it's a condominium or apartment complex now but it used to be the original jail there there was a police station and he was just there doing one of those things that used to do and he was in town for a performing who go to a local police station or somewhere and perform a quick active you know scape\nAs PR move for his next big event so it wasn't down there doing more of a say on boxing but who is doing is a is a scape escape retain\nLike ... ... ... you you mentioned that there are still which is in Salem how did they get along with this idea of the the ... celebrating painted the victim who did these innocent people who denied that they were which is where do they how do they play into this\nIn fact they don't have to Internet courts with plans to open a third one\nThe courts which operate twenty four hours a day have almost forty judges and

I I just want to make it clear that real life murder is not a parlor game\nUh whenever we speak of murder it's important to remember that the lives lost whether it's one desk\nWhether it's Jack the ripper the Boston Straggler the wages of Salem or the most elusive serial killer in American history about which will be talking to night the lives lost represent children\nWho will never see adulthood adults that will never see their children grow young men and women who had their human potential to offer the world taken away truly innocent people who died at the hands of evil\nIn the words of Clint Eastwood in one of my favorite movies are unforgiving it's a hell of a thing killing them and take away all that he's got an old that he's ever going to have\n[noise] so even as the author of a true crime book myself in a book about how true crime stories are cold and why\nI treat the subject of murder personally the woman that was at the center of my true crime book a black night for the bluegrass bell was the first cousin of my grandmother and a beloved character in my mother's southern family history I wrote that book just set the story straight and defend her on her\nBecause I had started to read the book and then I was told but if the red Sox make the series he can't be on with us so I had read about the first three chapters and then when I heard the Bo Sox made it into the series I I packed\nThe book in my boxes that are heading to Kansas 'cause I'm moving to K state understand you live in Lawrence, Kansas a lot of the\nTwo of them on\nSo I'm moving to Manhattan meant to be ... will be like almost neighbors and\nYet I wind up in Manhattan I Am very well and I regard you\nTotally cool so so I packed the book and then I got the call like\nFour days that are always good to go like uh the book isn't so the head of the overnight me a book that I had it in my hand but unfortunately awesome and I lost a few days reading time so I haven't finished yet and I love\nNothing more than doing an interview on a book I finished reading especially because I can tell already you're building up to a climax that I Do not want to miss with this true story of the the uh the America's most elusive serial killer\nDemand from the train so you're in Lawrence, Kansas and your ear coauthor is your wife Rachel McCarthy James\nSub I call her my daughter read daughter with my daughter she uh she worked with me out of a [noise]\nOkay it doesn't specify that's what I did make an assumption I'm Sorry I should have a figure that out I didn't really say that but I worked\nOut well I'd probably did somewhere but I didn't see it but in any event I just wanted to say I'm a great book obviously desserts all the accolades that ... that you are getting for it and the fact that you very likely crack this case\nIs very much to your credit so I I Want to start if I can with the by the way to congratulations on the ... of the red Sox win tonight and and\nWhat a game last night good thing you weren't book for last night huh\n[laughter] yeah I Would add to capitalize on a little bit of torture [laughter] to keep all the way I have to be going well over here [noise] ah [noise]\nBut you and we mentioned the Boston Straggler last uh last hour you have some experience researching that to do I get that right\n[noise] I wouldn't say so they ah I wrote about the ... along with hundreds of other crimes are going to book I wrote\nMaybe six or seven years ago called popular crime or what I did um uh I was living in Boston at the time that I was writing that book so I took an emphasis in boxes trying their case and publish some theories about what might be right or wrong who knows [laughter]\nWell I Love that I mean I may revisited that because I've always been very interested in that as well but demands on the train is a story it is it speaks to something I mentioned earlier I was in ...\nThey revisited that because I've always been very interested in as well but the mention the train is a story it is it speaks to something I mentioned earlier I was interviewing once uh and ruled the the queen of true crime and I asked\nHer once I said is is there any story too old to be told or when it comes to you know retailing a story about a murder and she said absolutely not\nShe said it doesn't matter how old the story is she said which which best is it's actually you is the author can bring something new to the story if you can solve it that's the best thing especially one that has either been\nIncorrectly adjudicated which we know is certainly a case in in the book so far as I read it but also is true for all the time that that will be of somebody who's falsely accused\nSometimes even convicted sometimes even executed just isn't the case here in the demand from the train a series of murders are happening around the country nobody is connecting them\nYet but in in one at least in one case a ... a a a local guy is accused of robbing a family and killing them and he ends up\nBeing killed for being executed for it and there was nothing he could do even though we know now with these totally innocent\n[noise] they are right there there are two while they're there for people who were actually lovely executed for crimes that may have been committed by the men are trained to them I Would go so far to say I'm fairly certain the crime was committed by the man from the train pulled a local person was executed not alive\nThe or the other two it could have happened but you can't say for sure the uh uh but there were also nine people nine black people who were murdered by Lynch mob who are when I was for crimes that were almost certainly committed by Matt from the track\nWhat year did the murders start\nFirst with an Eighteen Ninety eight but last year we are pretty sure that with him I can crawl although there was a ... there was an interesting crime ten years later that has earmarked but we can't say that it's ...\n[noise] so I looked in the ... I was trying to find an index for the book because I grew up in a town called ... or ... Illinois I saw the town where I'm home alone takes place I grew up not too far away from the the home alone house\nUm and ... the mayor in around the turn of the century in were neck and one of the first mayors of the town I'm was murdered along with his wife in their home\nIn a crime that was never solved and they happen to live right by the railroad tracks is that right\nYeah and it was a story I'd always been told by my mother because um she was kind of into the sort of thing where I get it and uh and ... the the belief was always that it was just some drifter who came off the train broke into the house\nRobbed them and then was able to catch a train and get up and they never found them um but when I was reading this not thinking wait a second that could be somebody else in the in the chart of demand from the train\n[noise] they ... it is possible where you have a we assumed that we did not find every crime that he committed we just we found those er which there were enough signature a sick segment or a characteristics of the crime that you could say with\nSome degree of confidence that they're there for him but they they may well committed and probably did commit other crimes that are we just did not have enough information about it but that that's a new and actually I I I've never heard that story before at all and if you hear my parents\nWhen the murder of a hundred years ago\nI tried to actually signed up this afternoon on it I couldn't um and I wondered whether somebody maybe from the Historical Society had more details but it was Saturday and I couldn't get a hold of anybody\nBut it made me think about it and so if I got something wrong you know forgive me but it's worth a ... a poke anyway so how many people do we think were murdered along America's railroad tracks by single perpetrator\nDemand from the train or who's anonymous for a reason or ... you know during this period\n[noise] well what Rachel I did was we put the murders and buckets right there's a hundred percent bucket that his crimes were certainly have a Seventy percent bucket or forty percent rocket and that ... percent bucket right\nAnd then we total up the numbers of murders and each bucket and multiplied them by their likelihood\nThat I'm a ... that ah it was a a criminal\nAnd the murder the total we came up with as a hundred and one\nThat actually include the two people who were murdered who were executed by the state a lot for crimes they committed and the the uh somewhere between four and nine people who were who were murdered by Lynch mob for crimes that he either did commit or it may have committed\nSome germs are the actual murders and his own hands as opposed to murders to which he would be responsible to polluting the executions as murders because they were innocent um do we say somewhere around Ninety like a solid Ninety victims guy\nOkay that's right All right so ... ... ... a typical crime as you as you see the pattern developing in the late ... uh nineteenth century early twentieth century what was this guy's him oh\nWell this is along this could be a long answer I'm not a long winded person could be a long trip because\nThere are a lot of things the tie them together the crimes happen near midnight almost all of the crimes happen within an hour midnight a family is murder most often a family including a young girl\nIs murdered without any warning and with no known enemies they live usually in a small town at a town too small to have a police department [noise] they live near the intersection of two railroad tracks\nThe I'm a very often bodies are moved their killed with an axe the ax is found in the in the yard of the victims or in the yard of a neighbor and they actually the ban then at the scene of the crime or handle is washed her fingerprints\nThe house is locked up tight to all the windows are the window shades of polls windows if necessary are covered with black it so that you can't see it all the doors are all law [noise] the or or something is jammed in the door [noise]\nAh the head off any move bodies post mortem so the police when they broke and would find a\nCindy ... getting a big we have the kind of fun a show at the we were just a hated the interrupt you because you were doing such a great job with the explanation about the the similarities between the cases and I I think you were coming up to the end but I I had to cut you off because we had the heartbreak at the bottom of the\nPlayers graduated or up to me because I was going to run out of the things to say but I was able to find\nThat part of my Saturdays I can extend like a little bit more of the murder what that says like thirty four of them aren't there or something yeah\nSomething like that the um the uh the crime you normally occurred on Sunday night so you heard on the weekends\nUp until Nineteen can crimes almost all occurred and areas in which the primary industry was ball getting her one of the primary understood was logging the or doors or doors and windows ... shot I think I mentioned that\nThe um [noise] there's all clear idea graphic pattern and the murders if one of hers just south of Portland the next occurs just north of Portland uh that that would be a link between them the uh\nUh one thing that is odd is that he would he would take our lap\nFrom inside the house turn the ... way way down low so that you just gave up a little bit of light take the chairman a offer lamp and set it on the floor usually under a table a and then carry the lamp around with him as he committed murders\nAnd the other thing is that he would a ... foot pole the blankets over the head of a sleeping person or a half a second before you went ahead with an axe are you there are a lot and they probably did that to keep the blood from\nFlying back and hitting hitting him as he was\nHurting someone the or the coup quite a detailed pattern\nYeah very interesting and so this is starting in the in the late Nineteen century and going to the early twentieth century following along logging lines that actually would be consistent with where this murder happened it's not that\nThe town that I grew up in the logging town but it was in between logging towns and if you just go north up into Wisconsin where that line started\nUm that was plenty of logging was going on in in Wisconsin it was it was insane for that matter Michigan just around the other side of Chicago so very likely could have could have followed a poet or another\nThing I forgot to mention there all the all in warm weather with one one possible exception there's one crime that he that he may have ... whether it's first crime which was just an outburst of anger and not\nAnd not a plan to vent probably that occurred in cold weather but he had to flee through cold weather and after that he never murdered anybody cold weather it's always warm weather\n[noise] um we're talking about the Americans most elusive serial killer at Ninety would he be America's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for that to be around\nIt yeah it it probably might be but I I had this discussion with my with my publisher which I Would have which was that they were going to want to say with the worst serial murder and American history or the first or something\nMurder is by its nature done in secret or the ... that in fact that is that is one of the earliest definitions of the word murder is killing got in secret\nThere because it is done in in secret the facts about it are never fully known\nAnd are not ah not normally are fully exposed and uh you get a lot of different people who claimed to be the worst serial murder in American history I don't think anyone has a better claim\nTo that disgusting title than the first person bought uh I'd I'd I wouldn't want to make it because the reality is we just kept document all the crimes to be attributed to a really anybody [noise]\nYeah I mean it's fair to say that if they were the most successful serial killer of all time very likely nobody would ever know about it and they ... they could have done these things\nUsing drifters or people without homes much in the way that you know some serial killers have already performed but in the area of like ten to Fifteen victims fry or John Wayne gay see using runaways and other things that that helped him to elude capture for so long so\nBut the demand from the train is is he is he's called\nAny we have to call them that although we'll get to what you think you'd be discovered about this at in terms of solving the crime is a little bit later on almost don't want to 'cause I don't want to ruin I'm so close to ... you know finishing I was reading all afternoon seriously but then there's a couple of good football games I got distracted at dinner so the ... but this guy he\nNobody it it it it would be president isn't for us to just assume that there was some national\nAwareness of the killer who was lurking along Americans railways be careful if you have a home near train tracks now because there's a guy going in between all of these towns what kind of word was going out about killers alone trains during this killing spree\nWealth of Eighteen Ninety eight and nine paint a loving nothing at all\nThe ... and that this has to do with the organization of the a wire services at that time and Eighteen Ninety eight the wire services were at a very primitive stage and because that's true information had very little uh it relates to have this guy had little ability to spread from town to town\nBy Nineteen twelve of the national wire services were were organized\nIn a small town somewhere it would be picked up by the Associated Press or your PI or or the other a wire services of that era and published all over the nation so after he had been killing people for about twelve years in October of Nineteen eleven all of a sudden there was a a sudden awareness that this was happening\nSo when he went to his most famous crime ... in June of Nineteen twelve\nEverybody knew immediately that this is him and this is the latest crime in this terrible series that's been going on but for the first more than ten years that he was killing people nobody was connecting the dots at all\nEven when logically they should have that even though you look at the crimes that there's a case in Virginia West Virginia where two crimes are committed six weeks apart the er er and and towns that it's a little less than eighty miles from one to the other as the crow flies\nAnd you and the crimes are extremely similar and there's no other crime like that anywhere in the United states and all the rest of the year\nSo you would think that people would connect the dots but they didn't they are the first crime was was hung on the shoulders of a man our little who was later executed for and the second crime was it was investigated as a totally separate event\nAnd that was interesting because they were so close to each other but that doesn't just speech to\nThe lack of say the development in the Associated Press wire it doesn't it's not just that it's also it speaks to the insurgency of the jurisdiction of sharing a police departments and sheriff's departments and there was new national\nUh investigative a body of like the FBI yet so there was nobody that you would report these two anyway that was going to keep track of what was happening around the country at the same time\nThat's exactly true and that introduces dissolves into one of the major themes of the book which is the\nAnd you know I've been writing about crime for a long time ... I'm ... I thought I was fairly knowledgeable about it I was astonished to to realize how backward and ineffective address additional system was just a hundred years ago\nIt's beyond belief how primitive the investigative process that's war at the time of these crimes\nAnd what the man from the train did was to exploit the peculiar weaknesses of of the\nOf the criminal justice system to evade capture\nThe uh he knew that if he committed a crime and got out of town before the crime was discovered there was no no way really to to connect it to him and he knew that if he committed a crime and the big city the police were going to be all over it\nBut if he committed a crime in a small town that had no police force first of all it took them two weeks to get their boots on but but even when they ... they had no resources to come after him\n[noise] and and syringe zinc medicine hadn't even really started yet I mean there's there's ... ... and ... this was a ... and then ... I'll even throw in another ... even in prosecuting that some of the things we we learn 'em ... is that even up until the Nineteen forties\nI'm juries were completely suspicious of crime science [noise]\nUm yeah and I I wrote about this little bit in in a in a true crime book I had written about this murder that happened in my family in that the the ... the jury's the the the defense attorneys appealed to the religious nature of the ...\nIn that the the ... the jury's the the the defense attorneys appealed to the religious nature of the jury's\nBy telling them this is ... it's it's not science\nLook at all these crazy things they're talking about we know none of these things are true now of course we look at juries very differently right and they have a very there now they have to see a side effect when expecting\nEvery stray student on meet the same day life has its peaks and valleys it's all about how you handle yourself to the valley\nDoesn't matter how long you been out of school for the first in your family to go to college it's a time wants to raise your kids poor if you're one Korea now the calling [noise]\nGet it together ashtray university\n... to learn history or university a certified to operate by ...

crime story and that sort of crime stories are they're these little there's a flash of light that eliminates the details of a or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know I think that brings us do you think could lead to the ...\nIowa I'm ended the crime story which as you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a killer on the real ways she gets she gets through what happened in ...\n[noise] an item of June nine Nineteen twelve or the lights were out in Alaska due to a um a dispute between the bullets cause city council and the power company\nFor their heads city lights and street lights but they were out in ... and the town was in complete darkness as this Sunday night there was a church service or a Sunday night church service organized by one of the victims but I've ... the woman who was the head of the house\nAfter the ... after the ...\nI didn't get into this in the book but I think it's true I don't believe in divorce can murders would ... would ever have happened when they did had the light spin on and the reason that was true is that he had committed another atrocity just six days earlier\nAbout a hundred miles away and he normally would not have a had another outraged that quickly but because the lights the city was plunged into darkness it was a perfect opportunity for him and he couldn't pass it up\nAnyway ... um uh the two little girls named Ida Lena still under went home with a more family the family of Henry More they walked home after the church service and and ah the little girls spent the night with the their friend the little girl was a member of the family\nOn the morning of June can no one is stirring around in the house the a and the uh uh his brother finally comes and breaks into the house finds a couple of bodies and runs out of the house scraping they bring the town marshal\nAnd he his name as as a hang court and Mr Horton courageously goes through the house you have to understand he has no reason to believe anything other than that uh a crazed murderer is hiding somewhere in this house here as a dark house\nOr he's holding matches in front of him or with no gun or to no form of protection holding matches in front of a front of his other himself going from room to room finding bodies\nTheir eight dead bodies in the house and in my log house in a small quiet mid western town\nThe um [noise] uh and all of them hit in the head with an axe the access found as it usually is\nNext to the body of a little girl the man from the train was a it was a pervert than he was interested in little little girls and the little girl was usually found in a in an attitude is suggesting that she had been a she had been outraged after death\nThe um [noise] uh in any case the crime was not there was a a great uproar is you can imagine with the crime was not solved a two years later\nOf course and came to Alaska and realized that he could sustain a phony investigation of the crime by keeping people angry he could keep donations coming in by keeping people angry\nOr ... and he did that by accusing ... a very prominent local set of them Frank ... of find that for the crimes there isn't any chance of the world the Frank Jones was guilty or that he had in any any connection to it\nBut this campaign to prosecute Frank Jones a divided pulled us or in a horrible and unprecedented way the city fought over whether or not Jones a dead end or didn't do it for several years uh and became\nA K better battery divided community we have families on one side of the line wouldn't play with families on the other side of the line they wouldn't go that they wouldn't shop if their stores they wouldn't uh wouldn't have anything to do with them\nThat this battle lasted in Alaska for even though a broker San jose eventually run out of town in Nineteen Seventeen\nThe uh um the battle went on for a long time and the hard feelings emanating from it a protest and the city I Would I Would say for two of the extent that they protest to the present day\n[noise] you know you mentioned in the piece about the the\nPerson in whipping up sentiment in making a false accusations of profit from it\nAnd even that creates a pattern for all too often how\nUm crime stories unsolved crimes stories are treated\nYet at the same time it it speaks to the fact that there weren't cold case police officers working that the crime still the crimes have been at that time might have been solved by after that period of time by somebody writing a letter confessing\nFor somebody knowing somebody that but it wasn't it went to almost literally like fall in their lap\nWhich again comes back to the the power of storytelling\nAnd how ... just by keeping my telling a story the beginning middle and end of these events it doesn't matter how old the story is is that it it will get people to listen again into reconsider again and most likely to connect again to that sense of outrage\nAbout what had happened and so you know a static police report won't necessarily you know anger people but when you start telling the story again people certainly yeah\nYeah that's right and and and ... but also keeps kind of the idea of the murder alive it it makes it it gives you a sensation again it is it that is you know the core of sensationalism but it does it make it sort of make you feel it again the fact that this crime in happened\nHad they had they built it you know any kind of memorial to the family had there been\nAny had there been what had the town done to try to come to grips with the fact that this murder had happened prior to even this con men coming to town there afterwards\nThey um [noise] uh ... well there was I don't know that there was that type of sound about I don't know that anyone build a memorial to them [noise]\nI I'm for many years the Alaska authority that I Would say that still true today the ... the the chamber of commerce tribe pipes and below ... was known for something else right right they are ... there there is a house\nFor the crime occurred is still standing of his operated as a kind of of\nIt's the it's a shows up on paranormal ... TV shows and people pay to take tours of the house\nThe I'm a ... if you drive around the less ... there's no sign anywhere that says where the houses are now there'll be a sign saying where the doctors houses but that but uh where the ... ... knowing for is not mentioned anywhere\nThe um uh that's not an appropriate I I I it goes without saying that that's not an appropriate memorial on\nThe um uh I don't know that you raise an interesting question I don't know that in any of these cases there was a a proper memorial to the victims\nVictims were mostly poor people or when people without a without one and the more family was very well like they are and the community uh thought well all of them and the vigorous efforts to solve the crime wore a kind of memorial to them\nUh but I don't think there was any physical memorial to\nYou know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers\n... or there's an effort to try to suggest in enough to be like a statue but it's interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economics peace and that explains everything you know at the\nEnd of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of status or not or you know\nThe um the one of his rather than maps and trains crimes are the double murder and Colorado Springs it murder two families in one night and joining how the uh uh but if you if you go to that community where that happened now the people that area's still remember it\nStill they they could show yeah oh that's a house right there um but it still has not forgotten or many places\nMany places where these crimes occurred it was so long ago that it's totally I'm absolutely forgotten but in some of the ... still quite well remembered\nSo I Want it you know I'm I'm going to make a sacrifice you because\nIt was really hoping to finish the book before the interview but I really want to get to the part about how you think you live narrowed down this suspect so let's let's go through that [noise]\n\n\nBill James the co author of the men from the train to research with his daughter Rachel McCarthy James and by the way when I read more carefully on the back cover it does say that she lives with her husband is not you [laughter] so [laughter]\nSo I got that wrong [laughter] um but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing or you looked at these ah you looked at these murders\nAnd you put them in these different pockets you know the percentage that you believed were clearly done by the men from the train and then well there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that um or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to\nHow many unsolved murders\nWere going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nRight well the murder of an entire family and one of that is a is a rare of that was then it is now but uh uh there were very many unsolved murders in that era\nYou know I mean there's even as you mentioned there just weren't any investigative bodies and if they had one wouldn't the investigation wouldn't last for long because there wasn't a lot of funding but so is let's let's let's go down this path of of the process that you used to try to\nActually narrowed down to a name to a person I've I've seen this done a couple of times right there's been some very interesting attempts to to to name names with regard to Jack the ripper for example\nAnd including going through ships registries and finding whether or not there was a particular sailor that coincided\nWith the murders and white chapel and or other parts of the world\nThat shared similar characteristics as the the crimes in in England but it happened in Central America or happened in in ... and so they were able to try to find\nYou know well this sailor went from this port to that port in in each one of these ports there was a murder so it's it it's a ... but you have to have to START I mean it it's a quite a needle in a haystack but it's\nIt's at least maybe I'm ... you know to to look at it broadly you're you're you don't even know yet what you don't know when you start doing a search like this so you you don't you know is it even possible that name could even be found\nGiven the scarcity of information about you know people are public registries during that period\n[noise] [noise] ... the Jack the ripper case I Am I\nProbably twenty bucks saying jak the river was this guy or whatever it was that guy or a jak with\nThe uh and I and my other book popular crime I made fun of the people who wrote those books um the uh uh because I don't I don't have much confidence that you can actually do that and to be Frank\nAlmost all of the arguments that Jack the ripper is this guy or that guy almost all of them are selling\nThe um I never really expected that we would find it convincing argument about who this who was doing this so I mean we were looking gas\nAnd Rachel says she did expect to find him but I didn't the um uh but when we walk the crimes backward\nA there is a crime in Massachusetts and Eighteen Ninety eight that Rachel says the moment she saw it she knew it was him\nThe um uh and that was because I had told her that this guy would make mistakes and in his first crime he did make numerous mistakes that let everybody know who he was\nThe um [noise] uh but the number of details that match up in the first crime to let's say Alaska\nIs is just it's beyond anything that you would you would a suspect was a could be coincidence and I'll I'll mentioned just a few things\nYou did you did you want me to give me the name or not it doesn't\nMatter to me is newly will Lewis million go through the coincidence or go through the the similarities first\nWell ... the first crimes that were sort of publicly lake where crimes in the Portland area and two crimes in the Portland area where we're committed rather obviously by the same man and the the tech the same detectives happen to\nBe investigating him and thought this is the same guy that crime a month ago down\nSouth for the the uh uh that criminal had size six feet the um there's another crime in Maine and Nineteen oh two in which the criminals there were there were a pair of boots prince that were central to the trial\nOr again size six feet is a very uh the the so we we know that this is a small man\nWell it is recorded about man that we found that he did in fact have size six feet not speculation he did we know that we ... it was believed that he was small because I'm\nThe or a ... and in other places\nWhen he swung the acts the ceiling was very low the ceiling is only about seven feet high in the room where the murders were committed but when he swung the axe over his head he just barely grazed the ceiling if a person of normal size a person of\nA if a person a large man could not swing an axe over his head in that room without sticking it in the ceiling because of that it was believed that he had to be small he was five foot for the uh uh\nIt was suspected if you look at the blood pattern the way the blood flies off the ax you can see clearly whether it's the guys basically left handed or basically right hand and that's a pretty easy thing to see\nIt was believed that the murder in Alaska was left handed the man who committed the crime and Eighteen Ninety eight was left handed we had said that he had to be a well the the first stories about him say that\nAnd we had said that he had to be a well the the first stories about him say that he was an experience trap that he would travel around the nation on trains for a while and then he would settle down into an area [noise]\nWe had said that he must work as a longer because all the crimes for about ten years occur and logging areas the first story about him or her stories about him specifically say\nThat he was inexperienced longer\nThe uh uh the nature of the crime itself the special attention to the a ... girl a that was there and the first crime in the first cry he always kill the man of the house first and the a\nAnd ended with the murder of a young girl that's what he did in first crime they he always used the blunt side of the X.\nI never even I wouldn't say it I Can't say he never killed anyone with a sharp ... but it was always his intention to use the blunt side of the acts and the spurs crime blunt side of the acts\nAnd as he would do in Alaska and many other places he left the acts on the floor beside the young girls that the um so the crime just matches up on too many points\nFor you to think that this isn't him\nSilly you started to look for signs for left handed pedophile knickers Seeley I didn't even longer ax murderer\nOr ... ... ...\n... how did you begin to narrowly name out of that\nThe when he committed first crime he it was obviously ... who could it's pretty clear that first crime is obvious who had committed it 'cause he was living with the family which that's a common thing that cereal murders first crime he often kills people\nTo whom he ... his directly connected and can be tied so we killed the first family and Eighteen Ninety eight everybody knew who who had done it because he fled the scene and\nI Would say they were looking for it just it all of these other facts about the first about the criminal happened to line up with what we were looking for\nAnd didn't name that you believe is the demand on the train\nThe ... the name that he was using their was Paul Miller the weather that we use ... he ... he was a German immigrant the or whether that was his actual name or not um this is speculation he could have been using a false name even that however there's no real reason to believe he was\nWe found that I shouldn't say we found a friend of mind doing research on his own after the book was published found a the the ships record in which he had entered the country about an Eighteen Ninety\nThe I'm a probably a man named Paul Miller had entered the country I'm On a ... he was he walked with a sailors gate he you know if\nIt was like it in there and walk side to side the uh uh and the uh uh\nUh they they so he he had been in the German army\nA German Navy so ah they found that ship within which came with came into the country", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM
