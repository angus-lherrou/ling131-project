dysfunctional uh they claim they want to go to the moon but they're not even planning a reasonable plan to do that\nAnd um so I think it it's going to be one of the new kids on the block that gets us there\nAre you happy the privatization is taking off the way it is and that NASA is kind of like feeding away\nI'm happy that privatization is taking off I Am not happy that NASA's human spaceflight program as dysfunctional\nUh I'm not happy about that at all um the uh you know I ... it would be disastrous NASA's robotic space flight program and space astronomy programs became is dysfunctional as the human spaceflight program but\nI mean it's really sad to see this program they I mean that storm cabin in the Nineteen sixties doing this crazy stuff now where you know they say they want to go to the moon and I was at a conference in Florida a month ago where a high level NASA official got actually got up in front of an aerospace audience and said\nWe're not ready to land on the moon we don't know how to land on\nThem [laughter] ... what happened in Nineteen sixty nine [laughter]\nYeah you you you got it may be there waiting for all the people that can remember that to die off so they can help people they did it the first time\nIn that statement alone Robert will make all the people who do that we went to the moon jumper joy and say see I told you so\nWell I got to tell you guys like him didn't take us to the mood um and I mean here's the thing you know they're saying before we go to the land on the moon we need to build a ...\nYou guys like him didn't take us to the mood um and I mean here's the thing you know they're saying before we go to the land on the moon we need to build a space station orbit around the moon which is totally crazy\nIt's totally crazy and it's and they want to put it in this weird orbit which is going to be hard to get to and hard to get to the moon from it and hard to get back to it from the moon it's going to add propulsion requirements is going to add timing requirements to any lunar mission I mean ... let me tell you what this they called us the deep space gateway\nYeah OK and let me tell you what I call it the lunar orbit toll booth okay\n[laughter] the the the\nHere's an analogy let me say I offered you the following deal I Want to read you an office in Saskatoon now you're going to have to pay to build the building and you're going to have to pay a hundred thousand dollars a month rent and it's a thirty year lease you can't get out of it\nAnd you must go there and stay there at least one month a year and if you want to fly anywhere from your home you have to pass through Saskatoon to go there\nI pass a bill passed on that had the whole and this thing\nIs what I buy the ... and you probably sell me what you buy the swamp blend you probably want to sell me a lot\nBetter off with the swamp land then with this ... ...\nYou get on with measles doing what he's doing falcon next base acts are it's a good thing you're right it's just you know for someone like you and\nAnd me the way we grew up during the space program watching NASA just kinda and not do much anymore with manned space flights and it's it's just a poignant Robert it really is\nWell it is and I mean look you know our parents' generation one World War two they had a government that was functional and that government built the interstate highway system and that government got us to the moon\nAh and and now we we see this thing is just dysfunctional it's incredible um I mean it's not all NASA I mean this is across the board we had a a major deterioration in the quality the political class in terms of its ability to execute great projects\nOn it and act on the basis of public spirit instead of partisan\nA chaos and the the the you know so there it is but uh I gotta tell ya you know\nI was hoping that the new NASA Administrator who was delayed and getting into office for quite a while would come in and say I'm not buying this crazy lunar orbit space station this is you know what the incompetence who\nPreceded us uh you know wanted to do I'm going to straighten this out we can certainly land on the mood I was hoping bright it's fine would do that but he didn't he just went along and I'm just shocked frankly\nA couple of weeks ago when I was in Los Angeles I had a chance through a witness the flight of one of the falcons a at night and then it came back it was a reusable and it was just gorgeous Robert watching that and half the people who are looking into the skies that night\nUh the they didn't know what it was they thought it was a UFO or something like that but it was spectacular to watch it's incredible technology isn't it\nWell it is a although I mean one might say it's about time uh because sure we started the space\nAge with expendable rockets and you'd figure that fifty years later we finally get him to be usable so I'm Better late than never and and here it is and\nAnd I got to tell you this thing that Musk has done in creating these reusable rockets and and and and and he's reduced the cost the space launch by a factor of five\nIt's a kilogram before must now it's two thousand dollars a kilogram dramatic\nIt's dramatic it's spectacular and it was done on a shoestring compare to [noise] um what a NASA considers normal for developing new space systems\nI mean it was done like for one tenth the money in one third of the time that anyone a it was accepting would be normal and this thing I'm at the results has been not only a these remarkable space systems that space Texas fielding\nIt is causing a private money to get into space and a number of other advanced fields that people thought were hopeless uh so okay Bezos has his own money's got large and but we now have three small launch companies a firefly\nA vector space um electron a these are small launch vehicle companies that have all gotten you know investments on the order of Seventy million a hundred million dollars a two to field a small launch systems\nAnd it even goes beyond the the space industry\nWe now have fusion power startups getting funded because people you know they were looking at future parents all this has just never going to happen they keep on saying it's going to happen in Twenty years and now it's been Twenty years and I think another Twenty years\nAnd but people in say maybe it's not really an impossible technical problem maybe the ...\nAnd um [noise] I gotta tell ya I actually worked in the fusion program in the Nineteen eighties and\nI can remember one lunch we had at Los Alamos when the group leader looked around the table and he said to all of us you know when fusion powers finally developed it's not going to be at a place like Los Alamos or Livermore it's gonna be a crock pot working in his garage yup well maybe not a crock pot\nIn his garage but I think probably a start up working in a warehouse is going to do it\nAnd he's going to get funded and God Knows what is going to be able to do with the Robert stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about space next hour we'll take phone calls with you Robert you were in our special guest tonight for a couple of hours lacks the coast to coast\nAlways on your own you'll be happy to know the ... website is no optimized rule users just point your iPhone or Android ... to ... dot com and enjoy\nCan I say he's an unusual guy I'm new like him a yeah although we can be a difficult at times uh ... I mean he has a sense of humor it's kind of dry and uh he he is um [noise]\nUh okay look um the thing to know about Iran is is this okay on the one side he well he he is very driven is very hard working a A N pie is\nAh driven to want to do\nSomething great for the human future he wants to be a person for the ages he likes money he likes cool things he can buy with money but that's not what he's about uh\nNow he he he really wants to do he he wants to go down in the history books for doing something great for for human kind and and so that's the other side of it okay is that\nHe doesn't just want to do great deeds he wants eternal gory for doing great feet so he's not Mother Teresa he can be selfish uh he he um and he certainly\nUm I'm not above using people ah [noise]\nAnd you know if you look at some of the things about him that um\nDidn't come off so well like Kim getting angry that he couldn't be the one that rescued those kids in Thailand um that that's the other side of it so you're a ... you know there is [noise] um ... you know a self assigned\nTo it but it's not selfish for money it's it's it's it's it's selfish for eternal glory for doing great teachers eagle\n[noise] it's not in fact he ego it's it's you know if you read Greek mythology like the only add\nThis is what homers heroes are about they are about eternal glory for doing great deeds or Shakespeare's Henry the fifth you know uh\nUh when he gets that speech you know we few we happy few we band of brothers he he wouldn't want anyone else there with him at action core to to fight the French because he he even though the odds are more against him he doesn't want to share the glory with anyone\nSo you know that's must to a tea and um\nAnd and and so but really um [noise] you know that that's the classical motive of the hero okay so I I think must give us a hero not a hero in this\nYou know that that's the classical motive of the hero okay so I I think must gives a hero not a hero in the sense of being a perfect person but a hero in the sense of being the kind of person\nI'm a ...\nThat is depicted as a hero in literature a that is a person who wants to win eternal Gloria Knight errant who goes out a looking to slay dragons looking to do something terrific uh ... that's what he's about but you know um\nHow would you can hear him to just ... Robert Well Jeff ease those as much calmer I'm much more laid back um\nI don't know these cells I met him once uh uh but that was certainly my impression uh\nAnd if you look at how the two companies are run a they reflect at a mosque is extremely driven he wants to stun fast a he wants everything done yesterday and um\nThe company takes chances and thus far um they're winning 'em but it's certainly a\nThere they pushed very hard bees owes the model of his company is step by step ferociously he's not in a rush measles strength and his weakness is that he has unlimited funds\nNow why a limited funds that sounds like a strength doesn't it [noise] um well in one sense it's obviously is a but the and the other sense it isn't because if you have unlimited funds you have unlimited time\nAnd that's why at this point space X is racing ahead of him so this is the you know ... the hair\nUm blue origins the tortoise and ah it'll be interesting to see who wins this race\nYou know measles is at least ten times as rich as mosque okay so I mean must you know by the standards of you and me and almost anybody um is a very rich person he's the Ninety fourth richest person in the world according to Forbes\nAnd is he doing all this with his own money or is he getting financing what's he doing\nNo mosque or is it well he started out doing it with his own money right now it's partially his own money but he's also want a lot of contracts for launching things for NASA effort the military\nBeing so just doing it all with his own money okay these shows you know is the richest man in the world ah and he you know he says I can just take a billion dollars worth of Amazon's stock each year sell it off I got a billion dollars I'll spend it on blue origin\nSo he he has unlimited funds and he thinks he has unlimited time\nI'm mosque knows that I'm you know in aerospace a cost just people times time\nOr the quicker you just do something the cheaper costs people say things like oh if we uh uh uh uh try to do Mars you know within ten years it would cost much more no it would cost much less\nUh because uh you know space program is like riding in a taxi cab and it costs you whether it's standing still or whether it's moving\nYeah that is true let's talk about our mutual favorite subject in March what what's going on with some of these latest discoveries underground lakes and things like that Robert\nYeah well it's pretty spectacular okay the European bought all these experiments or ex discoveries by the way are being made now with a [noise] um something it's not exactly news\nIn ... all these experiments or ex discoveries by the way are being made now with a\nUm something it's not exactly new but is is is finally really showing its its stuff which is a ground penetrating radar than his radar that can look through the ground and see what's underground\nAnd um the ground penetrating radar on the European Mars Express pro found an underground lake on Mars it's salt water\nUh and um but it it's definitely from the point of view of microbial life a habitable environment\nUm it's been suspected by a lot of scientists and by me um that uh there was a liquid water underground on Mars it has now been found\nAnd I believe that we're going to find a lot more because there's no reason why this Lakewood just exist in one place I think there's an underground water table on Mars uh and um you know on earth\nSome of the earliest organisms that ever lived on earth are still living deep underground in the ground water the surface of the earth has changed radically it's no longer habitable for them but the ground water is is as it was billions of years ago and they've been down there and\nIf there was ever life on the surface of Mars it would have retreated into that ground water and it'd be they're still\nNow then beyond that the ground penetrating radar on the American the Mars Reconnaissance orbiter has found\nGlaciers on Mars at mid latitudes that is a a mountains of pure water ice and something like a a million cubic kilometers\nOf pure ice covered by just a few feet of dust it's right there and it's a mid latitudes that is it's as far south is thirty eight ... a a north and the northern hemisphere Mars which by the way the same latitude to San Francisco\nSo imagine that there were glaciers in San Francisco and Denver and you know a Washington DC you know that's the latitude that these things are\nAnd what it means is that there's water readily available on Mars and not just you know I'm half a kilometer or a kilometer underground like this lake is but right at the surface where you could get out with a shovel\nThat's exciting you know some people this is strange some people say that if there's life on Mars or even the possibility that we shouldn't even go there and that's that's weird why\nWell that's a pretty crazy point of view um I think there's there's ... there there's two different versions of it one is the scientist saying if you go to Mars um them if we find life there we won't know whether we brought it or not okay\nContamination\nWell that's like saying if you go to France she won't know if the people there are French or not I mean that that that because they might have all gotten off the plane with you I mean what if if if\nHow do we know that there's actually people in France and they didn't all just show up when you did well for one thing there are houses and there's the arc de Triomphe and there's the Eiffel Tower there's all this stuff that they built in the past well if there's life on Mars today it was there in the past and there will be fossils of it\nAnd I mean to to to say that fossils of life on Mars don't prove that the life you find there was there before is like the people who say that dinosaur bones don't prove that there were dinosaurs because God could have put the dinosaurs\nAre you prepared to navigate today's bond markets for your clients\nWith decades of

Washington and welcome to the program John go ahead\nAnd ... and like oh You're welcome thank you for your your guest's name Robert\nRobert Robert are great questions of people who are um oh probably take 'em off here [noise] they're sort of speculative the first is um\nDo you know anything about this earlier the guy that that we're just talking about anti gravity back in the sixties\nAnd conversely you know anything about a couple reversal of being able to generate artificial gravity\nAnd secondly you know anything about electrical ... or ... from the\nAh let me ask both of those three questions when you got one more Robert and you got one more okay one more\nWhen you are the third one is um would be viable to design a space station like a memorial type thing to test I'm a human physiology reacts to Mars gravity\nAll right Robert let's take that one first go ahead\nAll right well let me just a run 'em down quickly then maybe a provide some detail the first one in Lear jets in anti gravity I don't know anything about that\nSecond question artificial gravity um which goes along with your last question of a spinning spacecraft yeah we do know how to create artificial gravity you spin the space craft\nCrates and cheer physical force that mixed gravity and that's a uh in my view or a very wise thing to do on a long space voyage in order to ah prevent the deterioration of bone and muscle that you get with um\n[noise] is zero gravity for a long range belongs to a long time so\nExactly 'cause if you you know anybody who just walks around on earth the you know not an athlete just a person that you know walks around the house goes to the store they they get somewhat of a workout 'cause they're carrying a hundred and fifty pounds on their feet and and and and and and you know and moving around a\nA worse in space just floating around in zero gravity you don't get that\nAnd so in fact I Do recommend artificial gravity for use on trips tomorrow so not that we couldn't survive going there and see all grab it\nIf you're going to Mars to explore you don't want your astronauts arriving there in a weakened condition though about liberal\nBarely do anything for you\nRight and then the the the third question was electrical repulsion yeah I Know a fair amount about electrical pulse and\nI'm electric propulsion is using a electric or electromagnetic forces to accelerate repellents to very high velocity she'd get about ten times the exhaust philosophy with an electric fluster that you can with a chemical roster\nThe problem though is that it requires electricity to run them and typically the power sources way a lot\nAnd that means that I'm your power is limited and therefore you're thrust is limited\nAnd what that means is that electric propulsion systems are kind of like a car that gets a thousand miles to the gallon and but it goes from zero to sixty in a week I'm not terribly useful for short distance driving around town\nBut if you were going to drive around the world and let's say there was somehow a road that went all the way around the world\nOkay you floor of the car you know in San Francisco and\nUm you know a week later going sixty miles an hour and you've reached a the east coast and now you can go driving around the world because your car and drive over water in this case but in any case now you you you have a tremendous advantage in that your your your mileage is great\nBut if you're going from earth to Mars and actually takes longer to get there with electric propulsion than it does with chemical bullshit if because it the time it takes to speed up is longer than the time it takes to get there on the other hand if you're going from earth to Saturn electric propulsion would get you there faster\nRobert if you had to pick one man going back to the moon or going to Mars which would you pick\nPick Mars you would um because you know I mean look we went to the moon fifty years ago or we're not going to inspire the next generation by doing things that their\nGrandparents' generation dead or the science on Mars is far more profound we're going to discover the truth about the potential uh existence and diversity of life in the universe and Mars has got much more resources so many to compare Mars to the moon\nTo the choice in the age of ocean exploration Mars compares to the moon to way North America compared to green point you know Greenland was closer to Europe Europeans got to Greenland long before they got to North America\n[noise] but it wasn't a place where you could build a civilization that didn't have all the different resources and uh so Mars is is is you know it's a much richer world\nBut you know here's NASA and frankly doesn't have the confidence to take on Mars\nWell then they say well then we'll go to the moon well what I see is okay if you think you need to go to the moon before you go to Mars then get on with they go to the moon don't come off with some other thing that's a halfway house you have to do before you go to the moon because if we can go to the moon fifty years ago we could go to the moon now\nHow can you believe in the next July will be fifty years since we went to the moon with the first time fifty years already rubber where did the time go\nYeah I don't know I was Seventeen when we landed on the moon and if anybody you told me then that I'd be sixty six and we'd be sitting here stuck on earth I I I Would have thought they were crazy\nYeah I Would agree easily the Rockies Joe's with us Long Island New York Hey Joe go ahead\nBut I'm Sorry they can get to go to the mall but a couple of questions and deep\nNew York Hey Joe go ahead\nI'm Sorry they can get to go to the mall but a\nCouple of questions and deep space\nUh when we send out these probes are what you are or what would you be dealing with extreme heat even open space as opposed to the planet and would it\nBe advantageous to us to kind of go to mercury though with some sort of probes in case back here we have one away a global warming due to maybe solar flask combined with CEO to increase was\nUh in other words what the spin off of dealing with extreme heat and space help us to deal with it potentially back here and also what kind of person would profile are going to Mars\nUh how would you profile a potential candidate to travel on a ship come to Mars what type of ... looking for\nAll right let me take the questions one time or the first question it'd be hot and space if you're close to the sun um if you are a far away from the sun is called uh and uh [noise]\nIf you're in earth orbit time it depends on whether you're in the sun right now or not\n[noise] um but um\nYou know we do have a kind of I mean you can't you can get the reason why spacesuits white is because they they can overheat from sunlight and they want to reflect most\nAs much as you can\nWrite a on the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so you kind of have to watch that uh but space itself doesn't really have a temperature but certainly the the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it you get hotter much faster\nUm now the second question\n... people well okay\nHold on for a second the Robert we're going to hit the brake already going by fast with you Robert ... with us we'll be back well ah let them finish up Joe's questions there and the interesting what kind of a personality would want to go to Mars will be back in the moment on the coast to coast am\nFeeling lost not by your radio grab

Mars uh [noise]\nUm I mean quite literally and and some are people that are you might well one on a crew a that's going to Mars and others not a chance that the caller asked what sort of people would I select to go to Mars um\nAnd I'll tell you it's real simple it's the same sort of people that you would select to go on a say\nA a hiking expedition with you I'm a or an exploration ah adventure of any kind um they're the people who you know have a high spirits are fun to be with that sense of humor\nA you know or not you know a ... um and and and ... and and and you know and and the people who can laugh when things go wrong and people who you know our\nUm and and and bitchy and and and you know and and the people who can laugh when things go wrong and people who you know our one for all end all for one\nThat's who you want to take to Mars what's going on with your August conference you're working on\n[noise] uh well we're having another conference a in August uh or actually this year it might be in September in Los Angeles [noise] um if he could uh it it's probably going to be at one of the major universities in Los Angeles [noise] um and ah\nI'm sure we're going to have all sorts of debates about things like is this lunar orbit gateway or told you said a gateway or is it a toll booth okay you know we're going to have that one out\nUm you know we're going to have all sorts of presentations on the latest discoveries you know it there's a Mars probe on its way it's going to land in November ... insight and it's going to find out how a geologically active Mars is so that's kind of land this November and we'll probably have\nUm a discoveries from it um there's also a new space telescope that just got into orbit um a couple of months ago which will be reporting\nData discovering planets going around other stars\nOr am I guess it will have discovered hundreds by them and you will probably discover thousands what's done um called Tess um you know a will you know since we're going to be in Los Angeles will have a scientist from Jet Propulsion lab coming over and\nTalking about a um all the latest discoveries from the rovers on Mars and the plans for the next one's ah probably have space X people talking about what they're up to I'm hoping to get flu arching people there too so we can hear from them\nAnd maybe some from the the the small entrepreneur rocket companies like Victor space just got funded by Seventy million dollars to create small launches you know the we now have\nSmall satellites that can do what it used to take big satellites to do and so small rockets make a lot of sense\nI'm and I'm a I myself from involved and design of a mission to go to the moon with ground penetrating radar with for satellites each of which are the size of a shoe box um and so little watchers like this could really play a role I'm\nAlright psychiatry more calls where you go to the first time caller Armand in a bill guards California go ahead Armand\nYes good evening George did you and your guest I just wanted to put something on your radar screen so to speak\nAnd that is that you may not be aware of this but there's a whole new paradigm for water planetary water on not only earth but on march if you're interested in learning more about it you can go to geo water I. N. G. L. dot com\nLike international your water international and the reality is that it's already been demonstrated on this planet but the water comes from them that look below and whatever you got the ... the planet fractured\nThat water that hydrogen and oxygen elemental hydrogen option can make it too late to the surface I moved back in areas the goal is worthy of structure that happens quite often\nAnd on Mars the same effect is there in fact the largest grow up and you know in the solar system is Olympic moms are bars which is over eighty thousand feet tall just for digits there was a cold beer on top\nAnd that's what brought her provide Scott city or lava flows that happens so\nAnd that's what brought her her by Scott city or while the flows that happen so that's really where the water has always been on Mars and that's where the water is on this planet and it's time I think for a start factoring that through our calculations for Mars trip\nWell said rubber what do you think well I I\nIt sounds interesting we certainly know there's a lot of water on Mars we found the lakes we found glaciers in this probably more to fine so I think he's on the right track\nDo you think we are the Martians that's a long time ago either organisms flew here for ... it'll chopped up media writes a slow off the planet\nOr or maybe they had a full blown civilization long time ago and the skiing I think\nI think the former is is this a good chance is true ah in not civilizations but a microbes on on meteors a because Mars um well a couple things first of all\nLife appeared on earth almost immediately after it could\nWhich either means one of two things that life can evolve very quickly from chemistry or that life was floating around in space and as soon as the earth was cool enough\nFor life to to prosper here the ... it landed in the seeds to cold as it were\nUm and now if you think about that when you say here's Mars nearby it's being hit by meteors knocking chunks offsetting I'm flying and hitting the earth we're hit by Mars meteorites all the time [noise]\nUm if life could evolve quickly out of chemistry it would have on Mars Mars cooled before earth to Mars have liquid water before or that\nSort of life is is is a quick study evolving rapidly from chemistry it would've occurred on Mars first and then it would have landed here so there is a good chance that it came for Mars\nThe the the the a and also that is supported by the fact that we find no organisms on earth no free living organisms simpler than bacteria and bacteria are really pretty complicated\nThey have this whole shirt DNA in are in a whole alphabet for transmitting genetic information [noise]\nUm you know or imagined you you've found a um an ancient manuscript that I had a complete alphabet along with all the punctuation marks and everything and\nUh it could not possibly be the first written document that they would have to be more primitive things before you know the complete alphabet and punctuation and commas and paragraphs and all this had been worked out\nSo uh but bacteria have all that so that suggests that\nThey came here already fully developed it could've come from Mars or maybe both earth and Mars is needed for interstellar space\nI just lost his how did you get interested in all this Robert\nSputnik that did it for yeah\nWell I was already somewhat interested I I was an early reader I was five when Sputnik flu\nAnd while to the adult world split it may have been a terrifying event to me was just great ah because what it was proving was that the um the space faring uh stories that I was reading we're going to be true\nAnd I can remember reading about uh like it the space dog in my weekly reader and later a um the ... and ... the next space dogs and you know uh I have a dog today\nI'm a beat the struggle was the first off to come back from space alive and she even had puppies and Khrushchev gave one to Jackie Kennedy and um and her descendants are alive today um anyway so um\nIf you have a passion a vision for your future in any field today's military dot com can be your past you're filling courier you have a calling and we have an answer find your way at today's military dot com\n[noise] news then talk on the radio stations use radio Thirteen ... murder at\nThe University of Utah I'm ...

nine for nine radio or one eight five five nine for nine seven two three four\nI there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity alright and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and um you have psychic abilities\nHum ship coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is I'm so those who are are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans May New we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways but the physical environment affect certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nUm there is a researcher out there Michael J. our who categorize these environmentally sensitive people um and what he found was people who are environmentally sensitive have you know long standing allergies chronic pain fatigue migraines fibromyalgia and just an overt sensitivity to light found my\nCity and smells more than maybe me and you do so I could walk into a room and be fine other people could walk in the same room and they smell cologne from all over the place they all get ashes [laughter]\nSo these environmentally sensitive people actually way way way more paranormal experiences than the general population um there's those higher it's a really high number\nAnd what the thought is is these environmentally sensitive people are picking up on whether it's asked federal magnetic fields more than the general population in other words they have a better antenna or biological radio\nAnd the electromagnetic spectrum than other people so we all are we all have radios with basic equipment to tune into things but some people have really really really redefined are sensitive radios are and they're picking up on things in it and detecting things in the environment that normal people don't pick up or the general population doesn't\nSo this ability to truly experience paranormal phenomenon\nIt's it's more likely to be detected are registered among this group and I think that's a fascinating thing so we have environmental sensitivity which there's a lot of research suggesting obviously it's viable and it's real I think in Canada you can be on disability for certain types of environmental sensitivity\nSo there's science behind it and then there's also science saying these people are having way more ghostly encounters why is that and then that's kind of where we go a little further into that\nTo some of these people brand didn't realize how sensitive the yard to picking up these things do they know they get it\nI I think they do it in in in when I go out there and I my research was done I had I talked to a lot of people who are environmentally sensitive\nAnd what you find is you know\nNot only or do they pick up on things or have way more paranormal experiences but it's genetics so their mom did to wear their dad and then they're ... and so forth and so on so this is something kind of like most you know genetic diseases or or what not this kind of passed down from generation\nAnd listen they know they're sensitive to the environment um just by walking into places some people\nYou know like I said get rashes um they can um the under neon lights some people almost allergic to electricity or so these types of people just experience a different world and and believe me they know it affects them probably more negatively than it does positively\nYou know you talked about some of the reality television shows Brenda my criticism them\nBecause they always seem that they have to have some kind of goes down because it's television and you know they don't want to do this three minute program and not have anything happen so looks like the ...\nTelevision and you know they don't want to do their three minute or one hour program and not have anything happen so looks like they create these things and I think that kinda hurts the credibility of some of these uh episodes don't you\n[noise] [noise] yeah I think yeah I think it is it really does too because it implies that either\nPeople or misinterpreting normal things or there's over fraud and um you know every ... those those people who do this on a regular basis and are genuine no you know out of ten locations that you go to you might have a one experience\nIt's really impossible to have you know thirty or forty experiences every time you go to a location 'cause then it's your muddying the waters and I and then you kind of lean towards that that fried type of\nThing so we've we've talked about the individual who might have the ability to spot goes to fuel ghost more than others but what about the ghost itself or there's some does that come back more often than others or because they have an ability to do that\n[noise] um I think it's really I guess which one is stronger and when you think about it is the person's ability to sense that goes if if I'm really sensitive to it I'm going to pick up those encounters a lot more than everyone else\nSo I might pick up on a ghost town ever civil war soldier I'm very often if I'm really sense\nI mean a good a good radio or real good radio probably from she crane is the ability to pick up a weak signals from radio station\n... isn't that much that way with the person that if that person is a good receiver he or she may be more apt to pick up these grossly things\nExactly yeah exactly so you know ... and ... and that that kind of a boils down to the environmental sensitive per se\nUm they're going to have a way way way more goes encounters and um so I think it has to do to your prior question I think it has to do mainly with the person not so much that goes for encounter the environment\nBut you have to ask you know hey I'm an environmentally sensitive person I pick up on all this stuff\nYou know I go from place to place to place throughout my day however one location I'm picking up a lot of um having a lot of goes Lee phenomenon happened to me um the places pretty active whereas in other places it\nBut then you start asking yourself why why that place and and why not the other places um so then you have to go into why is the location have more um paranormal\nPhenomenon ... out of the other locations you know it's like those antennas we had the rabbit here was\nYou know why is this configuration picking up channel thirty three and this configuration is that\nYou know what I'm saying you have to figure out the right combination of things that happen for um the TV to show up in a clear picture and the same with ghostly encounters you have to figure out the right sort of ingredients are variable of that line up the habit goes counter location is one person has to\n'em and then there's there's probably other ones that I you know we haven't really identified at this point\nBut the person not only of their sensitivity but their internal ... electric a consciousness of all this stuff really plays into it and it's really fascinating to me it\nReally is I remember when my dad brought home a better TV and you know there was the kind that didn't just move with the rabbit ears\nBut it had like a little knob on it that you collect and it brought into signal better that way too and I thought for use this technology amazing how times have changed Brenda\n[laughter] I remember those two [laughter] do you know or have you\nIs this technology amazing how times have changed Brandon\n[laughter] I remember the fifth [laughter]\nDo you or have you come across demonic\nSpirit in your work\nUh no I haven't and I get that question a lot though the the theme of questions seems to be getting more and more prevalent in the last five years or so\nI think you know when you have a ghostly counter or you have some sort of phenomenon happened to you it's amazing it's great uh and then you want to start maybe putting labels on it you know this experience what the good the bad with a positive with this with that and I think when you start putting negative to it then you start feeling like it's demonic\nMhm demonic team is more of a religious perspective than it is sort of um you know like a scientific perspective so usually whoever classified this is a demon or um you know a regular goes I think there's more of a religious help to it um\nThat's where I usually when I meet David knowledge is they're they're very religious as well um\nSo I think there's a little little that labeling going on to me it's an experience\nUm and some people perceive it as good or bad I might receive one experience being really positive you might have the same experience can be terrified and the way the negative and then kind of you go toward more demonic part effect\nSo I I really enjoyed not joy but I have the experience I research experience and I don't try to put the female label on anything\nWell with Brenda ... his book is called the ghost studies ... dot com of course linked up

branded can you you you interviewed a number of people with some case studies let's talk a couple of them some of your favorites what do you have\n[noise] sure sure ah so I have several real life a cow that I go over I'm the first one is actually because Halloween approaching a I'll go with this one\nPerfect um trick or treat [laughter]\nMy wife passed away unexpectedly over the summer while it's been difficult I managed to care for the house and myself\nAt Halloween approached out putting up decorations and the kids in the neighborhood usually allowed trick or treating my wife and I had bought a plastic pumpkin together when we first got married Twenty years ago we had places past ... plastic pumpkin at our window every Halloween\nI searched out for days looking for that okay until I finally gave up a few days after giving up I was walking down the staircase and I was shocked to see my wife standing at the bottom\nShe smiled and lift bird check behind the workbench and then vanished I began to weep uncontrollably rushed out to the garage huge smile came across my face as the plastic punk and was laying behind the workbench it must have fallen off the top shelf\nSo this is a a great example of a you mentioned it before and intelligent Harding or goes interacting with us so in this case you know the ghost during this goes like counter that goes out of conscious\nAnd she was actually giving information that the husband wanted so they're aware of their surroundings they they're\nThat's sort of confined to an area they're interacting with the witness um they're not like routine specific like they don't just show up every day on this or on the twenty fifth of mayor on Christmas Eve or anything like that\nSo this direct interaction\nUm is sort of the ... the cream of the crop when it comes to go slowly encounters\nA and these are the most rare ones that I've been talking with people these are the most rare when you have like um the ... in intelligence the interaction the giving information which is verified um this is sort of what we all seek in a way of those who investigate the paranormal\nZero pecking order on the other side brand in in in your opinion on what's the word ... I mean who sends the goes back to do what it does it does it do it on its own war is new some organization that's involved in doing that on the other side\nI'm a strong believer in in consciousness so you know who who we are as people are are personality our memories are um everything that we are\nUm are ... after we die you know what happens to that right or some people will say that we're just computers and when we die who everything of who we are memories are ... ... it just pieces to exist\nUm and that's kind of mainstream science says you but when you look at things the if consciousness survive death and it goes in and it continues to exist it's it could maybe really be in the environment to some degree\nAnd I think when needed maybe like ... example with the husband when needed he can sort of resonate or or link up with the consciousness of his past wife\nSo I don't think it's a pecking order as much as you know someone just really needs something and then they sort of resonates with the consciousness of of a path love one and then these experience maybe half is\nSo yeah you know I I really believe that there's obviously things in the environment that that we don't know about and the consciousness I'm electromagnetic fields all the stuff that really happens in the environment\nIs is really important uh Michael pursing or who recently passed away but it was a neuropsychologist basically said\nHe did all of the numbers by this but the the environment holds enough energy\nFor every every person that ever ever lived their consciousness to exist at it\nUm which means we have access to memories from Abraham Lincoln to Billy the kid it's it's all out there and the environment has enough energy to store all that and then maybe some people can just connect with that or resonate with that and that's when he's great experiences happen\nWhen you say the skeptics Brandon who say these people who have these encounters or mentally unstable or something even worse\nYeah unfortunately I think you know when someone tells you a ghostly encounter um a lot of people will just kind of say well you're crazy and they kind of say jokingly but it really makes the other person feel like they're you know they might be crazy [laughter]\nUm so ... you know what I usually tell people who move skeptics or things like that I usually just basically kind of go over listen you know in in my experience it's all I Do all day is diagnosed mental health and and um you\nKnow you see it all\nYeah I mean my job I I worked in the ER for seven years so I just did behavioral health assessments on med floors in the ER and I've I've done probably five thousand assessments them over the course of ten years um so I Know how to parcel out you know significant mental health issue\nI'd probably five thousand assessments him over the course of ten years [noise] um so I Know how to parcel out you know significant mental health issues and all these real life and counters that I've come across um Ninety nine point nine percent of them are from people who are genuine and had a subjective paranormal experience\nThat's huge yeah you know and and I think that it's easy to say\nOh you're crazy or your this or you're that or your unstable or he'll lose for dating or you're drinking too much or withdrawing or whatever the situation is but listen to it in my professional opinion a lot of these ghostly encounters are the ... there are genuine and the people's eyes it's not the result of mental illness\nOnly always found that skepticism as healthy as long as it was true skeptic has an open mind\n... exactly exactly you know it's it's really easy to beef you know a steadfast believer or steadfast skeptic because you can just\nIn golf yourself and whatever your reading journals magazines books\nAnd it's really easy to sort of said on everything is everything is not a ghost or everything is it goes\nIt's being in between an open minded is the most rewarding and challenging because you have to take both sides you have to read the skeptical stuff and you also have to read\nThe believe the believers stuff and you have to have common sense in a way and sort of parcel out what's you know what's fried or fake or just people being overzealous and then come up with your own conclusions and that's where you're right the open mindedness part is is a central when it comes to being involved and apparently\nHe got sick for I'm pretty much a majority of my life what change do you know I I\nWhen people would tell me and I was really interested in Paris psychology like I said before but I never had to experience so I always kind of thought well these people who are having experiences maybe they're just misinterpreting things and just getting it wrong\nSo when people would tell me experiences I Would kind of sit there and that they're talking I won't even listen to him I Would just sort of go over how to debunk yet or what could be happening and then I just sit back and you know I'm going to start listening and I started listening and I'm like oh okay and then I started picking up books\nLike um Carl Young's collective unconscious\nJoe drape stuff um oh Harold facts numbers life feels your memory layman Moody's work yes exactly a near\nDeath experience at all this stuff and you start reading it and you go wait a minute there's actually this might be happening and then you go deeper down that rabbit hole and you're reading research articles about untangle matter\nAnd then you kinda go oh wait a minute this is actually somewhat possible and then you know as far as ... the and things like that\nI mean the research on that is growing every year um but I Know every year I'm reading more and more journal articles which statistically give credence to the idea that property and ESPN the sigh phenomenon is legit\nAnd then you're like whoa wait a minute if this is saying this and he's ghostly encounters could be possible as well and that's kind of what led me into it from a skeptical to more of a believer part a thing\nHe was another one of my favorite stories\nAll right I got a lot of them so\nIt doesn't really matter all because every time dad like take a moment like that to spend with our kids\nAre pretty momentous [noise]\nSounds like somebody agrees\nSo let's take a moment to make them all day and

out for that goes to come out and\nYou know try to encourage them er instigate them by yelling at them you know it it it doesn't to me it doesn't work like that\nThere's so many complex processes that happen whether it's the person the environments are resonating the frequency of all the stuff we talked about earlier that just simply yelling goes come out is not sufficient enough in my view I I think there's a lot more to go into it\nI mean don't teach them Rochester New York Yankees going\nYes I'd like to ask about possible or early imprint teams on the brain that might explain to an extent why people see ghost like others I've seen the film of the\nBaby ... ships being fed by humans with hand puppets made to look like the mother so wouldn't return to the wild the tricks noted key in\nOn a mother conned or are you mentioned the window we're who was searching for the pumpkin and his\nWife appeared and then those gone I've never had any experience like that but the closest I've had over in the many years I'm now sixty three\nI Will rub my eyes in various ways and all different kinds of\nFigures will appear before me a figures that again bringing up imprinting I Would not think would have occurred with an me a different figures in all different kinds of actions some of them quite grotesque\nAnd I'm sure that those are not ghost by definition but this kind of bringing us together and closing a one about imprint teens that like with the window we're uh seen his wife saying look uh uh in the back of the garage I Can't imprint teens\nCan people be so emotionally attached and mentally like the husband to his wife that he would see his wife where's the rest of us would not and maybe I in my life with things that the rest of you would not\nMhm [noise] yeah yeah it's it I don't that's a tough one to answer I I think that you know I I it's a little bit with a widower they were talking about it's a little bit like he is resonating with something in the environment that's why he's saying his wife he's not saying Abraham Lincoln or whoever else so it's\nYou were talking about it for a little bit like he is resonating with something in the environment that's why he's seeing his wife he's not saying Abraham\nLincoln or whoever else so specific to him there's a there's sort of a connection to him you know as as we're driving down the street in our in our cars are there's radio signals all around us but if I turn my radio station to Ninety two point five I only pick up Ninety two point five\nBecause we're matching frequencies so with a husband and wife with with ... and a mother they match frequencies and that's one of these sort of experience have happened as far as an imprint goes um ... if I'm understanding that the way you're you're describing it\nIf there is I mean Carl young had this idea of collective unconscious\nSo were all born with these archetypes and the sort of um blueprints for how to really manage life\nUm so we're sort of imprinted um with with with these archetypes and and with sort of the ancestral beliefs that are common throughout every culture that's happening\nSo this could be me here at Ohio or you know um people in other countries we all have similar sort of visions and and stories and things like that\nSo I think we're all imprinted I'm In a grand gesture but it could be more specific for cultures it could be more specific for families could be imprinted I'm with certain information so you pass that down to your family\nUm so it could be more micro than macro when it comes to this collective archetypes that are out there so I think there is something to the imprint I I I couldn't answer your question differently but that's sort of my best guess that it\nDoes religion kind of changed your views about these Appalachians Yugoslavian donors\n[noise] yeah I I think it's it it changes our view than it is it's basically changes our perception of an experience\nSo you know you can have someone who is a devout religious person have the same experience as someone who is not the religious person might a perceived that as more of um like we talked about earlier a demon or an angel\nOr I'm a of of a sign from from God or aside from a deceased person that they love\nUm whereas a person who doesn't have that religious till two it might experience says as simply\nYou know an experience or or um a mundane thing or ambiguous stimuli so everyone's everyone's past sort of influences how we perceive any sort of ... paranormal phenomenon\nUm and that's why we talked about before you know the believers are automatically going to go to whatever they believe in and if they believe in earth bounce spirits everything is in our spirit\nA so I think perception religion or they play a huge part and how we perceive a ghost encounters a paranormal phenomenon\nHave you ever witnessed an ex uses them no I've never witnessed that would you like to um [noise]\nAs long as it's not yours [laughter]\n[laughter] you know it was somewhat although I did interview a while back and and I can't remember what I said but I just kind of like yeah I Love to have an experience like that and then someone emails me and

back to selling in just a moment here Sally in North Dakota has a situation where her daughter died sadly in a car crash\nAnd we're going to go back to ... just a moment Shelly in North Dakota has a situation where her daughter died sadly in a car crash but she's getting visitation selling how often are these visitations or she's she's not there anymore\nAnd they will get your reaction to that brand and what do you think's going on\n[noise] well that's actually becoming more and more common um and I've heard more and more stories about this in the last ten years but this this idea that you know this is somehow\nI'm ghosts are utilizing electric electrical equipment to ... to communicate so that's like phones tax emails these types of things\nUm you know typically people will report they'll get hang ups from um a family members number who's been deceased for whether it's five days or five years\nUm then they'll get text messages from them you know after their death or you know these types of things and there's a there's a book out there that I'm a pair of psychologist Dr column Cooper rose cause telephone calls from the dead\nWhich he encompasses a great he he lists a bunch of these um phenomenon that are happening and then there's phantom menace messages with just recently came out as well which goes over this is well\nIt's hard to really know that to me I mean listen this is the idea that um ghosts or consciousness or wherever you want to call his utilizing electrical of electrical equipment it's been going on for a while so\nYou know to to know the exact or how that's happening I'm not sure uh but anytime we talked about this numerous times today anytime there's some sort of trauma or crisis or life threatening events\nLike she was talking about um it increases the probability of these types of things happening I'm so we we the only thing we can do is try to see these consistency there's similarities and then try to find the answers as best we can from the back and\nHow do you change the skeptics mind Brandon ...\nAh [noise] I think you could um put some some doubt and education in there about what could possibly be happening [noise]\nAh it's it's a challenging it's challenging because you know at this point goats are measurable phenomenon and the paranormal is difficult to study in a sort of a logical scientific way and this is mainly because paranormal experiences are you know there are radical their episodic\nThey're poorly documented um their random and they're not repeatable at well which is essentially everything that the scientific method hates\n'em for these things are are tough and and isn't that kind of why most people go into its fraud or mental illness or imaginations um\nYou know we didn't matter is not a cop out to be able to just to say that\nI think it's an ... a cop out would be an easy answer to it so this the idea is if it's ... if I'm presented with something that I don't know the answer to um rather than spend hours and hours of researching it I can just say that the person's misunderstanding or it's fried earth over active imagination\nAnd then I could go on living my life in my normal views and it doesn't blow my mind at any kind of way\nSo it's an easy way to sort of give an answer to something that you know it's it's pretty mind blowing phenomenon um\nBut you know is is there is all this this stuff out there that that some people point to as evidence like pictures and he'd be peace um but there's really no follow up after that um and then those things nowadays are easily fake\nI I think really is and and this is kind of what I tell people out in a paranormal investigator is is you got to it's about collecting data it's about sample sizes\nSo it's kind of what I tell people out in the paranormal investigator is is you kind of gets about collecting data about sample sizes it's about being consistent and what you do and that over how you got to tell you progress or advance a field\nYou know similar questionnaires at all these people are using when they do investigations\nSimilar methods um you know if sample sizes huge and academia and was skeptics as well is that you know if if you have a sample size of three hundred people that's pretty impressive if you give questionnaires if every paranormal team gave a questionnaire to somebody and they did a hundred investigations a year and there's\nYou know I don't know three hundred paranormal teams out there your sample sizes getting pretty big and then academia takes notice because you have um a hundred thousand questionnaires that are just waiting to be analyzed and then you start getting some variables are um some similarities inconsistencies and then you have a measurable phenomenon [noise]\nSo you know it's it's hard to argue I'm with someone who has a close mine but if you could just push him towards a piece of research or a book or something like that and maybe they pick it up then that helps you know that that goes for the opposite end to what people are just adamant believers there's\nThere's things you can push a more towards the middle with which is to me is the best place to be\nLet's go to Tom short driving in Pennsylvania Hi Tom go ahead\n[noise] how are ya great thank you hey I Want to\nTalk to you guys I'm a long time listener first time caller so bear with me a little bit short story I Am a back in Nineteen Seventy four Nineteen Seventy five I was ten or eleven years old when it comes to New York with small house and upstate New York\nAnd I woke up I don't know why but there was a man standing there and he was a goes with the thing that he didn't even think it's very beautiful\n... and I'll never forget it I close my eyes\nOpen it back up look at me like a slap myself a couple of times myself we weren't studying in school or anything like that and close my eyes really are open them up and he was dragging my face and then I close my eyes with him and he was saying it back\nYou know I get along and he threw me out but it was funny and I just walked through the wall\nBlow the uniform looked like it might have been from the Eighteen hundreds or something like that Tom\n... me the wrong on the shoulders and the owner was like not a spy but I don't know that for the ads you know he had a a mosque that was a male\nWas there any kind of battle in that area a long time ago\nI think though in up state New York you know farming community you know what the heck you know I don't know it's just I've never had another three with anything in my whole life again for now\nLet's bring the expert in Brandon what's a Spanish soldiers from the Eighteen hundreds doing there\nThis this is this is a fascinating story and and these are the stories are really get the most excited about this phenomenon right so\nHow could there'll be a ghost of something that shouldn't be there right so if you have a house for a hundred and fifty years and there's no tragedy happening and all of a sudden there's a civil war goes that appears there right\nIn this house is I'm In Montana where there shouldn't be civil war goes why is that well I think and and I go over I have a whole chapter devoted ...\nPasses on in Montana where there shouldn't be civil war goes why is that well I think and and I go over I have a whole chapter devoted sort of this in my book\nUm you know to me it's not so much location specific when it comes to a lot of these hard things that happen\nSo let's say let's go back to our caller Patrick distress messages right so I'm In Ohio and um I get into a car accident and end up dying I send to tell a path distress message to\nMy brother and a Montana and the if he wakes up in the middle of night season operation of me and my in my clothes while I'm driving or whatever\nAnd I say good bye I Love you\nNow the operation didn't happen where I died it happened in Montana where my brother was living right now\nSo let's say we skip ahead a hundred and fifty years into the future someone buys my brother's house and know tragedy happened there no nobody died there was a it was it was great place to live for all those years\nThey walk into a room and they see an operation of me and they go what the heck is going on here now the operation of me is it because I died and my brother's house it's the endpoint of my tell a path a distress call to my brother that he's picking up on so in that case that the the ... the caller's talking about\nThe housing expert me about the options that are right for you a\nWere busy

Florida a month ago where a high level NASA official got actually got up in front of an aerospace audience and said we're not ready to land on the moon we don't know how to land on\nThe moon [laughter] ... what happened in Nineteen sixty nine [laughter]\nYeah you you you got and maybe they're waiting for all the people that can remember that to die off so they can tell people they did it the first time\nIn that statement alone Robert will make all the people who doubt that we went to the moon jumper joy and say see I told you so\nWell I got to tell you guys like him didn't take us to the mood um and I mean here's the thing you know they're saying before we go to the land on the moon we need to build a space station in orbit around the ... which is totally crazy\nIt's totally crazy and it's and they want to put it in this weird orbit which is gonna be hard to get to and hard to get to the moon from it hard to get back to it from the moon it's going to add propulsion requirements is going to add timing requirements to any lunar mission I mean let me tell you what this they call this the deep space gateway\nYeah OK and let me tell you what I call it the lunar orbit toll booth okay [laughter]\nThe the the ... ...\nHere's an analogy let me say I offered you the following deal I Want to read you an office in Saskatoon now you're gonna have to pay to build the building\nAnd you're gonna have to pay a hundred thousand dollars a month rent and it's a thirty year lease you can't get out of it and you must go there and stay there at least one month a year and if you want to fly anywhere from your home you have to pass through Saskatoon to go there\nI pass a bill passed on that\nThey had a deal and this thing\nIs that I buy the ... and you'd probably sell me what\nYou buy the swarm play and you'd probably want to sell me a lot\nBetter off with the swamp land than with this\nIs ... ... you know would result is doing what he's doing falcon next base acts are it's a good thing you're right it's just you know for someone like you and\nAnd me the way we grew up during the space program watching NASA just kind of not do much anymore with manned space flights and it's it's disappointing Robert it really is\nWell it is and I mean look you know our parents' generation one World War two they had a government that was functional and that government built the interstate highway system and that government got us to the moon\nAh and and now we we see this thing is just dysfunctional it's incredible um I mean it's not all NASA I mean this is across the board we had a a major deterioration in the quality the political class in terms of its ability to execute great projects\nOn it and act on the basis of public spirit instead of partisan\nA chaos and the the the you know so there it is but uh I gotta tell ya you know\nI was hoping that the new NASA Administrator who was delayed and getting into office for quite a while would come in and say I'm not buying this crazy lunar orbit space station this is you know what what the incompetence who preceded us\nUh you know want it to do I'm going to straighten this out we can certainly land on the mood I was hoping ... Stein would do that but it didn't he just went along and I'm just shocked frankly\nA couple of weeks ago when I was in Los Angeles I had a chance to witness the flight of one of the ... or at night and then it came back it was a reusable and it was just gorgeous Robert watching that and half the people who are looking into the skies that night\nUh the they didn't know what it was they thought it was a you off\nRobert watching that and half the people who are looking into the guys that night uh the they didn't know what it was they thought it was a UFO or something like that but it was big tech you learn to watch it's incredible technology isn't it\nWell it is a although I mean one might say it's about time ah because sure we started the space age with expendable rockets and you'd figure that fifty years later we finally get him to be reusable so I'm Better late than never and and here it is and\nAnd I got to tell you this thing that mosque is done in creating these reusable rockets and and and and at least reduce the cost of space launched by a factor of five it was ten thousand dollars a kilogram perform us now it's two thousand dollars a kilogram traumatic\nIt's dramatic it's ... and it was done on a shoestring compared to um what a NASA considers normal for developing new space systems I mean it was done like for one tenth the money in one third of the time\nThat anyone or it was accepting would be normal and this thing um the result has been not only a these remarkable space systems that space Texas fielding\nIt is causing a private money to get into space and a number of other advanced fields that people thought were hopeless uh so okay Bezos has his own money's got large and but we now have three small launch companies\nA firefly a vector space um electron a these are small launch vehicle companies that have all gotten you know investments on the order of Seventy million hundred million dollars\nA two to field a small launch systems and it even goes beyond the the space industry we now have fusion power startups getting funded\nBecause people you know they were looking at future parents all this is just never going to happen they keep on saying it's going to happen in Twenty years and now it's been Twenty years and I think another Twenty years\nAnd but people in say maybe it's not really an impossible technical problem maybe the problem with it\nAnd um I gotta tell ya I actually worked in the future program in the Nineteen eighties and I can remember one lunch we had at Los Alamos when the group leader looked around the table and he said to all of us you know when fusion powers finally developed it's not going to be at a place like Los Alamos or Livermore it's gonna be a\nCrock pot working in his garage yup well maybe not a crock pot in his garage but I think probably a start up working in a warehouse is going to do it\nAnd he's going to get funded and God Knows what he's going to be able to do with the Robert stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about space next hour we'll take phone calls with you Robert Zubrin our special guest tonight for a couple of hours lacks the coast to coast they are\nAlways on your own you'll be happy to know the ... website is now optimized removal users and just point your iPhone or Android rose or to go to ... dot com and enjoy\nWell um [noise] [noise]\nWhat can I say he's an unusual guy I'm new like him a yeah although we can be a difficult at times uh ... I mean he has a sense of humor it's kind of dry and uh he he is um [noise]\nUh okay look um the thing to know about Iran is is this okay on the one side he well he he is very driven it's very hard working a A N pie is\nAh driven to want to do\nGreat for the human future he wants to be a person for the ages he likes money he likes cool things he can buy with money but that's not what he's about uh\nNow he he he really wants to do he he wants to go down in the history books for doing something great for for human kind and and so that's the other side of it okay is that\nHe doesn't just want to do great detail he wants eternal gory for doing great deep so he's not Mother Teresa can be selfish uh he he um and he certainly um I'm not above using people uh [noise]\nAnd you know if you look at some of the things about him that um\nDidn't come off so well like Kim getting angry that he couldn't be the one that rescued those kids in Thailand um that that's the other side of it so you're a ... you know there is [noise] um\nUm that that's the other side of it so yeah uh the the you know there is [noise] um\n... you know a self assigned to it but it's not selfish for money it's it's it's it it's selfish for eternal glory for doing great teaches you go about\nIt it's not exactly ego it's it's you know if you read Greek mythology like the only add\nThis is what homers heroes are about they are about eternal glory for doing great deeds or Shakespeare's Henry the fifth you know uh uh when he gets that speech you know we few we happy few we band of brothers he he wouldn't want anyone else there with him at action core\nTo to fight the friends because he he even though I mean the odds are more against him he doesn't want to share the glory with anyone so you know that's must to a tea and um\nAnd and and so but really um\n[noise] you know that that's the classical motive of the hero okay so I I think most ... is a hero not a hero in the sense of being a perfect person but a hero in the sense of being the kind of person\nI'm a ...\nThat is depicted as a hero in literature a that is a person who wants to win eternal Gloria Knight errant who goes out uh looking to slay dragons looking to do something terrific uh ... that's what he's about but you know\nUm how would you consider um the just measles Robert Well Jeff ease those as much calmer I'm much more laid back um I don't know these cells I've met him once uh uh but that was certainly my impression uh and\nIf you look at how the two companies are run a they reflect at a mosque is extremely driven he wants to stun fast a he wants everything done yesterday and\nUm the company takes chances and thus far um they're winning 'em but it's certainly a\nThere they pushed very hard bees owes the model of his company is step by step ferociously he's not in a rush being cells strength and his weakness is that he has unlimited funds now why a limited funds that sounds like a strength doesn't it [noise]\nUm well in one sense it's obviously is a but the and the other sense it isn't because if you have unlimited funds you have unlimited time\nAnd that's why at this point space X is racing ahead of him so this is the you know ... the hair\nUm blue origins the tortoise and ah it'll be interesting to see who wins this race you know measles is at least ten times as rich as mosque okay so I mean must you know by the standards of you and me and almost anybody\nUm is a very rich person he's the night before the richest person in the world according to Forbes\nAnd is he doing all this with his own money or is he getting financing what's he doing\nNo mosque or is it well he started out doing it with his own money right now it's partially his own money but he's also won a lot of contracts for launching things for NASA effort the military\n... is doing it all with his own money okay these shows you know is the richest man in the world ah and he you know he says I can just take a billion dollars worth of Amazon's stock each year sell it off I got a billion dollars I'll spend it on blue origin so\nLimited funds and he thinks he has unlimited time I'm mosque knows that I'm you know in aerospace a cost just people times time\nUh the quicker you just do something the cheaper cause people say things like oh if we uh uh uh uh try to do Mars you know within ten years it would cost much more no cost much less\nUh because uh you know space program is like riding in a taxi cab and it costs you whether it's standing still or whether it's moving\nYeah that is true let's talk about our mutual favorite subject in that Mars what what's going on with some of these latest discoveries underground lakes and things like that Robert\nOh yeah well it's pretty spectacular okay the European bought all these experiments or ex discoveries by the way are being made now with a [noise]\nUm something it's not exactly new but is is is finally really showing its its stuff which is a ground penetrating radar and his radar that can look through the ground and see what's underground\nAnd um the ground penetrating radar on the European Mars Express pro found an underground lake on Mars it's salt water [noise]\nUh and um but it's definitely from the point of view of microbial life a habitable environment\nUm it's been suspected by a lot of scientists and by me um that uh there was a liquid water underground on Mars it has now been found\nAnd I believe that we're going to find a lot more because there's no reason why this Lakewood just exist in one place I think there's an underground water table on Mars uh and um you know on earth\nSome of the earliest organisms that ever lived on earth\nAre still living deep underground in the ground water the surface of the earth has changed radically it's no longer habitable for them but the ground water is is as it was billions of years ago and they been down there and if there was ever life on the surface of Mars would have retreated into that ground water and it'd be they're still [noise]\nNow then beyond that the ground penetrating radar on the American the Mars Reconnaissance orbiter has found glaciers on Mars at mid latitudes that is I'm a mountains of pure water ice and something like\nA a million cubic kilometers\nOf pure ice covered by just a few feet of dust and it was it's right there and it's a mid latitudes that is it's as far south is thirty eight ... a a north and the northern hemisphere Mars which by the way the same latitude to San Francisco\nSo imagine that there were glaciers in San Francisco and Denver and you know a Washington DC you know that's the the latitude that these things are\nAnd what it means is that there's water readily available on Mars and not just you know I'm half a kilometer or a kilometer underground like this lake is but right at the surface where you could get out with a shovel\nThat's exciting you know some people this is strange some people say that if there's life on Mars or even the possibility that we shouldn't even go there that's that's weird why\nWell that's a pretty crazy point of view um I think so there's there's two they there there's two different versions of it one is the scientist saying if you go to Mars um them if we find life there we won't know whether we\nAny contamination\nYeah well that's like saying if you go to France you won't know if the people there are friends who are not I mean that that that because they might have all gotten off the plane with you I mean look if if it\nHow do we know that there's actually people in France and they didn't all just show up when you did well for one thing there are houses and there's the arc de Triomphe and there's the Eiffel Tower there's all this stuff that they built in the past well if there's life on Mars today it was there in the past and there will be fossils of it\nAnd I mean to to to say that fossils of life on Mars don't prove that the life you find there was there before is like the people who say that\nFeeling I knew what he cares about how you're feeling\nBetter than north canyon medical center\nTo home rain here in the ... valley canyon provides only the bad to the state of the

to do\nLet's go to John in Seattle, Washington and welcome to the program John go ahead\nYou for taking my call You're welcome thank you for your your guest's name Robert\nRobert Robert are great questions if you go um oh probably take 'em off here [noise]\nThey're sort of speculative reversed is um\nDo you know anything about this earlier the guy that the Learjet talking about anti gravity back in the sixties and conversely you know anything about a couple reversal of that being able to generate artificial gravity\nAnd secondly you do anything about electrical ... recalls from I\nMean ... of those three questions when you got one more Robert you've got one more okay one more\n... or the third one is um would you advise the ball to design a space station like a memorial type thing to test um oh human physiology reacts to Mars gravity\nAll right Robert let's take that one first go ahead\nAll right well let me just a run them down quickly then maybe a provide some detail the first one in Lear jets and anti gravity I don't know anything about that\nSecond question artificial gravity um which goes along with your last question of a spinning space craft yeah we do know how to creating artificial gravity you spin the space craft\nCrates and cheer physical force that mimics gravity and that's a uh in my view a a a a very wise thing to do on a long space voyage in order to ah prevent the deterioration of bone and muscle that you get with um\n[noise] is zero gravity\nFor a long range belongs to a long time so\nYeah exactly 'cause if you you know anybody who just walks around on earth the you know ... not an athlete just a person that you know walks around the house goes to the store they they get some one of them\nPounds on their feet and and and and and and you know and moving it around a a worse in space just floating around in zero gravity don't get that\nAnd so in fact I Do recommend artificial gravity for use on trips tomorrow so not that we couldn't survive going there and zero gravity we can but if you're going to Mars to explore you don't want your astronauts arriving\nThere in a weakened condition though about liberal barely do anything for you\nRight and then the the the third question was electrical pulse and yeah I Know a fair amount about electrical pulse and\nI'm electric propulsion is using a electric or electromagnetic forces to accelerate a pre Palance to very high velocity she can get about ten times the exhaust philosophy with an electric roster that you can with the chemicals roster\nThe problem though is that it requires electricity to run them and typically the power sources way a lot\nAnd that means that I'm your power is limited and therefore you're thrust is limited\nAnd what that means is that electric propulsion systems are kind of like a car that gets a thousand miles to the gallon and but it goes from zero to sixty in a week I'm not terribly useful for short distance driving around town\nBut if you were going to drive around the world and let's say there was somehow a road that went all the way around the world\nOkay you floor of the car you know in San Francisco and\nUm you know a week later going sixty miles an hour and you've reached a the east coast and now you can go driving around the world because your car and drive over water in this case but in any case now you you you have a tremendous advantage in that your your your mileage is great\nBut if you're going from earth to Mars it actually takes longer to get there with electrical pulse and then it does with chemical bullshit if because it the time it takes to speed up is longer than the time it takes to get there on the other hand if you're going from earth to Saturn electric propulsion would get you there faster\nRobert if you had to pick one man going back to the moon or going to Mars which would you pick\nI pick Mars you would um because you know I mean look we went to the moon fifty years ago or we're not going to inspire the next generation by doing things that their\nGrandparents' generation did uh the science on Mars is far more profound we're going to discover the truth about the potential uh existence and diversity of life in the universe and Mars has got much more resources so many to compare Mars to the moon\nTo the choice in the age of ocean exploration Mars compares to the moon the way North America compared to Greenland you know Greenland was closer to Europe Europeans got to Greenland long before they got to North America\n[noise] but it wasn't a place where you could build a civilization that didn't have all the different resources\nAnd ah so Mars is is is you know it's a much richer world\nBut you know here's NASA and frankly it doesn't have the confidence to take on Mars\nWell then they say well then we'll go to the moon well what I see is okay if you think you need to go to the moon before you go to Mars then get on with it go to the moon don't come off with\nSome other thing that the halfway house you have to do before you go to the moon because if we can go to the moon fifty years ago we could go to the moon now\nHow can you believe the next July will be fifty years since we went to the moon would the first time fifty years already wherever we're at the time go\nYeah I don't know I was Seventeen when we landed on the ...\nThat'd be sixty six and we'd be sitting here stuck on earth I I I Would have thought they were crazy\nYeah I Would agree east of the Rockies Joe's with us Long Island New York Hey Joe go ahead\nI'm Sorry they can get to go to the mall but a\nCouple of questions are in deep space uh when we send out these probes are what you are or what would you be dealing with extreme heat even open space as opposed to the planet\nAnd would it be advantageous to us to kind of go to mercury though with some sort of probes in case back here we have one away a global warming due to maybe solar flares combined with CEO to increase was\nUh in other words what the spin off of dealing with extreme heat and space help us to deal with the potentially back here and also what kind of person would profile are going to Mars\nUh how would you profile a potential candidate to travel on a ship them to Mars what type of person always looking for\nAll right let me take the question is one of the time or the first question it'd be hot and space if you're close to the sun um if you are a far away from the sun it's called uh\nAnd uh if you're in earth orbit it kind of depends on whether you're in the sun right now or not\nUm but um\nYou know we do have a kind of I mean you ... you can ... the reason why spacesuits white is because they they can overheat from sunlight and they want to reflect most\nAs much as you can\nWrite a on the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so you kind of have to watch that uh but space itself doesn't really have a temperature but certainly the the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it and you get hotter much faster\nI'm now second question\nProfiles of people well okay\nHold on for a second the Robert we're going to hit the brake already going by fast food you Robert you've been with us we'll be back well ah let them finish up Joe's questions there and they're interesting what kind of a personality would want to go to Mars will be

the way are linked up it goes to those damn dot com [noise] what Robert you you have looked at profiles of people and personalities who would love to go to Mars what are they like\n[noise] well um well there's all sorts of people that say they want to go to Mars uh [noise]\nUm I mean quite literally and and some are people that are\nYou might well want on a crew or it's going to Mars and others not a chance or the caller asked what sort of people would I select to go to Mars um and I'll tell you it's real simple it's the same sort of people that you would still like to go on a say\nA a hiking expedition with you I'm a or an exploration I adventure of any kind um they're the people who you know\nHave a high spirits are fun to be with that sense of humor a ... you know or not you know\nWell who you know have a high spirits are fun to be with a guy in the sense of humor\nA ... you know or not you know a grouchy um and and and ... and and and you know and and the people who can

having another conference a in August uh or actually this year it might be in September in Los Angeles [noise] um if he could a ... it's probably going to be at one of the major universities in Los Angeles [noise] um and ah\nI'm sure we're going to have all sorts of debates about things like is this lunar orbit gateway or do you say the gateway or is it a toll booth okay you know we're going to have that one out\nUm you know we're going to have all sorts of presentations on the latest discoveries you know it there's a Mars probe on its way it's going to land in November call insight and it's going to find out how a geologically active Mars is so that's kind of land this November and we'll probably have um\nA discoveries from it um there's also a new space telescope that just got into orbit um a couple of months ago which will be reporting data discovering planets going around other stars\nOr am I guess it will have discovered hundreds by them if you will probably discover thousands what's done um called Tess um\nYou know a will you know since we're going to be in Los Angeles will have a scientist from Jet Propulsion lab coming over and\nTalking about a um all the latest discoveries from the rovers on Mars and the plans for the next one's ah probably have ... people talking about what they're up to I'm hoping to get flu arching people there too so we can hear from them\nAnd maybe some from the the the small entrepreneur rocket companies like vector space just got funded by Seventy million dollars to\nCreate small launches you know the we now have\nSmall satellites that can do what it used to take big satellites uh to do and so small rockets make a lot of sense I'm and I'm a I myself from involved and design of a mission to go to the moon with ground penetrating radar\nWith for satellites each of which are the size of a shoe box um and so little launchers like this could really play a role I'm\nAlright psychiatry more calls for you what's going to the first time caller Armand in a bill guarded California go ahead Armand\nYes good evening George did you and your guest I just wanted to put something on your radar screen so to speak and that is that you may not be aware of this but there's a whole new paradigm\nFor water planetary water on NATO ally earth but on march if you're interested in learning more about it you can go to geo water I. N. G. L. dot com\nLike international your water international and the reality is that it's already been demonstrated on this planet\nBut the water comes from them back look below that whatever you've got the cross struck the planet fractured that water that hydrogen or not you know an element of hydrogen auction can make its way to the surface I moved back in the ... of the earth the structure that happens quite often\nAnd on Mars the same effect is there in fact the largest spoiled and you know in the solar system is Olympic moms are bars which is over eighty thousand feet tall\nIs there in fact or just walk into in the solar system of the Olympics moms on guard which is over eighty thousand feet tall just for the ages there was a cold beer on top\nAnd that's what ... Scott city or while but close to ... so that's really what are the water has always been on Mars and that's where the water is on this planet\nAnd it's time I think for us started factoring that is true our calculations for borrowers trip\nWell said rubber what do you think\nWell I I it sounds interesting we certainly know there's a lot of water on Mars we found the lakes we found glaciers in this probably more to find so I think he's on the right track\nDo you think we are the Martians that a long time ago either organisms flu hear from you know chopped up media writes a slow off the planet\nOr or maybe they had a full blown civilization long time ago and they ... I think\nI think the former is is this a good chance is true ah in not civilizations but a microbes on on meteors a because Mars\nUm well a couple things first of all life appeared on earth almost immediately after it could\nWhich either means one or two things that life can evolve very quickly from chemistry or that life was floating around in space and as soon as the earth was cool enough\nFor life to to prosper here that it landed in the seeds to cold as it were\nUm and now if you think about that when you say years Mars nearby it's being hit by meteors knocking chunks off sending them flying and hitting the earth we're hit by Mars meteorites all the time [noise] um\nIf life could evolve quickly out of chemistry it would have on Mars Mars cooled before earth to Mars have liquid water before or stupid\nSelf life is is is a quick study evolving rapidly from chemistry it would've occurred on Mars first and then it would have landed here\nSo there is a good chance that keen for Mars the the the the a and also that is supported by the fact that we find no organisms on earth no free living organisms simpler than bacteria and bacteria really pretty complicated\nThey have this whole shirt DNA in are in a whole alphabet for transmitting genetic information [noise] um\nYou know or imagined you you've found a um an ancient manuscript that I had a complete alphabet along with all the punctuation marks and everything and\nUh it could not possibly be the first written document that they would have to be more primitive things before [noise] you know the complete alphabet and punctuation and comments and paragraphs and all this\nHad been worked out so uh but bacteria have all that so that suggests that\nThey came here already fully developed it could've come from Mars or maybe both earth and Mars is needed for interstellar space I just lost his how did you get interested in all this Robert Sputnik that did it for yeah\nWell I was already somewhat interested I I was an early reader I was five when Sputnik flu\nAnd while to the adult world split it may have been a terrifying event to me was just great ah because what it was proving was that the um the space hearings are stories that I was reading we're going to be true and I can remember reading about uh\nYeah I'm the space hearings are stories that I was reading we're going to be true\nAnd I can remember reading about uh like it a space dog in my weekly reader and later ah I'm ... and ... the next space dogs and you know I'm I have a dog today her her name is ... and um uh\nThe the struggle was the first off to come back from space alive and she even had puppies and Khrushchev gave one to Jackie Kennedy and um and her descendants are alive today um anyway so um", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "23"}
