L. I. X.\n[noise]\nI'm quite used to the ground zero to the house in Oregon Hi Robyn [noise]\nI think you guys nailed it last [noise] yeah I I think that's what's going on down there [noise] uh I was\nGoing to talk about the inter galactic cloud that we're going through right now but I think that's a that's another topic that you should just cover some other time that's why the sun is looking kind of where these days and some of the weather and stuff but\nI just had two interesting ideas of the sounds on the earth one you know the earth is moving you know we're we're moving pretty fast right through a few of of a solar system right I mean there were spinning we're moving\nWhat if there were some times it was almost like a whistle or a home going on and that was picked up almost like a a flute or something and I flew to is probably the wrong\nImage like yeah like we're making some noise when the world around her wobbling around you know the I think that's been taken into consideration that we would be hearing something that would be like the music of the earth just like you know you've heard when I played Saturn strike out and makes his music in it now has talks in selling this every once in a while\nBut uh yeah it could be that I thought about that when you're thinking about the horns for that but he's high different do you think these these homes are a little different than those horns\nWell let me tie and the other thought I had worked together you know there's this idea of the electronic universe that fit electrical forces maybe have more of an influence\nA new way to look at the way things interact with each other\nRight and then when there's always there's always the ionosphere heaters too that does tend to abuse you have harp and you have other um you you have a right and they\nMaybe they understand that there is an electronic universe and that's why those things work or scratching our heads thinking how could they just beam up something you know when you only have pressure and gravity but if it is an electronic universe and they're not letting us know maybe that's why all that stuff works\nYeah now maybe I mean that's the thing is that you know you you have to kind of think outside the box to wonder why we have all this stuff going on and I think that when a immediately when they said uh we we got to get a better way to identify what we're doing rather than just looking after\nA you know a overhearing phone calls between extraterrestrials\nWhat they're doing they're looking for technical signatures left behind by the machinery and the technology and and so when we have these sounds that aren't necessarily that\nOf communicating biological entities we do have sounds of what may be their synthetic life forms\nWe may have sounds that may be their machines and they're robots and their spaceships than most of the time when these things happened what we're seeing as we're seeing probes we're not really seeing aliens we're seeing problems we're seeing robots we're seeing a these types of things or you know observing earth from a distance\nI think we have what's happening is the future and the past are kind of coming together rediscovering\nThat there was probably much more intelligent or you know ... civilization here at one point and then there are yes there are other [laughter] maybe future beings maybe artificial intelligence was able to uh time travel [noise] and then we're in trouble aren't we\nWell yeah I mean it's going back to the idea that what if this is just one big encyclopedia we have some sympathetic aliens just watching us every once in a while they rip a page out and that's where history kinda like stops well Britain's pick up and start over again do it again in another uh another chapter in another verse\nYou know ballots don't get our head spinning too fast here we're gonna lose or any sort of core chart [laughter]\nDefinitely most definitely yeah ... that's the great thoughts I appreciate your calling thank you so much no problem that they are at\nTripoli six Seventy three thirty seven hundred that's AAA six seven three thirty seven hundred hey ah the October or thirty first Halloween\nAnd then from there we have November Thanksgiving and they start with family and then of course Christmas if you have family members are ground zero fans and uh you would like to have like ground zero T shirts OR Books or something\nI Would tell you go to ground zero store dot org\nGround zero store dot or you go there and we have a wide variety of different colored shirts ride variety of different colored pillows computer ah backpacks all kinds of things on the ground zero a logo on them it'd be great for someone in your family\nLoves ground zero and also you know you

money by Louis pick up a book and just helps everything out thank you so much Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred will be back\nI mean as far as the ... the sounds of many I mean I live in a you know around the you know we have bases around here and stuff like that and uh you know here things all the time but um\nYou know as far as the atmosphere and the controls that are ... or the black capitalist country over here they just they out here in the sky our town and there you know things like you know you can kill a lot of waves that way you know as far as that goes\nWell I think that you know what we're seeing here is we're seeing a lot of things from oh elements and all of factions\nAnd we have a geo engineering happening we have a you know we have these discoveries are going on and they can't put their finger on what these discoveries are but they do say that there are strange basically they have to reevaluate how they analyze and what they think could be for number they're they're studying and so with that in\nMind we we're waiting for some sort of answer but we're not getting the answers were looking for all\nI don't think we're in ... I mean who's who's who's giving these are just trying to say they're trying to discover this I mean who is\nThey already have way they\nThey discovered thing they discovered things fit of force them into changing the way they view of the universe changing the way they view stories about alien abductions and aliens arriving make all these things are now being considered because ah they're thinking that we're looking at civilizations that may have advanced than than a gay guy we're looking civilizations there's no way\nAliens are way or we have civilizations that are certainly a you know sending messages through a more um I guess you could say a microbial means we're we're getting microbes that that don't respond like they're from earth we'd get neutrinos that ah don't respond\nLike the the standard model here on earth these are things that are before science would never even considered but now it's it's something to think about\nOh it's I I ... that I mean as far as that goes it's it's it's there's I mean right now we're in a in a transition as a as notes that isn't it surprises me at this point right there so there's so much that's being\nKept on this for many many years I mean uh I'm even watch or that you know even I don't think many people will ask but\nI'm a link to it as a way and they are the government it eczema there is files unless of course mhm mhm uh\nWho was Trump's ... took those files you know that right well John John John Trump here\nAnd say you know I thought that was and he said there was nothing there that was that interests us close to what an added a lot of things nationality\nThere was a lot of things in there I think that there's a lot of things about it like plus older groups groups that are uh the go underground that are secretly creating technologies that we don't know about maybe have an underground a breakaway civilizations this type of thing so yeah that I mean you know we're going all over with this but certainly or something to think about\nDefinitely something to think about let's go to Mike in Texas let's go to Mike Mike Hi you're on ground zero\nLong time first time on it that touch base on a little bigger picture that local or what if what we're shaving one poll transmitting another poll therefore what is it just a relay stations other planets and other entities for\nThat would make sense because the sun always since I was thinking of Europe Europe has to respond feared babysitting signals the other ... other planets the planet I mean this would be like you know when they say in the Bible that a certain God's would roar certain planets\nWould war they were roaring maybe it's because they were closer and roars can be heard with the auto ear that they can hear the wars and the thunders communication between the planets\nThe planets communicate that's why we have such a you know I think we're in a store but that's why we have such a you know uniform uh cosmos is because of the fact that we we have to have these planets\nIn line so that we can use them for communications and others and other things and so that's the thing that we could be one big transmitter\nSears give me one big transmitter this could be the answer is that we had been transmitting out extraterrestrial intelligence for a long time about extraterrestrial intelligence has been sending stuff back to us as well\nWe're listening but we're not hearing\nWell yeah it's because we don't know what we're hearing we don't know what we should be hearing for I mean I played the signals uh the guy that that it's been picked up on we just hear that his homes we don't hear them as a perhaps or something it'd be intelligent\nWe don't know that it's some hitting hitting message in there on the on the a particle ever the atomic level that's up for the scientists to decide I Believe\nWhy don't we put things on most polls and listen and\nI'm sure they do they have these uh these projects like ice cube and others that are they're trying to a ... a controller released trying to uh gather together neutrinos to see what kind they are when they are or what the standard model\nThey going to be on a Saturday ... right now they're seeing everything going beyond the standard model and that's something that a either a is a alien or be we're doing this to ourselves with CERN or I mean I can just go down the list of all the reasons why the plan is doing what it's doing it's not good for one thing could harm us it where it's not harm\nBecause you have do we know of but it could be the reason why we're seeing all this abrupt\nThe plan is doing what it's doing it's not good for one thing you could harm us where it's not harm us yet that we know of but it could be the reason why we're seeing all this abrupt or climate situation we're\nSeeing all these abrupt or earth a seismic stuff going on I mean there's a lot of things that could explain this and that of course we have to also say that they're trailing other planets in the solar system that do have as was said earlier or an electrical university effect\nOn everything maybe we're just not smart enough yet\nOr we may not be but we are getting their er and and we are reevaluating how we go about the uh the investigations which I think is interesting\nThat's all I got up keep listening\nThank you might think recall I really appreciate those go down to Jerry in Tennessee Hi Joe you're on ground zero\n... hey what's up how you doing good finally get to talk to you man hallelujah that's good to hear from you [laughter] hey I wanted to just ask you what about the have you heard of the five hundred and twenty eight hurts frequency when you reach tune from four forty four hundred and forty four hurts\nYou talk about Schumann rather than Israel and everything else excuse me\nAre you talking about Schumann residents are you talking about something else\nYeah is it there might be a connection there was like what you were talking about\nAh well anything there's I'm sure that what they're picking up is ah being picked up and uh it's being hurt beyond her I felt the Amish are Schumann residents and I heard that you know it fluctuates from time to time and no one can tell you why so\nOr the background noise this is beyond the background noise it's got to go beyond the background noise in the background pulses otherwise they wouldn't be able to figure this out\nAnd be able to pick up on the particles too I think is a major issue if they're able to pick up on this uh what do you call the decay that nuclear decay and they're seeing this and it's not something that's the standard model it means something else is making it\n[noise] mhm [noise] and we ... our\n... our command ... he's a allege us apparently in a from the ladies he's had

I Would I Would I Would you know because I like conventional medicine in some cases are but I Love the natural things in all cases but I probably would do ... I had my bets and do a combination\nNothing wrong with that well we have one product I mean we have I'd probably probably two dozen antioxidant product that would take them all but um there's two of them are one of which was done in a big study I'm In I'm a Charlotte North Carolina I'm In the medical school\nAnd there was a ten year study a hundred and twenty million dollar study was the government study and um it's it's on our mosque a dime grape seed extract has a liquid or from our um nature's Pearl division\nAnd it's probably shouldn't treat journals and it just came out like last year at the end of the study and it was one of the most effective um cancer which I say survival I'm a products\nAnd so liquid and you take two servings a day for a hundred pounds of body weight\nAnd um there's nothing like it out there and that so they they were just so excited I'm a hundred and twenty million dollar government study medical school in Charlotte North Carolina publishing history medical journals it's liquid extract\nOf of from the mosquito and grape seed and it's just a beautiful product and then of course we have we call her the radical uh eight hundred and ...\nOf uh from the market on grape seed and it's just a beautiful product and then of course we have we call her the radical uh eight hundred and fifty university studies in Japan on the radical it or has\nThe a few quite in which is an extract from red green algae that they credit is the reason why they have so few cancer deaths there and they have a a lower rate of cancer than any other nation because they eat so much of this\nRed green algae as part of their sushi stuff as part of their standard diet and so we have a product called the radical and few cards either capsules and the radical the liquid and so I take that and of course I'd take the mosquitoes and grape seed capsules and they take the must get angry seat liquid\nHis for prevention I keep my immune system a top and I don't eat the processed meats\nAnd um and and so you get your body than Ninety essentially a chance to sixteen mineral sixteen vitamins for him as a free pass your body functions probably including your immune system\nAnd you're going to do very well um your quality of life goes up it live longer you are able to fend off and avoid so many diseases because most of the ones that used to be said to be genetic it really just simple nutritional deficiency disease is\nAnd that's why my thesis charges in the Smithsonian Institute is national treasure and sells for twenty five thousand dollars\nEach jeeze that's amazing and young jeopardy the company behind critical Health News dot com is entering the cannabis markets a in a big way right now we use CBD Oil I I think is going to be a wonder for people who says\nWell I'm Glad you brought that up because you know there are thousands of little companies have out there CBD Oil they sell CBD Oil isn't tobacco shops and whiskey stores and liquor stores and so forth [noise]\nSo what we did we added things to our CBD Oil or so so bland and you get the benefit of the ... plus the enhancement of these other products we got three products right now and we're going to have two more before the end of the year or the first one was it's a drop or ... foot drop send your child is called relax\nAnd and this ... blend has came a meal in a lavender Larry in which many people are familiar with and melatonin all just sort of relax you and just so good\nVery smart and so now instead of our CBD which everybody else has\nDealing with say five or six standard ... of problems including sleep apnea and so forth now are bland with all these uh again Kevin ... melatonin\nWith our video now it deals with fifty issues and of course we have a topical cream and sent pump out for pain\nAnd not only does it have the pain relief of ... which was just fabulous in its own right\nWe have a big mixture of herbs in there which I'm ... and minerals and of course we have good asylum in another antioxidant\nHold on for ... ... talk more about this I've done a whole handful of emails that have come in for you\nAnd a half months later something amazing in which we really don't taste while I was actually a contract staggering about what they do what you would come check the mumps off but\nI thought I could kind of sweet ... result started coming through ... it kinda barbaric ... excuse the pun well I like that works beautifully\nRichard astro here we're talking about the power of waking up your immune system he says he'll this gentleman's hot perhaps the immune system can be called one of the bodies fears is powers to he'll visit C.

were the number of people you put in the group for the test why ... why not three Fifteen\n[laughter] will the town of eight really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments I wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups of\nYou know groups small groups in my workshop you know will will they heel and so this is just another experiment in my own mind and I was sitting there trying to figure out how to do this in a workshop because\nThis is back in two thousand and eight and then I wasn't I hadn't really done many workshops before you know I'm an investigative reporter by training\nThat's how I used to bust baby selling rings when I was you know young\nSo um so I I'm kicking around this with my husband and I'm sort of saying well I don't know maybe I'll just put people in groups of eight and or so and have them send healing intention to each other and he's a good headline writer and he said yeah I Love it the power of eat\nSo it can be about totally by accident we put people in groups of eight in our workshop the first one we ran in Chicago\nI always kind of I I knew how to do intention I'd studied it within tension masters I'd put together a program I'd looked at what worked in scientific in the scientific lab but I wasn't sure about these small groups should they hold hands which may do so I'm I'm kind of making it up as I go along\nAnd the next day I figured I'd I have him come back the next day and tell us what happened and I'd had all the groups and intention to somebody in the group with some sort of health challenge\nAnd when they came back I assume they were going to tell me it's it's kind of like having a facial or getting it back up to you know nice little feel good effect\nThat isn't what happened what happened do stuff like this they lined up I gave them the Mike in turn and they said things like I have cataracts and their eighty percent better\nI'm due for a knee replacement my knees completely messed up and I'm walking normally today and I can do deep squats\nI have terrible insomnia and I slept like a baby last night you know and on and on it went like that total instant healing\nAnd I was completely shocked because as I said I'm you know I I look at things as a journalist I'm I look at things I Try to look at the science of things that are trying to prove things and this was completely out of my room\nSo I didn't believe it I like to be honest George I thought it was a placebo effect but then it started happening over and over and over I mean I've run hundreds of these things\nAnd I've had people where their their arm is dislocated and its slots back into place during the intention or somebody who had couldn't see well because she'd had a stroke and her eyes went back to normal\nSomebody ... says ... ... completely out of pain and we then you know a month or so were daughter wrote me just say that her back straight and so much they had to change the rearview mirror of her car\nShe stories like this over and over again\nAnd the same thing going on with some of the Sanders too and that was the thing that really was amazing\nTo tell me about the centers how how powerful most maybe and then what was happening to them\nWell their ordinary people this is the amazing thing of the George we all have this power this is our birthright it's just we don't know this we don't know how to use it and we don't realize it amplifies in a group [noise] let me tell you about the story of Wes\nI mean with when I met him I put together a couple of groups at the mile high church in Denver just is kind of\nWes I mean with when I met him I put together a couple of groups at the mile high church in Denver just is kind of just as a test this is last last on them less muscle and um I ... I wanted to put himself forward he was one of the the initial groups\nUm because he suffered from terrible depression but there was a woman there with stage ... cancer Linda and so we we decided to go with her\nBoys had a terrible life he had been a really bright guy in college studying biochemistry wanting to be a doctor and he got a he got cold and he had a low lottery number and the very last years of the Vietnam War\nAnd they'd done away with drafted ... for college um college students so he had to go in the last horrible chaotic years of the war\nAnd it was so traumatic for him he came back was really depressed\nAnd that continued in his life even even lost the love of his life to fast growing cancer it was just terrible story so by the time he he got to meeting me he had gone to a point of feeling like what's the use\nAnd he was living in a senior facility you barely able to get up and make themselves breakfast in the morning really depressed\nSo he does his intention for Linda [noise]\nAnd then that next day he told me he woke up and everything had really changed it was almost like you had this amazing heightened to sensory awareness you know the grass is greener than it ever been he drank a cup of herbal tea and it knocked his socks off he says\nUm but even more amazing was the next night he had this extraordinary vision on a dream almost like a vision where he was back in college and he met his Nineteen year old self\nAnd this than Nineteen year Old West communicated to him in some way it's all going to be okay there's still plenty of time [noise] and then experience to him\nWas so life transforming he's a completely different guy now he is how we're walking Ninety minutes sees lifting weights he's running group says it's at his church he's writing is trying to write again\nHe's doing all kinds of stuff and he had completely given up and that is only one time from being a cinder\nUm and this is a story I hear over and over again we're that act of being part of this group of being kind of a higher consciousness is life transforming\nWindows is under me to have any special abilities\n[noise] well here's the really interesting thing that you know I again did not believe this I was looking at it from every angle um it took me ten years to even get the courage to write this book\nAnd we should you were the skeptic 'em all skeptics\nWas I was the ultimate doubting Thomas because as I said I\nI started the intention experiments because I wasn't I wasn't really sure about all of this manifestation law attraction I didn't I wasn't sure I believed it and I wanted to find out how far can you take it you know we talking about the shifting a quantum particles are we talking about curing cancer here\nSo um that's what I set up the intention experiments but I never I never thought these little groups would have the power but the thing that's so interesting is\nI had a life universities the largest chiropractic university I'm In the world and they offered to do studies of the power of aid to let their nerves science department look at this\nThe university I'm In the world and they offered to do studies of the power of eight to let their nearest science department look at this\nSo we sent up eight groups of students\nAnd we put a ... G kept to measure the brain waves of each one person one sender in each of the groups\nAnd what we found was so amazing that within a few minutes\nThey would have this completely different brainwaves signature it would turn off all the part of the power of a group would have a quieting all the parts of the brain that makes us feel separate and also the parts of the brain that make us\nHave worried doubt negativity\nSo these are basically brainwave signatures of somebody who's feeling a sense of ecstatic one this\nAnd when we compared these signatures when the nearest scientists who work at the doctor said Stephanie Sullivan um we looked at\nOther things like uh the work of the University of Pennsylvania looking at the masters and and and Buddhist monks any static prayer they had an identical brainwaves signature\nBut the only difference was I had you know it takes years to become a Buddhist monk or sue female structure my guys were total novices there were students who never

their lives would begin to heal not just their health\nSo I got a group of two hundred and fifty together and had them you know I taught them for a while and then I put them in groups of eight or so and had the meat every week for a whole year\nAnd it was extraordinary of the people who continued to meet regularly you know every week and that was about a hundred and fifty\nTwo percent of them had major life changing experience is so it wasn't just their house\nYou know they got financial windfall or they got amazing new careers or they made up with this strange relatives or you know they got a great new house just the one they wanted\nUm just came out of nowhere or they found a new life purpose but and pretty much everybody had extraordinary stories to tell\nOur ... are are you sure that this works uh primarily from CU ... science behind\n[noise] well I think there's a science in the sense that um we did that brainwaves study\nAnd we found that you know there are major brain changes that go on when you do intention of in a group called ... group prayer in a way I'm In a sense that's what it is it's kind of secular prayer\nBecause you have these major changes which are really very very much similar to somebody having a mystical state you know somebody having a mystical experience people get changed during those kinds of experiences\nAnd they allow themselves to be open to a lot of possibilities or they suddenly feel you know something major has changed all their senses are heightened um they feel really optimistic about their future\nAnd so in a way that starts to pave the way if you want to just look at what happens to the individual that paved the way for major changes\nAnd and possibilities but there's something more this a bigger piece of this George that and believe me I was trying to figure out what is it\nIt a group of fact you know is it just the power of intention but a big piece of this is the power of altruism um that was the big surprise for me because remember the Sanders we're having amazing affects to healing effects\nAnd when I started looking into um the science of altruism it's extraordinary I mean people who do stuff for other people no matter how small live longer are happier are healthier in every regard and that's what we found in a lot of our intention groups\nI mean when I talk about that group and twenty Fifteen and I was studying for a whole year I'm One of the people you know there were a couple of people that weren't getting anywhere\nYou know one of them was a woman called Andy and Andy was going through a divorce and she had two small kids she needed a new job\nAnd she was very talented in marketing and coaching and she just couldn't get anything you know young woman just couldn't get anything\nAnd she was just trying everything and we talked with her and tried to work with her and this and that are group tried to work with her and finally I was a bit frustrated by it and I just said oh Andy get off for yourself start intending for someone else\nAnd she was one of the people who is intending for the young boy Luke and the moment she did that she gets a coal out of the blue from somebody offering her a dream job\nSo can I tell you any everything about how this works you're absolutely not [laughter] there's a complete X factor here I don't understand but there is something about that power of\nGetting off for yourself and doing for someone else that seems to get a reward for you\nWhat you're convinced it works aren't you\nSay I sort of look at it almost like a scientist I've looked at studying groups over years\nUm you know I run I run these year long master classes and I'm I'm actually evaluating what's happening to people they're filling out forms every month to say what's changed in their lives\nAnd you know we've done the brain studies were gonna do immune systems studies um and just seeing what happens in groups right in front of me you know I Know it works\nOr than others some little limited don't get results in the ...\nWell I think it's the people who don't come regularly um sometimes it's nothing to do with skepticism that's the interesting thing too I gave a talk once in in Denver last last year and there was a woman\nWho had really bad arthritis and she was a total skeptic and she got healed right away right there\nAnd um you know we've had people like that who haven't who were a little skeptical really didn't you know thought to themselves yeah right and they had some healing\nDoesn't mean everybody in an audience gets healed but a lot of them you know there's enough to say something really interesting is going on here\nAnd are you interested in the human because it's easier to track in terms of the experiments\nDo you mean a physical healing well yeah because it is not\nIt's easy to ... you know somebody had a condition they don't have the conditions growing up we had a woman was staged for cancer I talked about earlier and she's now you know down to normal numbers now she was doing other stuff too but the intention pushed it right along\nSomebody else with the um J. problems those temperate mandated dealer joint problems in your jaw\nAnd uh that she was sort of suffering with the pain of eight or nine out of ten and it went immediately down to two and then the pain was gone over days\nSo this kind of thing you know it's kind of this healed in an instant or soon after is the thing that you can as you say really track but then you've got other things we're amazing synchronous cities happen you know another woman who was\nTrying to write a book she was a body work um expert Lisa and she was in one of the year long groups and she was trying to write a book about\nShe figured out a way to treat trauma victims with body work and she wanted to write this book about it she'd never written a book and she was getting no where she had three different editors and just nothing was happening and at the group was intending for nothing was happening\nAnd finally once again I simply say get off for yourself\nAnd you start it intending to another member of the group who had some ... serious health issues\nAnd again the next week she has she feels compelled to go into a store\nAnd she didn't even need anything at the store and when she gets in there she meets somebody she vaguely been introduced to before\nAnd as they got chatting it turns out this woman was a former publisher and he's now a book coach and when she hears what Lisa wants to do she offers to coach or through the whole thing end of story Lisa gets her book done and it becomes an Amazon best seller\nUnless you stopped ignoring me what else am I supposed to do remember when I quit you quit sincerely\nYour heart listen to your

be famous but she just didn't specify how and so suddenly\nHad consequences that they have consequences right\nAbsolutely absolutely so it's about really telling the universe what you want I mean I Know that you're a a journalist too and so you'll recognize the\nFive W than age I usually tell people you know what reporters have to learn is when they write a leader of a story they write in an intro they have to do who what when where and why and how and how and that's not a bad thing to do when you're formulating an intention\nAnd if a story includes all those ingredients you got a pretty good story\nExactly and for an intention it's the same thing you've got to say what do you want you know the number of people on my master class\nWho will do things like I Want to be rich and you know they don't really want to be rich what they want is usually you know in the sense of having loads and loads of money and more stuff\nWhat they want is they don't want the job there in what they want is not to worry so much anymore they need a certain amount of money they may not necessarily need to be rich\nUm what they want is more time to spend with their children or grandchildren and so what you have to do is try to figure out first what you want what is that you really want and then tell the universe exactly what you want\nAnd the other thing I notice George is oftentimes the universe gives us what we need not necessarily what we're trying to say we need like um I have one group one master class a intention group of eight\nAnd they said well were intended for all of us to win the lottery [laughter] and I said to them why what do you need and they said well gene needs twelve thousand dollars\nI'm for child and Joan needs another Fifteen thousand dollars to get a car and so and so need this and that and I said well why do you intend for the meat individually and ask for what exactly they need because that's probably what the universe is going to give you you\nKnow so it's it's really about first of all figuring out what you want exactly and then telling\nEach of her because she wanted on it yeah exactly well here's an opportunity for you to talk with when Mick Jagger and about intention let's start by going to Thomas\nGeorge thank you for taking my call limb that's really a pleasure a comment and then a question um I ... I was just you know your audio watcher programs one called living the fields\nAnd the other one called living with intention and boy those audio compact desks are in constant rotation on my CD player I just want you to know that they're just so so much information now you you think about\nRetro causality retro in transition and you cite a number of experiments that\nAppear to prove that we can not only in ... for the president but we can chat and for the past that the past is not fixed and stone so to speak that there appears to be\nWith experimental proof you cite a lot of researchers\nThere appears to be a robust cross talk between the past and the future\nAnd you cite a lot of each have how much met\nA job up here a group in Princeton and each of the experiments that they did that appear to show that you can influence the past that the past is not fixed my question for you can you utilize retro intention\nRetro causality for healing [noise]\nThat's such a great question thank you um yes the answer is the short answer is yes now I Do this all the time in my master classes in workshop semi just random retreat in Italy last week and we were doing a lot of retro intentions\nWhen I tend to do though is\nYou can't change the past of what of what happened in the sense of it happened what you can do though is changed your response to it and going forward and in a way that is part of this whole thing of time being really elastic\nTime being one big smeared out now\nAnd that's what the studies you're talking about demonstrate is that you know we what they really show is that and this is a weird thing\nUm we don't change the past we changed the president as it unfolds the future affects the present as it unfolds all those studies show\nBut just to answer your question\nWhy tend to do is ask people to go back to a seed movement a movement in their health\nJust when something just started before it blew up to full blown disease a moment where they first argument argued with somebody in a relationship\nAnd it then deteriorated afterwards just sent moment when it started\nOr a moment when somebody told you you weren't good enough as a child or you were terrible at some things were just just did something like that\nAnd go back and change your response to the teacher and you say no I'm not used to sit math I just don't understand this now I Will later\nSomething like that or imagine that that healing that that illness doesn't blow up into full blown disease I'm actually had somebody who got ... from an infection go back and imagine\nLung disease I'm actually had somebody who got ... from an infection the bank and imagine that time and I swear to you know she told us her skin was starting to re pigment in the workshop it was extraordinary\nAnd loads of people where they were they were told something and it's in his since released it for them going forward\nSo it's an interesting little technique but there's plenty more to mess around with with ritual intentions because even standard physicists now are saying to us all\nUm you know time is it what we thought it was it's not just for we're going era that we thought from cradle to grave it's much more as I said like one big smeared out now and one big smeared out here for space\nRich in Monterey, California is with us here hey rich go ahead\nYeah hey can you hear me okay I'm On speaker phone alone only good pretty good okay 'cause it's kind of hard to hear you I Want to thank you and when I'm your conversation is so right on its almost what you have all the time\nLet me give you a a thing um I grew up kind of Catholic and I heard one story that you know some people will never die of course science science as energy only changes farm so you know that kind\nOf back me up my whole life\nSo I was a little kid I like to be multiple I'm like oh let the karate and learn how to teach\nAnd it talks about one percent of the doubt can get your nose broke like 'cause your focus is gone\nI'm so no I'm divorced from the same life twice I have a daughter she's not talk to me all the stuff happens but on such a positive person\nI knew I Would be sixty one years old not working being taken care of and I am recently I could barely walk three years ago because all the stress of all this stuff\nNow my ex wife still my friend she may even be my third wife again third time it was but I Do not focus well on my intention even though I'm On my third book of poetry and stuff picture of all this stuff but\nI write in my poetry exactly what I Want but I don't really visualize it\nI'm such a positive person I Want to have a a hippie hard center where people just come and visit and we do this prayer thing what you're talking about and that just get them to be happy for a minute or a couple of minutes and go on them anyway and your suggestion that these little groups\nTo change the world that is how it's going to happen\nSo my question is I have I broke my body working a hammer gun for Thirteen Years\nUm I have lifted shoulders ligaments or actually broken\nSo every time I worked out it hurts like hell so not only not work out again after a year

well I think it was the probably that so many instances killings\nAnd I think that I it was really shocking to me that it wasn't just health that was healing 'cause you know you could almost explain that by saying well it's the big feel good effect on the immune system things like that\nI'm not for instance Natalie Lancaster I mean I it was shocking to me cases like this she was one of the receivers in a power of a group and she wanted her intention to be that her family's business expand in all directions and be prosperous an own ways\nAnd she and her husband had a computer support business but it had been built on just two major clients and they were you know they ... they had just heard that one of their two clients was about to take their business elsewhere\nAnd they were really worried because they had lost money from a Ponzi scheme about a decade before and they had to file for bankruptcy and so she was really frightened that she was gonna have to take a job I'm In real estate again flipping houses in order to survive\nSo she kept during the group session she kept visualizing both her and mark opening up their car doors and money spilling out\nAnd afterward her feeling about it for fear and their depression seemed to lift but what was really interesting is opportunities just started opening up for them they suddenly their business received a steady stream of smaller clients and within a few months\nShe they learn not only did that major client decided to stay with them but they completely diverse to flood their client list\nAnd she and her husband had other big opportunities to um she had kind of a certain offers she paints is a hobby and she was a given offers to do her painting and mark was trying to do a sideline business trading for program that took off\nAnd it was just amazing for her she thought that something about the power of age group not only performed magic but helped her and her husband trust in self empowerment\nShe thought that something about the power of aid group not only performed magic but helped her and her husband trust in self empowerment and the possibility of prosperity and I think that's what's so incredible for me is to watch everything and people's lives began to heal\nAnd you do develop intention in your dreams they\n[laughter] that's a great question\nI think we are intending in our dream state in a weird way though you know we're intending you know somebody calls a dreams are be real you know we felt weird weird stuff going on there and dreams thought\nThey are often times pre cognitive you know they're forecasting all the time I mean I was fascinated to see when I was studying\nYou know time the fact that time is so elastic and not this one way arrow I was really interested\nTo find that that um a lot of people a lot of people pre dreamed the nine eleven I'm a ... tax\nUm looper children did a study of it and found so many people had dreams of it of planes going into buildings that has a high rise buildings\nAnd maybe not even in New York but they had that kind of very very specific dream and also they know that the Titanic had a record number of people um cancel their tickets for that maiden voyage the one that sank\nAnd the the somehow they knew ahead of time so we're picking up all all kinds of information\nAhead of time it's not beyond the realm of possibility that we're also sending out what we want to have happen we're thinking about it the key though is\nI think being really specific as I mentioned before and also the power of a group you know we had before our break we had that caller call in about how to fix all of his his illnesses you know his pain\nAnd I really got to say that the one way is to get a power of a group together because let them in ten for you be very specific about where your pain is that you want to kill the pain and you're you know if you've got a pain in your left so\nI'm left being too you know focus on that the really really specific about it\nAnd if you don't have I should say if you don't have seven other good friends\nTo be part of physically we have a place on our Web site limit ... dot com forward slash forum\nWhich allows people to just sign up uh either advertise that they want a group and their time zone or they can joined an existing group and we have hundreds and hundreds of groups that are meeting all the time on on there so you can just set up a group virtually that way\nHave you ever seen anything backfire dream is\nNo nothing I mean we've had\nPeople who say they feel worse for a little while you know after they've done the intention maybe they feel a little bit more pain but it usually resolves and it's so much better so I've never had an instance yet where somebody has really got worse over this\nAnd nothing you know at wars nothing has happened but in most cases if they persist at it if they keep meeting with their group big things and big changes to start happening\nOkay let's go to

greets and they grabbed me by my arm and they said if you see Dr wallich would you just thank him he's saved my life so you've helped a lot of people\nIt literally millions and they were in fifty countries now jargon are so very proud of that so we have five thousand products to deal with over nine hundred different diseases and uh it's just that we run into this all over the world and it's just a very gratifying able to help so many people\nStory that I had a couple of weeks ago that I saved knowing you are going to be on was and you've talked about this but eating foods like bacon and sausages they say\nAnd then I had a couple of weeks ago that I say you know when you were going to view on was that you've talked about this but eating food like bacon and sausages they say may raise the risk of breast cancer what's going on here\nWell it's an absolute fact or you know if my thesis for my postdoctoral fellowship and the sixties and seventies I did twenty thousand autopsies I'm Seventeen thousand some change over four hundred and fifty four species of animals and three thousand humans are looking for\nA a common thread were animals were getting the same um diseases in death or from the same pollutants because everybody knew the earth is going to end until weeks from pollution as humid and when he found was of course that uh there were no deaths from a pollution\nUm but the but I did find that when people ate one serving a day with a male or female they won Serbia Dave any causes me things like Delhi slice of the sandwich meat sauce a ham bacon baloney salami pastrami pepperoni dirt economy spam Cerrito those kinds of things [noise]\nUm they increase their risk many different types of cancers at the same rate\nAs smoking two packs of cigarettes a day I I wrote that up and published in Nineteen Seventy one everybody laughed at me well in two thousand Fifteen\nThe world Health Organization and set it and then just a couple of weeks ago there's big study in England where they said they looked at like five hundred thousand people who are getting these processed meats and sure enough you know men get breast cancer younger you know Israel of women\nAnd of course it also have um a cause and effect a in a lung cancer and colorectal cancer and stomach cancer and so on\nAbsolute fact and so I had an them eat and processed meats for fifty years\nTalk I've got a friend of mine who has been\nJust starting the regimen ... a little late and let me tell you why\nShe went to the doctor a couple of months ago and the diagnosed her with the uterine cancer okay are you there I guess they're going to give her full hysterectomy she's all upset but a ... ... what do you do at this stage\nOkay has metastasized other words has left the uterus and gone to lymph nodes and the liver and that kind of thing I don't think so\nOkay well I'm your immune system is your best friend when you have cancer or chemotherapy kills cancer cells no doubt about it but it also killed normal cells many people who die probably eighty percent of the people who died when they're getting chemotherapy treatment for cancer\nOr the dodges oh gosh you know we just we got 'em too late and it's so sorry that we weren't able to to stop the cancer invariably it was the fact that the chemotherapy agents killed all the normal cells that killed a patient's cancer\nAnd so that's a problematic thing a with a treated with chemotherapy but as everybody's choice where they're going to get that are not\nThe antioxidants and immune support is your best friend when you have any type of cancer any type of cancer and so here in cancer testicular cancer prostate cancer colorectal cancer stomach cancer lung cancer brain cancer I mean we could we could save John McCain of you to come to us\nOkay ah he had a brain cancer others actually caused by the patients have a single mineral and I'm\nA ... and so by the gate and chemotherapy instead of giving them the nutrients\nIn and it is it okay to do both\nWell many people do and do they do very well we we have one\nI Would God Forbid young I Would I Would I Would you know because unlike conventional medicine in some cases uh but I Love natural things in all cases but I probably would do ... I had my debts and do a combination\nUm but I Love natural things in all cases but I probably would do ... I had my doubts and do a combination\nNothing wrong with that well we have one product I mean we have I'd probably probably two dozen antioxidant products I Would take them all but um there's two of them are one of which was done at big study I'm In I'm a Charlotte North Carolina I'm In the medical school\nAnd there was a ten year study a hundred and twenty million dollar study was a government study and um it's it's on our mosque a dime grape seed extract has a liquid or from our um nature's Pearl division\nAnd it's probably shouldn't street journals and it just came out like last year at the end of the study and it was one of the most effective um cancer which I say survival I'm a products\nAnd so liquid and you take two servings a day for a hundred pounds of body weight\nAnd um there's nothing like it out there and that so they're they're just so excited I'm like a hundred and twenty million dollar government study medical school in Charlotte North Carolina publishing the tree medical journals it's liquid extract\nOf of from the mosquito and grape seed and it's just a beautiful product and then of course we have we call her the radical\nUh eight hundred and fifty university studies in Japan on the radical it or has the a few Clayton which is an extract from red green algae that they credit is the reason why they have so few cancer deaths there and they have a a lower rate of cancer than any other nation because they eat so much of this\nRed marine allergy is part of the sushi stuff as part of their standard diet\nAnd so we have a political Z radical and few causes either capsules and the radical the liquid and so I take that and of course I'd take the most 'cause I ain't grape seed capsules and they take the most getting grape seed liquid just for prevention I keep my immune system a top and I don't eat the processed meats\nAnd um and and so you get your body than Ninety ascension your chance to sixteen minerals sixteen vitamins film as bad as your body functions probably including your immune system\nAnd you're going to do very well um your quality of life goes up it live longer you are able to fend off and avoid so many diseases I because most of the ones that used to be said to be genetic I really just simple nutritional deficiency disease is [noise]\nAnd that's why my thesis charges in the Smithsonian Institute of natural treasure and sells for twenty five thousand dollars\nEach jeeze that's amazing young jeopardy the company behind critical Health News dot com is entering the cannabis markets are you in a big way right now we use CBD Oil I I think is going to be a wonderful people who says\nWell I'm Glad you brought that up because you know there were thousands of little companies have out there CBD Oil they sell CBD Oil as in tobacco shops in with the stores and liquor stores and so forth\nSo what we did we added things to or CBD Oil or so to blend and you get the benefit of the CBS show plus the enhancement of these other products got three products right now and we're going to have two more before the end of the year of the first one was to drop or ... if you put drops on your time it's called relaxed\nAnd at this ... blend has camera meal and lavender Larry in which many people are familiar with and melatonin all just sort of relax you and just so good very smart\nKnow and so now instead of our CBD which everybody else has\nDealing with say five or six standard ... of problems including sleep apnea and so forth now are blend with all these are again Kevin ... tone and with our TBO now it deals with fifty issues\nOh these are again came a meal amateur malaria and melatonin with RCB you know it deals with the issues and of course we have a topical cream it's a battle for pain and not only does it have the pain relief of CPR which are just fabulous and its own right we have a big\nMixture of herbs in there which I'm ... and minerals and of course we have ... on another any ...\nHold on for a shutdown we'll talk more about this I've got a whole handful of emails that have come in for you\nYou say you make it easy to own bitcoin in your IRA talk about that\nGeorge we do all the work we buy it for you holding insecure account and sell it for you any proceed you accumulate will be retained tax deferred until you take a distribution\nKevin any of our listeners want to learn more about the bitcoin i._r._a. what can they do\nThey can call for a free book at one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty or visit black man IRA dot com that one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty or visit black man IRA dot com\nThanks again Kevin and once again you can call for a free market one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty one eight hundred and five seven nine sixty sixty or visit block them into our a dot com\nSixty one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty or visit block mint R.
