a smart cities have been pushing all along with the United nations\nIs partly agenda it's all part of agenda Twenty one it's all part of a smart cities in twenty thirty and green economy and\nYou know and and you know I've been talking about this for years and we're all going on climate will never come\nTo that it is that it's happening now they're pushing the issue the FCC wants people to start

fuel and\nThe closer he got to get the truth to the she was told that if he didn't back down there would be dire consequences for him and his family and it makes me think along the lines as well as as you know I live here in the mid west and\nUh you know biofuel as far as the eye can see in the fields of corn and soybeans\nAnd I think are maybe beyond something about this a lot of these fields are sprayed with you know they call pesticide ... I Believe that could be one of the forms of getting the end of the fuel because it can't be broken down and can't be destroyed\nSo therefore wants to fuels turned into biofuel for jet fuel and therefore it's going to be sprayed\nWell that's it it's one way they can do it yes I mean what a lot of this and I've said this before or get them to do it where they put it in GMO foods for one so you you get it from GMO foods\nYou get it from the Kim trails you get it from a when they put in the water supply or you don't think that they're going to stick something like fluoride in the water supply they're not going to pick something else in the water supply to the most definitely are uh it's on the products are it's on the products you buy a it's on the clothes you wear\nAnd it's all this data it's all about data okay so what they're doing is they're using particles to to get massive\nData on everybody was and it goes beyond the you know you think you're off the Internet and they're not getting data and they're getting data on something that you have and or even your money has the little particles on it and the little metal wiring in it so they can track\nYou and figure out what's going on with it so they can track their money as well\nAbsolutely you know as as a you're physically track through the ether and the wife five bills that are generated or west radio off\nArticle that come out here about a year ago my there are a little bit longer ago about how they can actually tell who the person is probably the gates of them are walking oh younger the\nYeah the gate a also once again\nI think it was a few days ago we were talking about what is it two million\nA closed circuit TV cameras having to be installed in the United states for most of the smart grid cities and again for the surveillance apparatus of their wishing to put in play a so not only do they have the cameras to see you they'll have\nA the data to have on you if they need to access\nThat data through a ... you know you're going down a particle smart just evil dust like a a song called it but these are called ... says what they're called\n... but we live on the truth uh here in the small town that I reside in maybe about five thousand people they put up a three security cameras all the post office and three security cameras at the uh the local park right\nAnd it's because we all want a safe utopia smart city and it won't be our police either in the future will not be a it will not be the police were used to it will be forces that will be actually\nUnder the control and the police chiefs will answer to an autonomous robots that will make determinations as to who are threats and who aren't threats as soon as part of what is your home was about jade home was a a rape yawn project\nIt I mean a lot of other people said differently but we report it was a rape you on project to basically do a test run on the grid system that we're planning on putting in play with the ... system that they that everybody will soon be carrying with them if they're not carrying with them now\nAbsolutely it makes me think very much of al ... and the the USSL ridge although if you're familiar with this story\nOh they're going to be like a long time ago yeah awesome yeah well I you know I appreciate all your thoughts on this thank you so much for calling John soak you\nEither by speaking of John John Brennan talks about how interest that he is for the future and how to deliver certain things by a stratospheric air assault injections here we go\nAnother example is the rate of technologies often referred to collectively as geo engineering that potentially\nCould help reverse the warming effects of global climate change one that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric air assault injection or as a high a method of seat in the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's heat and most of the same way that kind of like the Russians do\n[noise] so that's a John Brennan and uh that's not out of context he was talking with the council on Foreign Relations and other body think tank that\nActually runs this country from the sidelines talking about the future for a strategic air assault inoculations injections it's certainly a a brave new world that's for sure it's\nGoing to Sam and Kansas Hi Sam you're on ground zero good evening\nLied hey I'm Glad to hear your lady soon find out if you are as well yes and when you see here ever big hugging the kiss for me I Will definitely okay [noise]\nUm [noise] maybe you can answer this question and [noise] I don't know how knowledgeable you are about it and my question is uh [noise] hit it down to layman's terms basically\nYou have these tiny microphones mhm and they broadcast signal I mean it it's not necessarily a voice communication\nNo at state of communication and celebrate it has nothing to do with voice they don't listen to you but the data is kept on you so then there'll be a data marking it'd probably be indefinite data but it certainly will be data on what the the the sensors are picking up all over the world\nDon you still do then there'll be a data marking it'd probably be indefinite data but it's certainly will be data on what the the the sensors are picking up all over the world\nOkay my question is also is it a receiver and transmitter or is it just a a transmitter\nMostly receiver but of course it's going to help with the Internet of things so yes there will eventually be transferred hundreds away to integrate us into the machines and machine learning and\nDo it and if it isn't it if it is now it will be\nIt can be yeah but at the moment they just want to for data is it's basically data collection on everything including inner inner inanimate objects like bridges and whether or not a road needs to be paved or whether or not there is a charcoal and the road they can detect that or whether or not you know that sort of thing\nIf they can do that to inanimate objects they can do to people as well\nWell that's the whole point I mean they were able to ingest it and we get it through a you know vaccines Kim trails GMO food things of that nature it's all there anyway and that's why people are saying what kind of do to get rid of it but we're nothing it's just like you know when you inhale or when you inhale particularly from a smokestack goes into your body or liver has to process it\nAnd you're still alive and you're still breathing unless of course they say that living next to a smokestack is giving you black lung and then you can say well I can blame that company for giving me black lung everybody has been in them and now we're no reason to panic\nJust be advised that this is how they're going to be able to put sensors all over the world in two years\nSo then it it's safe to assume that eventually they'll be able to manipulate you\nSaw maybe yeah but see that's the thing is I was talking with Ron during the break and he was a kind of blood but he was he was very serious and it's like we say we know we could be kidding but we're very serious about what we're kidding about\nHe said ... says the new investment is into memory setters he said if you invested in memory centers you will be a billionaire because memories centers of the new things to invest in\nSo they can control your metabolism they can control your thoughts and they can even convince you that you're sick\nWell that was the idea Bebe behind quelled McCall program that's what the program was about the classified instilled conspiracy theory 'cause there's no way we can prove it otherwise it's all circumstantial evidence or\nYou know or that you speculative evidence when you're looking at a piece of paper that could've been forged are made up but still it was out long before this ever became an issue and people were worried that are in fact they tried to dismiss it saying it's all a hoax but most of the people that were involved\nIn bringing it to the public or either killed or died or committed suicide it's just amazing everybody there was a you know attached\nTo this project or at least declassify or bring it to the public were either killed or suicide it or what have you\nWell here's my thoughts yeah if it's broadcast [noise] it's possible to blow up the signal it with may take a continuous electromagnetic pulse\nOregon uh you know but the thing is that it is possible\nBut then all they'd have to do is just dust again and ah and so you constantly would be struggling are having a a trouble to avoid it you know I don't think it said it said data system\nThat is that collects data on everything so they want data on you or or the the fire hydrant next to the house or how many times the lamp turns on to the delight of the neighborhood they have that information\nWell and if you do manage to block the signal their equipment would tell them the signals being blocked can\nCatch thrown or a parrot cage maybe I don't know fairly ... work a thug with a criminal ballot\nPeople that want to target in time and again it's half I don't know why they would do that but uh yeah I was

[noise]\nHey and welcome back to the coast to coast Georgian already went through you have a marvelous Monday Night program for you mark lunar of course the astrologer them later on Gordon Moore joins us to talk about flying saucers from beyond the earth and he\nWas one of the first people to be part of NIH Kaplan national investigations committee an aerial phenomena so I'm looking forward to that but mark alone or of course began his astrological studies in New York back in Nineteen Seventy two\nMarks birth Aquarius news website which is amazing represents a merging of astrological wisdom was late breaking reporting in an online news paper format he's done thousands of astrological consultations\nAnd mark welcome back to the program\nOh thank you George glad to be here\nLooking for is that your only website or do you have others\nDo we just started a great their enterprises that that's what I Want her to a seven stars of the great there it's very exciting fate of the art very beautiful\nWhich one do you prefer that we use\nA grape enterprises my daughter has just been the Web math their Web designer look very very beautiful and all kinds of new things on their\nSuper what do you run up to lately well then that's what we've had a full time right well\nPretty much um and really getting into the world of pod cast beginning thing was with a book and other kinds of things that we've sort of been wanting to move into and suddenly now with the state of the art website we're really getting going with that\nYou were with me years ago and when you were first on with me ah our executive producer Lisa line who thinks the world abuse says I'm going to give you a special guest he's a mundane astrologer right and I went what what what are you keeping me somebody who's mundane for\nIt if it's actually uh I I guess in the field of astrology that that's the name they've been around for hundreds of years for people who study pretty much it's it's really earth astrology global astrology\nIs relative nations world leaders thing with like eclipse is new moon is full of major planetary alignment\nIn other words that's kinda the opposite to doing personal horoscope readings although I've I've been doing that\nJust as long um for the word again now people think of mundane of kind of just ordinary and that's really not what it is\nAre the results the same mundane astrology and personal horoscope type ...\nNo I mean well you're dealing with the same plan a fine line there there's a fine line isn't there well\nKind of the lake or caused them rather than microcosm and so people who are in my field it's just kind of they're they're wanting to take the broad objective universal perspective on things that they prefer to look at the big picture of national events current events the way the world isn't it\nIt's just kind of the way I was I read the the ... the world book um you know the almanac the world ... book affects every year would come out back in the fifties and sixties is still going after a hundred and fifty years actually mostly for sports like baseball growing up in New York with all the sports baseball football and so on\nSo I got into that and was really into ... social studies and current events and then of course a President Kennedy came into office with the with the Peace Corps the alliance for progress I was I was a young teenager and then we know what happened you know in the sixties there\nAnd I just wanted to keep focusing more on the world the nation in the world probably because of that particular event\nMark tell us exactly what is ... is\nWell what we're as I said before as above so below this goes back to I'm ancient Egypt the idea of a uh being called ... or the the thrice great ... which is the actual\nEgyptian Greek name for for the planet mercury and supposedly there was a deity somebody came down and taught all kinds of numbers and mathematics and we really get a lot of our astrology we know I'm of the modern astrology we say modern goes back about two thousand years to the time of someone named Ptolemy\nWho was also connected to Egypt but then we go back to Rome we go back to Greece but really Egypt is where there's so much and\nI also studied all kinds of things we regarding Atlantis or when I first got into the whole field I got into reincarnation\nMeditation metaphysics\nLived at the ... community after spending a number of years I'm working next to the United nations have what's called the Alice Bailey center or loses publishing and I know you've had some people on you know connected to those areas\nLet's talk about ritual grade planets what does that mean\nWell again if we were just we're all living on the sun or from the solar perspective he Leo nothing the planets just keep going the ordinary cycles\nAmerica has an eighty eight day forward moving a orbit around the sun um we have three hundred and sixty five days each planet has its normal motion but because we're Ninety three million miles away and the astrology we use as what we were called geo centric\nEvery so often all the planets no this is not the center moon George but all the planets\nWill tend to appear to go in reverse from our vantage point it's kind of like a this is the perfect metaphor you're at a train station and you're in a train and your train is beginning to pull out okay now another train right next to yours\nIs going to go in the same direction they start pulling out after you end up kind of looks like an optical illusion for a moment like you know they're kind of ... in your direction but they're like going the other way and it's confusing well that is kind of the idea of retrograde motion\nSo what most people have tuned into all over the decades\nIs mercury going in reverse because that planet does it three times from the earth perspective for about three weeks at a time\nAnd what's amazing now into that as an Eighteen if you if I went to Google or safari one of these places and you put in mercury retrograde year and then you click on images\nIt's filled George with all kinds of things like stop signs and road signs saying mercury recreate don't go here don't go there because people are actually too afraid that the cycles are negative when the planet's going to reverse\nIf you had ... would you get five different kinds readings at any given time\nUm well let me answer it one way if people who really studied them to feel like I have with four and a half decades very intensively if you had say a five of those people me it's\nSame chart of somebody or the same event\nAnd you ask them you know specific questions I think you've pretty much get the same kind of understanding and interpretation depending on what the questions are as long as\nThe what I Try and do you know we we've often talked about politics and other things over the years because I've been on during the election times and often you know people want to hear a prediction you're gonna go\nHowever astrology really works best\nIn terms of ... or as you said and he studied it or not just psychology and UFOs and ... dollars and everything else\nBut he actually studied astrology hundreds of people got married and he's the one that I use is called before whatever is born at a moment of time has the qualities of that moment of time it's because time\nShould not be thought of as like I'll meet you at ten o'clock in the morning at such and such a place\nSo that people think of time has kind of a convenient system it's really a power and so when a person is born and they have a particular astrology charts at at their first moments that they pick their first breath the sun the moon the planets they're put around in a great circle\nAnd they're in different signs of the ... and his trawler puts it altogether and reads it as a kind of I'm almost like a spiritual genetic code to interpret what is the greater purpose or higher destiny of that particular individual but\n... ... several hundred thousand people around the world are born on any given day and so lots of people have more or less the same kind of\nSolar energy lunar energy and climate or energy it's just indifferent formations some setting summarizing some above and below so at any rate the answer is basically I think that most astrologers kinda who've been around the horn along time will come up with a similar result\nArgue psychic too or just in Charlotte\nI'm Glad you asked that question I okay if I say out to the public my my son is in Pisces which tends to be at least as I understand that sign rather reticent to to be a for instance do walk on the planet earth for Twenty years I'm not\nSomebody who likes marketing and advertising and commercial stuff I'm much more focus that is why the mundane astrology virtual things\nAnd so I'm fundamentally um I ... it's interesting you ask me that because I have been very psychic\nAnd the two of them but I don't broadcasted but particularly in things like sports because I that's what I Love the most\nAnd scientifically in in sports or astrological psychic like okay stay with us mark where the break we're going to come back and talk about world events how they affect all of us and the next hour we'll take your phone calls with the astrologer but his website great beer enterprises dot com Martin Lorna\nUm and then October Nineteen Nineteen eighty seven the one day crash\nI'm not anticipating anything like that at least I'm not at the moment I'm the one thing that is interesting though um is that the the\nPeople call this planet furnace Iran of your ear and its depending on their pronunciation but that plan at the first of the out a plan of um which is so powerful when America was born because when a Seventeen eighty one\nWhen the American revolution was one is is the same year that Iran is was cited by sir William Herschel and ironically and bath England\nUm but at any rate that planet has just gone into tourists okay and tourists as the main\nSign of money and ... New York stock exchange which is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to ... Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two [noise]\nAnd so not yet but in the o five years\nOr Iran and spends about seven years in a sign that planet which is a planet of extreme change revolution the unconventional\nSoda things coming out of left field shocks and surprises Iran us will cross over the sun the solar life force of the New York stock exchange when when that happens it'll probably happen three times in the course of the year but it is a little bit down the road although\nIf that happens with some of the other things I see on the horizon for America which is\nFacing Pluto coming back uh which takes two hundred and forty seven years and if you had two hundred and forty seven years to Seventeen Seventy six he get two thousand twenty two two thousand twenty three\nAnd that's one of the big things that mundane astrologers of my field people look at these kind of thing with like a a nation's chart of nations are boring like people if you can locate the birth time of country cities have charts states of the union have charts\nBut America is definitely going to have something very big coming coming up in a number of years including I'll probably market changes but I don't see it right now what about Chris zones\nNow cryptic does this this brings up something I find really fascinating and and this is one of the bigger things in the field of astrology it's part of mundane astrology\nIt's that over about an eight hundred year cycle okay it's actually seven hundred Ninety four years the ... the planets Jupiter and Saturn which the largest planet if they've been actually looked at by people going back a couple of thousand\nFor years the ... the planets Jupiter and Saturn which the largest planet they've been actually looked at by people going back a couple of thousand years we can go back to the middle east and they were charting believe it or not because they didn't have\nA all of our modern conveniences they were sky watchers so the the ancient people were not just astrologers they were a stronger is they just didn't have the scientific kind of\nThings that we have now we can locate everything exactly to a degree of ... but basically Jupiter and Saturn or the big movers and shakers and they go through each of the elements fire earth air and water to make a what's happening is in Eighteen forty one every Twenty years\nJupiter and Saturn have been in earth science okay and that has been the rise of the main banking world the financial world as we know it\nBut what's gonna happen is on December Twenty one of two thousand twenty which is only two years in a couple of months from now\nThose two planets Jupiter and Saturn merge together at the beginning of Aquarius and then for the next like a hundred and eighty years all the Jupiter Saturn are going to be an air science and the point here is that crypto currency is or more connected to the air element of things that are more\nA serial that are more on the line that are more part of the communication world and not part of the physical material dimension that we've been dealing with since the Eighteen forties of the banking world the corporate world and all that so that we're we're ready to have a big change but we're not yet there\nHave you been following the story of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nOr should I say unfortunately yes yeah I guess you could say that\nA very stormy and um I we do have a couple of things on the website that people can look at I've created something new\nAnd my daughter has created it really beautifully it's called the astro flash it allows me to do some shorter things so I don't have to write very very long articles\nBecause so many people now they want to kind of a short hit so I've got a couple of things on grey parrot prizes in our or a earth Aquarius news zones so now or the chorus news which is still a website we have a smaller earth Aquarius news segment engraved their enterprises and people can read some of my takes about what's been happening\nWith a Brett Kavanaugh and and Dr ah Christine Blasey Ford\nInteresting take on all of this will soon you can you predict if he I mean today one of his color Joe ... says I Can't call them a friend who said that he was a drunk\nWell you know it's interesting with President Trump because we know he is he is he's not a drinker because of his brother died of alcoholism\nYou know and regardless of where people are on the political spectrum or the president certainly speaks his mind sometimes to some people too much\nBut the thing is is that you sort of wonder what is going on here with whether or not um he could withdraw I mean you know it it looks like he's going to stick with it from what from what he said you know last Thursday\nI don't think it I think it's going to be hard to prove anything\nThrough um you know that such and such an event actually happen however the whole ambiguity of everything is really big and what I did is I looked at the tried for the moment of Thursday when the session began you see that's part of mundane astrology don't always limits in charge of a person although you can do that\nAnd I have looked at their charts individually but very often if it's a national thing or an international thing what the mundane astrologer does as we look for the moment that something began and it's like a chart just like a ... a baby was born and we look at that chart and that chart is very descriptive of that whole tunnel last Thursday\nCan I put you on the spot and ask you if you think he's going to get confirmed astrological speaking\nWell okay here's the interesting thing you brought up the retrograde this Friday the planet Venus in the science Scorpio which is often connected to not just like\nOkay here's the interesting thing you brought up the retrograde this Friday the planet Venus in the science Scorpio which is often connected to not just psychic things but sexuality Venus is going to make one of those retrograde at the end of the week and Mitch McConnell just said today hey we're going to vote on this thing this week he keeps trying to push it\nI don't think it'll happen but well\nYeah well the thing is is that there's too much unknown but if I Would hazard a guess you know I Would just say there's certainly pushing forward it'd be a major embarrassment but here's the deal is if he doesn't get confirmed there's going to be just as conservative with somebody else who's going to be nominated\nIn in his in his place so it's not as if suddenly would be a liberal or Merrick Garland they're not getting in there\nWho's or anybody out there that a squeaky clean\nWell I think that would be because they've been saying that uh a\nLot but my question to alert you think you'll get confirmed about um your logically speaking\nWell astrological you we know his chart I Would I Would say probably but I I just think it's going to be based on pushing from the Republicans full force you know Mitch McConnell trying to take control he used to hazard a guess I'm not that side of the equation\nYou still didn't answer me though I think it will get confirmed do you do okay All right that that that's something that\nMight be one I I I I'll be wrong on but er well it'll say now\nIs at least you took a stand\nRight because when the whole thing happened with Trump and Hillary um where so many of the predictors of you know these forecasters ... we're all looking at everything um I was on and I looked at the numbers and I thought that Hillary would probably went on she did have more you know a popular vote but she lost those key states by small amounts Michigan\nWisconsin a Pennsylvania sixty seven thousand votes out of a hundred and twenty million and that turned the election to the electoral college in Trump won\nSo amazing work now next stop let's talk about Kim Jong on in his upcoming planned meeting with President Trump the second meeting right what do you what do you think what do you think it's happening here\nUm well I'll tell you one thing and I think this'll this'll be an interesting thing for you to when you talk to your other or people who come on often about Iran and the world situation\n[noise] I think it's a done deal that they are going to have nuclear weapons and when and they're never going to get rid of them\nBut what's gonna happen is that because of the way Trump is doing this thing um in other words it will be like you develop this kind of Brotherhood [laughter] whether it's a false whether or not a kind of you do these kinds of things that no other president would have ever done and you try and just sort of like make things nights\nAnd then eventually you know right now they just said the other day uh the secretary of state said we would like them to denuclearize\nBy the end of of the president's administration I don't know if you've caught that did you see that New Hampshire did it it was like we're wait we want them to do it tomorrow last week why they're dragging their feet and then\nDuring so I don't know if it was a late friday or something oh you know as long as they do it within the next few years we're fine what you know and so I just I've seen this all the way through\nThe danger I think I'm In all of this\nThis personal diplomacy we don't know if Kim Jong un is going to be the leader tomorrow the next day in this country at least we have a succession of how\nAre you also don't know what he's doing is a trend\nSo you got the tricky thing we the other thing is uh in astrology this is very important Donald Trump's sharp President Trump's choice is known we've known as exact birth time for decades it's not a mystery\nHillary Clinton's birth time could have been twelve hours off nobody has figured it out it's not talked about birth certificate it's not as if we've ever seen it so\nShe was kind of an unknown quality in terms of her chart okay\nIt's not talk about birth certificate it's not as if we've ever seen it so\nShe was kind of an unknown quality in terms of her chart okay we didn't know whether she was morning or evening we don't know the year of Kim Jong il their

amount of Capricorn the previous caller had sun a Capricorn you have one two three you have five less devising Capricorn more than even when you have an Aquarius a Capricorn\nUm is worth Saturn is moving and so you also if you want to do this you're you're moving into a strong career cycle\nAnd I mentioned earlier you asked me George something really for two to three good happening and I said Jupiter going into its own kind of said you're curious well here's somebody Donna you're born with Jupiter and Saturn ... so it's going to be home coming few over the next year a lot of Jupiter and Saturn\nSo do something in the world or something you know where you're making 'em expressing yourself in society and kind of a mover in shaker ... even in your community or neighborhood or your state you know to do something that you feel a significant and worthwhile\nAlright Don good luck to you hope everything works out so amazing mark how you're able to pinpoint individuals with a strong as well\nBecause it's kind of like if if I were a doctor okay and\nI'm doing if you just if you said okay this person needs advice about their chest area and you put an x-ray in front of me I just start

the chart is\nIs so magical but it's like again if this were a beginner and they they'd be looking around and saying what do I do you know I see that there's the symbol for Aquarius there's Pisces there's some Capricorn but\nIt would be like gobbledygook but but when you have done it for forty six years you know is there like on the website I have what's called the cosmic calendar which used to be and walk on the planet earth and now it's independent and that's where people can\nSee what's in the sky every day and they can they can subscribe you know for a year or two and we even have a new

of I ... when I when I Do a consultation for somebody I hate to say this I mean I'd love to have them come back hey I'd like to do a deeper thing and you know I could do charts of compatibility with a loved one or a parent and child\nBut my goal is to get them so excited that ... years later they would come back and say you know you did my reading and I started to study and I'm doing it on my own

...\nSo I I Would tell people to go to our strategy for thing and they couldn't put it in their birth data and get that relatively quickly for me to do things is ... you know it's more expensive you have to do to charge you gotta get background information both people but basically astrologers have been doing this for a long time\nAnd it's and it's like you look at Venus and Mars proponents of love and or the sun and moons matching up and all the different planets but it's quite complex but you can do it\nAre you like a human to roll card\n[laughter] well I've created to erode decks one with my ex wife Asia or we did in ... which have sold well over a hundred thousand copies for the last like almost Thirty years so many different languages and she has done an enormous amount of promotion of that and then I did baseball tomorrow and I just ran into the Gulf War films\nThe other day I hadn't seen her a while and that has not sold all that well because the publishers sort of doing calendars but they had never done a terrific project so I've done to row longer than I've done a strategy\nI'm going to give you our next to a special colors burst said first of all November

those kinds of things and the you know the twelve ... the birthdays\nI don't study Chinese now I just want to make it you know I I'm aware of the five different elements and those kind of things and the you know the ... the birthdays that kind of [noise] but um what I Need to know was was it Nineteen eighty eight\nNineteen eighty eight November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight okay hold on one second okay and while you're doing that we've got a couple of minutes before the break mark and we'll take some more calls when we come back later on tonight by the way we are going to be talking about flying saucers from beyond the earth which Gordon Moore go ahead mark\nOkay so November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight I'm just putting in like close to sunrise this person is a sun science Scorpio but you're not going to believe is the third time in a row we looked like we have another mood in areas that that is really\nTalked about that so unusual that yeah I mean there are twelve times three callers all within areas man\nThat's my that's my audience\nSo again we have somebody and this is interesting traditionally Mars which I mentioned earlier is going to hit its own zero point of areas on December thirty one and New Years which is what I said you know it's it's traditionally a planet of war but it can also be a planet of energy a planet of passion\nFor um sports exercise and this person who just called um has the moon and areas conducting Mars and he's the son signed Scorpio and traditionally Scorpio was also ruled by Mars was considered to the ancient Mars is night fine\nBecause it ruled water science so this person has a lot of Mars a lot of intensity um a lot of insurance energy that comes through the Scorpio world and currently Jupiter is making a ... a a crossing just finished three times on\nThis individual is mercury so he the fact that he made it through on this is probably part of Jupiter offering a kind of blessing just that he's on here and again I Would say to him he also has Capricorn strong\nTo do some kind of a study in metaphysics philosophy um people who have his so defined Scorpio need to really get into the things I'm sort of in a hot and heavy weight and stay with it\nDo you pick a lottery numbers Mark I'm I I I often enter you know the different lotteries Powerball so on a five years ago I had four out of the five

astrological chart\nUm [noise] I don't know that that would actually do something although my favorite magazine is astronomy young at a Wisconsin I don't know if you get it it's beautiful and a credible\nGotten it for a long time and they just had and the previous issue with there's a a free program I I don't remember exactly where it is I have an order to yet\nWhich I think is really unique with it the people can see\n'em they can plot like around America around the world when the moon would a cult a planet or star and even an asteroid to sort of comes close to what you're asking about and that's actually a software program so\nIn the software world these are amazing things but meteor you know we have the you know the different kind of media storms that happen every so often like there's one in August you know the Perseids and different ones um they're they're ...\nMore psychologically the people who like are prone to you know respond to earth changes you know some people tune in to earthquakes and animals and you you know things like that so I'm anything's possible but it wouldn't really change the charts so much\nAlright let's go back to the final coal series they line up for you or your next birthday is October Twenty one Nineteen fifty coming up pretty soon a birthday October Twenty one Nineteen fifty we'd go west to Albert in Tucson, Arizona Tucson how are you Albert\nHey good evening George good evening mark unhappy upcoming birthday to you my friend oh well thank you hey another year oh there you know\nThey keep clicking by do you have a question for mark I just want him to do reading for you\nOr he can do or reading my question which I've been kind of in a financial limbo for the last year so I was wondering if that was going to change and the other question is about you know it's love and money the money go ahead Mr learner\nOkay uh by the way I did solve the aries three people in a row because there's something called apart a fortune in Arabic astrology which was developed a thousand years ago\nThey were all mathematically oriented that that's where we get algebra hot and there's what's called parts like the part of the birth part of marriage and so on something called the part of fortune\nAnd throughout the entire a segment there the part of fortune for Los Angeles and out on the west coast was in areas the sign that the moon was showing up in the part of fortunes very connected to the moon\nAnd the moon was also is the ... sign cancer and is rising in the first house of self expression which is the kind of archetype of areas area so there was a reason that happened will this fellow now has a Pisces ...\nAnd ... is from from the past from another life or other existence is in the past\nThis person has developed in this could be why the financial thing\nI'm more of sort of a need for compassion may be working in religion and philosophy behind the scenes and it's not ... not very much of a mover and shake her in the world\nSo as an individual people who have Pisces moon come in and they're more impact and path okay for good or for ill okay and some people with strong Pisces moon can get sort of pulled into they can become vulnerable you know to other people and lose their way but\nThe sun side of this individual is the sign of a partnership Libra\nAnd he also has Neptune mercury and Venus there in science so as far as relationship is concerned the keynote esoteric Lee for labor is I Choose the way that leads ... between the two great lines of force and my mentor\nA day and Roger talked about libor as the great pyramid following the mystery of the things which is really Leo in Virgo the body of a lie on the head of a every a woman\nAnd so the whole Egyptian mystery kind of tradition it goes back to the summertime is of cancer Leo Virgo and leave right so so basically spiritually\nThis person should study everything about the great pyramid and that would be very good because there's a lot of more about mysteries even Jesus going and being a potentially initiated you know two thousand years ago during those last years from\nYou know from age twelve or Thirteen to thirty three going all around the world to India possibly to Egypt going to a glass to bury and in England I mean these are kind of law or but may very well have happened so study the great pyramid study Egypt\nA and get into things like reincarnation metaphysics that might help\nAlright anything else they're Albert\nNo just uh how is it my upcoming year looking\nWell Jupiter you have for planets ... inside the terrorists are Jupiter is kind of\nIt's ah how is my upcoming year looking well Jupiter you have for planets flood somebody's inside the terrorists are Jupiter is kind of tick off what are called conjunctions to house which has to do with solving problems\nSo it into a kind of study about how to solve your problems and developing strategic thinking and you'll also have Jupiter contact your Mars what's called high rod and series\nSo those are all unusual planets but that that their gifts from heaven so Jupiter the king of the gods which has a lot to do with you know success however positive thinking faith Providence\nBenevolence is really trying to give you some gifts here so hopefully you can use them\nAnd that's not going to the Rockies November twenty in Nineteen fifty five let's go to Jane and Florida and she was born to forty in the morning or mark\nFor your going fast November twenty of\nNineteen fifty five or time\nTo forty in the morning ... am to forty AM let's go to Jane in Florida she was on her mind Hi Jane\n... how's everything oh I'm going okay hey any question for mark or just reading\nUm or how about general reading\nAll right mark general reading again November twenty of Nineteen fifty five to forty ...\nOkay well uh kept her mom away [laughter]\nWell now we've got the beginning of Aquarius um where you have some strong energy is George and I do as well million at the beginning of aquarium yeah and this woman who is called a has the moon with higher on which was discovered Nineteen Seventy seven\nAnd tire on is kind of a ... so this brings up the idea\nOf getting involved with a group or some kind of group process would be really good for the soul spiritual standpoint\nWhere you're kind of building rainbow bridges between your spiritual life and higher destiny and your personality world but definitely\nTeamwork group were community work global kind of connections you've done this before in the past and it's still important to keep doing it just like the other a color your you're going to get the fortunate on Jupiter energy you have\nAn asteroid called you know the planet Venus which represents represents love relationship or creative artistry in what's called the north no to the moon which is the moon's orbit they're all inside the terrorists are Jupiter is going to help you\nWith all the ... energy that the the big issue probably in your life of being a sun science Scorpio and you have sun close to Saturn is you know or you need to be the warrior the esoteric he noted for scorpions warrior I Am in from the battle I emerged triumphant in every sun science Scorpio comes into life\nHaving to be daring and courageous but also off and having a lot of um challenges just kind of like the need to die to the old and then be reborn but we're Jupiter is moving\nUm is very helpful for you over the next a next year next Thirteen months it starts a November eighth and continues into the rest of the fall into the new year so there are suspicious vibes coming up\nOkay any questions Jane\nUm how about um you know going into my eighth how of um yeah I see that yeah oh is that going to be thinking well if you don't okay\nTo forty in the morning what's happening is that that planet is making what we call a square or right angle\nTo where the moon is and it's all so you're at an age where you're honest is making a square or right angle to its own position\nSo what you want to avoid as nervousness and anxiety because in medical astrology or on that planet Iran has a lot to do with the nervous system so when people are able to sort of meditate or study particularly a cult or metaphysical subjects or things like astrology encountered subjects\nSo when people are able to sort of meditate or study particularly a cult or metaphysical subjects or things like astrology encountered subjects than you're using your energy is on a higher level your intuition is developing than good things are happening but if you sort

C.\nAnd town of ships are wailing shipped captains log\nThat actually described in his own handwriting a disk that came out of this guy went down into the water came back up again and then circled the ship and then that off at a tremendous to it\nAnd and this was like in Eighteen forty eight or something like that and there was another case that I found also in the national archives\nIn the seventeenth century where um I uh some men were rafting a a a ... we're trying to paddle a raft down the muddy river\nAh in in Massachusetts when they saw this huge addicts this that came out\nRaft down the muddy river uh in in Massachusetts when they saw this huge addicts this that came out of the sky I started drawing the raft\nUp river against it and then\nIt ... it lifted up out of the air for a little bit flopped it back down into the water and took off disappear you know ... it had a lot of those things and and a lot of that was um in my book masters of the skies UFOs in perspective\nDo you know people like John Mack and um\nBut no I didn't know John Mack than at all I see I told you about Nineteen eighty to ah\nTo when I started this book are working on this book

name and it's linked up the coast to coast team dot com some of these cases in your book Gordon just bring back just amazing memories\nAh I I just refuse to remember how excited I was every time I read a brand new UFO story\nAnd just looking at them and flying saucers from beyond the earth to recollect all these all these stories all over again are amazing\nYeah yeah well I I kept some good files which I I took her three through the years and I've been I've been wanting for at least the last ten years to do this book and finally got around to it and\nHopefully it's my uh it may be my phone but I think I look at the same maybe has proven about this subject\nWhy do you think the government really has not disclosed what's going on\nIt may maybe about this subject\nAnd why do you think the government really has not just what we know why don't you tell us\nWhy I think they're coming close with this latest program out with the Pentagon and I think it's the closest I've ever come but um I have a theory and it it it it may sound kind of\nA court case but uh I think that we have known all along where these uh uh saucers come from and we've been actually exchanging perhaps technology is what's the main\nIt's it sounds like a far off thing it's not something keel would approve of it in his heyday\nA matter of fact ... was a little reluctant to put out any of the occupied reports until I wrote the book strange effects from UFOs in Nineteen sixty nine which was really a nice cat publication\nBut for the first time we got into the the um occupied in cases and uh\nAnd and and things like that but of course ... main focus was to get to ... hearings he managed to do it twice since Nineteen sixty six Nineteen sixty eight and he has some great hopes for the University of Colorado\nA UFO project matter of fact I call my chapter on that liar liar pants on fire the University of Colorado UFO product project\nBecause we are just symptom of disagreements of our uh out of some of our best cases and I'm In the long run they just almost completely ignored them\nI remember when the ... report came out kind of food do you suppose\nThat was January of Nineteen sixty nine and from that time on\nAll the funding for a night cap went out and then a a a there was not kept staff member who was also had the CIA\nConnections and I think the CIA had been trying to take it over a for some time of course Roscoe, Illinois quarter who was the first chairman of the night cap board after ... took over\nA was the first director of the CIA\n[laughter] yeah yeah what do you think she I wanted to do like you\nJust squash it\n[noise] well I think that's part of it but at the same time I think they wanted to keep it going as long as they had control over it and um but ... didn't

represents a merging of astrological wisdom was late breaking reporting in an online newspaper format he's done thousands of astrological consultations\nAnd mark welcome back to the program\nOh thank you George glad to be here\nLooking for is that your only website or do you have others\nDo we just started a great their enterprises that that's what I Want her to a seven stars of the great there it's very exciting state of the art very beautiful which one do you prefer that we use a grape or enterprises my daughter has just been the Web master and Web designer looks very very beautiful and all kinds of new things on their\nSuper what are you going up to lately well that that's what we've had a full time right\nWell pretty much um and getting into the world of pod cast beginning thing was with the e books and other kinds of things that we've sort of been wanting to\nMove into and suddenly now with the state of the ... website we're really getting going with that\nYou were with me years ago and when you were first on with me or our executive producer Lisa ... who thinks the world abuse says I'm going to give you a special guest teasing mundane astrologer\nRight and I went what what what are you keeping me somebody who's mundane for\nIt if it's actually uh I I guess in the field of astrology that that's the name that has been around for hundreds of years for people who study pretty much it's it's really earth astrology global astrology\nIt's his strategy of nations world leaders thing with like eclipse is new moon is full of major planetary alignment\nIn other words it's kinda the opposite to doing personal horoscope readings although I've I've been doing that just as long [noise] um so the word again now people think of mundane kind of just ordinary and that's really not what it is\nAre the results the same mundane astrology and personal horoscope type or readings\n[noise] no I mean well you're dealing with the same plan a\nFine line there there's a fine line is that there\nAgain kind of it's the make or caused them rather than microcosm of so people who are in my field it's just kind of they're they're wanting to take the broad objective universal perspective on things are they prefer to look at the big picture\nOf national events current events the way the world is and when I was growing up it's this kind of what I was I read the the ... the world book um you know the almanac the world ... book affects every year we'd come out back in the fifties and sixties if they'll going after a hundred and fifty years actually mostly\nThat the world ... book affects every year we'd come out back in the fifties and sixties is still going after a hundred and fifty years actually mostly for sports like baseball growing up in New York with all the sports baseball football and so on\nSo I got into that and was really into ... social studies and current events and then of course a President Kennedy came into office with the with the Peace Corps the alliance for progress I was I was a young teenager and then we know what happened you know in the sixties there\nAnd I just wanted to keep focusing more on the world the nation and the world probably because of that particular event\nMarch tell us exactly what ... is\nWell what we're as I said before as above so below this goes back to ancient Egypt the idea of a uh being called ... or the the thrice great ... which is the actual\nEgyptian Greek name for for the planet mercury and supposedly that was a deity somebody came down and taught all kinds of numbers and mathematics and we really get a lot of our astrology we know I'm of the modern astrology we say modern goes back about two thousand years to the time of someone named Ptolemy\nWho was also connected to Egypt but then we go back to Rome we go back to Greece but really Egypt is where there's so much and\nI also studied all kinds of things we regarding Atlantis or when I first got in the whole field I got into reincarnation\nMeditation metaphysics\nLived at the ... community after spending a number of years I'm working next to the United nations have what's called the Alice Bailey center or loses publishing and I know you've had some people on you know connected to those areas\nLet's talk about ritual grade planets what does that mean\nWell again if we were just if we're all living on the sun or from the solar perspective he Leo nothing the planets just keep going the ordinary cycles\nAmerica has an eighty eight day forward moving a orbit around the sun um we have three hundred and sixty five days each planet has its normal motion but because we're Ninety three million miles away and the astrology we use is what we were called geo centric\nEvery so often all the plot of snow this is not the center moon George but all the planets\nWill tend to appear to go in reverse from our vantage point it's kind of like a this is the perfect metaphor you're at a train station and you're in a train and your train is beginning to pull out okay now another train right next to yours\nIs going to go in the same direction they start pulling out after you end up kind of looks like an optical illusion for a moment like you know they're kind of ... in your direction but there are like going the other way and it's confusing well that is kind of the idea of retrograde motion\nSo what most people have tuned into all over the decades\nIs mercury going in reverse because that planet does it three times from the earth perspective for about three weeks at a time\nAnd what's amazing now into that as an Eighteen if he if I only went to Google Earth safari one of these places and you put in mercury retrograde year and then you click on images\nIt's still George with all kinds of things like stop signs in road signs saying mercury recreate don't go here don't go there because people are actually too afraid that the cycles are negative when the planet is going to reverse\nIf you had five different astrologers would you be had five different kinds of readings at any given time\nUm well let me answer it one way if people who really studied them to feel like I have with four and a half decades very intensively if you had say a five of those people me and for others and you gave them the same chart of somebody or the same event and you ask them\nSay a five of those people me and for others and you gave them the same charter somebody or the same event\nAnd you ask them you know specific questions I think you've pretty much get the same kind of understand again interpretation depending on what the questions are as long as\nThe what I Try and do you know we we've often talked about politics and other things over the years because I've been on during the election times and often you know people want to hear a prediction was you're going to go\nHowever astrology really works best\nIn terms of ... ... as you said and he studied it or not just psychology and UFOs and among dollars and everything else but he actually studied astrology hundreds of people got married and he's the one that I use this call before whatever is born at a moment of time\nHas the qualities of that moment of time it's because time should not be thought of as like I'll meet you at ten o'clock in the morning at such and such a place\nSo that people think of time it's kind of convenient system it's really a power and so when a person who's born and they have a particular astrology charts at at their first moments that they pick their first breath the sun the moon the planets they're put around and a great circle\nAnd they're in different signs of the ... and his trawler puts it altogether and reads it as a kind of I'm almost like a spiritual genetic code\nTo interpret what is the greater purpose or higher destiny of that particular individual but ... ... several hundred thousand people around the world are born on any given day and so lots of people have more or less the same kind of\nSolar energy lunar energy and climate or energy it's just indifferent formations some setting summarizing some above and below so at any rate the answer is basically I think that most of the straw measures kinda who've been around the horn a long time will come up with a similar result\nArgue psychic too or just these droplets\nI'm Glad you asked that question I okay if I say out to the public my my son is in Pisces which tends to be at least as I understand that sign rather reticent to to be\nA for instance do welcome to planet earth for Twenty years I'm not somebody who likes marketing and advertising and commercial stuff I'm much more focus that's why the mundane astrology or natural things\nAnd so I'm fundamentally um I it was interesting you ask me that because I have been very psychic\nAnd the two of them but I don't broadcasted but particularly in things like sports because I that's what I Love the most\nAnd I cite deeply in in sports arrest logically if I could stay with us mark where the break we're going to come back and talk about world events probably affects all of us and the next hour we'll take your phone calls with the stroller your website great mayor enterprises dot com Martin or\nIs so powerful when America was born because when a Seventeen eighty one when the American revolution was one has the same year that Iran is was cited by sir William Herschel and ironically in bath England\nUm but at any rate that planet has just gone into Taurus okay and tourists as the main\nSign of money in ... New York stock exchange which is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to ... Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two\nAnd so not yet but in the o five years\nOr Iran and spends about seven years in a sign that planet which is a planet of extreme change revolution the unconventional\nSort of things coming out of left field shots and surprises Iran us will cross over the sun the solar life force of the New York stock exchange when when that happens it'll probably happen three times in the course of the year but it is a little bit down the road although\nIf that happens with some of the other things I see on the horizon for America which is we're facing Pluto coming back\nUh which takes two hundred and forty seven years and if you had two hundred and forty seven years to Seventeen Seventy six he get two thousand twenty two two thousand twenty three\nAnd that's one of the big things that mundane astrologers of my field people look at these kind of thing with like a a nation's chart of nations are born like people if you can locate the birth time of country cities have charts states of the union have charts\nBut America is definitely going to have something very big coming coming up in a number of years including I'll probably market changes but I don't see it right now what about cribs those\nNow cryptic does this this brings up something I find really fascinating and and this is one of the bigger things in the field of astrology it's part of mundane astrology\nIt's that over about an eight hundred year cycle okay it's actually seven hundred Ninety four years the ... the planets Jupiter and Saturn which the largest planet even actually looked at by people going back a couple of thousand years we can go back to the middle east and they were charting believe it or not because they didn't have\nA all of our modern conveniences they were sky watchers so the the ancient people were not just astrology\nAnd they were charged and believe it or not because they didn't have a all of our modern conveniences they were sky watchers so the the ancient people were not just astrologers they were ... they just didn't have the scientific kind of\nThings that we have now we can locate everything exactly to a degree of ... but basically Jupiter and Saturn or the big movers and shakers and they go through each of the elements fire earth air and water to make a what's happening is in Eighteen forty one every Twenty years\nJupiter and Saturn have been in earth science okay and that has been the rise of the main banking world the financial world as we know\nWhat's going to happen is on December Twenty one of two thousand twenty which is only two years in a couple of months from now\nThose two planets Jupiter and Saturn merge together at the beginning of Aquarius and then for the next like a hundred and eighty years all the Jupiter Saturn are going to be an air science and the point here is that crypto currency is or more connected to the air element of things that are more\nA theory that are more on the line that are more part of the communication world and not part of the physical material dimension that we've been dealing with since the Eighteen forties of the banking world the corporate world and all that so they were were ready to have a big change but we're not yet there\nHave you been following the story of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nOr should I say unfortunately yes\nYeah I guess you could say that\nA very stormy and um I we do have a couple of things on the website that people can look at I've created something new\nAnd my daughter has created it really beautifully it's called the astro flash it allows me to do some shorter things so I don't have to write very very long articles\nBecause so many people now they want to kind of a short hit so I've got a couple of things on grey parrot prizes in our or a earth Aquarius news zone so now or the chorus news which is still a website we have a smaller earth Aquarius news segment and grape or enterprises and people can read some of my takes about what's been happening\nWith Brett Kavanaugh and and Dr ah Christine Blasey Ford\nInteresting take on all of this uh we'll see you can you predict if he I mean today one of his college a quaint and says I Can't call um a friend who said that he was drunk\nWell you know it's interesting with President Trump because we know he is he is he's not a drinker because of his brother died of alcoholism\nYou know and regardless of where people are on the political spectrum or the president certainly speaks his mind sometimes to some people\nToo much but the thing is is that you sort of wonder what is going on here with whether or not um he could withdraw I mean you know it it looks like he's going to stick with it from what from what he said you know last Thursday\nI don't think it's I think it's going to be hard to prove anything\nThrough um you know that such and such an event actually happen however the whole ambiguity of everything is really big and what I did is I looked at the charts for the moment of Thursday when the session began you see that's part of mundane astrology always look at the heart of a personal or you can do that\nAnd I have looked at their charts individually but very often if it's a national thing or an inch natural thing what the mundane astrologer does as we look for the moment that something began and it's like a charge just like a baby was born and we look at that chart and that chart is very descriptive of that whole time all last Thursday\nCan I put you on the spot and ask you if you think he's going to get confirmed astrological speaking\nWell okay here's the interesting thing you brought up the retrograde this Friday the planet Venus into science Scorpio which is often connected to not just psychic things but sexuality Venus is going to make one of those retrograde at the end of the week and Mitch McConnell just said today hey we're going to vote on this thing this week he keeps trying to push it\nThis is going to make one of those retrograde at the end of the week and Mitch McConnell just said today hey we're going to vote on this thing this week he keeps trying to push it\nI don't think it'll happen but well\nYeah well the thing is is that ... there's too much unknown but if I ... for the hazard a guess you know I Would just say there's certainly pushing forward it'd be a major embarrassment but here's the deal is if he doesn't get confirmed there's going to be just as conservative with somebody else who's going to be nominated\nIn in his in his place so it's not as if it would be a liberal or Merrick Garland they're not getting in there\nIs there anybody out there that is squeaky clean\nWell I think that would be because they've been saying that uh uh\nBought bought my question Mr learners you think you'll get confirmed divide 'em out of your logically speaking\nWell Esther logically we know his chart I Would I Would say probably but I I just think it's going to be based on pushing from the Republicans full force you know Mitch McConnell trying to take control\nThem used to hazard a guess on that side of the equation\nYou still didn't answer me though I think it will get confirmed do you do okay All right that that that's probably why\nThat might be one I I I'll be wrong on but er\nWell it'll say now is at least you took a stand\nRight because when the whole thing happened with Trump and Hillary um where so many of the predictors of you know these forecasters were were all looking at everything\nUm I was on and I looked at the numbers and I thought that Hillary would probably went on she did have more you know a popular vote but she lost those key states by small amounts Michigan\nWisconsin a Pennsylvania sixty seven thousand votes out of a hundred and twenty million and that turned the election to the electoral college in Trump won\nSo amazing work now next up let's talk about Kim Jong un on in his upcoming planned meeting with President Trump the second meeting right what do you what do you think what do you think is happening here\nUm well I'll tell you one thing and I think this will this will be an interesting thing for you to when you talk to your other uh people who come on off in about Iran and the world situation\n[noise] I think it's a done deal that they are going to have nuclear weapons they win and they're never going to get rid of him\nBut what's gonna happen is is that because of the way Trump is doing this thing um in other words it'll be like you develop this kind of Brotherhood [laughter] whether it's a false whether or not a kind of you do these kinds of things that no other president would have ever done and you try and just sort of like make things nights\nAnd then eventually you know right now they just said the other day uh the secretary of state said we would like them to denuclearize by the end of of the president's administration I don't know if you're caught that did you see that\nNew sure did it it was like we're wait we want them to do it tomorrow last week why they're dragging their feet and then during so I don't know if it was a late friday or something oh you know as long as they do it within the next few years we're fine what you know and so I just I've seen this all the way through the danger I think I'm In all of this\nThis personal diplomacy we don't know if Kim Jong un is going to be the leader tomorrow the next day in this country at least we have a succession of how\nAre you also don't know what he's doing his attract\nSo you got the tricky thing we the other thing is uh in astrology this is very important Donald Trump's char President Trump's choice is known we've known as exact birth time for decades and it's not a mystery\nHillary Clinton's birth time could have been twelve hours off nobody has figured it out it's not talk about birth certificate it's not as if we've ever seen it so\nShe was kind of an unknown quality in terms of her chart okay we didn't know whether she was morning or evening we don't know the year of Kim Jong un on their reports he was born in Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five he's definitely\nThe evening we don't know the year of Kim Jong un and their reports who was born in Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five he's definitely a Capricorn son we know that we just don't know the year and I think that the north Koreans and people in that part of the world they're really into astrology and things and they want to keep it a mystery\nNot about blame it's about because we didn't get it completely right in the first go around\nAnd when the system fails it is every day and then a Connecticut Senator ... none of us use radio ... use radio ...\nEvery day three or four days\nDo

hours\nOkay or you have a it's interesting\nJust like the previous caller another moon in areas okay where which means like from the past reason lifetime\nYou've developed leadership skills that you need to bring through their kind of instinctual like being in charge being assertive without being aggressive so there was a kind of forceful part but your son sign Aquarius\nAquariums need to learn through groups through friendships through team kind of activities or global kind of things\nAre where you're ... you ... that are sort of close to your philosophy of life and what's in your heart and you're also born with Pisces rising which adds if it's positive a compassionate empathic kind of energy and also it's like a quality\nInterestingly you like the previous caller had an enormous amount of Capricorn the previous caller had sun a Capricorn you have one two three you have five less devising Capricorn more than even when you have an Aquarius a Capricorn\nUm is worth Saturn is moving and so you also if you want to do this you're ... you're moving into a strong career cycle\nAnd I mentioned earlier you asked me George you know it's something really for two to good happening and I said Jupiter going into its own kind of ... well here's somebody Donna you're born with Jupiter and Saturn ... so it's going to be home coming few over the next year a lot of Jupiter and Saturn\nSo do something in the world or something you know we're making 'em expressing yourself in society and kind of a mover and shake her ... even in your community or a neighborhood or your state you know to do something that you feel a significant and worthwhile\nAlright Don good luck to you hope everything works out it's amazing mark how you're able to pinpoint individuals with astrology\nWell because it's kind of like if if I were a doctor okay and what I'm doing if you just if you said okay this person needs advice about their chest area and you put an x-ray in front of me I just start talking you know the doctors thing whatever it is and it's right then you'd say okay\nLooked serious enough that you know going to have to put you on antibiotics and then go back and forth a little bit will for

there's Pisces there's some Capricorn but it would be like gobbledygook but but when you have done it for forty six years you know if they're like on the website I have what's called the cosmic\nLike ... to ... but when you have done it for forty six years you know if they're like on the website I have what's called the cosmic calendar which used to be and walk on the planet earth and now it's

it's important for people to chart themselves right into see the direction they're going for advice\nMy whole goal has always been George again this part of my ... when I when I Do a consultation for somebody I hate to say that I mean I'd love to have them come back hey I'd like to do a deeper thing and you know I can do charts of compatibility with a loved one or a parent and a child\nBut my goal is to get them so excited that ... years later they would come back and say you know you did my reading and I started to study and I'm doing it on my own if I can do that that is the greatest thing that I could do new\nCouples ever come to you mark to say are we compatible with\nWell I Will say that first of all I don't do this anymore\nBut I used to do a lot of marriage ... really yeah but the thing is it's a very fine tuned I'm there we have we have reports that we sell coal friends and lovers and there's something called ...\nSo I I Would tell people to go to our strategy for thing and they couldn't put in their birth data and get that relatively quickly for me to do things is you know it's more expensive you have to do to charge you gotta get background information both people but basically astrologers have been doing this for a long time\nAnd it's and it's like you look at Venus and Mars for pilots of love and or the sun and moons matching up and all the different planets but it's quite complex but you can do it\nAre you like a human too real card\n[laughter] well I've created to erode decks one with my ex wife Asia or we did in ... which have sold well over a hundred thousand copies for the last like almost Thirty years in many different languages and she has done an enormous amount of\nPromotion of that and then I did baseball tomorrow and I just ran into the gal Laura films the other day I hadn't seen her a while and that has not sold all that well because the publishers sort of will doing calendars but they had never done a terrific project so I've done to row longer than I've done astrology\nI'm going to give you our next a special callers birth said first of all November\nNineteen Nineteen eighty eight November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight we're going to Bradley in Illinois Radley do you know where you were born\nThough Illinois Mandela ... well and now how about a time any idea I'm I'm not sure the day time okay do you have a question from

things like well\nI I don't study Chinese now I just wanted to make a you know I I'm aware of the five different elements and those kind of things and the you know the twelve ... the the birthdays that kind of [noise] but um what I Need to know was was it Nineteen eighty eight\nNineteen eighty eight the November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight okay hold on one\nSecond okay and while you're doing that we've got a couple of minutes before the break mark and we'll take some more calls when we come back later on tonight by the way we're going to be talking about flying saucers from beyond the earth would Gordon Moore go ahead mark\nSo November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight I'm just putting in like close to sunrise this person is a sun science Scorpio but you're not going to believe is the third time in a row\nWe've ever Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight I'm just putting in like close to sunrise this person is a sun science Scorpio but you're not going to believe is the third time in a row we looked like we have another mood in areas that that is really talked\nAbout that so unusual that yeah I mean there are twelve times three callers all with an areas man that's my that's my audience\nSo again we have somebody and this is interesting traditionally Mars which I mentioned earlier is going to hit its own zero point of areas on December thirty one and New Years which is what I said you know it's it's traditionally a planet of war but it can also be a planet of energy a planet of passion\nFor a sports exercise and this person who just called um has the moon and areas conducting Mars and he's the son signed Scorpio and traditionally Scorpio was also ruled by Mars was considered to the ancient Mars is night sign\nBecause it ruled the water side to this person has a lot of Mars a lot of intensity um a lot of difference energy that comes through the Scorpio world and currently Jupiter is making a ... a a crossing just finished three times on\nThis individual is mercury so he the fact that he made it through on this is probably part of Jupiter offering a kind of blessing just that he's on here and again I Would say to him he also has Capricorn strong\nTo do some kind of a study in metaphysics philosophy um people who have his science Scorpio need to really get into deep things I'm sort of in a hot and heavy way and stay with it\nYou pick lottery numbers Mark I'm I I I often enter into the different lotteries Powerball so on a five years ago I had four out of the five numbers of larval didn't show up wow closest\nI've come that would have been almost

astrological chart\n[laughter] um [noise] I don't know that that would actually do something although my favorite magazine is astronomy and yeah you got to Wisconsin I don't know if you get it it's beautiful and the credible\nGotten it for a long time and they just had the previous issue where there's a a free program I I don't remember exactly where it is I have in order to yet\nWhich I think is really unique with that the people can see\n'em they can plot like around America around the world when the moon would a cult a planet or star and even an asteroid so it's sort of comes close to what you're asking about and that's actually a software program so\nIn the software world these are amazing things but meteor you know we have the you know the different kind of media storms that happen every so often like this one\nIn August you know the Perseids and different ones\nUm there there may be some effect with some people I think more psychic Lee the people who like are prone to you know respond to earth changes you know some people tune into earthquakes and animals and you you know things like that so I'm anything's possible that it wouldn't really change the charts so much\nAll right let's go back to the final ... they line up for you or your next birthday is October Twenty one Nineteen fifty coming up pretty soon a birthday October Twenty one Nineteen fifty we'd go west to Albert in Tucson, Arizona\nAnd seen fifty coming up pretty soon birthday October Twenty one Nineteen fifty we go west to Albert in Tucson, Arizona Tucson how are you Albert\nHey good evening George good evening mark Manhattan the upcoming birthday to you my friend oh well thank you very another year oh there you know\nThey keep clicking by do you have a question for mark I just wanted to do reading for you\nOr he can do or reading my question which I've been kind of in a financial limbo for the last year so I was wondering if that was going to change and the other question is about you know it's love and money laundering money go ahead Mr learner\nOkay uh by the way I did solve the aries three people in a row because there's something called the part a fortune in Arabic astrology which was developed a thousand years ago they were all mathematically oriented that that's where we get algebra hot and there was what's called parts like the part of the birth part of marriage and so on something called the part of fortune\nAnd throughout the entire a segment there the part of fortune for Los Angeles and out on the west coast was in the areas the sign that the moon was showing up in the part of fortunes very connected to the moon\nAnd the moon was also is the ... sign cancer and is rising in the first house of self expression which is the kind of archetype all areas area so there was a reason that happened will this fellow now has a Pisces ...\nAnd ... is from from the past from another life or other existence is in the past\nThis person has developed in this could be why the financial thing\nI'm more of sort of a need for compassion may be working in religion and philosophy behind the scenes and it's not ... not very much of a mover and shake her in the world\nSo as an individual people who have Pisces moon come in and they're more impact and paths okay for good or for ill okay and some people with strong Pisces moon can get sort of pulled into they can become vulnerable you know to other people and lose their way but\nThe sun sign of this individual is the sign of a partnership Libra\nAnd he also has Neptune mercury and Venus there in that science so as far as relationship is concerned the keynote esoteric leaf reliever is I Choose the way that leads ... between the two great lines of force and my mentor\nA day and Roger talked about lever as the great pyramid following the mystery of the things which is really Leo in Virgo the body of a lie on the head of a every a woman\nAnd so the whole Egyptian mystery kind of tradition it goes back to the summer times of cancer Leo Virgo and lever and so so basically spiritually\nThis person should study everything about the great pyramid and that would be very good because there's a lot of more about mysteries even Jesus going and being a potentially initiated you know two thousand years ago during those last years from\nYou know from age twelve or Thirteen to thirty three going all around the world to India possibly to Egypt going to a glass to bury and in England I mean these are kind of war but may very well have happened so study the great pyramid study Egypt\nA and get into things like reincarnation of metaphysics that might help\nAlright anything else they're Albert\nNo just uh how is my upcoming year looking\nJupiter you have for planets celestial bodies inside the terrorists are Jupiter is going to tick off what are called conjunctions to palace which has to do with solving problems\nSo it into a kind of study about how to solve your problems in developing strategic thinking and you'll also have Jupiter contact your Mars what's called tire on and series so those are all unusual planets but they ... their gifts from the heavens to Jupiter\nDo with you know success however positive thinking faith Providence benevolence is really trying to give you some gifts here so hopefully you can use them\nAnd that's not going to the Rockies November twenty of Nineteen fifty five let's go to Jane in Florida and she was born to two forty in the morning or mark\nFor your going fast November twentieth\nNineteen fifty five what time\nTo forty in the morning ... am to forty AM let's go to Jane in Florida she was on her mind Hi Jane\n... how's everything oh I'm going okay hey any questions from our car just reading um or how about general reading\nAll right mark general reading again November twenty of Nineteen fifty five to forty any\nEl okay well uh kept her mom away [laughter]\nWell now we've got the beginning of Aquarius um where you have some strong energy is George and I do as well ... at the beginning of Aquarius yeah and this woman who is called a has the moon with higher on\nWhich was discovered in Nineteen Seventy seven and Cairo on is kind of a ... so this brings up the idea of getting involved with a group or some kind of group process would be really good for the soul spiritual standpoint\nWhere you're kind of building rainbow bridges between your spiritual life and higher destiny and your personality world but definitely teamwork group were community work global kind of connections you've done this before in the past and it's still important to keep doing it just like the other\nA color your you're going to get the fortunate oh Jupiter energy you have\nAn asteroid called you know the planet Venus which represents represents love relationship or creative artistry in what's called the north no to the moon which is the moon's orbit they're all inside the terrorists are Jupiter is going to help you\nWith all of a sudden you're carrying energy that the the big issue probably in your life or being a sun science Scorpio and you have a son close to Saturn is you know uh you need to be the warrior the turkey no for those scorpions warrior I Am in from the battle I emerged triumphant in every sense science Scorpio comes into life\nHaving to be daring and courageous but also off and having a lot of um challenges just kind of like the need to die to the old and then be reborn but we're Jupiter is moving\nUm is very helpful for you over the next a next year next Thirteen months it starts of November eighth and continues into the rest of the fall and into the new year so there are suspicious vibes coming up\nOkay any questions Jane um how about um you know going into my eighth how um yeah I see that yeah oh is that going to be thinking\nWell if you don't okay using to forty in the morning what's happening is that that planet is making what we call a square or right angle\nTo where the moon is and it's also you're at an age where you're honest is making a square or right angle to its own position\nSo what you want to avoid as nervousness and anxiety because in medical astrology Iraq that planet Iran has a lot to do with the nervous system so when people are able to sort of meditate or study particularly a cult or metaphysical subjects or things like astrology encountered subjects", "year":
