L. I. X. [noise]\n\nThere to be with us to them a ground zero [noise] having a conversation with a vampire during that conversation rebound fire where to go to join a gym actually calling in from Wisconsin Hi Jim you're on ground zero of the way I\nLove Hi how are you calling in what was going on here and a lot of the baby talk with your guest a\nLeader of after a long time and it shows a kid oh so you you've been a vampire since you were a kid\nLike self discovery how old were you I\nDon't know I just remembered I'm like my brother's a ... like ... or something I drink blood and then it's always interested I was really interested in\nLike rush a steady down each and I couldn't get enough so broadly\nAre in a gym that\nI said how are you tonight [laughter] what can I tell you\nA little nervous\nOkay you know it's interesting he was bringing up how he uh eat a lot of research that gate raw hamburger raw meat would that something that you went through Eric I mean you you you got your or or you always known yourself having a human blood because I mean\nJim seems to say that he was you know he wanted you drink the blood from like for example picking a scab we're doing that sort of thing\nI mean that is that typical you think\nI've heard that before and I think I Would more ask 'em what a exactly what more Maxine I'm thinking the blood and that that would be the bigger question because it's not about small amounts it's about larger amounts renting\nDo now to satisfy your for blood\nI just try to avoid it because that is so different really I kind of like getting that way\nUntil I heard a station your show and I kind of all just came out I was like a big banks like when you talk talking about that\nAnd so\nYou've been a mother and you've been all this time you've been you've been keeping yourself from blood all this time is what you're saying\nOh yeah how how old are you ... how old are you do thirty five thirty five\nOkay and um and how you experience any physical symptoms to go along with that or is it mostly on mental point\nUm you could I don't know if it says um but\nAlso other things like for a long time I felt like I could uh communicate with animals\nMhm and I don't I don't know you know anything about that I was hoping maybe to get some insight on that\nOne of my way better your intuition or you or do you feel you're psychic in some ways\nI'm charged\nAt Shea that just goes so taboo and I've been just along basically so when I heard your caller or when I read your guests speak I had to call in\nRight so you're pretty isolated that\n\nYeah you don't have many friends you don't have any adopted ripe friends shared but you were adopted Medicaid if that shows I mean [noise] you know I bring it up jokingly trying to kill people out but nobody ever who don't believe in the end\nI think the best thing to do to start doing some on investigation on the Internet and compare when you're experiencing to other people's accounts and I think if you're looking you're going to find your answers one way or another\nYou'd probably find a lot more people do they are like huge him for at least the you know that where you can find some different relationships that will understand what you're saying you're not in not ridicule your will laugh at you if you say that you are one\nAlso you're talking about religion and I went to Catholic schools and um I've never\nYou know burned or anything like that I only water earning it I really don't feel like you know I've done anything wrong or I Would be judged\nYou know named it really you know I don't think that you're asking her that\nWell it's not a time and they've never felt that at the Bible that\nI that it's not a movie so of course that's really not going to happen in the ways that you might imagine but\nYeah the vampires of the movies and on the same as the vampires and in reality and you should do the gym\nI Know that I just yeah I don't know that at our geography I've got about religion\nWill Jim thank you so much for calling and sharing them with us and uh [noise] I Hope you took his advice in uniform the Internet and and look over several places where you may be able to find\nThose who are similar to you or at least something that we can give you some advice on what to do because\nGetting sapping so Kevin thing is you have your awakening I guess that is that what I mean I'm I'm only surviving you gotta have awakening to know that okay you say that you drink you like drinking your own blood Kevin or like the taste of it okay you like the taste of their own blood and everybody\nSays directly or vampires are not real correct and you have to be shown to be a believer so how do I believe\nIf you find if you're fired his native labor just like it or not it a lot about belief okay it's not about believe I think it's kind of becoming clear is that about believe it's about\nSo you like the taste of your own blood you I mean this is not a religious following this is not something that it's a religious or act it's something that you know would you if you're a vampire and not so if you like the taste of your own blood and you want to explore further\nInto what can be done to become a vampire leads to have\nIs insatiable a you know there's for blood and four or whatever else energies or whatever else you want to seek out right\nThere in a life you know they truly are what they are and how how can I be proven how can I Know that for myself\nWell you know a um go ahead can I can I say something I'm at ...\nSo from the beginning of the call it it sounds like you're looking for something that I was looking for at one point which is to see the fireworks of something to know that somebody is true now I I've done not before um\nThen in in haunted places I've always looked for per se but the truth of the matter is there's [noise] there's rarely fireworks so can you rarely starting at\n... am I going to turn into a vampire if your dream level and that's why I Want to know now that\nNo matter what you would turn into as a donor you don't invite and\nI got that yeah I Know what that is right but I Am a stern for myself I just have to be a giver by what I get a turtle lifelike you or be ... be be destined for another state and after death or you understand\n[noise] yes I Do understand and and they answer that I can give you at this point is unless you're like me now\nYou have to find your own path you have to find your own way yeah everybody does yeah that's what I hear from people people who uh other vampires I've spoken to say you had to find your own way and it's only you discovery self discovery in a weakening I heard the term awakening and leaving Asian of some kind of sound or\nYou know and it's I and if that did happen to you and it wasn't for you if it wasn't already in you you wouldn't be happy anyway\nYeah true would be happy if you were doing some you don't like it's going to join Missouri Hi Joe you're on ground zero\nThat guy that was good I just wanted to cut it in detail about drinking the blood and this ceremonial setting or casual I don't want to go about drinking the blood [noise]\nFairly casual um although I guess there's some than I Do it for the higher it\nHow do you get your blood though I mean I I mean do people who you were talking about donors other people's willingly donate to\nAbsolutely yeah and and and you know that as do it for their own reasons I've had done is doing it because they say it gives them an experience that they need [noise] I I've always wondered what that meant but I'll never know because I'm not them\nIs there a blood letting into a into a a cop or do you drink and drive right from the body\nI don't get from the flow of blood putting it into a copy of the fast way to get blood jello and now [laughter] which you know interesting oh you mean or the girls that you know the owners are killed their classmates right and they're brought in a glass they would have ended up with a big glass cello\nThat's close to drill or you say I'm Sorry you were talking over a year ago\nI was asking if this was just to satisfy her training or is there more sinister darker a reason for the drinking water [noise]\nWell initially there's a a definitely a physical need that and the blood cells some sort of role in my ... not to keep me healthy\nAnd keeps me a disease free [noise] and ... as far as darker purposes\nNot intentionally but I'll tell you a they're in definitely something dark to it [noise]\nAh okay just air is and I and I'm not it's not my asthma but there's definitely something dark about drinking and other human blood\nObviously now it's like a weekly daily or any thing we got to do a\n... a couple of times a month and a good\nCouple of times a month so uh you know check your delivery and the the milkman and we'd rings twice so Joe thank you for the call [laughter] that's pretty scary actually courting Kansas the around

it is my biggest nightmare of course as a parent\nTo lose your child before ... before you go in or I could only see what you were going through at that time with this kind of pain but the synchronous cities then started so tell us a little bit about the name Institute and the twenty two which is the name of your book\n[noise] I I looked at that tax George again and again and again and in some way I found solid and connecting with that last tax\nAnd as I began to stare at it again and again it occurred to me eleven eleven well Ralph was born on two twenty two [laughter] and so the number twenty two began to resonate with me a firm that was the beginning point I Would say of that resignation\nDon't want to tell our audience does a little secret us to be here when I was talking with Jonathan several weeks ago a about the this situation in his book and of course the tragedy that occurred now he had mentioned that you know his his son roles\nUm was a you know just a delightful young guy and um is is used to name Gabriel of course ah you took that name as well did you not\nI did Ralph middle name was Gabriel and so I changed my middle name to Gabriel I felt the universe and that a ... and doing that it was symbolic was spiritual and um has brought me significant meaning\nAnd on and I was talking to Jonathan and I said my dad's name was Gabriel and uh\nUh he was born on February twenty seconds which says the same date that rolls was born in these weird ... he started coming up all over again and Jonathan's eyes just opened up an and everything else do you believe that your son is Cindy ... messages Jonathan through these strange occurrences\n[noise] I I Do believe that I I've always been a rational analytical regimented person and in my personal life in my profession in Avi aiding [noise]\nAnd with the pain of what happened\nIt began to open up my thought process and I said wait a minute there just got to be more and I took down the wall of what was my personal rationality and began to read I began to study\nA I've been studying the ancient couple a text in Hebrew I've looked through other religions and mystical world and I do believe that in finance is communicating with me\n[noise] what message do you think what else is trying to pass on to you what does he want you to know\n[noise] I find comfort in knowing that he's letting me know that the existence of him has not seized\nA perk and knowing that he's letting me know that the existence of him has not the best\nLife on earth for him has seized but the existence in the cosmic soup if you will does not stop [noise] and that has brought me tremendous comfort\nI I was going to say you must you you're in a very\nStrange way of course to give you the kind of comfort to know that his existence continues that he's out there somewhere a in trying to get you little messages every once in a while just to make you aware that you know hey Dan I'm here\n[noise] [noise] well you know it

went to work at my watch was\nTwenty two minutes by all I had to look at it a few times but it was twenty two men and\nDo you get behind the car and you look at a license plate did you see twenty two there to do these numbers pop up all over the place\nYou know they do pop up to me and at times I think they're popping up and at times I think they're not a coincidence is so I really created a work for myself out of coincidences I'm calling them coincide and says\nAs a recent trip to Los Angeles and I'm thinking a lot about him and hotel I check into and they hand me a key and I walk up to the

about the life of his son grow up in the ... cities that have occurred since rough tragically passed on\nJonathan I Know how tough this was for you when this tragedy occurred how're you doing now\n[noise] or Georgia I'm definitely doing better [noise] one of the things that's really helped me to come to terms with\nHow I think of a finite and the Internet and in my own simple explanation I don't think I'm anything unique I think each of us as human beings have this ability\nBut I think of the brain as the infinite zone and I think of the body finite zone and for the anatomical side of this the brainstem connects the brain to the rest of the body and so I think that anything that we think about is infinite and once it goes down through the brainstem it becomes finite\nAnd so in meditative thought and then thinking to higher levels of spirituality we all have that ability in the infinite zone where each\nPut it on the finite what did you think of the afterlife prior to this happening\nI have to say that I I question that\nI didn't think about it much and ever since Ralph passed away I set out on a journey to try and understand more of it which is what led me to read books and to be more open minded and to be more observant of the things that were occurring in front of me\nDuring the cold really didn't get to them in a second three stranger courage does not want to go through each one and have you explain to us what happened tell us about the drivers situation what happened there\nSo about eight months ago I had a gun in a new verb from downtown St Louis I was getting dropped off and I told the driver a funny story and he thought it was funny enough that he wanted to repeat it and I said you know I don't have a problem with it tell anybody you want\nAnd he looked at me in a very strange stare and said I'll just tell them Ralph set it\nOff I look and I looked at him he said what's wrong I said where did you come up with that name he said I don't know and I said well you know anybody named morale he said no\nShe how did you come up with it he said it popped in my head\n[laughter] I Love that about one with the balloons what happened there\nWell the day Ralph passed away he left me a two mylar balloons a smiling balloon Anna thank you balloon in the morning and after he passed away I decided I wasn't going to touch the balloons I just couldn't do it\nAnd the mylar balloons state inflated for many months two three four five months and one friday\nI went to sleep I got up Saturday morning and the balloons were both down [noise] I didn't think much about it until the following Monday and the cemetery called me and said we just want to let you know that the gravestone on friday was set for your son\nGets timing in secrecy again and then you had the courage with some strange lights\n[noise] well I moved out of our home rather rapidly after he passed away and I went back up into the room and I turned off the lights and I was leaving in the house was empty\nAnd the lights went back on and I and I had a friend with me and turn the lights back but the light switch back down and put it back up put it back down and they went off the lights went back on this happened two or three times until the lights finally stayed off and at that time I left the house\nAnd just let it be I chose not to think more about it other than that had never happened before\nIt was a point where you got angry about all this\n[noise] you know I've been asked that many times and I don't seem to be able to get angry about it I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing [noise] um [noise] I don't I don't fault him I\nHave struggled to try to understand how the generic drug industry in the United states has effectively shielded themselves from any and all liability from every American citizens\nSo they're they're protected by law aren't they\nIs there is there is a federal law in place and I'm not an attorney but the the outcome of the law is that generic drugs effectively have a liability shield around them\nJonathan was was roles subject to depression prior to the food poisoning\nNo Ralph was a very happy go lucky kid he was very popular in is\nPrior to the food poisoning\nNo Ralph was a very happy go lucky kid he was very popular in his class he was a straight a student ah frequently making jokes he was just if you ask his friends they would portray just the most honest [noise]\nUm you know like a bowl young man you could you could think of\nNot to go to the hospital for food poisoning that's pretty serious because you know most people who have food poisoning stay ... they take some stuff uh you know they go to the bathroom as often as they have to they don't go to the hospital ... what were the symptoms for him to go to the hospital\nI I think I think he was vomiting profusely there was a lot of blood out with his friends who are all medical school students as well and they unanimously decided he needed to go to the emergency room and that's how he got there\nHow did you get that\n[noise] well I got the call after the medication had been given to him about the next morning and he said to me immediately I feel different something has happened\nOh okay let's go to some culture for your job let's go to Patty in Seattle, Washington questions story Hi Patty\nHi uh I've I've got a little story and I hope it's relevant to\nThis synchronous cities that I think I've got more and then you can shake a stick at\nUm it started with my son ah who incidentally was taken away from me when he was born we somehow managed to to make a connection or that we could look back for each other on that he was born on my birthday three minutes apart from the same time\nI was born in from there the synchronized cities just roll in um\nUm we were both born nine fourteen I was nine fourteen fifty two it was nine fourteen sixty eight and every number we have to do it this is not a nine I mean ... of fourteen or a seven or its divisible by seven\nYeah I'm sure numbers as Jonathan gets twenty two you get certain numbers popping up all the time too\nYeah exactly well are you with the first thing was we noticed my initial PR his R. P.\nUm his mom's name was Donna I'm my dad's name is Don ... his adoptive parents are exactly the same age as my parents to the year and a month\nJuly Nineteen twenty nine and November Nineteen thirty one and I mean that kind of blew me off my socks\n... let me ask you like him why did they take him away from you as a child\nI was he was born on my sixteenth birthday ah okay okay uh it was it was better for him and me I understand that happened that way\nAnd I mean it was it was excruciating let him go but we did find each other twenty six years later and that's another one of the same kind of these out of twenty six years we cost in the mail looking for each\nOther and as it is is he still with us\nOh absolutely OK yeah he he lived with me for seven years and they moved back to his home state of Utah\nAnd um we were both born on air force bases in in this sacred yesterday's again they're beyond coincidence though when ours was done we're like astrological star twins\nAnd it's it's a candy in in what again John what do you call coincidence\nI call them coincide and says I I Believe that we all have these we just have to tune ourselves into them\nWash the reality\nOurs sings is I don't believe in coincidence is either I think the steps in and things have a purpose in a reason a search sometimes there's luck and strange occurrences but I think by and large there are no

discuss the potential for one hundred dollar silver I got your message that's a silver market is heating up what's going on George we always\nSilver market is heating up what's going on\nGeorge we always monitor the U.S mint sales in the middle of the summer we saw in the eighty percent increase in silver sales and with the stories about the potential silver shortage from solar demand this news seems to be in line with projections for one hundred dollar silver\nAre we seeing other signs up a silver market is heating up\nWell one of the men was selling more silver medal exchanges are also heating up buyers took delivery of more than thirty million ounces this summer with J. P. Morgan adding one million ounces to their stockpile of a hundred and thirty three million ounces\nAnd last time we talk to you told us about China's plans to build a huge solar farms which could spike silver demand we also talked about California being the first state to require new homes to have solar are there other states\nMaybe you're in the process but the latest trend is community solar what's that\n[noise] that's where cities install solar panels and homeowners share the power Minnesota's doing this and if it's successful the program could see community solar expand nationwide even globally\nAnd as you report says without silver there would be no solar\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something like twenty\nSimple so it's a good ways out there and he is that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter light ... it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from er is is that the border between the rebels and the or cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realized that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there is a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what this border is\nWhat was it that made you an astronomer realize that something ten times the mass of earth could be there in the first place\nThe clue that there is another planet out in the solar system\nReally came from looking at the very most distant objects that are in orbit around the sun well beyond Pluto they travel extreme distances and all these ones that are this far away all sweep off in one particular direction and there's no reason they should there should be randomly around the sky\nThe fact that they're all off in this one direction you can only be explained by the presence of a planet that perturbed bring their orbits and keeping them piled up in that direction\nAnd that what the new headlines in October of twenty Eighteen are about is one of those smaller objects to being swept off my whatever the massive book called planet nine that you discovered in twenty sixteen\nThat's exactly right although I don't use the word discovered yet I Would say we proposed the planets and when we see it it will have been discovered\nWhat do you use any two people who ask questions about rogue planet and the ... of the ...\nMarion and all of that because it does come up a lot what exactly are rogue planet how can a planet be wandering in the universe between sellers systems in galaxy\nThere certainly are fees wandering planets rope planets and they come about from the same sort of reason\nThat we think that planet nine is out there they certainly formed around a star just like our planet stood and then probably a couple of planets got too close to each other and one of them got tossed out usually the smaller one gets tossed out by the bigger one\nAnd in our case we think that that happened to planet nine but planet nine didn't get tossed quite far enough so now it's just hanging around on the outer edge but if if it had gotten a little bit closer to say Jupiter could have been completely ejected from our solar system\nIn which case it would just be wandering through space and so it is absolute certainty that these sorts of things exist there's no question about it\nWhen people ask me about the bureau that's always a funny one because of course that's a conspiracy theory that there is a giant planet that's going to destroy the earth that NASA knows about and won't tell anybody and\nThings like that and I try very hard to explain to people that this is just crazy YouTube Internet conspiracies stuff that actually makes no sense\nExplain for a general world audience why something massive like a planet cannot sneak up on earth in the inner planets with out every astronomer on knowing\nIf something like ... I don't know what's the latest crazy conspiracies are saying how big it is but occasionally over to headline that it's going to destroy the earth on some particular date because it's screaming into the inner solar system [laughter] usually if you do just a very quick calculation you realize if it were really\nIn particular date because it's screaming into the inner solar system [laughter]\nUsually if you do just a very quick calculation you realize if it were really coming it would be so bright\nThat you could see it with binoculars every person who owns binoculars on the planet could go look and see it coming you wouldn't be able to have a massive conspiracy keeping secrets\nAnd he would have been visible to every backyard astronomer with the telescope for the past decade and it would have been visible to every professional astronomer\nFor the past fifty years if all of these people are in on the conspiracy I don't know\nAnywhere else were that many people are all keeping a secret from the rest of the world\nIs something ten times the mass of our earth were even out past Pluto out in the Khyber belt what would be the obvious observation all changes perturbation in our solar system\nIn the inner part of our soldiers would be an apartment in the planets that we know of\nPlanning nine has no effect whatsoever on the inner planets and you can figure out why it's ten we actually think more like seven o seven times amounts of the earth and it is five hundred times further away from the sun and the earth is\nJupiter on the other hand is three hundred times the mass of the earth and it's only five times further from the sun than the earth is so Jupiter has a tremendous effect on the planet is in the solar system and nobody sits around and there's worry that Jupiter is certainly going to come destroy us\nPlanet nine is really far away and quite a bit smaller than Jupiter sort of it's the fact is really minimal one effect that it does have is that over four billion years is capable of slowly tilting the orbits of the planet but even that is just a very very minor effect\nIf you're going to Hawaii in November and maybe you'll be successful this time would it be possible to talk with you in December about what you might find or do you have to wait to do papers or\nJust the way the process works is we'll go there in November will collect the data it'll take us several weeks two a month to process the data from November then we're back there first of December and will do the same thing and so\nIf we have found what we're looking for we will know it within a month or two of collecting those data and then at that point will announce existence\nAs soon as we can confirm it we will have found it will go back to the telescope and double checked that it's really there and then will announce its existence right away we won't make the world wait\n[laughter] January twenty nine teen it is possible that three years after twenty sixteen January when we did our first interview about it that you might be able to confirm it\nIs possible I'm always very optimistic Constantine fatigue and my partner and all this is always much more pessimistic and so you know you should take my optimism with a grain of salt and then take his pessimist than with a grain of salt he thinks it'll take us another ten years I think it'll take us one year so maybe that means still another three years but I'm Still very optimistic\nThat barrier habit during and right from the manana and discovered the uh in terms of those ... nations of those half a dozen bodies that are all kind of gather together out where the guy prevailed in the uh or cloud in that area\nAnd I think one of the most important part of doing research project with these scientists is that I have no confusion about the fact that if there was something massive that we're trying to move\nIs that what it's called the inner solar system\nFrom a mercury Assad and mercury out to wear a\nNow Neptune and urine is our because Pluto is a been dumbed down to a dwarf planet out in the hyper belt\nThat there's nothing that could be out coming this way and massive that wouldn't be picked up by everyone everywhere because gravity that that's the thing about gravity in that\nIt it would have impact on every single thing in the solar system\nAbsolutely I would've loved those ... been alive to talk with the professor I Wonder if he would've been able to convince him about that the bureau\nWell I don't know how much time we have left but I can start my own work that I had a discussion a face to face eye to eye with is that right yeah and maybe what I'll do it said that for conversations that lend it because it's really quite a story\nOkay we can do that too but it's a great story and it's really exciting that even if he doesn't agree in some of the theories that are out there\nThe fact that there's this extra planted out there does echo what some of these people have said long before anybody even knew about this stuff well\nThe idea that there could be a massive planet but when you read like say about the ... through scholar and you're in the translation that we're a carbon done\nAnd you look at the carving one thing that always is\nConfusing to me is he talking about a Trump\nThere are eleven has got\nTo hold on right there are a

Linda molten whoa whose story next we'll deal with climate change Linda\nYou know with Thirty years ago and Nineteen eighty eight when the world with really kind of waking up seriously for the first time to global climate change and real potential dire consequences in the future\nIf we didn't get on top of the expanding methane and carbon dioxide blankets around the earth\nAnd at the United nations many countries especially those worried about being islands and we see level rise could flood and displaced populations\nThey came together to form the inter governmental panel on climate change also known as the P. C. C. and the objective was to provide data about earth changes on an ongoing basis\nTo help project some of these impacts on world politics and the economy\nBy twenty Fifteen only three years ago and the Paris Agreement on climate change\nMany small island nation were so worried about disappearing under ... rising sea levels that the PCC committed to doing a twenty Eighteen report written by Ninety One scientist from forty countries\nThe question was hit humans to restrict global warming two degrees Celsius or one point five degrees Celsius\nBelow pre industrial levels the October twenty Eighteen IPC the answer is stricter one point five degrees Celsius equal to a to point seven degrees Fahrenheit\nShould be the new target to achieve and hold in place by twenty thirty that's only a decade from now it's right because if we don't if our planet continues to warm up above that limit of one point five degrees Celsius\nScientists warn there will be a catastrophe of math die off they will accelerate and the coral reefs and if they die that kills off other marine feces dependent upon\nA mass die off they will accelerate and the coral reefs\nAnd if they die that kills off other marine species dependent upon the coral weather will become more violent and wins flooding rains and devastating wildfires\nWeather extremes will cause famine and fighting over land food and fresh water and sea level rise will force more and more island the coasts populations to move but to where\nThe twenty Eighteen I PCC reports that the next ten years between now and twenty thirty are crucial and in order to keep the one point five degrees Celsius limit nations must cut greenhouse gas emissions\nBy almost half of what they were in twenty ten solar wind and other renewable energy sources must replace\nAs much as sixty seven percent of today's electricity coal it as an industry around the world it must be phased out the coordinating lead author or the IPC the report says quote\nThis kind of a head in the sand mentality that has taken ... now in Washington\nWhich seems to pretend that this climate change threat does not exist\nBut this was widely knowledge in the defense community meaning the Pentagon as recently as three years ago and twenty Fifteen ...\nHe is professor drew Shen del PHD professor of earth sciences and the earth and sciences division at Duke University and he joins us now from Durham North Carolina\nCould you please give me the top five places in the United states where water is coming in and flooding is already making people move\nI Would say those are Florida Alaska and around the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and Virginia and Louisiana\nSo those would probably be the top of the United states\nAnd where we'd be the five top nations in the world that are now islands and other places that are most impacted by sea level rise\nAround the world unfortunately all too many very low lying countries and that's a large part of why we have this report to those countries wanted the United nations to investigate a lower woman target thinking that\nTwo degrees was probably not sufficient to protect them those are most of the islands in the south Pacific also older you've seen the Indian Ocean many Caribbean countries\nAnd then there are very low lying countries like Bangladesh where the bulk of the population very close to Nigeria has huge popular chief Roger shoot level but you know sodas most of the world I Know and the United states also has a Mormon population is right up the coast\nAnd where in Alaska in Alaska\nYou have an interesting problem where it's it's a combination of rising sea levels and melts the ice and the ice protected shorelines from the waves from the ocean\nAnd without the ice the wage can reach the shore and more easily and the waves are higher because of rising sea levels we saw a lot of coastal communities along the west coast and the buried straight area many of them are already having to be evacuated and move to higher ground\nSo it's not so much the north slope of the south and west\nCoasts and who is paying for that I Believe that the combination of federal and state governments\nAnd who is paying for that I Believe that the combination of federal and state governments\nAlready moving people in Alaska from flooding to higher ground yeah\nAny of that happening in Louisiana Florida North Carolina as well\nThere is not been so much evacuation of the coast there's been more what used to be rare flooding events that are now becoming quite common so I think that there is likely to have to be the evacuation in the next couple of decades of at least some places\nThere's an island doesn't have to pay for example between Maryland and Virginia\nMore than half of it it was already

had to put up marker so that\nMotorist can see how deep the flooding is it's so routine and Florida it's been some of the worst\nFlooding of streets in the southeast part of the state\nHas become fairly routine as he level rise has continued and we've seen an acceleration because both the Greenland\nAnd Antarctica ice sheets are melting more rapidly than was expected just a decade ago and dumped more water into the ocean unfortunately what we've been seeing over the past several decades since we started to generate these projections from computer models\nAnd then watch the model has often been too conservative and things are happening faster than the models project\nCan you give an example of what has been dramatic compared to the computer model\nOne thing was the boss of sea ice in the Arctic it went like two or three times faster than the models project to\nEase the Arctic has melted two to three times faster than the computer's projected already by twenty Eighteen is that a harbinger of the fact that it's likely be warming and melting ice will keep increasing faster like what happened in the Arctic\nWell we've been observing from satellite that melting of the Greenland ice sheet has been accelerating\nSo that is definitely a blurry it is extremely challenging problem to figure out exactly how this massive she might become de stabilized based on say melting from the top with water slipping down through cracks\nIn the ice sheet and lubricating the bit below\nYou know when we were we because the warming has been so fast in the Arctic that the acceleration will continue\nAnd we're speaking in October of twenty Eighteen what would you project we will be seeing as more dramatic weather events between twenty Eighteen and twenty thirty\nLess rainfall in the west increasing water scarcity greater probability of drought greater likelihood is high fire conditions and receipt flooding in the east as you get more extreme heavy rainfall events\nWalk or just hanging

Saddam think I've ever seen one\nDo you see anything in the eyes\nI don't remember the ... it's almost as if I couldn't look at them I think I was terrified to look at them but I had a feeling that this entity was imparting something to me because I wasn't afraid it was almost like it was giving me instructions very strange\nRemember a voice it was almost as if it would tell a path ethic and the the being\nSeem to be blowing like a pure white\nIt doesn't ... it had modeled skin but it was very white you can tell that it had a lot of texture\nYou know if it was why it had like cycles I Would say you know how they would be like model skin like someone who had black holes are almost like an albino salamander skin\nIt sounds like you're describing it ripped Chileans skin not a praying mantis skin\nWith texture was like that yeah\nBut the swarm was like a pre manner since\nThat time I Would describe it because of the arms they were ... and they were long but you could tell that they were joining could very strangely as I reached puberty\nI remember I started having a lot of growing pains\nAt one point I did find a spot on my groin and that was like a puncture area that the western I've just had ... that maybe they were doing something with me to recover sperm or something\nBased on everything that you have experience with the praying mantis well would you speculate could be

going to be like a shift or a jolt\nKind of like you take a glass of water and you accidentally knock your elbow and the water splashes out right from the random to go out that's the feeling I get from that I Am before voting feeling\nThat everything is going to get more violent and wetter\nYes [noise] now um\nLast night ... it is and things keep being woven they started with the issue\nOf uh I

of whatever the white us we'll call it Bobby smoker smoky fog than his period in my office twice\nThat led to my asking for a whether people had had these kinds of foggy white stuff\nAnd that led to Charles hazard and other even mailers or saying that this is not the only person last night on my YouTube channel I had a dialogue with my audience\nAbout has anybody whether they're in a duck tape and experience or a meditative\nSite about water a lot of water affecting the planet between now and twenty twenty six [noise]\nAnd that was a year that had been presented to me by a real whistle blower science we said that he had worked on a project having to do with this exact time period between twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty six\nIn which there could be some either a natural cycle or something that is going to now it's like what Charles hazard when he was saying I feel like it has to do with the rotation of the earth that there's going to be like a shift or a jolt\nAnd that it would cause soon armies and tremendous amounts of flooding\nAnd I had now several emails I'm going to be doing stories on them\nAbout exactly this kind of thing and raising the question could there be a natural strange cycle interacting with planets in our solar system that could relate to know is flood that is written about in genesis\nAnd that is how woven and a complex\nAll of this seems to be going that every single question is leading the answers that people are raising more issues and scientists are also coming forward and saying that they have information about this and so tonight if there's anybody listening on coast\nIf you are in the military government whistle blower category or human abducted category and you have any information\nAbout a huge water that could end up affecting our planet\nWhere they shall it up and call us with conversations with Linda which is coming up later but we got more when we come back\n\n\n\nThen we'll go back into molten home with ... we

sent me his duty to fourteen\nTo prove his military background which I've included at the end of my earth files news report tonight this email contained a life experience that he wrote up for me entitled quote the\nExperience that made me a believer that we are not alone\nAnd it began Hi Linda my name is Tony I Would like to tell you about something that I saw as a black child\nI Am fifty seven now but at the time of the incident I was four or five years old in Nineteen sixty five or Nineteen sixty six\nI was in my bed one night and I had woke up and could not go back to sleep here now from Winston Salem North Carolina\nAnd I had woke up and could not go back to only hear now from Winston Salem North Carolina that tell any town boy what got him as a child and harvest him to this very day is retired us air force staff sergeant Tony guy\nOutlived in Dayton, Ohio\nI was about four years of age\nI live with my mother and she had a best friend that she ... within two bedroom apartment my mother had two children\nAnd my mother's friend had two children and we were all about the same age it's a two bedroom apartment and it's two levels you have to go up to stay here as we get to the two bedrooms and bathrooms and I was in my bed sleeping along with my brother\nIn two other kids and I woke up in the middle of the night I had trouble going back to sleep and not just\nThey earn in a dark couldn't go back to sleep so I decided to get up out of bed and I went to the window\nAnd I was just looking out the window and it was very quiet about it and hearing the cars that's how I knew\nIt was very late at night 'cause I didn't ... year cargo by so I'm looking around and I happened to look up look up in the sky and you know just looking around because it was really nothing to see but a grassy field in between the park which\nIs how I look up and I see a light a bright light in the sky high so it was an airplane that same light that I was looking at because it was the only thing in the sky\nI notice something was coming down there by the time my notes that he may have been about I'd say fifty or sixty feet off the ground\nThe light that I was looking at came down it was or\nWhat I noticed about that was one half of it was so white collar and the other half of it was neon green color you know like the glow sticks that you see at the concert when they had to close the extent are neon green glow sticks right\nIt looked like that and I was saying to myself this looks like a perfect circle but it was from little all is that if you cut the perfect circle in half and then just pull it apart a little bit\nA little lighter in the middle then it would have been is that we're perfect circle\nYeah and I noticed there were two lights met in the middle the salt white light in the lime green light there was no bleed over you could clearly see where the neon green ended in a small white began in this object\nIt looked at the as thin as a balloon\nWhen you say he was like a balloon you mean that in the surface was translucent and you could see through it\nYeah I could clearly see through it it was no metal nothing like that it was more like a seafood balloon so the and it's like you're looking at sea theloop along and what are you seeing\nWhat I'm seeing is a person standing inside the fall white part wearing like down and he's looking up\nIs just standing there looking up like he's looking up into the bars I don't know what he's looking at but I could clearly see that's what I'm saying to myself look at that that is a person can keep in mind I'm no more than twenty five to thirty feet from is that\nThe only reason I didn't climb out the window that night was because I was like if you knock out the screen and go down there\nLove is going to the beach you [laughter] you know ... ... that's what I Would be like man I wanted to go but I'm going to be yes I Do this you know I Know she is but I just did\nThis is a gift for this okay so this is very close to you as you are looking at this window describe\nThe person that you are seeing in the white side of this circular orbit\nWhile I'll give you my thoughts at the time this is the conversation I was having to myself I was thinking man this person looks like God and then I thought I'm not going to say that uh let's see actually pills believe God right\nThen I'll go out man the show it looks like the guy because you're a church describe everything\nThe gal and he was worried like when you're looking at the small white I notice it was blue light or brighter colors and the flight light you could tell the difference between fall white and black and white\nI could clearly see that the gal was white ... very bright white he was looking up in the car cages and he had a brunette hair and it came down to say it showed her shoulder lanes mhm and it was just standing there looking up\nWas his his hair straight wavy or curly\nI'd say we're straight just like you see when you see these motion pictures of Jesus have ... ... it was like that\nWere you close enough to see the shape or color of his eyes\nYou know I wasn't close enough to see that\nAnd what was the shape of the gallon\nFrom board I could see it looked like it pulled over or is it that all look like one toilet peace and it went all the way down to his feet\nCould you see his feet in this ... craft\nNo I couldn't so how do you know it went down to his feet\nBecause I could see that where the or where he was standing at the very bottom of it I could clearly see the whole atmosphere is kind of strange because like it's so humid it but I could look in the green part it feels apartment buildings on the other shot\nSo if I'm twenty five to thirty feet as a four year old looking out your apartment second storey window you are able to look through\nThe surface of the white side of this sphere uncle or or craft and see the man inside the white side yes but you could not see into the lime green and you could see past the line and the white yes\nAnd the fact that he blocked out the apartment buildings that were beyond it seems to suggest that\nEven though it appeared very strange to you that it had to have been solid matter or at least blocking so times to have blocked out the buildings that were behind it\nNow's the time to fill 'em up Snake River

was full of this intense love I cannot tell you how sweet and wonderful\nThat law was and this has really changed me to be in the making sure I say a prayer great on this every morning and every night\nOut what that is good to live by and it reminds me of another mystery I interviewed people ah some in the abduction syndrome and some not but all describing this same phenomenon\nIn which whether it is that they were going to meditate or we're just going to bed I'm that they have experienced feeling or seeing with their eyes for at least for a while before they apparently go unconscious\nSeeing their body that I don't know if the word is dissolve a but transform into gold sparkly light what you were describing it reminds me\nAnd the the people who have had this experience they all say that it is a bit like seeing your in your body your hand everything turning in to a like very fine gold sparkly dust\nThat is a phenomena that I'm curious about and if anybody listening to Kosovo night knows anything about that specific\nThat is a phenomena that I'm curious about\nAnd if anybody listening to Kosovo night knows anything about that specific it's not you're not dying it is a transition that is seen by The Mind's eye that the body is changing into gold sparkly dust but then after\nThey have gone a unconscious or whatever the missing time is they are back alive and remembering that memory extremely vividly I find that also a very interesting and wonder George if you ever heard of that\nWell what's what's fascinating to me is when you think about the biblical pictures that we've seen paintings yeah almost all the church and figures terrible horrors around their head was markedly lights with\nYeah sparkly gold often that's true and what is this and I don't think that it is something being made up I think it is a\nPhysics part of the universe and other dimensions that we have been denied or have never been told or ever educated about it's always been a thrown into the bin of miss solid tea or something else\nAnd that we've got to start looking at all of this in terms of a brand new cosmic understanding of the physical relationship between the ... the universe we are in it could very likely be a projected hologram you would have\nTo be rejected from another dimension more and more physics papers are being written about more and more evidence of other dimensions\nAnd if we cycle if they're so is the important part\nAnd at the moment of death we transition into one or more different dimensions depending upon something having to do with the growth of the soul that not also will go to the same dimensions than recycling back into matter universes\nHas to be a huge and common part of that cycling um we have been left dumb and blind about it\nOur first time caller Steve in Brooklyn I even go into\nA hot Georgia Lynn do my question is do you think up to Seventy years will Raj well the American people now are really really ready for the truth that will be visiting Iraq because\nIf he's visitors had been abducted and people that will uh during a cat or a new way she's leaving the animals there for us\nAll to be taking people from Oak Park maybe and returning to the government for using this national security and that the schools in it that would keep a roof\nAbout safety that we would not do we'll take a hard\nBecause you were doing and yeah I understand your question and I have had to live with it for a very long time forty years um where I began my first investigation into animal needle Asians in September of Nineteen Seventy nine and it's\nTwenty Eighteen strange harvest was ...\nStrange harvest and uh it was a a well received a documentary it was awarded a regional Emmy\nUh so I was dealing from a pure as pure as fact based journalism as I could in that film and I had to wrestle myself\nWith the question of going out into pastures often by myself together tissue in and various things and my vulnerable and having to decide within myself that I was going to keep putting one foot in front of the other and if something took me\nAnd having to decide within myself\nThat I was going to keep putting one foot in front of the other and if something took me\nA so be it and I am still here and I was a to my knowledge never abducted from any of the many many many places on both hemispheres of this planet that I have walked where I have been where Anna mutilated animals are\nNow what I'm trying to do is set a a different lens and framework here\nYes there are animal mutilation there were animal sacrifices five thousand seven thousand ten thousand years ago in many parts of the planet is well those animal sacrifices may have been provoked by the same other intelligence\nThat is today in the twentieth and twenty first centuries are doing animal mutilation instead of making us line up uh to do an animal sacrifices\nBut what ever it is that is the truth behind the UFO phenomena on our planet earth I Do not think it is singular\nI think that there are many facets\nI think that some facets are truly allies and if we had not had allies whether they are from another solar system in this universe or from another dimension\nI Do not think homo sapiens safety and would have survived the the last several thousand years without help from something else\nWhy the hell does it make itself front and in our face this is who they are may relate to the fact\nThat humans have been abused and misused by a tremendous number I think of intelligence is using this planet and the solar system now that doesn't defendant humans being cooled to each other\nAnd the wars I don't defend that I think death and killing is horrible\nBut I Do have a feeling of compassion for my fellow human creature\nThat we we have never been treated to all the truth about the true nature of evolution of our own selves on this planet let alone other intelligence says\nUntil all of us know all of the truth\nThan animal mutilation and human abductions and all of the facets which seemed very disturbing may not be understand ... be understood in\nA correct relationship to the intelligence is interacting and that is why I feel so strongly that we have got to move the entire planet\nAnd break through like at San Andreas fault that's what it's going to be like and that sort of what you're asking\nThe San Andreas fault has to be the global announcement a consensus of the entire planet that we're not alone in this universe and that the governments of this planet has\nTo start opening up what they have in terms\nOf physical craft and beans and knowledge about who is manipulating and why if we have allies we no need to know who our allies are and not be afraid of them if there are hostile as they're described\nBy some people who have worked in the government is unfriendly we need to know who they are why they're hostile and that we have allies that are helping us\nAnd we're going to come back with more questions we

I Want to thank you for your magnificent research year after year it's just truly appreciate it by the coast audience\nWill end up my question is about CERN spelled C. E.

G. L. A. and the generic version of it at ...\nThis is a black box drug that was used as a first line of defense or something like food poisoning\nAnd from the moment that drug was injected within days Ralph both physical and mental condition began to deteriorate and there are many many many cases of this that can be found on the Internet\nAnd when you see it begin to deteriorate physically and mentally did you notice that change with him\nAbsolutely within a day or two he and one of his medical school room mates had done research\nAnd the changes I noticed or his anxiety began to increase it began to complain of strange pains that he had never had before and this began a slow deterioration that I Would\nPlane of strange pains that he had never had before and this began a slow deterioration that I Would call something like this doing this so a lot of the human body\nAnd at this point wealth took his life\n[noise] over the course of a early in twenty Seventeen he was I brought him back home to St Louis and uh he made three attempts on his life\nTo take themselves out of this horrific condition that was bringing him intense pain and from what I understand the form of anxiety times a hundred [noise]\nUm and on his last attempt he was successful and um I did hold his hand and was there and he passed away\nHow was he Johnson he was twenty [noise] and how did he take his life\nHe tried with two other attempts that were unsuccessful\nBut on the last attempt a he used a gun and at that time I wasn't there he sent me a text that really began the marketing of a year but the text came to me at exactly eleven eleven\nAnd that's where we're going to talk about tonight the ... that have occurred for you especially after this tragedy occurred I mean I remember being in St Louis when I heard about this\nAnd uh it was a it was a shocking situation for anybody to have to go through a ... ... it is my biggest nightmare of course as a parent to lose your child before before you go\nIn or I could only see what you were going through at that time with this kind of pain but the synchronous cities then started so tell us a little bit about the name instant Ito and then twenty two which is the name of your book\n[noise] I I looked at that tax George again and again and again and in some way I found solid and connecting with that last tax\nAnd as I began to stare at it again and again it occurred to me eleven eleven well Ralph was born on two twenty two [noise] and so the number twenty two began to resonate with me a firm that was the beginning point I Would say of that rather than nation\nI Want to tell our audience is a little secret is the year when I was talking with Jonathan several weeks ago about this situation in his book and of course the tragedy that occurred now he had mentioned that you know his his son roles\nUm was a you know just a delightful young guy and uh is is you use the name Gabriel of course uh you took that name as well did you not\nI did Ralph middle name was Gabriel and so I changed my middle name to Gabriel I felt the universe and that one is and doing that it was symbolic was spiritual and um brought me significant meaning\nAnd on and I was talking to Jon to them and I said my dad's name was Gabriel and uh\nNow he was born on February twenty seconds which is the same date the roles was born in these weird synchronous he started coming up all over again and Jonathan's eyes just don't do nothing and everything else do you believe that your son is Cindy ... messages Jonathan through these strange occurrences\n[noise] I I Do believe that I I've always been a rational analytical regimented person in in my personal life in my profession in ...

the need to twenty two dot com linked up the coast to coast am dot com we're talking about his latest work called infant Udall twenty two about the life of his son roped into synchronous cities\nThat have occurred since rough tragically passed on Jonathan I Know how tough this was for you when this tragedy occurred how're you doing now\n[noise] ah Georgia I'm definitely doing better one of the things that's really help to me\nYou know [noise] well George I'm I'm definitely doing better [noise] one of the things that's really help to me is to come to terms with how I think of the finite and the infinite and in my own simple explanation\nI don't think I'm anything unique I think each of us as human beings has disability\nBut I think of the brain as the infinite zone and I think of the body as the finite zone and for the anatomical side of this the brainstem connects the brain to the rest of the body and so I think that anything that we think about is infinite and once it goes down through the brainstem it becomes finite\nAnd so in meditative thought and then thinking to higher levels of spirituality we all have that ability and the infant its own were each of us is a combination of the infinite and the finite\nWhat'd you think of the afterlife prior to this happening\n[noise] I have to say that I I question that I didn't think about it much and\nEver since Ralph passed away I set out on a journey to try and understand more of it which is what led me to read books and to be more open minded and to be more observant of the things that were occurring in front of me\nKind of the goals really didn't get to them in a second three stranger courage does not want to go through each one and have you explain to us what happened tell us about the drivers situation what happened there\nSo about eight months ago I had a gun in a new verb from downtown St Louis I was getting dropped off and I told the driver or a funny story and he thought it was funny enough that he wanted to repeat it and I said you know I don't have a problem with it tell anybody you want\nAnd he looked at me in a very strange stare and said I'll just tell them Ralph set it\nOff and I looked at him he said what's wrong I said where did you come up with that name he said I don't know and I said well you know anybody named morale he said no\nShe how did you come up with it he said it popped in my head\n[laughter] I Love it how about one with the balloons what happened there\nWell the day Ralph passed away he left me a two mylar balloons a smiling balloon and I think you balloon in the morning\nAnd after he passed away I decided I wasn't going to touch the balloons I just couldn't do it\nAnd the mylar balloons state inflated for many months two three four five months and one friday\nI went to sleep I got up Saturday morning and the balloons were both down [noise] I didn't think much about it until the following Monday and the cemetery called me and say we just want to let you know that the gravestone on friday was set for your son\nGets time in secret and then you had to the currents with some strange lights\n[noise] well I moved out of our home rather rapidly after he passed away and I went back up into the room and\nI turned off the lights and I was leaving in the house was empty\nAnd the lights went back on and I and I had a friend with may occur in the lights back but the light switch back down and put it back up put it back down and they went off the lights went back on this happened two or three times until the lights finally stayed off and at that time

P. Morgan adding one million ounces to their stockpile of a hundred and thirty three million ounces\nAnd last time we talk to you told us about China's plans to build huge solar farms which could spike silver demand we also talked about California being the first state to require new homes to have solar are there other states\nMany are in the process but the latest trend is community solar what's that\n[noise] that's where cities install solar panels and homeowners share the power Minnesota's doing this and if it's successful the program to the community solar expand nationwide even globally\nAnd as you report says without silver there would be no solar\nGrayish white atmosphere with no features of it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd is that a quarter of a light year oh no it's not even close to a quarter like ... it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from er is is that the border between the ... rebels and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realized that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there's a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure 'cause we don't know what is beyond the planet and we don't quite yet know how the planet is affecting what the border of\nWhat was it that made you an astronomer realize that something ten times the mass of earth could be there in the first place\nThe clue that there is another planet out in the solar system\nReally came from looking at the very most distant objects that are in orbit around the sun well beyond Pluto they travel extreme distances and all these ones that are this far away all sweep often one particular direction and there's no reason they should they should be randomly around the sky\nThe fact that they're all off in this one direction you can only be explained by the presence of a planet that's perturbation their orbits and keeping them piled up in that direction\nAnd that what the new headlines in October of twenty Eighteen are about is one of those smaller objects as being swept off by whatever the massive recall planet nine that you discovered in twenty sixteen\nThat's exactly right although I don't use the word discovered yet I Would say we proposed the planets and when we see it it will have been discovered\nWhat do you use any two people who ask questions about rogue planet and the ... crew of the ...\nMarion and all of that because it does come up a lot what exactly are rogue planet how can a planet be wandering in the universe between sellers systems in galaxy\nThere certainly are these blonde\nAnd it be wandering in the universe between sellers distancing galaxy\nThere certainly are these wandering planets\nRogue planet and they come about from the same sort of reason that we think that planet nine is out there they certainly formed around a star just like our plan instead\nAnd then probably a couple of planets got too close to each other and one of them got tossed out usually the smaller one gets tossed out by the bigger one\nAnd in our case we think that that happened to planet nine but planet nine didn't get past quite far enough so now it's just hanging around on the outer edge but if if it had gotten a little bit closer to say Jupiter could have been completely injected from our solar system\nIn which case it would just be wandering through space and so it is absolute certainty that these sorts of things exist there's\nNo question about it when people ask me about the bureau that's always a funny one because of course that's a conspiracy theory that there's a giant planet that's going to destroy the earth that NASA knows about and won't tell anybody and\nThings like that and I try very hard to explain to people that this is just crazy YouTube Internet conspiracy stuff that actually makes no sense\nExplains for a general world audience why some thing now says like a planet cannot sneak up on earth in the inner planets with out every astronomer on knowing\nIf something like ... I don't know what the latest crazy conspiracies are saying how big it is but occasionally over to headline that it's going to destroy the earth on some particular date because it's screaming into the inner solar system\nUsually if you do just a very quick calculation you realize if it were really coming it would be so bright\nThat you could see it with binoculars every person who owns binoculars on the planet could go look and see it coming you wouldn't be able to have a massive conspiracy keeping it secret\nAnd it would've been invisible to every backyard astronomer with Apollo scope for the past decade and it would have been visible to every professional astronomer\nFor the past fifty years if all of these people are in on the conspiracy I don't know\nAnywhere else were that many people are all keeping a secret from the rest of the world\nIs something ten times the mass of our earth where even out past Pluto out in the ... about what would be the obvious observation all changes perturbation in our solar system\nIn the inner part of our soldiers are being apart meaning the planets that we know of\nPlanet nine has no effect whatsoever on the inner planets and you can figure out why it's ten we actually think more like seven now seven times the mass of the earth and it is five hundred times further away from the sun and the earth is\nJupiter on the other hand is three hundred times the mass of the earth and it's only five times further from the sun than the earth is so Jupiter has a tremendous effect on the planets in the solar system and nobody sits around and there's worry that Jupiter is certainly going to come destroy us\nPlanet nine is really far away and quite a bit smaller than Jupiter so it's a fact it's really minimal one effect that it does have is that over four billion years it is capable of slowly tilting the orbits of the planets but even that is just a very very minor effect\nIf you're going to Hawaii in November and maybe you know be successful this time would it be possible to talk with you in December about what you might find or you have to wait to do papers\nThere's this will go there in November will collect the data it'll take us several weeks to months to process the data from November then we're back there first of December and will do the same thing and so\nIf we have found what we're looking for we will know it within a month or two of collecting those data\nAnd then to the point will announce existence as soon as we can confirm it we will have found it will go back to a total scope and double checked that it's really there and then we'll metal to existing trend ways we won't make the world wait\n[laughter] good so January twenty nine teen it is possible that three years after twenty sixteen January when we did our first interview about it that you might be able to confirm it\nIs possible I'm always very optimistic Constantine fatigue and my partner and all this is always much more pessimistic and so you know you should take my optimism with a grain of salt and then take his pessimist than with a grain of salt he thinks it'll take us another ten years I think it'll take us one year so maybe that means still another three years but I'm Still very optimistic\nThat there you have it during an right from the man who discovered this\nUh in terms of those ... and ... of those half a dozen bodies that are all kind of gather together out where the guy prevailed in the uh or cloud in that area and I think one of the most important part of doing these research\nProjects with these scientists\nIs that I have no confusion about the fact that if there was something massive that was trying to move into our solar system what it's called the inner solar system\nFrom a mercury the sun and mercury out to wear a\nNow Neptune and urine is our biggest Pluto is a been dumbed down to a dwarf planet out in the hyper belt that there's nothing that could be out coming this way and massive that wouldn't be picked up by everyone everywhere because\nGravity that that's the thing about gravity in math\nUh it it would have impact on every single thing in the solar system\nAbsolutely I Would have loved those ... been alive to talk with the professor I Wonder if you would have been able to convince him about that new bureau\nWell I don't know how much time we have left but I can START I have my own or ... that I had a discussion a face to face eye to eye with is that right yeah and maybe what I'll do it said that for conversations that lend it because it's really quite a story\nOkay we can do that too but it's a great story and it's really exciting that even if she doesn't agree and some of the theories that are out there\nThe fact that there's this extra planted out there does echo what some of these people have said long before anybody even knew about this stuff\nWell the idea that there could be a massive planets but when you read like say about the ... through scholar and you do the translation that we're a carbon done\nAnd you look at the carvings one thing that always is confusing to me is he talking about a Trump\nAir are eleven got\nHold on right there in the most come back we'll look finished that up in conversation [noise]\nNational debt relief his help so many people there a persuaded by the better Business Bureau you don't have to declare bankruptcy or

knowing what you were back with Linda molten how whose story next we'll deal with climate change Linda\nYou know Thirty years ago and Nineteen eighty eight when the world when it really kind of waiting that seriously for the first time the global climate change and real potential dire consequences in the future\nIt we couldn't get on top of expanding methane and carbon dioxide blanket around the earth\nAnd at the United nation many countries especially the worry about in Ireland and we see level rise could flood and display population they came together to form\nWorried about being islands in which sea level rise could flood and displaced populations\nThey came together to form the inter governmental panel on climate change also known as the eye PCC on the objective was to provide data about earth changes on an ongoing basis\nTo help project some of these impacts on world politics and the economy's\nBy twenty Fifteen only three years ago and the Paris Agreement on climate change\nMany small island nation were so worried about disappearing under something rising sea levels that the I. T. C. C. committed to doing a twenty Eighteen report written by Ninety One scientists from forty countries\nThe question was should humans to restrict global warming to two degrees Celsius or one point five degrees Celsius below pre industrial levels\nThe October twenty Eighteen IPC the answer is the stricter one point five degrees Celsius equal to a to point seven degrees Fahrenheit\nShould be the new target to achieve and hold in place by twenty thirty that's only a decade from now because if we don't if our planet continues to warm up above that limit of one point five degrees Celsius\nScientists warn there will be a catastrophe the mass die off they will accelerate and the coral reefs\nAnd if they die that kills off other marine species dependent upon the coral weather will become more violent and wins flooding rains and devastating wildfires\nWeather extremes will cause famine and fighting over land food and freshwater and sea level rise will force more and more Ireland to coast populations to move but to where the twenty Eighteen I PCC report said the next ten years\nBetween now and twenty thirty are crucial and in order to keep the one point five degrees Celsius limit nations must cut greenhouse gas emissions\nBy almost half of what they were in twenty ten solar wind and other renewable energy sources must replace\nAs much as sixty seven percent of today's electricity coal it as an industry around the world it must be phased out the coordinating lead author or vi PCC report says quote\nThis kind of a head in the sand mentality that has taken ... now in Washington which seems to pretend that this climate change threat does not exist\nBut this was widely knowledge in the defense community meaning the Pentagon as recently as three years ago and twenty Fifteen ... he is professor drew Janelle PHD professor of earth sciences in the earth\nAnd sciences division at Duke University and he joins us now from Durham North Carolina\nCould you please give me the top five places in the United states where water is coming in and flooding is already making people move\nI Would say those are the order Alaska and around the should be a ... year alone and Virginia and Louisiana so those would probably be the top of the United states\nAnd where would be the five top nations in the world that are now Ireland and other places that are most affected by the whole right\nAround the world\nThat are now islands and other places that are most impacted by sea level rise\nAround the world unfortunately all too many very low lying countries enough a large part of why we have this new report says countries wanted the United nations to investigate a lower woman target thinking that\nTwo degrees was probably not sufficient to protect them those are most of the islands in the south Pacific also multi use in the Indian Ocean many Caribbean countries\nAnd then there are very low lying countries like Bangladesh where the bulk of the population very close to the level of Nigeria has huge population Heath Ledger street level but you know some of his most of the world I Know and the United states also have enormous populations right up the coast\nAnd where in Alaska in Alaska\nYou have an interesting problem where it's it's a combination of rising sea levels and melting ice and the ice protected the shorelines from the waves from the ocean\nAnd without the ice the waiters can reach the shore or more easily and the waves are higher because of rising sea levels and so a lot of coastal communities along the west coast and the very straight area\nMany of them are already having to be evacuated and move to higher ground so it's not so much the north slope of the south and west\nCoasts and who is paying for that I Believe\nThat the combination of federal and state governments\nAlready moving people in Alaska from flooding to higher ground yeah\nAnd he is that happening in Louisiana Florida North Carolina as well\nThere's not been so much\nEvacuation of the coast there's been more what used to be rare flooding events that are now becoming quite common so I think that there is likely to have to be evacuations in the next couple decades of at least some places\nThat was an island does not speak for example between Maryland and Virginia more than half of it was already going\nThat we've seen the water come up through the drain the skin to Charleston South Carolina and Virginia wear loose and flooding that went very rare it's become so commonplace that governments have had to put up marker so that motorists country how deep the flooding is just so routine and Florida it's been some of the worst\nFlooding of streets in the southeast part of the state\nHas become fairly routine as he level rise has\nContinued and we've seen an acceleration because both the Greenland\nAnd Antarctica ice sheets are melting more rapidly than was expected just a decade to cope and become more water into the ocean unfortunately what we've been seeing over the past several decades since we started to generate these projections from the computer models\nAnd then watch the models has often been too conservative and things are happening faster than the models project\nCan you give an example of what has been dramatic compared to the computer model\nOne thing was the boss of sea ice in the Arctic it went like two or three times faster than the models project to\nIs the Arctic has melted two to three times faster than the computer's projected already by twenty Eighteen is that a harbinger of the fact that it's likely the warming and melting ice will keep increasing faster like what happened in the Arctic\nWell we've been observing from satellite that melting of the Greenland ice sheet has been accelerating\nWell we've been observing from satellite that melting of the Greenland ice sheet has been accelerating\nSo that is definitely a worry that is extremely challenging problem to figure out exactly how this massive she might become destabilized based on a treadmill thing from the top with water slipping down through cracks\nIn the ice sheet and lubricating the bit below you know when we worry because the warming has been so fast in the Arctic that the acceleration will continue\nAnd we're speaking in October of twenty Eighteen what would you project we will be seeing as more dramatic weather events between twenty Eighteen and twenty thirty\nLess rainfall in the west increasing water scarcity greater probability of drought greater likelihood of high fire conditions\nAnd receive flooding in the east 'cause you get more extreme heavy rainfall events and more heat waves everywhere around the country and well even the sheet extremes going up in metropolitan areas around the country so things
