of that area they they they would not be adapted to other environments around North America they would not want to go there\nAnd do you do a segment and a show on hard there in Alaska\n[noise] yeah we did that was a pretty weird experience ah what do you think's going on up there well I'm you know we had the benefit of spending some time with Dr Nick Begich use great isn't it yeah and I mean the guys who he's\nReally dynamic very knowledgeable man and you know I had written I've ... I had read all of the harp literature I was actually able to uh go to the Alaska librarian track down some official harp literature that came out when they open the facility so it kind of read their um\nYou know sales pitch so to speak but a doctor nicked did some experiments or showed us some experiments and I\nYou know how how it was possible uh\nUsing energy you know to use energy to basically disrupt people's brainwaves\nAnd you know that's just one of the allegations with regard to harm the other of course being that they're trying to control the weather is somehow\nA but the bottom line to me is the fact that you know that there is such they playing God I mean they're they're beaming you know billions of lots of power in the eye on a sphere which is essentially our protective shield it protects the earth from the from the sun from solar rays\nAnd uh uh you know as you know you know with chaos theory I mean a tiny tiny stimulus and have all types of repercussions that we can't even conceive up so you know even though they claim that they're not really doing or putting enough energy up there to really uh you know\nTo cause any effect but uh I don't know I I don't know if I Believe that or not it's pretty scary stuff\nJohn and many older Texas your turn John thanks for calling\nA fucking or for taking my own my own show or orange but not pay such to pull you out of ... hours and Honda so I go for us but things are ... for a while the voices of several search for the ... or ...\nOr ... and ... we have a reptile came out of a front of our town\nThat was about three feet tall and to give a general a body type I Would say it may lack federal rafter\nWow I Am a paper on Honduras have a common name fall and a ... a lot to call balls who has a plan and Paul just as a curator of a a\nA cruise ship that all of this reserve or grandma sexism he said he didn't talk to a ... fine and they said the one we saw there was one a member of the memo that have been known to small children\nI have ... years to try to ... and I came up\nHere that when Kenny\nYes it's actually a very familiar I'm even here in North America we have accounts of something known as a river Dina's or you know essentially descriptions are very similar to what John is saying like a a by Peter dinosaurs like raptor type of raptor types of dinosaurs scanning about three to five feet tall\nOr but apparently you don't have to go to Honduras to see them because uh just last year there were several sightings down here in South Texas\nOr in the town of ... ville I interviewed a couple of eyewitnesses a couple of ladies who claim he saw these\nThese dinosaur looking things running around there uh and\nShe's also been sightings from Colorado and New Mexico so I mean if a if you believe that the world is big enough and vast enough and still maybe an unexplored enough to to harbor some of these surviving dinosaurs you know I guess it's certainly possible\nYou want this monster and it's been on your list as a non\n... has and um actually this year has been a ... year pretty significant here for the Loch ness monster George\nI'm you know in recent years sightings of the lock this monster have really trailing off but uh in two thousand and Fifteen we actually had a they log five pretty darn good sightings\nOf something in ... and Loch Ness and it was the biggest fear for the longest monster in over a decade uh the sightings started in March of two thousand Fifteen or a family of tourists who were by the ... castle there the famous castle a sidewalk ness claim he saw a twenty foot\nComplex shape come out of the water and then submerge they weren't able to take a photograph of it because they were in shock and awe but they did get some footage of the uh the disturbance that left behind and then the next month in April there were a two or three really good sightings of a of a large animate object in Loch Ness\nAnd uh then again in September or the thing was seen again so whatever is in Loch Ness nasty the Loch ness monster whatever it is a it seems like it's still there are the sightings are going on again\nOne of our guests Stephen and believes that's a huge deal and you see in swimming up and down I'm not sure I think it's I think it's a ... a dinosaur\nThat's that's definitely a definitely matches some of the descriptions I'm In my new book George actually put out a theory that says it's not my theory it's been around for years but ah\nThe possibility that the Loch ness monsters that giant amphibian or essentially like a related to salamanders and Newt's in that same played and the reasons that I support that over the police you stores that amphibians are more acclimated to cold water then or reptiles\nAh and in addition to that amphibians can actually suck oxygen bar breathe oxygen through their skin so an amphibian would be able to stay submerged for a longer period of time and say a reptile which we need to come to the surface for air a fairly consistently\nLike little submarines aren't they\nYeah so I bet but who knows but the giant he'll theory is very prevalent as well but there's definitely something and Loch Ness\nLet's go to Gina in Denver, Colorado handle Gina\nHi can you hear me\nYou for taking my call um I just wanted to let you know however you can hear conclusion therapeutic and ... worked extra related heavy and into other kinds of mentions and things coming too\nI'm sure you've nailed it and I've been sitting on some evidence for a while now trying to figure out how to present it to the world and I was just kind of kinda jumping on it um I that photographic evidence of exactly what you're saying and just in our area of actually knew one other time when David quite is was on yes I'm I'm\nI'm the one from ... okay and I've got some initial contact with him a gun no further because other things have been happening but\nUm yeah can you know you've nailed it because the pictures that I have now and it it's going quicker and faster for me and I I actually don't even know how to present it to people but yeah the actual photographic evidence of\nHurdles opening other dimensional things coming and going into it when you drill down deeper into the picture you can see spirit a con spirit everything from things that look kind of I'm not familiar with ... and everything looks familiar to pick foot\nUm few alien to wrap ... looking things um [noise] it's it's uncanny and however I I'd like to ask how you kinda figured that out but it it was more text related portal that's bringing things end because now Im eyesight I've got the evidence to support [noise]\nWow that's pretty amazing and in terms of the evidence to gene or what do you have\nGot well you know it started with some of the other abilities with me and then when the check housing happened it's really started picking up and then all of a sudden now here during this past summer I've been able to take pictures and whenever I take pictures and then I feel presidents around me\nWhenever I take pictures there's other dimensional teams around me all the time and now here lately and this has happened just your leaks to go\nUm I've got this evidence that these portals opening I'll be taking pictures of anything whether it's my apartment or an environment that I'm In\nI'm just neutral areas and don't feel something there and I'll take a picture and you look at the picture and you drill down and you see here the on spirit other entities and then here these past few weeks the portal\nBeing open and are these portals opening and closing\n[noise] yeah [laughter] yeah it's it's something else it's like it drove down to like almost like a piano as like I'll take a picture to normal often something there yeah and then it'll turn black like something's\nTrying wants to see the pictures the genesis of you Georgia coast to coast am dot com or lacks that coast to coast am dot com it can I suspect that if there are for Texas they've got to be pretty big swollen walk so many people rather than just being you know maybe the side of a sidewalk well don't you think\nYeah that makes sense and again you know as a corpus of all this quantum physics is one of my strong points but uh certainly I've read the works of you know I was interested in some of other forty and researchers at of address the vortex theory and um\nYeah you absolutely would we'd be talking about something that has just an unbelievable amount of a mouse and energy\nWell that's that's more scarier than big food or UFOs to me falling into a dimension and you can't get back ... were coming back with spinal calls in a moment coast to coast down\nOh this is a great story so I I was contacted by a fireman and EMS worker in Georgia who swore to me that he was out mowing his back yard and he saw a ... a spider as big as a house cat he said it looked like a wolf spider but it was about as big as a house cat with about a twelve inch\nSpan ah and ah it basically crawled up a tree in his backyard and he didn't know whether to\nUh to run away because he was afraid that might jump on him or or to you know run and grab a camera you alternately went for a camera but by the time he got back to thing was gone but uh this guy was pretty credible George I mean this is a guy he said it's people's lives for a living and he uh he swore to me up and down at this this really happened\nEverybody who's listening to us in bed right now there is a huge bite or on your pillow just one [laughter] ah I'm not that I have a wreck the phobia but I don't like spiders can I just don't like I Know they have a purpose but I don't like 'em\n[laughter] uh most people don't George I think you're not alone there but uh you can imagine spider that big a particularly here in North America uh yeah you get a house restless night\nWhy did the greed create or give them eight legs what do they need to eat leagues for\n[laughter] well spiders are actually uh it's uh they're they're pretty darn proven designed George I mean they uh they date back uh probably four hundred million years or to the slurry and if you're talking about like the the the ancestors of spiders which were like the ... the sea scorpions\nUh so uh it's it's a it's a tried and true design and it's worked for hundreds of millions of years\nTo let's go to a amber and the Kurds Tom Pennsylvania to get us going Hi amber go ahead\nGeorge how're you doing good hope you are to yeah you know ... me turn left the spider\nAgain it's not like I can look very well anyway ... hairs [laughter] anyway I'm kidding only what I call it about why is that something last year saw last names north norm let's credit do say New Mexico and when it comes out about that\nI'm Sorry I didn't hear what about not being in New Mexico\nWas created in do say in Mexico\nOh so it was kind of like a like a covert government experiment or something like that 'cause it yeah application\nUh yeah you know what do you think about that not nothing's impossible but uh in my flying humanoid book um I actually um there is a case of a mosque man type creature known as the bird man of shopper Raul\nAnd it's been an countered by several residents of a tiny town called ... which is\nA not too too darn far for white sands\nAnd our some of those other kind of covert\nUh things have gone on through the years so uh you know maybe you've got a case they're of a mosque man a little bit closer to home if a if New Mexico is where they're from\nOkay who's next been in Florida it's your turn been taken away\nHey Jen I'm home those who remember me but we ... we a cat that one night on the victim of extradition yeah\nCeremony and we were looking for the ... yeah we sure why well I found him in that you know six and I guess what are you going to be coming back down this way to do further research and um [noise] ah because there's been some interesting things happening I'm Out with that area where we were at\nAnd I'm also since you've been doing thunder purge stuff I spent last year up in North Dakota and the oil fields working\nAnd I went to ... state park near Gwen dive Montana and if you're in if you're still doing it on your research you should go out there and take a look at some things because I saw some I saw some sparked out there last year that freaked me out I'm a wildlife biologist\nWow that's impressive press is they don't they can take some ... by the way this the skunk apes people think they're All right well\nHe I think most researchers feel that they're potentially a subspecies so they are kind of a a derivative of big foot but since\nYou're looking at a completely you know you're considering a completely different type of habitat the swamps the Cyprus swamps and uh\nAnd so forth um there are a little bit smaller than the traditional big Twitter sauce watch for the Pacific northwest\nAre they primarily walk on their hind legs or by Peter Lee but there have been a lot of accounts of them are going down on all fours a so in that respect to the Florida it's concave seems to be you know even more ape like if you will than the traditional ... watch\nWhether any huge stories in two thousand Fifteen in the criminal world [noise] well\nUh in addition to the Loch ness monster thing that I told you about that was kind of big but um there had been a lot of sightings are accounts of something known as the dog man I don't know if you've heard of that or not\nBut essentially it's aware wolf type creature that combines the characteristics of a of a of a canine\nA and a human and a kind of like your traditional Hollywood werewolf if you will but um there were at least four to six accounts or in a relatively short period of time from central Pennsylvania and these were followed closely by some of my colleagues who are researchers up in that area\nAnd ah the descriptions are again very similar now a Linda Godfrey of course is a a colleague of mine who's documented these dog man\nYes a flash where we'll accounts from all over the mid west or but it seems to\nLee a seems to be a very a polarizing topic I should say in the field or crypto zoology there's so many accounts now uh it seems like these things whatever they are they're they're really being seen in a with a lot of frequency lately\nHow much do we not know creatures\nWell well that's just George I mean there's two ways to look at it you know one is that we've got it all figured out and uh the world's all been explored but uh uh I personally know that should not be the case I've had the opportunity to travel all over the world to the Amazon jungle to Africa to all kinds of amazing habitats\nAnd I can tell you that the vast majority of our planet is uninhabited and very inaccessible and in addition to that new species are being discovered on a consistent basis still\nSo um you know that there is certainly the potential for all types of strange and marvelous creatures to be out there just beyond the grasp of scientist\nRoberta in Baltimore, Maryland now hey Robert thanks ringing in there go ahead\nOh thank you George ... wanna wish both you and Ken a happy and healthy new year I think you\nKnow which one of the things I've been trying to do with your a story you see a is a great or the many gifts that you've had in the end the things that they bring out the ah the the have some like strange nice having heard before\nAnd the and in regard to what kind of talking about this for items up like the to bring to your attention one is that uh the uh we we've heard quite a bit about it a civilization that have existed and and still exist on the earth\nAnd it would seem like a for example one of the uh one of these are species or the ... and I noticed that Ken talked about it ... features on some of the\nUh the animals that have been observed or another one is the fact that the next ... admiral bird and others when they've been in the Arctic and and it ties in with this ah\nI live in a being a location where you see many of these creatures that they found a whole\nAh they reported a hole in the in the Arctic and then when admiral bird was sent down to Antarctica\nWhich was on another one of your shows a day of course discovered that there's quite a bit of activity going on underground in Antarctica and again that can be a location where other species could develop\nAnd if these are underground areas exist all through the country which we've heard they do or they could very easily be independent civilizations independence species living there and coming out through the various ah\nAh areas that have not been explored I'm ... and finally a when you talk about shaped shifting Ken I I think we always want to keep in mind the possibility that the shade shift or maybe isn't shaped shifting buddies projecting a um\nA a holographic image tell a perfectly to the receivers that if when you look at him he's a\nVery much directing an image and I wonder and many of these cases where maybe they are shaped shifting but it is ...\nAlways have to consider that possibility that they're not end on on another subject you brought up before I went to make a comment on hard\nUh that one of the major uh objectives for the people researching harp and that isn't just in the United states has you know a Russia had done quite a bit of research in that area beforehand but the one of the purposes military\nThe United states is you know a Russia had done quite a bit of research and let area beforehand but the

two year old Texas man and his dog died in twenty Fifteen when they\nGot stuck into Corvettes that uses the same type of door mechanism\nAnd I coordinate down the area to scoop up which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made in sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the hoop of police that a police background I approached them and they said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me\nI'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth and every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that they would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders and this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys with introduced me and they say hey\nYou can trust this guy ah he's a friend he's credible and that's the way it got started and uh after I heard maybe ten or Fifteen of these stories from ultra credible people in and out of the tribe\nA one was a store manager that ran this big store in Hooper that live miles away who saw one coming into town I started thinking about my police days and\nI used to work with a forensic artist that was just phenomenal\nAnd uh he would sit down with a witness be able to draw this sketch from just the witness statements\nAnd the results were amazing but I wanted something that a slightly different so I could a line this person with a tribal setting in Native Americans and I found a diamond unbelievable look\nAn individual name Harvey ... who was assistant director of the Oklahoma bureau of investigation and the chief forensic artist FBI trained\nFor the state of Oklahoma and Harvey is not only a world famous artists tease outstanding law enforcement person\nAnd a Harvey and I met in right away we just click like brothers\nAnd when Harvey would sit down with say a witness to a robbery and draw the sketch a suspect and the suspect was later caught I Swear to you it is like the suspect was in the room and Harvey due the sketch of the suspect that is how accurate this man has\nAnd so when I brought him in to the Native American tribes\nThey immediately accept and\nArmy and I have done this for a long time now together and we're best friends\nWe did two books that Hooper project and then we did a follow up book called tribal big foot where he went outside of hoop and draw sketches of what other people saw again took statements under penalty of perjury\nAnd ah it's kind of how it started\nAh you said you don't have a dog in the white meaning you're not committed to one position or another because there are several different camps in the big world right\nOh bingo uh started the most vocal the most audacious the most vulgar [laughter] are probably the people who believe it's an eight and they will run you over the world demean you they will do anything\nBut since they were the most outspoken I thought well this must be true and I kinda went down that path thinking well it must be an aid must be some kind of a background\nBut I still kept that open mind in when we the first day that we sat down with the people in and around hoop Andrew the sketches\nHarvey myself in Harvey's wife Gina proud also an agent for in Oklahoma\nWe were set in stone disbelief because the sketches or very human like\nYeah they were huge yeah they had hair all over the body but there was a human quality that you just couldn't miss\nAnd they didn't look like apes they didn't have that ape characteristics that you would think of in a face in a chest et cetera\nAnd it was just shocking and when the witnesses saw the sketches to a lady into a man they would consistently say Harvey you nailed it that if the exactly what you look like\nAnd when you talk to the old there's they would consistently say this is another tribal people is on animals is their people\nThey had a sort of developed a relationship with them at least a coexistence right\n[noise] yeah it in the tribal area at the one of the managers presidents chairman of the tribe\nA and they said so that they looked at a map and they said so this is their area we don't go in there and this is your area this is our area and if they can come into our area and they do regularly and that's why we see him\nThe only thing that the hoop areas the trinity river like great salmon and steal head area\nA has just so much wildlife and if you drive through Hooper from willow creek you'll notice that there are more very bushes on the roadways and the surrounding mountains than I've ever seen anywhere in the world\nAnd there's this association with berries and big foot over the years that if you pay attention and you do the research something about that and I I I Know that they're seeing eating at a lot but it's just an odd coincidence\nYou or I don't want to get too deep into the woods I'm literally and figuratively but you can you summarize as a law man as a former law man at the state of the evidence about whether you'd say there is that there is there sufficient evidence that something is real here and now we just haven't quite figured out\nSo several years of walking down that path I knew that DNA is the real answer to any solution of animal life for human life\nAnd there were a series of people that I met on this journey that were absolutely ultra credible many of them didn't want to talk about it many of them didn't want to be visible without it put all of them said you were in on this let's let's get the DNA\nAnd George I got to think that to many years ago you brought on and at my request a ah a PHD named Melba catch them and Dr catch him\nWas one of the few people in the world that was willing to go into the lab and DNA test hairs tissue blood et cetera that we'd bring in and on your show we said hey we need other samples from throughout North America the test to kind of get a cross section of what we're dealing with\nAnd that led to a hundred and ten samples being submitted a many of them were ... were hair and with the hair you need the follicle to get the mitochondrial DNA and then other people came forward with a tissue samples blood saliva\nUpper worked through incredibly well ah to figure out the solution and the chemical way to extract and read this DNA and the amazing part was is that we got nuclear DNA and what the showed\nWas that the wife had went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the female side\nTo the ... Arab region to ah Jerusalem to\nA Jordan ended that part of the world and this is when I was sent to a gym bag and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in the ...\nAnd unbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation\nAnd they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her white a white paper about this\nAnd during that process of getting the DNA extracting that DNA one of the places that they used was Louisiana crime lab a completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this the samples could've been compromised yet as the paper was written about before I get there\nSo they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't do this but you and I work together to introduce smell but two of very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explained to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this\nShe listen to some of this but she didn't listen to all of it and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in a white paper in a white paper\nBut if you at strapped all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science which people don't in Ninety nine percent of the people have never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit\nWith a scientist who reads that science behind the paper they know that\nThose hundred and ten samples sell us tell a story that phenomenal\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a little bit more and then jump into specifics from ... new book big wild man and giants eased Harry noon and night night I mean big what ... air tickets into the break\n[noise] well that's the part that I don't think a lot of people understand it a this wasn't some half ale treatment it was it was the best of the best that DNA was sent to force certified lab so to ensure that there was no mistake\nAll of the labs got the same results\nOr was analyzed by a series of people it was\nIt went through so many hurdles was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you can see 'em on TV and they said oh you know the DNA has come back as bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that they'll but did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nIs that when the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to a DNA to ensure that they came back as big foot her\nNow people are saying going to say well how do you know let's pick for their well big foot hair looks different than any other mammal hair in the world and I could teach anybody in five minutes to look at a big foot her and tell the physical difference under a microscope between that and other hairs\nHair and fiber experts have a graph of all the different mammal hairs in North America\nAnd when you look at a big but here it's entirely different\nSo if it if they didn't jump through that hurdle and never went on to DNA\nBut if you pay attention to all of these DNA experts are not using her hair and fiber expert even work at and ensure that what they're dealing with it is the real deal [noise]\nSo and I don't think some of these so called DNA experts\nHave figured out the formula that Melba did to extract this DNA and to get the results and there's a lotta there's a lotta attitude in this arena as you know George\nAnd it's unfortunate that people won't put down their defenses and all work together and it almost seems at times that there's something else behind the scenes that's ensuring that they don't want to get those results\nWell it's kinda like the you up a world I mean people are very passionate but they're also very bitter conscious and you have a certain element of people who takes the cake their passion to\nDifferent levels um to the point of fraudulent um material um and ah\nWill stab people in the back and will sabotage others uh the DNA evidence\n... had a minimum um\nWere able to dismiss it because it has\nAnd advertise others uh the DNA evidence ... at a minimum um people were able to dismiss it because it has elements of humans in it right so they'd say well it's humid but it's not all you\nKnow and that's that's the part\nBut as I can say is it looks like it's a hybrid humid um it's unusual but it's it's way far down that humans spectrum I'm I I think the most unusual part\nThat everyone was stunned about was that the nuclear DNA couldn't come back with the human match on gender bank and when you look at that you've got to think well that means number one\nThat Gen bank has never had a sample in the world submitted other than ours\nAnd how could that be um we we used we we sat down as a group many times and tried to be smart about how we got this DNA and luckily on a couple of occasions a farmer had some pipes break an irrigation pipe and\nIt was kind of surmise that say a six foot section of pipe was purposely broken on on each and six feet apart because it appears that a big foot with trying to get some kind of animal that within the pipes some kinda rodent or something\nAnd when he broke the PVC pipe and bled on it well we got the DNA off that\nOther times it licked game camera we got that and there were there was a tissue sample we got that and then over a hundred hair samples that had a follicle that all match this big foot look when you view it under a microscope\nNow Ninety nine point nine percent of the time when I get approached about this that people haven't read the study they've read a newspaper article or someone's opinion and they believe it\nAnd they refused to get into the minutia of the data and read the report because it's available online and see that the hurdles that we went through to make sure that this was true an accurate I give all the credit Melba she's a genius scientists that figure this out\nUm it's unfortunate\nYeah then it got kind of a thrown under the under the bus as she did as well um you said that the this this was not engine bank is it now or are they toss it out\nThey wouldn't take it\nLet's go to your book big wild man and giants I made a lotta times you know these descriptions and there's some amazing working here there's some really\nA tremendous writing in some of these old articles a from a long time ago but um and some of them are pretty hilarious in in reading it off and making fun of the witnesses as well\nBut these things are at the three different categories that you have in the title they're all sort of blended together although there are some very important distinctions between the the three and they go way way back sixteen eighty how did you how did you find all these\nSo ... again it was just me searching for old cases on missing people that seemed to miss that fit that profile but we were looking for\nBut then when I had this giant stack of articles kind of the breakdown of of the way the articles were worded is two hundred and two of the articles used wild man as a description twenty four used a gorilla monkey Ninety eight used giants and forty use something else\nNow the articles the way they broke down on geographical is a hundred and fifty eight we're in the U. S. sixteen\nIt was something else now the articles the way they broke down on geographical is a hundred and fifty eight we're in the U. S. sixteen in Canada three in Hungary three in the Himalayas er Nepal and three in the u._k. there were others but those were the bulk of him\nAnd then the states with the most articles about it a whirl Ohio with Twenty one Pennsylvania Thirteen California eleven Indiana all live in\nNew York nine Georgia nine Kentucky in Texas six [noise]\nAnd then the numbers keep going down from there but again it wasn't I wasn't looking for these and\nThey weren't associated with a missing persons articles they just would have visibility on a front page along with a new article in the missing\nBut I started to pay attention and I got to get some credit to a guy named Tom Powell out of Oregon Tom's a brilliant guy good researcher and he started to make the connection between giants in Bigfoot\nAnd one of the funniest things he did in his presentations his genius is a lot of people say oh you know a few overlay this map with the maps of the foot wild man disappearances there all the same\nAnd he puts up a map of like Bigfoot there's a appearances and UFO appearances and\nThen he does some where all the you know the amount of rain in certain areas associated and\nAnd he goes out like six maps and then he puts up on that but he doesn't say anything because you know what this map of because this is a map of all the Wal Mart stores in the U.S can you see how they're kind of associated the same locations as the big ... [laughter] and\nBut it was his statement about giants that were found in past centuries\nIn mountains and in a excavations they're really kind of got me thinking or these giants the big for that were buried or were they something else and how come they're more there aren't more giants that we can go see it museums and things where are they\nYeah I've asked that question I'm really interested in the subject in part because there are some of those stories you're in Nevada you know the ... showing that you have legends and stories about a big foot bones or a giant bones that were stashed in that came up in northern Nevada and uh yeah ask what happened to the bones and nobody can seem to find\nA lot of these articles pointed to um some universities would get them into the more likely candidate where all these went and it said in the articles was the Smithsonian yet nobody can go back and find them now and the Smithsonian claims they don't have them\nYou look back and some of the descriptions there's one early in your book I it's from the Marilyn ...

back in history or so\nDoes that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history and so there's something to this they got got a skill where they said they started looking like him or apes in animals and\nAs you know Georgia's a segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and I don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one maybe some kind of over loaded on testosterone\nBut they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them but it's not going to happen\nThere are some uh reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and a invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\n[noise] yeah and uh probably the one case in you know about it the Minnesota Wild man that has a lot of injury to it because\nI've seen pictures of it and I've seen descriptions of it and it is unusual and nobody quite knows what happens to it but a lot of people just cuckoo it sale you know was that was a fake meant for the circus but the more you dig into that one there was something strange with that\nWell I find myself rooting for the wild man or whatever it is to get away and all these cases so I'm Glad it ends up that way you know you look at where are these reports come from there from major these are major newspapers too I mean the Boston Globe and the San Francisco newspaper LA Times or\nAnd they and it's some great writing some of these descriptions is just terrific writing it it's somebody wasn't just phony get in or when they were working on this story and the fact that they come from places like Indiana and Iowa and Kansas\nOr that's not where we associate big what sightings modern sightings at all is trying to think of why would Ohio in Pennsylvania be so prominent in the numbers and it's because\nI mean that was the center of American civilization and is Seventeen hundreds or so Seventeen eighties where the bigger cities where it wasn't exactly the frontier because there are people out here as well but\nUh that's where the bulk of the population probably lived at the time\nOh exactly and it's a a it's an interesting phenomenon when you start to look at the fighting locations in conjunction to the giants sightings\nAnd skeletons and then if you go back in history and you think about exactly what you said where did we first establish civilization and cities that as we move west where were these locations but then even though we're thing to me is Ohio has a lot of these sightings\nWell that's Bruce Maccabee with Ohio is a friend and I went to spent four or five days within earlier this year and the strange things that he's told me that have happened in Ohio in the air and on the ground it's really strange\n[laughter] ... can be a is welcome here anytime he is a fascinating guy are both in person and on the air and in his books or you know what it was kind of surprising to see the early reports from Hungary I'd never heard of Hungarian big voter sasquatch reports until reading this book of yours\nWide I'd never heard of him either and a\nAgain a surprising surprising fact that they're writing about it from there and then in the ... they there's an article from there about siting it when you look at the descriptions that they're offering almost identical to what they're seeing here in the U.S at the same time period or thereabouts\nAnd then when you think about present day sightings again from\nThe U.S at the same time period or thereabouts and then when you think about present day sightings again from on almost every continent in the world which is unusual\nUm you know some of the descriptions obviously I you have to take him in a cultural contacts now I don't remember when the jungle book was written but Mobley the character Mobley um you know he's described that description is used in a couple of the newspaper clippings from that era that that you've collected here\nCorrect and er I people always tell me what about the star wars creature that looks like Bigfoot I kind of strange\nThan it was inspired by maybe yeah I don't know it's it is a similarity um some of the descriptions I I I Would have to leave their way here to find one but it seems like the witnesses are saying that the wild men have clothes or items of clothing or just a ... kind of thing\nWhich suggests to me maybe ... maybe read they really were literally wild men out there\n[noise] and usually and occasionally even nowadays you hear about it for wearing clothing and kind of goes on explainable because why would they do that but you know maybe it's\nSome association maybe they're trying to break a barrier or if they're seen\nMaybe they think they'll be accepted more if they're seen maybe people won't be so scared you know we could all through in our conjecture about why that may be happening but it happens too often for people to be fabricating it I I hear it occasionally but not very often\nUm if you were to communicate with the tribe these days a ... a modern tribe that would still perhaps be in contact other than the hope is is are there any other tribes you would say people that have a relationship one going with or whatever these things are\nI Would say it's almost every one I mean there's there's famous stories out of Arizona New Mexico and the high plains out there where\nUh they have these and there's so many times an association between and this is where they put people start their head start spending that fact\nWhere there's this association between big for it in UFOs even in the hoop a book I wrote that many of the tribal people said that they saw a UFO and costs time and space to the point where they saw big foot and they regularly saw UFOs on many of the tribal grounds\nAnd when you talk to these tribal members The Elders they believe they came from the stars and they're they're not once they have your trust they will tell you hey\nYou know there's this association between us and them and there are different kind of try and different kinds of people but they came from the same place we did\nAnd when you start to go back and you look at the history of these certain areas there's a lot of tribal people that will tell you we've had visitations for hundreds and hundreds of years going back in time and almost all of them believe that they came from the stars\nWell there are an awful lot of associations between these creatures being cited in in proximity to UFOs and it makes everyone uncomfortable the big put people to die hards don't like it the UFO diehards like it even less or they they're not comfortable with that at all but you have\nTo follow it where it leads and you know I I don't have a conviction on it either I don't know what these things are I don't know what you are those are where they're from but um there was enough cases\nAnd a lot more of them now thanks to this new book you can ignore it I I thought the interest there was a couple of stories clippings where there are reputable witnesses who say they saw these creatures are engaging with cow's milking cows\nSo this is the part that really really unusual several years ago one of my best friends their parents on a dairy farm\nAnd I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that they may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know let me go talk to my parents\nSo they own a huge cheer for anyone out there and talk to them in this all the I think he's eighty years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know every once in awhile Mike how will come back from nowhere completely though\nHe goes I don't understand it [laughter] then\nThe same man told her he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property and something tells me don't turn around get back on the horse or get back on my ATV and leave and he does\nAnd then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property I don't know how it got there so\nDogs [laughter] I I think when you get the trust of some of the dairy farmers way out in the middle they're going to tell you the same thing because I've heard many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're at a particular this image of a big foot milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and different kinds of fruit\nUm do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take deer et cetera they're an omnivore and many times\nWhen the natives are in the middle of the woods hunting themselves\nThey'll come across a deer that stuck up in a tree and like a two hundred and fifty pound here a native ... could have done it and they don't know how it got way up in the trees and it's a tornado or hurricane zone so how did it get their\nRight here we go calls for my guess de ... first time caller Gwen in Pittsburgh Hi Gwen\nThere um thank you for letting me on your show first of all welcome second of all the ... I have had many sleepless nights listening to everything about the missing person like it is one of the most unsettling thing that I've heard in a long time so good job on your finding\n'em I wanted to talk about the big thing I actually\nThink you're I really love\nHow you were saying how it's related to wild man\nI'm I feel like Rome are also as the way that we could find out more about wild men because there are Amazonian tribe that were just discovered like the first time with your own and I feel like\nYour idea of revolutionary and I feel like with them and I hadn't years will definitely have an answer because it's grown and my question\nIs you know like you're going to use drones in your research at all\nSo drones are an interesting topic but uh there was actually some a PHD level people that thought the drones are going to be good for finding that for that that was a complete bomb\nSo a drones are never going to work for a big topic the missing people topic they have used drones before on missing people a housing work real well and you can't use the drone international park it's against the wall and there's a huge fine so probably won't happen\nThat George Bush is going to the next call I had a question for you and maybe you should kind of touch on it for the people here your work on skin walk a ranch the researchers there saw something very similar to a big ... can you tell us about that\nAre actually multiple times ah it's more of the tribe that that encounters them they've seen them there as long as they lived there there was a very dramatic instance I've got the transcripts of the interviews with the officers and we went to the spot where it happened\nBut the the dogs there were police officers are patrolling tribal grounds they have a gift shop that's just off the highway there on the reservation and\nUh the dogs alerted the officers to this huge thing that was a just outside the window and as soon as the dogs mated noise and the this thing looked at the officers and showing a light on it it took off running\nAnd it went all the way through the community and you could hear it it well I mean it was just taking these giant stride it knocked over a garbage cans you head alarms going off then\nThat the police officers chased it ah I think they they found some tracks it led to a there's a reservoir there this just on the other side of skin Walker ranch and that's where they lost that it just kind of sort of disappeared\nOr they are seen similar creatures on the ranch itself I'm I should call it big but it's more like humanoid and there's one particular instance that we've just\nThese two scientists and to other people who were observers up on skin marker rigid seen\nWhat looked like a dirty snowball of light that uh that was floated just off the\nOff the ground in the middle homestead there on the ranch in it ... through infrared you can see the the ball of light started stretching into what looked like a tunnel\nAnd through this tunnel this creature started crawling they could see it it can you guys these guys were really excited seeing this thing is coming from somewhere else in this tunnel of light ... through struggling to get through this skinny little opening it pulls itself out at the er at the entrance to this uh this tunnel\nStands up it's eight feet tall I'm feature lists dark humanoid shaped like ahead with no neck on a on a body it's just stands up and then starts moving up towards getting Walker ridge where these guys are watching it and they can tell ya they got the hell out of there they were pretty scared about the whole thing but\nAre there have been multiple sightings of that by humans by um scientists by dogs uh uh the the tribe has the best a handle on it and um has seen it all over the you went to base and so yeah it's pretty common in that area and and of course it's in proximity to a lot of other really strange stuff so\nYou have to ask the question about what is the association between these creatures are that are described in many different ways and a lot of other very unusual phenomena and we don't know um west of the Rockies Kyle\nIn Utah I Kyle welcome to the program\nHow you doing All right so in your mind so\n[noise] so I had um you're talking about David Was talking about Joseph ... spent the one who taught the Cain on his saddle um he thought they put\nIt happened in Eighteen [noise] a five star Eighteen thirty five he was on his way to another town and go ... and he was impossible at the time that the prophet\nAnd he ... he ran into a cane and uh he described Cain as a as a tall or figure that was taller than the saddle\nAnd ah just to fill the fifth talked a cane in the heat and came to introduce it still is that I'm a man I'm personally wander here and there and I might go will basically he she wanted to make men misery or the destroyed their souls you brought that up I just thought\nIt morning culture LVS coach or that we have you know there's two story there really famous that story than just killing Smith who is Joseph Smith nephew\nKnow his brother had an encounter Leslie Smith a in Hawaii at the dedication at the then lay Hawaii temple of ... in Nineteen Twenty one uh came came to read the doors of the temple and I'm In his hand [noise] uh\nUh Wesley Smith said that he that was the priest and to cast came out and some of the roses Hannah name is ... ... [noise] and so it's interesting you say that we can and our church you know like some people who are skeptical I ate there kind of hush hush let's talk about it\nBut as people continue to go on you know um there are more accepted but I just wanted for David like with the disappearances 'cause I've been reading news but for a little while and stuff\nI Do think it's it's a big foot you thinking like does he have any idea what's going on is like people are asking me you know like people don't need to kind of have an interest in a little bit of this stuff\nWell let me tell you a coyote let everyone listening here to tonight is probably the the weirdo expert in their family and then there are social social circle a you and\nLee the go to person in their own circles more information about these kind of topics do you are to begin with the Joseph Smith story is that a is that likely a big foot type encounter or is that something else\nWell the description that the Smith gave was with natural Bigfoot but then there's there's people who are researching this topic who believe that the big ... may be some night some type of the film from the Bible and when you read that there is some association there that makes some sense\nThat Scott Carpenter another researcher in the world has written a book about this it's compelling and there's there's some strong evidence\nThat he's come across that may joined the two topics\nThen the other things like in the Smith and said the part that's unusual is that it came and it spoke to him and he never said it mine spoke but more like it spoke to him so hard to say I don't know but one thing like this gentleman asked about my thoughts and things\nI've always stated that I'm a man of facts all of my books are filled with facts\nThere aren't any opinions about what's going on I allow you to come to your own opinion and why do I do that because there are no facts to it to establish any current pattern that points to one suspect\nWhen you look at the big foot world there's nothing that points to an exact equation of what we're dealing with other than the DNA\nBut again if you stick with the facts and allow the public to come to their own thoughts I have never met anybody who's read my eight books and they have been thousands that has come to me and said I Know exactly what's happening now\nAnd I should point out that you know you did address this maybe Kyle didn't hear it but there are no credible stories in your view a big one being responsible for what carting people off as far as you know\n[noise] well no no killing them I I think all of them okay there's there's a story that John Green wrote about a prospect that was taken in British Columbia where he took an affidavit from this man\nAnd he was sleeping in a sleeping bag and one of these by pitch grabbed his bag and started walking with him for hours and ended up dumped put him in a cave\nAnd he was eventually escaped but he said he saw this family of big foot in the cave and they kind of watched him and he kind of watch them a it's a it's a really really good story who and the individual at the time sign an affidavit I followed green bleeding and said this is a good way to document the stories I hear and\nThat's kinda how it came came to pass\nI remember that story now yeah that is a good one is it there are some other account in one of your books about a witness claiming just see a big what type creature carrying a person through the forest\nDoesn't ring a bell yeah ah\nSo well there's this story out of Wyoming that I I don't put much Clinton said it because the people didn't come forward and they were doing something illegal but a group disappear in Wyoming\nAnd to uh people who were poaching we're out in the woods and they claimed that they saw big for carrying this body under its arm and a pure dead\nEvery diploma more rewarding it makes us all proud\nEvery stray student on meet the same thing like a piece in the valley is all about how you handle your stuff to do family\nDoesn't matter how long you been out of school or be the first in your family to go to college which took time off to raise your kids or if you're one career but you know the calling [noise]\nGet it together ashtray university\nDistrict dot edu to learn\nHistory or university it's sort of ...\nDo you help learning to speak to read an or write English to colleges southern Idaho and career readiness program to help this is a free service and classes are offered at various times in locations throughout south central Idaho oh eight hundred six eight zero zero to seven for extension six five three four\nThat's eight hundred sixty eight zero zero to seven for extension six five three for free helped to speak right and ...

it exceeded all my expectations the subject is rubbing the writing is superb\nThe research is meticulous and this story this tragedy really touches a nerve in ways that I think we will explore over the next few hours and for anyone who's not a student of naval history\nYou know the first time most of us probably heard of what little we know about the USS Indianapolis it can be traced to\nOne of the best scenes in the history of American movies is from blockbuster Spielberg movie jaws Robert jaws character went delivered a moving powerful slightly tipsy account of what motivated him to become a shark hunter here is an edited version of that scene deserved just as a reminder to you\n[noise] seven hundred mental [noise] says Linda improvement as [noise]\nAnd I'm In the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was the case of hitting in the shore of environment\nAnd during that time and much thirty first Nineteen forty five she was hit by kamikaze nine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent for on the fateful journey\nMight have gone down in history as victorious flagship of the world war two specific theaters I'm Victoria said okay now as well as nine other major battles\nBut instead she went back to their island California for repairs and that's where she was on July sixteenth Nineteen forty five when general Leslie grows and the other leaders of Manhattan Project including President Truman\nDecided that they want us to send the components of the atomic bomb little boy with would later ... to head to the forward areas\nAnd trim and did this a lot of uh a lot of people don't know that trim and did this before he even knew that he would use the bomb because at that time uh everyone thought that there would be an invasion of mainland Japan\nSo Indianapolis was selected to transport these ... components of the bomb she did that a native record breaking run to a Pearl Harbor and then\nPushed on defending an island where she dropped off the components of the atomic bomb and then two days after that on July twenty eighth Nineteen forty five she set out on what was going to be a routine voyage across those can see from Guam for the Philippines\nAn omelet straight west down shot and right when she was in the middle of the Pacific or Stevie middle of the Philippines these\nOn July thirty is Nineteen forty five just a few minutes after midnight or she intersected course with\nA Japanese submarine called I fifty eight commanded by lieutenant commander Moshe Sarah how she mode of how she met her fired expose torpedoes Indianapolis with\nTwo of them the first one almost completely blew the vow of the shift Indianapolis heavy cruiser the second one hit her image shifts the vessel went down and twelve minutes and you know we've been talking longer than twelve minutes it was very very quick\nAbout three hundred men went down with the shift of a little under nine hundred made it into the water alive and when they made it into the water those who survive their wounds were very optimistic that they were going to be rescued and\nBut uh they weren't and they've spent five nights and four days in the water struggling to survive and uh as you mentioned earlier they've\nThey've fought madness they've fought the hydration they've a shark\nOr eventually they fought each other because of the madness and that is the story that most people know about Indianapolis she was a spotted completely by accident on the about mid day on the fourth the fourth day after five nights and four days in the water\nAnd only three hundred and sixteen minutes devised\nSarah secrecy play such an important part in this at every step of the way and it leads to tragedy with tragic tragic results because of the secrecy of the what they were carrying and continue to sort of continued over after they drop it off\nOr what did you share with us the secrecy or I ... which obviously was necessary military necessity a lead to tragedy and how you probably you interfered with your ability to get at the core of the story\nAbsolutely I mean there were multiple areas that held secrecy and the story that led to the demise of Indianapolis and ultimately the men being you know lost that fee for five days\nAnd you know first of which being how messages were transmitted across the Pacific during the war you know there was a ...\nTaken into consideration and you know one of the ships that Indianapolis was to report to when it arrived in the Philippines was um admiral McCormick and the message he received was garbled\nAnd so you know protocol said that oh it didn't you know didn't come through clearly and no one asked for a repeat so they didn't even know Indian Indianapolis was supposed to be reporting to them you know that was one of the first thing\nI'm so when she didn't show up they didn't know she was supposed to show up you know um aside from that there was protocol that noncombatants ship the rivals didn't have to be reported and so when she didn't arrive lieutenant thought while I guess I don't have to report that either\nAnd so he took it upon himself not to say anything even though he knew the ship was in there and these were all put in place\nYou know to protect our vessels during wartime but the secrecy of that and the protocols ultimately lead to her not being found\nYou know and then beyond that you know we had broken the Japanese code at this time and there were a message trafficking going across the Pacific and the Philippines the\nReporting you know various subs in the area well none of that was related to captain McVeigh because they didn't want anyone to know that the codes and been broken and that we were using that\nAnd so yeah he should not have been there without an escort he should have you know had and taking a step back Indianapolis was not you know made really for combat it was made to get to a scene or to a battle quickly and have guns\nAnd so she should have had something you know first of all that sonar and second of all that had um any calmer ability\nYou know arm or two and a former I mean she was part of the treaty cruiser so her armor was exceptionally thin compared to many of the newer shifts and so that was one of the reasons why she sang so quickly\nUh you know so all of these things kind of came together to form the perfect storm\nAnd so much of that played into the secrecy of this mission and why she was out there and why this information was it passed along to the captain who may have made different decisions knowing that there was a direct threat in its path\nTold me this was a difficult to get the the the survivors to trust you I I Know there's been so many wrong stories in wrong conclusions made about what happened there then I Would think they might still be suspicious even decades later\nWhen I think a big part of it they mention is that I had spent several years visiting with them and spending time with their families\nTalking with them that you know\nWith no other interests other than learning their story and so they I think trusted me by the time that I actually wanted to start doing interviews and\nPutting the story down on film or you know the screenplay and eventually as a book and limit as well when she came in we had this trust built in\nWith these men that they knew and genuinely wanted to tell the accurate story however hard and however long that would take we would tell the true story\nWas uh it it was amazing the uh how how widely you cast the net here um you know in creating real characters you you get to know these people a lot of the people who\nAre characters of the book obviously didn't survives you're using them together I guess from people who did know there but uh you know may be among the most interesting is ... the the guy who was commander the sub the sink the USS of\nIndianapolis a limb talk about him a little bit easier\nStereotypical Japanese commander\nThat's right one of the things that we tried to do is really pulled back the land on the Indianapolis story because really\nThe man uh before I get asked and not as it is to you know circle back to him the men who ferry the atomic bomb aboard USS Indianapolis was an army name Robert a nominee major name Robert Vernon\nAnd he had spent the last couple of years of the war running down all of the material that they feared the Germans were using to try to develop their own atomic bomb\nUh on the continent of Europe though one that missing was completely and then burn and very simple components of little boys depending an island\nUm status final breathing the editor of the year and and the conflict and so in writing the whole book we tried to pull back that land and bring in a lot of other uh characters and world leaders and figures\nIncluding the Japanese point of view in addition to hush murder we had him for here he do and tell me ... ... commander\nAnd what we tried to do was to even to recognize it even those men were enemies at the time that they were all acting out of their content and conviction and doing what\nI tell you what we observed interrupt we have to take a break into a will come back and you can talk a little bit more about ... and some of the other central characters including captain McVeigh who took the brunt of the blame we'll be right back talking about the Indianapolis tragedy you're all goes to goes down\nAnd it was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties or here in America in English\nAnd it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two but written from commend her how she motives point of view and there was a chapter on his devoted to Indianapolis\nBut because we were looking at the larger Pacific War in in the end of this of World War two in general we were able to really develop his personality alive he was a commander who cared for his men\nHe was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese submarines and\nReally against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military um he went around banging on doors asking for radar and more technology for his submarine because\nJapanese submarines didn't have read or write up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was seeing a lot of his brother says commanders go down to sell the grave for lack of technology\nWho is very caring you had a wife he had three sons um\nAnd eventually in addition to his um [noise] book which was called fun um we were also able to interview his granddaughter a and it's even more information about his later life after the war\nWhile as we'll find out a little bit later he was kinda ticked off because the U.S Navy I mean they took the extraordinary step of having him testify in court Marshall per capita McVeigh and then they didn't really want to hear his version of health things went but we'll we'll circle back around that\nI'm sure I Want to get to the moments right after these torpedoes slammed into decided the Indianapolis\nA chaos breaks out um you know we we heard that clip from Robert showing the movie jaws saying that no signal was sent a distress signal\nAre not exactly true but sort of true why don't you pick up the story there almost describe those next couple of chaotic moments after the torpedoes hit\nSure well it was just after midnight so you know the moon was behind clouds that had been an intermittent cloudy night and so and that was part of the reasons\nWhy you know I don't know if you would say it's lucky for how she motive but the clouds just part of the moon came out for just a moment enough for him to see the silhouette of the ship\nAnd so you know after it was struck given the power went out with the second torpedo and so there was no power on the ship they couldn't communicate over the first them see\nYou know the ... from the sound system and so there was no one to say abandoned ship you know over the speakers there was no one to tell people to report to battle stations\nThey had to pass that from mouth to mouth well this is a six hundred and ten foot long ship the great big ship\nSo with the chaos happening and the ship thinking and twelve minutes you have to imagine that compartments or flooding incredibly quickly you know the ship is starting to tilt first to the star bird and then it goes down by the bell\nSo men are being trapped inside the ship unable to Hispanics skate from their compartments and you know I ... and mentioned before\nThey believe about three hundred men went down with the ship and even further to this because there wasn't any direct command able to be broadcast to the men people started abandoning ship very shortly\nAnd even further to this because there wasn't any direct command able to be broadcast to the men people started abandoning ship very shortly after the ship was torpedoed all the way until you know men went down with her and were able to escape so these men were spread out for over a mile and a half\nIs what they believe and you know those who went down on or went off on the ... the low side\nThey would have been with more of the supplies you know there were only twelve raft that they believe got off the ship 'em but you know standard protocol at that time was to go off the high side the courtside well the majority of the men went off that side and there was no supplies so they weren't in rafts they were\nYou know somewhere in even in life jacket some were holding on to flotsam that they could find in the water as long as they could until they could get to someone who can help them you know fellow ship made or whomever\nAnd others had to just swim and tell a sailor would pass away and then everybody would help them take the life jacket off the dead sailor and put it on them\nI mean this was incredibly chaotic so scary these are sixteen Seventeen and Eighteen year old that had just got on the ship not some of them not even three weeks or a month earlier you know they just went on board right before the last mission\nHadn't really gone to any drills yet some didn't know how to swim and they're just thrown into the middle of the Pacific at midnight it's pitch black they're covered in fuel oil because in a you know in an effort to save the ship but the last moment\nLieutenant a red vain actually released the fuel into the water and so this is very very sick oil that can only be transferred with heat so it's like tar on these men and they can't tell who anybody is they can barely breed they're swallowing it their vomiting\nThere at this point they're trying to stay alive some have injuries and they won't last much longer I'm you know they they say that those who head injuries and didn't really make it past the first day\nBut the men who were able to escape without injuries were still suffering are from the early stages of dehydration because of vomiting this fuel oil so no one's really great shape you know by the time the sun comes up the first morning but they're very optimistic that rescue is going to come because they believe\nThere's a shift in the Philippines waiting for their arrival\nAnd and there was a you know there were attempts to get a signal out to just didn't go I guess they they they they they weren't successful exact uh\nUm I guess within a couple of days it becomes clear that they know what's coming or if they're coming there they're going to have a hard time finding a because\nAs as you describe in the book they're spread out all over the place and in these big waves are pushing the group's further and further apart right I'm Lynn maybe you want to talk about that a little bit are you in this context there is incredible acts of heroism\nThat you described from some of these the sailors who were doing their best to help everybody else and then at the same time there is some incredibly selfish acts of brutality that happen as well\nThat's right um there were incredible act of heroism and as you mentioned in as Sarah mentioned\nThe currents they move it about one mile an hour in that area and they also moving these sort of giant eddies there or world if you will\nAnd so two men that would be together in the morning could be a mile apart by afternoon and and all the time these twelve that swelled Sunday that\nIt's clear his glasses on the day in and rescue but Sunday's there these twelve ... twelve along with the current so over time over the\nClear as glass says on the day of the rescue but Sunday's there these twelve swells along with these currents so over time over the course of the the five nights and four days and then become spread out over a twenty five mile area\nAnd I'm One of the rescue pilot later wrote\nThat from altitude a rescue plain looking down on a situation like that that head of one man would be the size of a human hair scene in cross section or diameter from across the room so basically\nThey were invisible and you mentioned acts of heroism acts of cowardice one ... one real hero was I'm\nA captain park he was the commander of the Marines detachment that was aboard the ship and\nThe largest swimmer group and the water the the the as Sarah mentioned the the men in the water we're spread out initially over a mile and a half and then they just got further and further apart with those currents\nThe largest group that had nothing but life jackets was about four hundred men and captain park within that group and he really spent twenty four hours a day\nTrying to keep them in together the only resource that that group of men had besides their life jackets which not even all of them had life jackets was a single line that was about a hundred feet long and so they form that line into a circle and the men were to tie themselves to the line\nAnd captain park would uh\nHelp the men that didn't have life jackets and several times he would get a life jacket from a dead sailor and then give it to another man who needed a life jacket and he did this numerous times and he would round up the stragglers and encourage everybody until

... evening twilight or just before the ship was sunk that the standing orders of the military put that in his purview that was at his discretion and he chose to exercise that discretion\nUm and then when commander ... testified at the trial he said that he would have something to say whether he had been ... or not and then it didn't make a difference\nBut he was testifying and Japanese through a translator\nAnd the translator did not translate exactly what he said uh correctly\nAnd commander ... could understand enough English to know that but not enough to really repair the damage\nAnd also he was you know in this very intimidating environment\nAnd so I don't think it was really can conducive for him to sit there and argue either but I'm In later interviews Sarah found out from his granddaughter that that was something he always regretted was that um he had been translated incorrectly and that had and that had in part had been captain McVey\nYeah he was angry years later zero right at the with the retiring of the USS Indianapolis the submarine the namesake ship many years later a there was an attempt to get him to open up and share the story and he wanted nothing to do with it\nExactly you know they're a commander built or I'm Sorry captain bill Tony who was the commanding officer of the Indianapolis namesake submarine when she was a he commissioned\nBill went over and tried to talk to ... and he said they didn't believe me then they won't believe me now and he wanted nothing to do was talking with him you know but he did what I was actually pretty incredible as he actually wrote a letter you know kind of flashing forward a few years to the exoneration effort\n... wrote a letter explaining his side of the story and saying that the captain should never have been found guilty and you know kind of did what he could do in order to help exonerate this man\nYou tell the story in the book about a Nineteen sixty reunion for the survivors\nAnd kept the McVeigh shows up and he's not exactly sure how he's going to be received by by the crew because you know he was court martialed um he received as you noted the book these terrible letters from a family you didn't feel he'd been punished enough\nAnd um you know I'm\nGuilt tripping him for years afterward\nYou didn't feel you'd been punished enough and um you know I'm really tripping over years afterward so he shows up at this Nineteen sixty event and how was he received or when\nHe was received with open arms he have very much dreaded going to this reunion in Nineteen sixty he hadn't seen these men [noise] except for just a couple of them but most of these men he had not seen since Nineteen forty five right after the court marshal\nSo they decide to have a reunion and they have their reunion in the ships named safe city Indianapolis, Indiana\nAnd captain McVeigh was dreading it but when he got there they actually um travelled out a dozens and dozens of survivors and their wives met him at the airport and they formed\nTo receiving lines are across the tarmac because they didn't have debt ways the way we do now they would they would just they were deep plane right onto the ramp and so they formed two lines and when captain McVeigh got to the bottom of the aircraft loading stairs\nSomeone shouted attention on deck and everybody's snap to attention and then they began to cheer and the crab and and ... came to his eyes and he he couldn't believe that they were receiving him so warmly and that continued through the entire reunion weekend\nSarah talk a little bit about difficulty in getting materials you talked about going through archives and records a share with me you did you run into road blocks that you could not get past that and if so what were they\n[noise] I actually one of the the documents that really helped us pay the biggest picture was the quarter of inquiry documents and\nYou know I had tried for years Lynn had you know come into the picture and joined me in this effort to get a copy of this document and the reason it was so important was that it was really the first recorded testimony of any of the survivors right after the sinking\nSo you know just days after their rescued there in the hospital in Guam and their testimonies are taken and so\nWe tried everything to get these documents and this actually this specific report and we would come back you know oh it's last forever oh one you know we got one copy of it and it was entirely redacted and you know freedom of freedom of Information Act\nShould've allowed us to have this and then you know we contacted the the source again and our contacts said well we don't have an an redacted version doesn't exist and so interestingly enough\nYou know a friend or actually a a young man who became a friend was the grandson of the rescue pilot who landed in the water and same fifty three men\nHis with his grandson was actually um I'm an inspector general started trying to remember is titled he's inspector general works with the navy and he was actually the person who got us this document\nAnd this kind of showed us really\nTestimonies of what happened not only when the ship was torpedoed and those final moments but what was happening in the water because\nIn the court marshal they did not allow any of the testimony is about what took place in the actual water because they didn't you know that would impact how McVeigh was viewed and so it was just kept strictly to what took place when the ship was torpedoed\nAnd the events leading up to that so this new quarter of inquiry document was so important because you know Seventy years later stories can change your stories can be impacted by other stories but this was the purest form of what\nBecause you know Seventy years later stories can change your stories can be impacted by other stories but this was the purest form of what really took place that only when the ship saying but in the water for those five nights for days\nLynn did you talk about the the wife immediately after they were rescued what it was like for the survivors where they were taken um I I Would assume more of them died after because of their injuries and exposure\nWell a few did die and and if you can imagine how awful that was not only for the men themselves for their families to know that they had actually made it all the way to rescue\nOnly to die of their exposure and their injuries um\nSo I think three hundred and twenty were actually rescued is that correct Sara yes three hundred and twenty were rescued but only three hundred and sixteen ultimately survive so they were taken to\nFace hospitals around the Philippines see eventually converging on Guam where they had um some time to recover before they had to give their testimony\nAnd then they went aboard the USS how ... how ... which was an escort carrier and they actually landed in our home city of San Diego where they were\nI actually participated in a parade and then a very quickly they went home a\nCop buses and trains back to their hometowns some of them ... got out of the navy some of them had survivors leave and then got out of them stayed and made careers of the navy [noise]\nUm and you know this was the greatest generation so the vast majority of them and they just kind of put this behind then they went on to have careers as engineers and fishermen and everything you can think of police officers\nBut there were those who could not hold a job and there were those who became alcoholic\nAnd um had many many struggles and almost to a man\nNone of them talked about it and not even to their families and they held it in for years and years and years and um some for sixty years um but mostly they didn't talk about that today that would be a lot different I think people would be\nOut trying to get a book deal or a movie deal or something like that that these men were different\nI think about that though Robert show a character in jaws you know you got that story bottled up he becomes a short cut her as a result of being one of those guys and I'm\nA very moving scene and that was great I was going to use that clip anyway I was really glad to see the coverage in in the book a zero did you always have in mind keeping that in there\n[noise] [noise] well yeah it's really you know when let them have gone across the country talking to groups about the story in this book\nYou know one of the things that really comes out every time is that most people learned about this story from ... so it's an essential part of the stories history\nIs that you know the public learned about it this way and interestingly enough some of the children of the survivors actually first heard about it and that their father was involved in it by watching jobs you know they came home\nSeveral accounts came home saw the movie were really impacted by it and especially this scene but\nOnly to find out their dad was on the ship the scene is about well so you know it's pretty incredible the men didn't talk about it that long but then to find out this way but that's you know how your dad served in World War two so\n\n[noise]\nSarah share with me your thoughts are when you heard the news I think it was last year that the ah Indianapolis had been found uh there there's a mission funded by Paul Allen\nActually it was about four in the morning when I received a phone call from bill Tony who was the gentleman I mentioned earlier the commander of Indianapolis\nAnd you know bill was contacted by the navy and he called me and there they found the ship and I didn't know what he was talking about it for them [laughter] [laughter]\nAnd so you know dating my faculty and you realize what was going on very quickly and was astonished I mean this was something that several people before\nThe petrol group which has the vessel that recently responsible for finding the ship and there have been several attempts than they were the first one to be successful\nAnd what was interesting about it they said you have three hours before we release this information to the press so go ahead and call the survivors so villain I spent the next\nThree hours a calling\nInformation to the press so go ahead and call the survivors so bill and I spent the next three hours of calling the survivors up and being able to share with them the news that their shift had been found and so that was a pretty incredible experience to hear their take on all of it\nWhat's the reaction in general\nIt was really I mean it was very somber was most of them couldn't believe it actually happened in that it happened in their lifetime or what [laughter]\nMostly reverence and then there was a young man by the name of a fan Lopez he was a sale and Indianapolis in the day the ship sank hit a really good day playing dice with his buddies\nAnd so he wanted to know if they would go down and find his money suck that off winnings [laughter]\nYou know across the board it was general you know respect and reverence for the story but you know there was a ... a couple of funny quotes here and there from the guys that you know they're always sailors that hurt [noise] an\nInland you know we've heard a little bit about road blocks put up to the information they uh you know were they were not entirely helpful at every step of the way to get the story told what about reaction to the book since it's come out from the navy oh boy\nWe've been very very gratified by the reaction there is um an admiral named Hancock who is the director of naval history and heritage command\nAnd we made contact with admiral ... at the survivors reunion and I believe it was funny Fifteen or twenty sixteen\nAnd we can while through we'd really like to have your support and your health on this\nAnd um he was helpful and directing as various resources but if you can imagine sending this real work at the heart that you've done to try to honor these men and honor the legacy and how the whole story of the ship and and gave the entire history\nAnd draw new analysis about various things that happen in the story if you can imagine taking that and then sending it to the director of naval history and heritage and saying hey sir hey admiral what do you think\nOh boy we were we nervous about that that he really really has endorsed the story and I went to his full court since he saw what his what we came up with\nWell I Know Sarah has an award winning documentary film about it sure seems like it would make a great movie I'm hopeful big screen movie any thoughts about that\nWe are actually working on that right now so stay tuned okay we'll\nTake a couple of calls I've got some other questions about the west of the Rockies Jerry in ... California as a personal connection to the story I during\n... where are you doing my father was a on the ship that was the first one or the ... to rescue the shooters in the water and I still have one car being used and she was discharged from so you know\nAnd I never saw him I ... ... years past ... years ago but I never saw him cry and do you try to talk about that story\nThat's amazing what he uh with key on the USS that peace will take the oil or the ... that you know the name of the ship that the man\nWho ... you know I don't remember it's on it's on it's been stone in\nOur will you speaking about that before I call ... ... yeah what was the name of the ship but to me she was the first one who man and he was talking to you it was horrific you know he tried to tell the story a little bit and my father never talked about in the about\nThe chip all but you know all those years\nSo where are you a little bit and my father never talk about in the about ... chip all that and all those years you know\nHe was light up you know just missed part of the ethos of that generation that those\nOh yeah yeah he was in World War two and Korea or he was a gun or drink dinners made for each class you know but he ... he was a police officer who's officer for Thirty years well there's this incredible story and I absolutely\nHeroic to go into harm's way like that and um if he was aboard the Basset one interesting story is that they can adding officer of the bat that\nWas considered to be a coward by some of his men and indeed when they arrived on the same if it didn't really know what he was getting into and ah\nHe knew that that had been found probably by submarine but they didn't know what exactly had happened\nAnd there was um a sailor has added a large shark and the water and he said look at that fish well fish is another word for it torpedo and so the cat in ...\nHe tried to get everybody out of there he said he said I'm all ahead full we're going to get outta here we're going to leave the scene\nAnd his officers actually need need and lock the captain in his state room and continued with Iraq you have to be interesting if your dad was had been on that ship\nThanks Jerry appreciated wildcard line Ron and used in the morning on good\nMorning ah my father was also in the navy and he was on a destroyer escort Cecil jade de oil he was twenty six years old he was the end soon doctor\nAnd what's interesting over forty years I had opened up one of his uh I guess his seat just you know of all of his memoirs\nAnd I found unbelievable and eye witness accounts a letter of the eye witness accounts from the doctor's point of view of the rescue of the survivors\nI've got the letter in front of me it's stated August fifth Sunday at sea\nAnd it's a phenomenal letter I think the uh women would love to see this to read this it talks about the sharks\nIt talks about the fact that the polls these guys up tick in the sharks author rear end showing 'em up with the with a line given a morphine given him penicillin this is an unbelievable letter from the of view of the doctor and it was my dad\nAnd he has been that some of the reunions but never did talk about this but the fact that I found this letter it's about five six pages of the whole account its its history its historical\nI Love my fair share this with a young ladies if I can get of getting information and I'll\nI'll tell you what Ron why don't you hold on and Donna O R R gal there will get the information for yeah we'll pass it on to win and Sarah and a thank you for calling appreciate you sharing that I I'd like to see that myself thank you so how many how many of the survivors are still with us or Sarah\nThere's fourteen still living\nClass I don't assume that they still have a gatherings do they\nActually you know um we've gone to several events all over the country with them and they they do have reunions every July and Indianapolis I'm about five or six I think six came this year\nThem and they they do have reunions every July and Indianapolis I'm\nAbout five or six I think six came this year and it is dwindling but you know we'll have an event on the USS Hornet on Veterans Day and two of the survivors will be there for that so you know the the youngest is Ninety One but\nThey're still sailors that heart and I think think an arm wrestle man when [laughter]\nYou know it's a generational thing well we're we're hearing these descriptions both from the two of you and from the callers about um how\nHow these men reacted to it keeping bottled up inside you're right it would be different now people would be out there on Dr phil or or getting a book deal or something but keeping it inside I don't know if it's entirely healthy but it certainly has changed when you agree\nYes absolutely and I I Do wonder whether maybe presence somewhat healthier I I don't know I think ah I think that generation may have been a lot more stable than we are now but uh\nIt is an interesting contrast isn't it um and I think it has to do with the the um profusion of the media that we have today and he believed to share everything instantly all the time and that

research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the hoop of police that a police background I approached them and they said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me\nI'm not gonna I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth and every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and they'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders and this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys with introduced me and they say hey\nYou can trust this guy ah he's a friend he's credible and that's the way it got started and uh after I heard maybe ten or Fifteen of these stories from ultra credible people in and out of the tribe\nA one was a store manager that ran this big story in Hooper that live miles away who saw one coming into town I started to think about my police days and I used to work with a forensic artist that was just phenomenal and he would sit down with a witness be able to draw the sketch from just the witness statements\nAnd the results were amazing but I wanted something that a slightly different so I could a line this person with a tribal setting in Native Americans and I found a diamond unbelievable look\nAn individual name Harvey ... who was assistant director of the Oklahoma bureau of investigation and the chief forensic artist FBI trained\nFor the state of Oklahoma and Harvey is not only a world famous artists tease outstanding law enforcement person\nAnd a Harvey and I met in right away we just quick like brothers and when Harvey\nWould sit down with say a witness to a robbery and draw the sketch a suspect and the suspect was later caught I Swear to you it is like the suspect was in the room and Harvey due the sketch the suspect that is how accurate this man has\nAnd so when I brought him in to the Native American tribes the media\nIs this ... Native American chief it's got a law enforcement background so we can kind of smell when it happens\nAnd I have done this for a long time now together and we're best friends we did two books that Hooper project and then we did a follow up book called tribal big foot where he went outside of hoop and draw sketches of what other people saw again took statements under penalty of perjury\nAnd a kind of how it started\nA you say you don't have a dog in the fight meaning you're not committed to one position or another because there are several different camps in the big world right\nOh bingo uh but I started the most vocal the most audacious\nThe most vulgar [laughter] are probably the people who believe it's an eight and they will run you over the world demean you they will do anything to push that cause\nBut since they were the most outspoken I thought well this must be true and I kinda went down that path thinking well it must be an aid must be some kind of a background\nBut I still kept that open mind in when we the first day that we sat down with the people in and around hoop and drew the sketches\nHarvey myself in Harvey wife Gina proud also an agent for in Oklahoma we were set in stone disbelief because the sketches or very human like\nYeah they were huge yacht I had hair all over the body that there was a human quality that you just couldn't miss and they didn't look like apes they didn't have that eight characteristics that you would think of in a face in a chest et cetera\nAnd it was just shocking and when the witnesses saw the sketches to a lady and to a man they would consistently say Harvey you nailed it that if he Shockley what you look like and when you talk about the old there's they would consistently say\nThis is another tribal people is on animals is there are people\nThey had a sort of developed a relationship with him at least they coexist in St right\n[noise] yeah it in the tribal area I met the one of the managers presidents chairman of the tribe\nA and they said so that they looked at a map and they said so this is their area we don't go in there and this is your area this is our area and if they can come into our area and they do regularly and that's why we see I'm\nThe one thing about the hoop areas the trinity river like great salmon and steal head area\nA has just so much wildlife and if you drive through hoop uh from willow creek\nYou'll notice that there are more Barry bushes on the roadways and the surrounding mountains and I've ever seen anywhere in the world and there's this association with berries and ... over the years that if you pay attention and you do the research something about that and I I\nI Know that they're seeing eating at a lot but it's just an odd coincidence\nYou uh I don't want to get too deep into the woods I'm literally and figuratively but you can you summarize as a law man as a former law man at the state of the evidence about this whether you'd say there is that there is there's diminishing evidence that something is real here or that we just haven't quite figured out\nSo several years of walking down that path I knew that DNA is the real answer to any solution of animal life for human life and there were a series of people that I met on this journey that were absolutely\nMany of them didn't want to talk about it many of them didn't want to be visible about it but all of them said you were in on this let's let's get the DNA\nAnd George I gotta thank you for that to many years ago you brought on and at my request a ah a PHD name never catch them\nDr catch him was one of the few people in the world that was willing to go into the lab and DNA test hairs tissue blood et cetera that we'd bring in\nAnd on your show we said hey we need other samples from throughout North America the test to kind of get a cross section of what we're dealing with\nAnd that led to a hundred and ten samples being submitted a many more than ... were hair and with the hair you need the follicle to get the mitochondrial DNA\nAnd then other people came forward with a tissue samples blood saliva and all of this noble work through incredibly well ah to figure out the solution and the chemical way to extract and read this DNA\nAnd the amazing part was is that we got nuclear DNA and what the showed was that the wife had went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the females side\nTo the ... Arab region to ah Jerusalem to\nA Jordan ended that part of the world and this was when I was sent to a gym bag and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in this\nAnd unbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation\nAnd they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her white a white paper about this\nAnd during that process of getting the DNA extracting the DNA one of the places that they used was Louisiana crime lab completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this the samples could've been compromised yet as the paper was written up before I get there\nSo they write as they are in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't do this but you and I work together to introduce smelled with two of very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explained to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this [noise]\nShe listen to some of this but she didn't listen to all of that and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in the white paper in a white paper but if you ... all of those feelings and thoughts\nAnd you stick strictly with the science which people don't in Ninety nine percent of the people have never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit\nWith a scientist who reads that science behind the paper they know that\nThose hundred and ten samples sell us tell a story that phenomenal\n[noise] well that's the part that I don't think a lot of people understand it a this was in some half ale treatment it was it was the best of the best the DNA was sent to for certified lab so to ensure that there was no mistake\nAll of the labs got the same results\nOr was analyzed by a series of people it was [noise]\nIt went through so many hurdles it was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you can see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA has come back as bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that they'll but did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nIs that when the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to be in a way to ensure that they came back as big foot her\nNow people are saying going to say well how do you know let's pick for their well big foot hair looks different than any other mammal here in the world and I could teach anybody in five minutes to look at a big foot her and tell the physical difference under a microscope between that and other hairs\nHair and fiber experts have a graph of all the different mammal hairs in North America\nAnd when you look at a big but here it's an entirely different\nSo if it if the hair didn't jump through that hurdle and never went on to DNA\nBut if you pay attention to all of these DNA expert or not using their hair and fiber expert even work at an insurer that what they're dealing with is the real deal [noise]\nSo and I don't think some of these so called DNA experts have figured out the formula\nThe deal [noise] so and I don't think some of these so called DNA experts have figured out the formula that Melba did to extract this DNA and to get the results and there's a lotta a lotta attitude in this arena as you know George\nAnd it's unfortunate that people won't put down their defenses and all work together and it almost seems at times that there's something else behind the scenes that's ensuring that they don't want to get those results\nWell it's kinda like the UFO world I mean people are very passionate but they're also very conscious and you have a certain element of people who takes their take their passion to different levels\nUm to the point of origin let 'em material um and ah\nWill stab people in the back and will sabotage others uh the DNA evidence\n... at a minimum um\nPeople were able to dismiss it because it has elements of humans in it right so they'd say well it's humid but it's not all you\nKnow and that's that's the part but as I can say is it looks like it's a hybrid human um it's unusual\nBut it's it's way far down that humans spectrum I'm I I think the most unusual part that everyone was stunned about was that\nThe nuclear DNA couldn't come back with the human match on gender thing and when you look at that you've got to think well that means number one that Gen bank has never had a sample in the world submitted other than ours\nAnd how could that be um we we used we we sat down as a group many times and tried to be smart about how we got this DNA and luckily on a couple of occasions\nA farmer had some pipes break an irrigation pipe and it was kind of surmise that say a six foot section\nOf pipe was purposely broken on on each and six feet apart because it appeared that big foot with trying to get some kind of animal that within the pipe some kinda rodent or something\nAnd when he broke the PVC pipe and bled on it well we got the DNA off that\nOther times it licked game camera we got that and there were there was a tissue sample we got that and then over a hundred hair samples that had a follicle that all match this big foot look when you view it under a microscope\nNow Ninety nine point nine percent of the time when I get approached about this that people haven't read the study they've read a newspaper article or someone's opinion and they believe it\nAnd they refused to get into the minutia of the data and read the report because it's available online and see that the hurdles that we went through to make sure that this was true an accurate I give all the credit ... she's a genius scientists that figure this out\nUm it's unfortunate\nYeah then it got down to a thrown under the under the bus as she did as well um you you said that the this this was not engine bank is it now or did they toss it out\nThey wouldn't take it\n...\nLet's go to your book big wild man and giants I mean a lotta times you know these descriptions and there's some amazing working here there's some really a tremendous writing in some of these old articles a from a long time ago but um and some of them are pretty hilarious in in reading it often makes\nAmen does writing in some of these old articles a from a long time ago but um and some of them are pretty hilarious in in reading and often making fun of the witnesses as well\nBut these things are the three different categories you have in the title they're all sort of blended together although there are some very important distinctions between the the three and they go way way back sixteen eighty\nHow did you how did you find all these\nSo ... again it was just me searching for old cases I'm missing people that seemed emit that fit that profile but we were looking for\nBut then when I had this giant stack of articles kind of the breakdown of of the way the articles were worded is two hundred and two of the articles used wild man as a description twenty four years eight gorilla monkey Ninety eight used giants and forty use something else\nNow the articles the way they broke down on geographical is a hundred and fifty eight we're in the U. S. sixteen in Canada three in Hungary three in the Himalayas er Nepal and three in the u._k. there were others but those were the bulk of him\nAnd then the states with the most articles about it a whirl Ohio with Twenty one Pennsylvania Thirteen California eleven Indiana all live in\nNew York nine Georgia nine Kentucky in Texas six [noise]\nAnd then the numbers keep going down from there but again it was I was looking for these and\nThey weren't associated with a missing persons articles they just would have visibility on a front page along with a new article and the missing\nBut I started to pay attention and I got to get some credit to a guy named Tom Powell out of Oregon Tom's a brilliant guy good researcher and he started to make the connection between giants in Bigfoot\nAnd one of the funniest things he did in his presentations his genius is a lot of people say oh you know a few overlay this map with the maps of the foot wild man disappearances there all the same\nAnd he puts up a map of like Bigfoot the uh appearances and UFO appearances and\nThen he does some where all the you know the amount of rain in certain areas associated and\nAnd he goes out like six maps and then he puts up on that but he doesn't say anything because you know what this Napa because this is a map of all the Wal Mart stores in the U.S can you see how they are kind of associated the same locations as the big fight [laughter] and but it was his\nStatement about giants that were found in past centuries\nIn mountains and in a excavations that really kind of got me thinking or these giants the big for that were buried or were they something else and how come they're more there aren't more giants that we can go see it museums and things where are they\nYeah I've asked that question I'm really interested in the subject in part because there are some of those stories you're in Nevada you know the ... century shown to you have legends and stories about a big foot bones or a giant bones that were stashed in that came up in northern Nevada and are you ask what happened to the bones and nobody can seem to find\nA lot of these articles pointed to um some universities would get them into the more likely candidate where all these went and it fit in the articles was the Smithsonian yet nobody can go back and find them now and the Smithsonian claims they don't have them\nYou look back and some of the descriptions there's one early in your book is from the Marilyn ... June twenty seven Seventeen Ninety three describing an account or a witness sees this on the cell for cover rubber an animal ...\nTwenty seven Seventeen Ninety three\nDescribing an account or a witness sees this on a cell phone number rubber an animal between twelve and Fifteen feet high it's a sheep resembling a human except the head with it which is an equal proportion to the body the feet are two feet long and Harry uh that sounds like our guy doesn't\nMean the descriptions semi modern descriptions of big\nSo when I found these these articles from the Seventeen hundreds I I was stunned because nobody talks about it\nBut when you like one of the quotes in that article says this animal is between Trump and Fifteen feet high and in shape resembling a human being except the head which is like you said an equal proportion to the body\nAnd so I'm thinking wow they were writing about this way back when and nobody nowadays is ever brought this stuff up\nOnly getting easier even quite saying to you every month you can log into your site and seeing that check whatever you want with ... hair is out at the south and they can prove that I'm here locally in the magic ... but the reason that expertise having nationwide\nSo she harnessed her passion and now she's a cyber security I start in the military\nIf you had a passion and vision for your future field today's military dot com can be your path feeling courier you have a calling we have an answer find your way up today's military dot com [noise] news\nAnd talk on the radio dishes news radio Thirteen say hey I like swimming fall Idaho really us\nPull out of a nuclear weapons treaty President Reagan's side with the Soviets I'm Dave Anthony Fox News President Trump intends do and national security adviser John Bolton is in Moscow for two days of talks Fox assignment on monitoring live from London\nDave jump boats and they said was already in the diary but the tension has been ratcheted up by President Trump's weekend announcement that the United states will withdraw from the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty landmark agreement from the Cold War era\nUnder which the U.S and the Soviet Union agreed to limit so narrow snows of nuclear missiles the Russian foreign minister\nDue to meet with both in today says Russia once an explanation President Trump says Russia has been violating the deal so yes a claim the Kremlin denies day for\nSome of the missing Saudi journalist presumed dead was murdered Saudi Arabia's foreign minister acknowledged that to Fox News\nWe are determined to uncover every stone we are determined to find out all the facts and where to turn on the show so I was I was for\nThe murder of ... a barrel so calls it a mistake made by a rogue operation\nThe vigil consistent just outside of this so he he\nAlso call though acceptable they tried to cover up which I'm all ... killing the Saudis now say he was killed in a fist fight us lawmakers in both parties are skeptical democratic Congressman Adam Schiff\nTold ABC's This week it was hard for me to imagine that ah these orders would have been carried out without the knowledge of the crowd prince\nTurkey's president says he'll reveal details of his country's investigation tomorrow visuals Arab said they ever recordings of his jokey being tortured and killed a caravan of Central American migrants President Trump blames on Democrats and says won't be allowed into the U.S keeps me moving through Mexico boxers grip Jenkins at the border in McAllen, Texas set\nCaravan obviously reforming into some seven thousand strong and making their way north officials here certainly worrying about that keep it a very close eye on that this is Fox News [noise]\n\nBusiness iris ... had written a cannery enrich site in the heart because now more than ever ... our voices from anything you've heard\nAnd then you'd done right\nBy making dot com and sign up\nThe Fox news rundown dives deep into the major and controversial stories of the day hosted by the anchors of Fox News radio subscribe now to your perspective of news you won't find anywhere else in going to ... get a job\nBecause there's so much marketing and noise and yelling at our role is to take three steps back and just strong what really matters and handed me the most important thing that we do we are looking out for the ... men and women in this country luring them\nThey're going to get a straight shooter no holds barred I'm not going to cut people flash Fox is the one place for this and allow\nWe have voices we won't be silent controls my voice\nOn the news channel real news real honest opinion\n[noise] should protesters pay for their protests reimbursing local officials for security and other costs so that's something the national park services considering among other possible changes in Washington D.

they said they started looking like him are apes and animals and\nAs you know Georgia's a segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and I don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over loaded on testosterone\nBut they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them but it's not going to happen\nThere are some are reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on a ship or they've got him in jail and they invariably or he gets away or the evidence disappears however\n[noise] yeah and uh probably the one case in you know about it the Minnesota Wild man that has a lot of injury to it because I've seen pictures of it and I've seen descriptions of it and it is unusual and nobody quite knows what happens to it\nBut a lot of people just cuckoo it fail you know was that was a fake meant for the circus but the more you dig into that one there was something strange with that\nWell I find myself rooting for the wild man or whatever it is to get away and all these cases so I'm Glad it ends up that way you know you look at where are these reports come from there from major these are major newspapers too I mean the Boston Globe and the San Francisco newspaper LA Times ah\nAnd they and it's some great writing some of these descriptions is just terrific writing it it's somebody wasn't just phone and get in or when they were working on this story\nAnd the fact that they come from places like Indiana and Iowa and Kansas\nA that's not where we associate big foot sightings modern sightings at all is trying to think of why would Ohio in Pennsylvania will be so prominent in the numbers and it's because\nI mean that was a center of American civilization and is Seventeen hundreds or so Seventeen eighties where the bigger cities where it wasn't exactly the frontier because there are people out here as well but\nUh that's where the bulk of the population probably lived at the time\nOr exactly and it's a a it's an interesting phenomenon when you start to work at the fighting locations in conjunction to the giants sightings\nAnd skeletons and then if you go back in history and you think about exactly what you said where did we first established civilization and cities that as we move west where were these locations but then even though we're thing to me is Ohio has a lot of these sightings\nWell that's Bruce Maccabee with Ohio is a friend and I I went to spend four or five days within earlier this year and the strange things that he's told me that have happened in Ohio in the air and on the ground it's really strange\nBruce Mac can be a is welcome here anytime\nIn the air and on the ground it's really strange\n[laughter] ... can be a is welcome here anytime he is a fascinating guy are both in person and on the air and in his books ah you know it was kind of surprising just CD early reports from Hungary I'd never heard of Hungarian big butter sasquatch reports until reading this book of yours\nWide and I'd never heard of him either and a\nAgain a surprising surprising fact that they're right about it from there and then in the ... they there's an article from there about siting ... when you look at the descriptions that they're offering almost identical to what they're seeing here in the U.S at the same time period or thereabouts\nAnd then when you think about present day sightings again from on almost every continent in the world which is unusual\nUm you know some of the uh descriptions obviously I you have to take him in a cultural contacts now I don't remember when the jungle book was written but Mobley the character Mobley um\nYou know he's described that description is used in a couple of the newspaper clippings from that era that that you've collected here\nCorrect and er I people always telling me well what about the star wars creature that looks like big foot I mean that's kinda strange\nThan it was inspired by maybe yeah I don't know it's it's it's a similarity\nUm some of the descriptions I I I Would have to leave their way here to find one but it seems like the witnesses are saying that the wild men have clothes or items of clothing or just a ... kind of thing which suggests to me maybe they were humans may be read they really were literally wild men out there\n[noise] and usually and occasionally even nowadays you hear about it for wearing clothing\nAnd kind of goes on explainable because why would they do that but you know maybe it's some association maybe they're trying to break a barrier or if they're seen\nMaybe they think they'll be accepted more if they're seen maybe people won't be so scared you know we could all through in our conjecture about why that may be happening but it happens too often for people to be fabricating it I I hear it occasionally but not very often\nUm if you were to communicate with the tribe these days a ... a modern tribe that would still perhaps be in contact other than the hope is is are there any other tribes you would say people that have a relationship one going with or whatever these things are\nI Would say it's almost every one I mean there's there's famous stories out of Arizona New Mexico and the high plains out there where\nUh they have these and there's many times an association between and this is where they put people start their head start spinning that fact\nWhere there's this association between victory in UFOs even in the hoop a book I wrote that many of the tribal people said that they saw a UFO and coast time and space to the point where they saw big foot and they regularly saw UFOs on many of the tribal grounds\nAnd when you talk to these tribal members The Elders they believe they came from the stars and they're they're not once they have your trust they will tell you hey\nYou know there's this association between us and them and they're different kind of try and different kinds of people but they came from the same place we did\nAnd when you start to go back and you look at the history of the ...\nBut will tell you we've had visitations for hundreds and hundreds of years going back in time and almost all of them believe that they came from the stars\nWell there are an awful lot of associations between these creatures being cited in in proximity to UFOs and it makes everyone comfortable the big put people to die hards don't like it\nThe UFO diehards like it even less or they they're not comfortable with that at all\nBut you have to follow it where it leads and you know I I don't have a conviction on it either I don't know what these things are I don't know what you are those are where they're from\nBut um there was enough cases are over the centuries and a lot more of them now thanks to this new book you can ignore it I I thought the interest there was a couple of stories hoping ... where are there are reputable witnesses who say they saw these creatures are engaging with cow's milking cows\nSo this is the part that really really unusual several years ago one of my best friends their parents on a dairy farm\nAnd I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that they may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know let me go talk to my parents\nSo they own a huge cheer for anyone out there and talk to them in this oh I think he's eighty years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know every once in awhile Mike how will come back from nowhere completely though\nHe goes I don't understand it [laughter] then\nThe same man told him he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property something tells me don't turn around get back on the horse or get back on my a TV and leave and he does\nAnd then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property I don't know how it got there saw\nDogs [laughter] I I think when you get the trust of some of these dairy farmers way out in the middle they're going to tell you the same thing because I've heard many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big foot milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and different kinds of fruits\nUm do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take dear to their an omnivore\nAnd many times when the natives are in the middle of the woods hunting themselves\nThey'll come across a deer that stuck up in a tree and like a two hundred and fifty pound here a native ... could have done it and they don't know how it got way up in the trees and it's a tornado or hurricane zone so how did it get their\nTo everything about the missing persons like it is one of the most unsettling thing that I've heard in a long time so good on your finding 'em I wanted to talk about the big thing I actually think you're I really love\nHow you're saying how it's related wild man I'm I feel like phones are also as the way that we could find out more about wild men because there are Amazonian tribe that were just discovered like for the first time with your own and I feel like your ideas revolutionary and I feel like with them and I\nHadn't years will definitely have an answer because it's wrong and my question to you as you feel like you're going to use drones in your research at all\nSo drones are an interesting topic but uh there was actually some a PHD level people that thought the drones are going to be good for finding that for that that was a complete bomb\nSo a drones are never going to work for a big topic the missing people topic they have used drones before on missing people a housing work real well and you can't use a drone in a national park it's against the wall and there's a huge fine so probably won't happen\nThat George Bush is going to the next call I had a question for you and maybe you should kind of touch on it for the people here your work on skin walk a ranch the researchers there saw something very similar to a big foot can you tell us about that\nAre actually multiple times ah it's more of the tribe that that encounters them they've seen them there as long as they lived there there was a very dramatic instance I've got the transcripts of the interviews with the officers\nAnd we went to the spot where it happened but the the dogs there were police officers are patrolling tribal browns they have a gift shop that's just off the highway there on the reservation and\nUh the dogs alerted the officers to this huge thing that was a just outside the window and as soon as the dog's made a noise and the this thing looked at the officers and shown a light on it it took off running\nAnd it went all the way through the community and\nAs soon as the dog's made a noise and the this thing looked at the officers and showing a light on it it took off running\nAnd it went all the way through the community and you can hear it it ... I mean it was just taking these giant stride it knocked over garbage cans you had alarms going off then\nThe police officers chased that ah I think they they found some tracks it led to a there's a reservoir there this just on the other side of skin Walker ranch and that's where they lost that it just kind of sort of disappeared\nOr they are seen similar creatures on the ranch itself I'm I shouldn't call it big but it's more like humanoid and there's one particular instance that we've described on the program before where\nThese two scientists and to other people who were observers up on skin Walker rigid seen\nWhat looked like a dirty snowball of light that ah that was floating just off the\nOff the ground in the middle homes that they are on the ranch in it ... through infrared you can see the the ball of light started stretching into what looked like a tunnel\nAnd through this tunnel this creature started crawling they could see it it can you guys these guys were really excited seeing this thing is coming from somewhere else in this tunnel of light ... through struggling to get through this skinny little opening it pulls itself out\nAt the er at the entrance to this uh this tunnel\nStands up it's eight feet tall I'm feature lists dark humanoid shaped like ahead with no neck on a on a body it's just stands up and then starts moving up towards getting Walker ridge where these guys are watching it and they can tell ya they got the hell out of there they were pretty scared about the whole thing but\nUh there have been multiple sightings of that by humans by um scientists by dogs uh uh the the tribe has the best a handle on it and um\nI've seen it all over the you went to base and so yeah it's pretty common in that area and and of course it's in proximity to a lot\nOf other really strange stuff so you have to ask the question about what is the association between these creatures are that are described in many different ways and a lot of other very unusual phenomena and we don't know\nUm west of the Rockies Kyle\nIn Utah I Kyle welcome to the program how you doing All right so in your mind\nSo [noise] so I had um you're talking about David Was talking about Joseph ... Smith the one who taught the Cain on his saddle um he thought they put\nIt happened in Eighteen [noise] a five star Eighteen thirty five he was on his way to another ... logo cross white and he was an awful lot of time that the prophet\nAnd he ... he ran into Cain and ah he described Cain as a as a tall a figure that was taller than a shadow\nAnd ah adjusted to the fifth talked a cane and the heat and Katie introduced it still is that I Am a man I'm personally wander here and there and I might go will basically he she wanted to make men misery or that destroyed their souls that you brought that up I just thought\nThe Mormon culture LVS coach or that we have you know there's two story really famous that story than just killing Smith too is Joseph is left you\nKnow his brother had an encounter Leslie Smith in Hawaii at the dedication and that then lay Hawaii temple of ... in Nineteen Twenty one uh came came to read the doors of the temple and I'm In his hand [noise] uh\nUh Wesley Smith said that he that was the priest to cast came out and so he Rose's hand and they just crashed a cash yeah king Ron it's interesting you say that we can and our church\nYeah and so he was his hand and they just kind of cash yeah king wrong and so it's interesting you say that because in our church you know like some people who are skeptical I ate it kind of hush hush let's talk about it but\nAs people continue to go on you know um there are more shut it but I just wanted for David like with the disappearance is because I've been reading a book for a little while and stuff\nI Do think it's it's a big ... when he does he have any idea what's going on is like people are asking me you know like people do need to kind of have an interest in a little bit of this stuff\nWell let me tell you Kyle and everyone listening here tonight is probably the the weirdo expert in their family and then there are ... social circle a you and uh and everyone listening is likely they go to person in their own circles for information about these kind of topics\nThey are to begin with the Joseph Smith story is that a is that likely a big foot type encounter or is that something else\nWill the description that the Smith gave was would match up for it but then there's there's people who are researching this topic who believe that the ... may be some night some type of the film from the Bible and when you read that there is some association there that makes some sense\nA Scott Carpenter another researcher in the world has written a book about this it's compelling and there's there's some strong evidence\nThat he's come across that may joined the two topics\nAnd other things like in the Smith and sent the part that's unusual is that it came and spoke to him and he never said mine spoke but more like it spoke to him so hard to say I don't know but one thing like this gentleman asked about my thoughts and things\nI've always stated that I'm a man of facts all of my books are filled with facts\nThere aren't any opinions about what's going on I allow you to come to your own opinion and why do I do that because there are no facts to to establish any current pattern that points to one suspect\nWhen you look at the big foot world there's nothing that points to an exact equation of what we're dealing with other than the DNA\nBut again if you stick with the facts and allow the public to come to their own thoughts I have never met anybody who's read my eight books and they have been thousands that it's come to me and said I Know exactly what's happening\nNow and I should point out that you know you did address this may be Kyle didn't hear it but there are no credible stories in your view of big what being responsible for recording people off as far as you know\n[noise] well no no killing them I I think I'm going okay there's there's a story that John Green wrote about a prospect or that was taken in British Columbia where he took an affidavit from this man\nAnd he was sleeping in a sleeping bag and one of these by pitch grabbed his bag and started walking with him for hours and ended up dumped put him in a cave\nAnd he was eventually escaped but he said he saw this family of big foot in the cave and they kind of watched him and he kind of watch them a it's a it's a really really good story who and the individual at the time sign an affidavit I followed green bleed and said this is a good way to document the stories I hear and\nThat's kinda how Kevin came to pass\nI remember that story now yeah that is a good one is it there are some other account in one of your books about a witness claiming to see a big what type creature carrying a person\nThere was a forest and ... yeah\nA big boy type creature carrying a person through the forest\nAnd ring a bell yeah I think\nSo well there's a story out of Wyoming that I I don't put much Clinton said it because people didn't come forward and they were doing something illegal but a girl disappeared in
