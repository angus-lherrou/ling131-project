going to start World War three but it certainly pushes the very very difficult spot in his jacket pointed out yes it could destabilize everything and uh you know I I really didn't you know pay attention all that much of the case until someone had said you should talk about this because of what it might mean and what what am I Do to force the president's hand\nI said well this is obviously something once again but it's provided by groups like gladly oh the deep state operatives they're all over the world and uh it's it's more than just taking down the president's thinking down even entire country and that's what this is all about so ah let's go to Peter Indiana high speed rail ground zero\nTake like what's up I I think you might be over thinking this a little bit I\nI I I Do like your state and everything but I think this is a plot by the hardliners in Iran and Saudi Arabia and the Muslim Brotherhood will hobby is just getting rid of Mohammed bits on lawn and I'm not sure

about then you know then why did they kill the guy who who once wrote about al ... in a favorable way why why did they ah\nSomebody with a may not be dead he's part of the Muslim Brotherhood\nHe's

wants to retake back massager NBS or whatever he calls himself as one of them wanted to normalize a westernized\nWell if they want to do that they failed miserably what they've done now they put President Trump in a very precarious position is like jak sees ... between a rock and a hard place if we decide to to push Saudi Arabia develop our gas prices when\nIt will be in a world of hurt and not only that but we'll see our economy ...\nOr they could sacrifice their president Mohammad bin saw him on and get back on our good gracious well at the same to Albuquerque\nBack in architecture you really think that it's going to have an ... do you think they're going to execute him\n[noise] I I Would think that the after ... and a lot of them in their\nHistory former remember Peter he's a reformer removed\nOr former yes and that's what I don't like they don't want reform I don't buy it they want you don't buy it well\nI don't buy that he's a reformer at all I don't I don't buy it you know I mean look these guys\nWield a lot of power they will they they they because they have all the the oil and they have all this\nThey have all this stuff and we basically been kissing their asses for a long time and we gave it to them after World War one and and and the thing is is that now they pulled something or that someone has pulled something in the deep state to make this happen and it's it I I kind of agree with jak it's there to make Donald Trump making stupid decision\nAnd whatever he died on the out to be done and they'd be damned it'll be damned if he doesn't\nAnd I think Trump is alluded to something when they said today that rogue actors they may have been at\nI think really actors as do speak for deep state\n[noise] it it could be within the rogue actors within the Saudi Government didn't want to or to undermine been so long [noise] well\nI I Will just have to wait and see 'cause I Know that uh uh I think that Saudi Government a CNN has been alluding to the fact that Saudi government's been wanting to come forward and say that yes they killed him but I mean I I just don't this is one of those situations Peter where I Would just have to wait and see how it all plays out\n'cause right now it's labor my my my feelings are that this is a deep state up a\nGladiator type operation where they've they've done this because it puts President Trump at a very bad position especially before the election and\nThe fact that I I've said before and I said I think I said on the Alex Jones show I said that I think our next step is to\nDestroy the economy and secure a war footing and I said that's our next phase so I mean this could do it looked at\nI think we have to look at turkey airborne the endless than the shaky footing Irwin is\nOn with his ... dropping like Iraq right [noise] and he's got ties to the hardliners in Saudi Arabia and [noise] and it's possible that this is a a a\nYou know year or so this is what they thought Obama was going to do this where they thought George Bush was going to do they didn't do it so you think the Trump would be stupid enough to suspend elections so that there are only a president\nThat no it's not stupid if you think about it well they did he would lay you that most you got most of the American public\nI can hear Hitler Hitler Hitler I can hear Hitler chanted in the streets about happened\nYet but that's what we think about what the story is between the a lot sees it plans to everything that's going on think about all the uproar what's going on and what this is set up for an Emmy again if you look at\nIt and I respect the law is not going on and it's not happening but then he's okay well that can't happen but it is happening look at all the diversity or like that's happening\nWith the Arab by up or you got all these a fraction of the people that are just pitch fit about everything in the country\nIf you look at things will be stabilized everywhere\nWe are being liberalize the entire all the countries all the countries that ah you know wanna hold on to their sovereignty and their freedom or being destabilize the United states is a big prize that's when they want they want it\nDone and and look at our our ... our economy on one hand there by like even Trump try and say oh I'm doing great but then on the other hand you look at or losing jobs some of these plants closing down our losing fat or losing all these laws and\nHis theory shutting down certainly uh sounds like we have a great economy and you know another thing I'll tell you this do you know how you judge there there are three ways you judge economy of awards going one\nHow much is a Big Mac to how much is it to go to a movie and three how much is the lottery worth tomorrow yep that's how you draw the lottery the lottery is over or nearing a billion dollars\nFree how much is the lottery worth tomorrow yep that's how you draw the lottery the lottery is over or nearing a billion dollars the economy has gone to help these people wouldn't be buying that many lottery tickets if it ever the case that\nYou I mean that's what I'm saying you know and everybody's looking at the fact that all the ... and all these people you know said oh Trump's you know a lot during the last eight states not doing this but if you look at the way things are going to set up for basically like you say I kind of a global\nSituation and I do believe the Trump I'm not saying he is the um like I say the leader of that but he has something to do\nThat I mean you look at when he was going through I guess say in the Republican nomination and that I mean everybody really thought he was a joke at first and he is\nAnd now he's president and all this stuff's\nPlay on to him as a joke I I thought it was very I thought it was a contender\nI mean I I had I had my doubts about whether or not win but it didn't seem to have you on that I mean\nThat's what I'm getting at I mean let's say a total joke joke but I'm just saying he he was not a contender in that really and then all of a sudden he's president now and then look at what he's saying he's actually doing it but I Do is part of it as far as the stabilizing all the country and all of us\nDon't think he's a no I don't think he's involved would destabilize the country the country was already having\nA ... interview with history who are always oh no no no no Doug\nStorage please you need to stop focusing on Donald Trump and you stop focusing on Hillary Clinton you need to go beyond that you need to go beyond where we started out saying this to happen after\nThe nine eleven attacks like you need to start looking at the socialism that was being pushed on the American people after that the idea of the project of a new American Century and the neo cons were pushing that issue of expansion in the middle east and all that and put that into perspective Donald Trump is probably fully aware\nOf just how fragile things are right now he's he's acting presidential at least he's trying to\nEase was appalling and it\nWell maybe maybe he's upon it maybe doesn't understand he doesn't understand just who's in control I think he may think he's in control I think the American people who voted for him being the he's in control but I don't think he's in control I think the deep said has been ... and they're not gonna let up but he's still fighting like hell because he won't go down without\nA fight because of his ego and that's fine because these shows that he if you if you get angry enemy you bully him he bullies you three times as hard and people want that in a leader they want a leader who's willing to fight that and that's why they do it but it doesn't make it right it doesn't make it wrong it just makes Donald Trump Donald Trump\nAnd it doesn't matter how much bullying you'll do in the inner how much money to do in the end it we're screwed we're screwed and that's the point and and it won't matter they prompted all those great wonderful things they're going to throw that all of them like slot never pay to\nGet well he he you know your place say you're thinking that he's the one that stinking ... great but he's actually on that's helping each state has all this\nHow is the helping stabilize how is it I don't even effective at night and he's doing it\nLooked at the divisiveness in this country right\nNow even if I had been stopped Trump the media is doing that the media says Trump says the drugs then Trump says on\nHis chest ain't going to all these well\nHe has made a little what's wrong with him going to rallies I mean what was going to rallies that I Would I Can't marry held rallies that really held rallies ... Brock Obama held rallies George Bush held rallies why what's the point\nThat you did not see all the problems with those rally shoot it\nFailed rallies George Bush held rallies why what's the point\nBut you did not see all the problems with those rallies you did not see all the protests you do not see all of him\nBecause they kept them had him did you know that when George Bush went down or when he went down a ... I guess as Pennsylvania Avenue the parade they have in Washington his car would beg the whole time nobody saw that 'cause they kept the cameras on the fact that he was the the uh the limousines were being egg\nI mean like I said do you look at Trump and everything's doing it's the whole situation that he's the stabilizing the whole it's done in the world is\nSaid to these stabilization happened before the elections\nNow I'm not saying they that's how it started I mean that's how he got in there I mean it's all these stabilizing and I think\nWhat he does he smoke I give him credit Jewish smart he's taken advantage of the situation to set everything up on nearby so worried about these elections come up that you know all of a sudden all the Democrats get old liberal throw him out of office no\nIt doesn't matter who goes in there I think you have I think that I think I think he's more clueless and George W. Bush was I think you were then again I don't I don't think so I think he's the only that everybody's getting credit or I don't think so I think\nHe's sitting there going okay because he's already said one time he thinks he can be the president for life and it's a situation where it's that's what he's setting up for in this global situation there set him up for that it all that's doing the stabilizing our country and everywhere else\nWell I gotta say it'd be it'd be makes himself president definitely he's not going to last Fifteen minutes after about\nWell but the but there again that's part of the agenda I mean he think English and and like I say I I I mean it's legal situation it's it's in his head I mean he's making millions and Amy as God somewhat\nHe's not making any money off of being president\nOh you'd be surprised\nNot only that he doesn't need it he doesn't he didn't take the\nSalary it they didn't have the salary of it while you didn't pay salaries are a joke compared to what he's making for all\nAll of his interests and everything is looking ... look at what he made last year\nYeah he's a billionaire we knew he was a billion or when we voted him in\nAnd look at what he laid since we put in there\nWhy I Believe it or ... his bank account I don't know what his name was he made me I'm not doing nearly a dozen years I mean\nHis family is going to make money anyway I mean see this is the thing is we're all going to look what he's done here look we've done here you know look at him look at what he is look what he does\nLook I Would just stand there and he's oblivious he's oblivious he's he's oblivious I Can't say enough he's oblivious\nThat's what they pets to sit\nSo he's all below us George George movie is\nIs that how do you think he's got or is that he's a smart man that makes several body think\nHe's a smart businessman and that's even arguable but what I'm saying is that the president I think he's clueless I mean he's got ... I think he's just doing what he was told\nNo yeah yeah I think you're off from the I think\nOh I don't I I think you have to watch it\nThere are people above him that are helping him in this situation\nDirect mailing them with their directing them yes I Know there there there's some things he says no to\nBecause he is going by his conscience I think Trump goes by his conscious more more so than people think he does I think he goes by his conscience more so than people think he does and that makes him it it it makes them effective as a person who can engender\nSome sort of competence with the people and that's fine\nIt it it makes them effective as a person who can engender some sort of competence with the people and that's fine I mean I think the rock Obama had that same power\nThe only problem is is that Obama big you started writing a blog Vin whims and things and continuing the the oppression and I think Trump has an exercise any of those things yet 'cause I don't know if we know the odds of it as it is disposal or if he does that mean supposedly chooses not to use them you realize he could jail reporters were lying about it if you want to do it but he had all it will not\nGet that seat is that the pitch but if he does that\nAgain why not tight\nRight now will not be the time to make any rash decision about Saudi Arabia but he's going to have to 'cause he's being pressure to do it and then they know that we made the problems with the gas pump we may see some problems with inflation and the economy we may or may see some stuff go down and this is why I say if the deep state move it to the deep state movement a worldwide on the world wide scale\nCan hang on right\nYou can see signs of autism children as young as ...\nOr early intervention we make a lifetime of scientists\nAssigned autism speaks ...\nBrand new light on Tuesday Sunday I Am\n[noise] news then talk on the radio dishes use radio Virginia ... muscle breakthrough\nHere the missing journalist case ...

where the name Sears, Roebuck came from and in Eighteen Ninety six they started their first catalog\nRoom in Nineteen thirty I mean the catalog was was huge big business you could buy homes on there or they would sell you all the materials given the planned buy a home\nMy how a times have changed here I'm a George it's it's really a sad story I I mean they just loaded up with that and that and that\nAnd I mean there last big ass that they had left\nWas the Sears craftsman brand of tools cool\nAnd to me they're going to sell off the Kenmore appliance or the ... section I hear in another mistake that they may have made Mitch who's picking up in bind Kmart what do you think\nYeah I think so too just mismanagement all up and down the line\nI don't see how they survive here now a Lambert is talking about ... the company's chairman is talking about keeping food stores over George they're going to follow Toys R us radio shack sports authority\nTo the graveyard ... how do they millennia or millennials going to shop at Sears\nI Know I mean so what do they have ... and everyone else is turning to online they've given up all of their best asset there's nothing left George\nA to the borders of Tel Aviv and and from there another Fifteen twenty minutes and you're in central Tel Aviv so it's a fantastic location and you know Georgia we leave forty eight years abroad\nUm I was taken out of Israeli Nineteen Seventy two by the CIA [noise] we their range main um through the Mossad\nI we lived in New York for ten years and then we um we we left New York and we went to England we lived in London and in a tiny village called softening on Tamms right outside London\nAnd two and a half years ago my wife and I and I we basically decided to come back to Israel\nAs there is always a burning ... year earning ... fire it's um I think it's very truly nature that brings almost every Israeli back home to his homeland so we made that move and now we're very very happy living here in Jaffa\nWell that's great I Know about a week ago uh for some reason something just hits me and said George you haven't you have an email to ... you know while\nGetting back on the show and ah you were really receptive in here you are but I've got to tell you a great story you've been on the program a couple of times but a couple of years ago when you were on with me you did an experiment where you had people bring their watches in clocks that were working the whole by the radio\nIn in you do this incredible thing and I got an email that night in for the following week from people who said oh my God\nMy watch is working it hasn't worked in years the funny part about all this is ... years later we ran part of that program on our weekend shows and I started getting emails from people\nAfter that scene George my watches are working my clock is working and going what's going on here or he was on two years ago and it didn't dawn on me that we had re run that show a couple of days before that the power of what you did was unbelievable\n[noise] yes you know George ... of people think that when I Am on television or radio and when I ask people to bring broken house appliances broken wants his old clothes and by the way we we can if you wish we can repeat the same experience sure and\nSo people think that it's actually um my energy that flies through the airwaves and and they come out of the radio and television but it's really know what I Do even seem ... trigger I'm I'm simply a captain b.'s\nTo the how the mind of our listeners or the viewers them big T. V. shows\nThese actually worked started my career in a very unusual way I was on uh the b._b._c. Nineteen Seventy three it was my first beak television show\nAnd they ended me for\nTwo band and I don't know why and what made me do this but I looked into the camera and I said everybody at home go and get your schooling get broken watches I didn't realize that I sent around ten million people through the kitchen [noise] because everyone\nYou know when it first with no one believed\nThat spoons and folks are going to bend and watches we've come alive but nevertheless they brought this food they broke broken launches in Poughkeepsie porches and I mean it was messy and then I did my my thing I said one two three work we scream three times one two three work work work\nAnd lo and behold it if the federal money occurred exactly what happened to you people from all over England Wales and Scotland and Ireland [noise]\nYou know very you you didn't have\nThen um you know Twitter in face time and you you you just didn't have the Internet there were no more my phone was old fashioned black phone and what happened is the BBC's telephone system\nCould then take the hundreds of thousands of calls from people all across Britain any collapse\nAnd the next day of course I was kind of the most famous person even in England they rip newspapers ran headline stories or we get our puts England in a band\nSo full year is George I thought that I did it I really believe that I admitted in energy that fix broken clocks and bend spoons but the day I discovered that I was wrong was in in Los Angeles\nUCLA and don't to sell the most mhm invited me to her class\nAnd of course I did my my act\nAnd I left when I didn't know George is it she secretly recorded me while and I went back to New York two weeks later she took that heavy video remember those videos in Nineteen Seventy four Seventy five and Seventy six\nAnd she put that in her a video recorder she invited a new set of pupils students we've broken watches and lo and behold there watches started teaching from that video\nNow she calls me in New York and she tells the story you just fix broken launches in Los Angeles\nAnd I said no way what are you talking about I mean New York I didn't even know that you you're doing this experiment and ... going to me that it's basically I may trigger I make capital east I mean in may ... to the power of the mind of just ordinary people\nWell when you were on the radio show with me you started watches and clocks all around the world and people will just we're just our gas it was amazing I first met early Geller back in Nineteen Ninety seven and St Louis he was an invited guest at the Jewish community center do you remember remember that time ... yes I Do\nIn a just a great time the place was packed in a I got reason some Asian and had him on my local show when I was the noise and walk and\nWe've stayed friends ever since lots of things have been going on in your life and we'll get into that or you while you're with us but the big story that has started to come out has been the CIA recruiting you a long long time ago what did they want with you\n[noise] okay well it all started um when I was Thirteen Years old [noise] uh I Lived in Cyprus and you could see how we left because my parents divorced my mother remarried Hungarian Jew living in ... which is the capital of the cypress yes\nAnd he added tiny bed and breakfast type of a hotel with a Thirteen rooms and Mossad the Israeli intelligence services\nDidn't breakfast type of a hotel with a Thirteen rooms and Mossad the Israeli intelligence services they found out that we're from Israel so they basically turned the hotel into is an into a more safe house oh\nSpies would come into the hotel they would check under you know teachers geology ... but they were really Mossad agents that were\nFrom Cyprus where a flying out to Syria and Jordan and Egypt and Iraq to sky\nAnd there were problems in Cyprus if I remember during that time period because I always used to remember them talking about Cypriots fighting with Greek people and there was something going on there wasn't there\nOh yeah there was a civil war it was it was just awful but I was when I when I came to ... I was only eleven I didn't know English and I so people blown up I\nI I mean\n... out of Mormons I've seen everything uh curfews booms exploding ah so being at that age it really changes your life\nSo I went through the whole war the Greeks were killing the ... the British soldier the Turks were killing the Greeks\nBut why all this was going on I was a I befriended their Mossad agent who told me to you know run errands for him he would send me letters\nWe she didn't allow me to open but my task was to jump on the bicycling psycho them to the conflict in the Israeli conflict anyhow the reason I told you the story is because I already was excited\nAbout you know the the the life for fear of ... by ... and I love movies so [noise]\nTo make a long story short um when I became kind of well known in Israel I met um go ... who is a\nPrime minister right [noise] and she introduced\nMe to Ari Sharon you know these are all of your gender rose in that they are insured and introduced me to the intelligence community and they started using my abilities\nHold on right there or we're going to take a break in let's come back and pick that up right from there because you truly route in the middle of all that with some of the leaders of Israel who stayed leaders for a long long time we'll be back in a moment with the three Geller the paranormal is The Mentalist next on coast to coast day on\nAnd see if we can get those working for you but there are a you're talking about how you were with really the the leaders of Israel gold them my year our real short on who ended up being the prime minister and then went into a coma and less for longer than I ever thought he would but they they they recruited you basically didn't they\nYes they introduced me to the head of a loss out or they recruited me and I started doing some work for them which we weren't going to but they basically didn't have the technology to test my abilities and they picked up\nThe phone in the cold the CIA and he was a CIA scientists quote keeping green who took the call you basically talks about it in a fascinating documentary called the secret life of for a gather produced by the BBC and it's on my website you can watch it [noise]\nUm my website is already gathered dot com\nAnd um they asked the CIA to test me they they wanted to know they wanted the information of how the mind works how can they put the Kurds\nAnd the Nineteen Seventy two I left ... trade to California to Palo Alto to Stanford research Institute which is today Stanford University and I went through rigorous a laboratory controlled condition tests [noise]\nUh and then I started working for the CIA doing you know stuff all over the place for them\nBut just about a year ago I asked you mentioned before the CIA release that some of the documents um that concerned me and it was amazing the twin you know the press to coat of this story any ... worldwide yes\nAnd in these documents they show drawings that I've done um from you know inside\nParody cages um there there was experiments where keep green held a book in his hand it let's just remind our listeners that there were no more by phone then and no Twitter and Instagram [noise]\nAnd I basically drew worked that was in the book and he also worked on that page I'm at their word architectural and I wrote the same word in Palo Alto in California so [noise] yeah that's a dancer that I worked very hard to read these agencies\nIn the United states touring in a you know when I was watching you on TV and the Johnny Carson show into were you recruited by the CIA at that time or afterwards\nIt at that time um but they need to eat you know kind of um ... into other areas where senator Claiborne Pell who was the head of the American Foreign Relations committee\nFlew me to Geneva we've ambassador max can put them in a next to me stood Al Gore\nAnd I was instructed to boom barred usually vote on so to sign the nuclear arms reduction treaty between America and Russia of course I was briefed by by these people in London\nAnd um I got very close to your liver on so I mean I was inches away from his head and I ... I Know it sounds so far out and freaky and science fiction but\nI did exactly that I'd bum boarded these mind to sign sign sign up and they sign they knew the nuclear arms reduction treaty of course I Can't claim that I eat eat only happened because of me\nThere are other elements who vote that I was definitely an instigator I was a motivator and I use these powers to convince the Russians to go ahead and signed a treaty\nAbout a year ago President Trump blow at least some JFK documents and then later on release some more there's still a lot that still have been suppressed Henri but sure enough we uh we read that were in jail or was asked to look at the JFK files\nYes what happened is\nWhy I was I'm working for some CIA operators and my handler is in Mexico city it was very kind of in the genius how they got me into Mexico I was introduced to the president of Mexico or ... or ... and his wife\nOr his wife was kind of fell in love with the powers and you know she loves the power normal in the supernatural [noise]\nAnd um she arranged me television shows we're talking about the wife of the president of Mexico and I was flying all over Mexico with their private jet and so on that but powder to that\nI was asked to spy on the Russian embassy in Mexico city to see who goes in who goes out where they were there American spies going game um people who betrayed the country and so forth\nAnd one of my town schools to find out Neal Harvey all vote actually visited that that embassy or consulate\nThere was some controversy about that because there was a picture of what we're supposed to be me Harvey Oswald coming outside of the embassy but a lot of people re said that's not him put so go ahead\nYeah well that was my task was to tell them whether that was him or not\nBut there there were more more in much deeper things in in Mexico that I did for the CIA [noise] it was amazing I I actually love the by the way I never got paid for these I did it out of ideological reasons\nAnd uh I Love these showbiz nascent cloak and dagger a there I was on Johnny Carson in Merv Griffin Mike Douglas\nAnd then yet I was doing these secret stuff\nFor also for him I five in in London but by the way you know that the Johnny Carson show was a an amazing experience for me because it's still talked about I was sitting there with Johnny Carson\nShow was a an amazing experience for me because it's still talked about I was sitting there with Johnny Carson for twenty two minutes humiliated by him I don't know if you know this I walked into a trap\nYeah they they set you up it was because Johnny Was a ... as a small news magician on his own so he was interested in trying to nail you and then uh then he had what the amazing Randy with him\nYeah he wasn't very easy he was ... it was a setup so I walked him into the onto the show you know people tell me\nWhy or refute do the Johnny Carson you made eating them Mary ... so I was very excited to do this show but there is I sat I been to school or in the hands of free cardamom tumbling if you remember him right to a movie actor [noise]\nAnd they voted for Johnny Was in bend enough and um I I was really kind of swim team and the only thought that rambled in my mind was when we gather you're finished for twenty two minutes humiliated me and I went back to the hotel\nDevastate do you were upset I hear\nTotally I even though their bed and I I thought that seat of a wake up tomorrow morning and I'll pack up and go back to Israel\nBut this is funny thing happened I wake up in the morning or phone rings in my room and the operator downstairs tells me that there is a man called Merv Griffin on the line for [laughter]\nSo I said you mean V.

I want people to listen to that very carefully because we're apt to overlook familiar things we're apt to overlook simple things\nIf you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there was an esoteric and a coke dimensions of the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nLots options is you know why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt they really have to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of scientists are cyclical research to quantum theory rising we have made the determination over the past eight years\nThat time is not what we think it is linear time it's basically a very powerful illusion that we use\nTo organize our lives and it's a necessary illusion but if it's an illusion that means that we are selecting events all the time from across it and send it to the possibilities so I don't use the term manifest I use the term select\nAnd you can select events under the right circumstances within exquisitely focused and the motive Lee charged thought and that's what's going on we are selecting and the same way that when you take a measurement and the particle lab you're very decision to take that measurement will affect what you experience the same is true in our life\nAnd you use these powers to affect your health\nThey're very decision to take that measurement will affect what you experience the same is true in our life\nCan you use these powers to affect your health\nWithout question and and I have to emphasize that we live under lots of laws and forces or one of them is a lot of physical declined one of them is a law mortality there's never been an exception to that but one must never feel that you're without devices that you're without tools\nIn the book I write about extraordinary cases of spontaneous remission of diseases which doesn't mean that is going to happen to people all the time I Would never extend false hope but the cases are there the occurrences are there and we have to probe and look at these things very often they correlate with intensive\nA meditation people who live meditative three hours a day have recorded instances in the medical literature of remission of diseases not all the time but it has occurred\nYou say that when you're writing a book or something weird happened what's the block a band the monkeys\nOh it was the one hand George talk about us all being loose in time a couple of summers ago I was getting into the music of the monkeys just completely out of the blue and my wife thought I was going nuts my kids were memorizing\nThere I Would think you were going nuts yes you would think that no one could imagine what they did have a few good songs\nThey really did add some beautiful pop song [laughter]\nAnd I was playing them all the time I was getting into them everybody thought I was going crazy I couldn't figure out why I was getting into the monkeys George it was months and months later that I got a call from an editor at the Washington Post who said to me do you know Mike Nesmith who was one of the members of the monkeys I said no\nHe said that you know Nesmith just wrote a memoir and I said no\nAnd he said did you know he was a Christian Scientists which is a a a a healing and and mentally based um a form of spirituality\nI said no he said well we like you to in a a review Nesmith a memoir for the Washington Post that you're interested and I said of course I'm interested and I told him the story of how month before without any for thought about any of this\nI started getting into the monkeys and I actually put this into the review and the Washington Post to its credit included this material that was just the weird thing that it was almost like retro causality in a way whereas if I was loose\nFor money or time this is why I'm saying that time is not what we think it is I was completely prepared for that opportunity because for reasons that no one could understand I was getting into the monkeys but the reason seem to be off in the future so to speak but my contention is it wasn't the future it's that everything is happening all around us at once\nWhich is why mental focus is so effective\nI was sixteen when the monkey started plane was there a long long time ago and if I remember one of the members was Mickey ... that's right who played Sherk is more on television right that's\nRight and and still touring still touring\nHere who is still going that's absolutely that's I Love them [laughter]\nAnd do you know the name ... gallon burger buddy chance I don't ... I wrote a couple of books one called liquid luck hall of course her life I Know the book I Know he he would conduct experiments still does in Las Vegas with groups of people mhm any which is\nTrying to prove that positive thinking in the mind has a lot to do with influencing things that happen that's Ryan and he is totally convinced that he's convinced me too\nThat if you go into a situation like Las Vegas upbeat and you know just you know positive about things\nThe odds are really high you're going to win\nYes and you know what's so fascinating about that is that outlook is been validated\nThings the odds are really high you're going to win\nYes and you know what's so fascinating about that is that outlook is been validated by Syria CSP research my hero J. B. rind pioneered scholarly ESP research at Duke University in the early Nineteen thirties J. B. is now deceased\nAnd one of the things that Jay be found that he just buried this in the foot notable booklet it's monumental\nThat when his subject in the ESP lab and these were people tested under very rigorous conditions when they had a feeling of hopeful expectancy when they were upbeat when they were enthusiastic when they were positive their scores like\nWhen they were bored when they were down cast when they were fatigue their scores death and it was inevitable\nIs spike followed mood it's the same thing that he says in the book\nIf you go into a situation any kind of situation doesn't happen to be Las Vegas down in ... you know putting that black cloud over your head for whatever reason yeah it's not going to happen for you\nIt's not going to happen and the thing that I always tell people is\nAnd again this one of these familiar things but listen very carefully to it you must really wanted you must really want it if you're a person who's attitude is neither here nor there about winning in Vegas or the lottery or money or whatever\nIt's not going to work it has to be something that you really want which is why it's so important to mid surely identify your most heartfelt desires there's real power there because the power comes from an emotionally charged thought\nWe're talking with Mitch Horwitz his latest book is called the miracle club as a matter of fact we are going to tell you how you can\nGet a membership in the miracle of a little bit later on in the program is website is his name all linked up for you at coast to coast am dot com it's amazing how well how did you decide to write this kind of a book\nYou know it was funny I had written a history of the positive mind moving a couple of years ago called one simple idea and I began to realize\nEvery chapter that I wrote every person who I talked about in the book I was using their methods I was road testing these things myself\nAnd I thought to myself look if I'm experimenting with these methods myself and if that's what's driving my historical research a lot I write about the methods why did I write about the steps what am I right about the techniques and it was a big step because a lot of historians are afraid to mask themselves\nAs believers in what they write about but I've never been afraid to do that and I just really wanted to share with readers the actual hands on things I Do in my own life\nHow powerful is our human mind Mitch\nIt is powerful in ways that our generation is only coming to understand look we are realizing that things work out there like placebo surgery we're realizing that people can lose weight literally George\nAnd lower their blood pressure just based on the thought that they carry with them things that we would have thought were unbelievable a generation ago are being validated and clinical experiments today\nI think this universe is ultimately mental that doesn't mean that we don't live under many laws enforces but if one can understand how much that means your thoughts are more powerful than anything you've been brought up to realize\nIs that the power of the brain or are we dealing with something outside of the physical body\nWe're dealing with something outside of the physical body and I think we could say that conclusively today because we have actual experiment but the thoughts changed the brain\nYou were sustained thoughts will actually alter the neural pathways the electrical pathways in your brain that's demonstrable by brain scans it's literally mind over matter sort of thought changes the brain and fly it has to be something that extra physical that goes beyond the brain\nWhen we're human beings sometimes things works\nChanges the brain fought has to be something that extra physical that goes beyond the brain\nWhen we're human beings sometimes things work sometimes they don't have you ... if they don't work what does that mean\nYou know it's very important that that's an extremely important point because people will sometimes try him out that it works they're thrilled they try it again it doesn't work and they feel project one of the things that I read about on the book\nIs that we live within a cosmic framework where we experienced many different laws enforces the law of mind is constant as a law must be but so is the law of gravity but you're going to experience gravity differently on earth\nThan you would on the moon around Jupiter doesn't mean gravity isn't there doesn't mean gravity is an operative but it's affected by mass the mind is the same way circumstances are\nGoing to intrude upon how we experience these things so we're fortunate that we experiment\nVery clearly in very carefully\n... going to come back and talk more about your

as we talked about his latest book which is called the miracle ... thoughts become reality will take your calls and your stories\nNext hour as well how does he is pie fit into this mess you were talking about it briefly but uh I I tend to think there's a very deep rooted tie in here\nYou know there is the question you know ... we've experienced in this country about eighty years of serious\nPsychological research serious experiments and the E S P ... telepathy and George the evidence is simply overwhelming and what we're seeing in the SP lab is that the mind\nPossesses extra physical qualities there are ways that we receive and get and give information that go beyond the five senses once we've come to grips with the fact that the mind is extra physical but the mind has an existence\nOutside the scent said body it opens the door to all kinds of possibilities we realize we are not just material beings and it helps confirmed to us that\nOur thoughts make a difference in the world we may be like sending in receiving stations we're always looking for people to help us with projects to give us a hand to meet us\nHalfway and as I was mentioning in the last segment J. B. riding the grade ESP researcher found that ESP results spike in the laboratory based on the enthusiasm of the subject\nSo that gives you a different perspective on how important your thoughts are what actually happens to you may be based on your emotions your enthusiasm your focus\nAnd you believe that you can just change your entire life this way get a better job maybe find the relationship you're looking for just about all that stuff\nI Do believe that but the here's the key thing and this is really the magic key if there is one behind all of our self help systems\nYou must wanted with everything and you you must want it with passionate intensity and we often tell ourselves that we want things without scrutinizing and examining our convictions\nDo we really wanted for example we say we want a job when what we really want is security we say we want a new relationship when what we really want\nMaybe is is is something else you know to move to a different city or to have a different domestic arrangement or to somehow rearrange the furniture of our lives it's very important that we get down to the essentials of what we really want before we put a label on it because I Would contend that what\nYou want over time you're going to get do people know what they want\nThat is really the key thing we tell ourselves well we want you know we say gee I Want a better job I Want romance I Want to live you\nKnow in this city versus that city but my urging to people my urging people and this is something ... can do right now is to sit down with a pencil and paper and for a mature stained sustained period of time really write down your deepest desires your deepest wants\nThink about this well on this be private about this don't talk to anybody\nIf they channel in one direction discover what you want so far because sometimes we repeat things to ourselves by rote and they don't represent are really passionate heartfelt desires get in touch with your desires you may think you have but I Would contend that few of us actually have\nMitch how close you echoed the secrets that story or is that different\nI ... it's different in some ways I have a lot of respect for run to burn and the secret but I rarely use the term law the traction because\nI don't believe we live under one mental super law I Believe that given the circumstances we live under we experienced many different laws and forces like the law of gravity as I was saying and the previous\nSegment so I think it's a mistake to think that our minds and our thoughts are the only game in town so to speak\nThey are part of the game they are part of the game and that's important enough that's essential enough\nYou write about how people travel back into time to help their current life yeah but can't that also be dangerous\nYes it can and it's a very interesting prospect this is why I tell people be careful\nOf what you're thinking about be careful of what you're doing because you know we like to play games with ourselves and we'd like to say\nGee you know if I could travel back into time and give advice to my Fifteen year old self what would I say well my contention is you may be doing that all the time that may be happening all the time linear time is very likely a very powerful illusion that we use to organize our lives but what we've discovered\nIn the hard sciences as well as over the course of testimony from centuries is that\nLife has intimate everything is happening now there is in and finish the two of events occurring at once and we select among them so it could be that we are selecting among events past president future all the time and yet these things feel very real to us very set in concrete to us but I Would contend\nThat when you think about going back and giving advice to a young herself you may actually be doing that so be careful be careful we are granted perspective we are granted some perspective but use your mind use your thoughts carefully because things that you may think of as a novelty may actually be concretely we'll\nPut it all into Apple's stock that's where they come back well [laughter]\nWell who knows George you know who knows the guy who owns Apple's stock right now you know he may have just had that fought based on what you said and he's experiencing that his concrete reality whereas there might have been another reality operative and his wife a few minutes ago\nMitch what is the third day mental challenge\nOr the thirty they mental challenge is something that I invite everybody to join me and it's very very simple and any coast listener who emails me I Will send them a little instruction sheet you basically right out a pledge that for the next thirty days you were going to dedicate your mind to everything that as productive progressive\nForwarding you're not going to think of negative events of the past you're not going to think of unpleasant possibilities are the future you're going to think that every reasonable ambition\nIs within your grass it make up a grid of thirty days you do this for thirty days it's your private experiment just see what happens see what happens it sounds easy but it's not it's very difficult and if you fall off the horse\nYou don't have to restart the thirty days you just get back on the horse the ideas to just try to direct your mind in the direction of that which is positive and productive for thirty days\nSee what happens when you give thirty days of the possibility of experiencing a whole different life and I will do it with you I Will do it with you and if you're having a hard time you could write to me you can email me and say you know I really fell off the wagon last night and I'm there in the trenches with you a couple of years\nAnd you can write to me you can email me and say you know I really fell off the wagon last night and uh I'm there in the trenches with you\nA couple of years ago I started the coast prayer club and you know what that is Mitch is on Fridays\nPeople will neutralize a list of people who have written in yes who are on the prayer list for whatever they need a willing there is a new job in a selection\nSomething people even right in and said please pray for my cats you know he's sick and stuff like that anyway how powerful do you believe in and I will say I believe this works cause I've gotten emails back\nAfter the fact that people say you know so and so's thing was cured and this like that but how powerful deeply prayer is\nI really do believe prayers powerful and it's for this reason I don't think Mother Nature plays cruel tricks on us\nThere are instances and there are times in life where somebody is feeling\nSo depressed and facing such difficulty that they can't do the things that aren't prescribing they can't\nDirect their mind in a positive way they're all kinds of methods and techniques I can give them but let's face it there are times in life where we feel crushed by circumstance ... that's one prayer comes in that's when ... comes in prayer is an escape hatch\nFrom the difficulties of our own psyche from the difficulties of life circumstances when we can do nothing else\nWe can pray and there's no wrong or right right way to pray it's an escape hatch\nFrom her own psyche so again I don't think we've been putting too cosmic framework\nThe tricks us I think we've been given away out when we can't use our minds and the way I'm describing and there are times where people are suffering from addiction from depression from Greek and they can't do the things on saying there were times I Can't do the things I'm saying that's where ... comes in and I devote a special section to prayer in the marrow clubs\nThey have rises for winters\nHere that was when I got a phone

I ... I was reading some of their ... and many enough of these people were truly professional in their lives you know one\nBecause there was evidence before the crash of something bad was about to happen I Know myself\nI Would have spoken up and said get me out of this that crap\nBut these those people Mr Horwitz of the upper middle class the all basically we remained mom no one spoke up their their very lives were coming to an end and yet you say a from a ... a higher exalted background that people should know but\nThe ... they were like many people and society they they were conditioned to stay quiet and it ended up costing there are a lot there were twenty people killed Eighteen in a limo no one spoke up to say\nThis has got to stop pull over now and they could have but they didn't like sheep to say if they went to their deaths\nSort of wrap all of this up um whether me in the city\nAnd seen my fellow city residents ... many of them good enough but not getting ahead and then in school Harry these upper middle class people not speaking up for themselves I'd like you to tide us together and so far as why to say it if I have to like sheep\nSo many people go to their dome and they just can't bring themselves to grab themselves by their lapels and just speak\nUp for themselves and say gosh darn just let all of this that and let us all come together and do something about it\nAnd she let me let me ask you because we have the story the night it happened it was a tragedy for sure but what do you mean\nNobody to stop what was going on inside that bloom all ...\nThere are indications that the car was basically to use my term coming apart at the uh people are saying uh amongst the victims because they had cell phones that we can't we can't even hear each other next to each other a ... ...\nTalk down\nThe car was being coming very noisy and and literally coming apart the scenes and you would think that intelligent people and many enough for both of you these were quite professional people would noticeably higher\n... middle class of jobs where they should have had the smarts the know how justice say I'm going to speak up here get this driver to pull over and I know because you've heard me before me teeth oh that driver would have pulled over no if fans\nOr I Would have wanted to be in a limo would you you would have stopped that guy\n... you know ... there's a lot to unpack and will keep his saying and of course I I read that same news coverage now you know there's a new age expression there are no accidents and I break with that expression I don't I don't abide\nBy that everything happens for a reason\nRight right one of the things I write in the book is you know as I've been eluding we live under many laws enforces we experienced many laws that forces and I've never including love accident including\nAccidents of birth for example now peer pressure as as Keith was looting is an extremely powerful force then it can be a destructive force one must never get caught up in peer pressure because it can be a kind of group mentality regardless of whether it holds you too where you've been born or it keeps you from speaking up if you're seeing something that you think\nIs dangerous it's vitally vitally important that everybody acts with independent agency that doesn't mean you can escape accidents that doesn't mean you can escape tragedy but my contention is\nThat the mind is one vital element that participates\nThat participates in other things that are going on and it is extremely important to exercise it at all times you're never without devices whether you're facing a crisis\nOr based on the accident of birth and economic class I Can't tell you and I would never tell anyone that there aren't crushing forces socially and economically there are but the fact is the mind is one vital tool in your belt that you can always use\nAnd it can make all the difference at a crucial moment\nIt is one thing we think of ourselves as having mines that control cognitive and motor function and that's true but there's more to it than that there's more to it that that the mind as extra physical properties that doesn't mean that it necessarily determines everything and every force that occurs or comes into her life\nBut it's one vital tool and my messages use it use it always and everywhere and in every circumstance whether its environment as Keith was alluding to or whether it's a situation that you think is going to be\nHazardous never feel bound by peer pressure there is no more blunt force of your own will ineffectiveness in potency than peer pressure it must be escaped\nLet's go to ... to California you know like I'm going like\nGeorge thank you for taking my call very up beat interview was hearing

any listeners who haven't heard of him he was a British bar Baden mystic who've lived and worked in America died in Nineteen Seventy two\nAnd as the caller was describing metal taught that your imagination is God and that the God of scripture Old Testament New Testament is really a metaphor for your imagination and everything that you see and experience including my own voices you're hearing it right now\nIs really coming from within view it is rooted in you I Am rooted in you as you are ultimately rooted in God and that everything\nThat happens to your relationships your experience

you can lose weight you can get stronger you can do all kinds of things he's using the power of the mind\nIt's absolutely crazy there was a Harvard study and George this is the God's honest truth and I give the details and the miracle club is a Harvard a clinical psychologist named Ellen Langer she did a study on hotel maids\nShe found that if she explained to hotel maids the fact that their jobs are actually robotically an anaerobic healthy\nAnd then studied the maids for six weeks compared to a control group who had been told nothing she found the group that had been educated about the

fascinating work match and what's even greater about all this it really does work\nIt really does work you know I always tell people that would never give somebody an exercise that I hadn't row tested and I treat every reader as I Would a member of my own family every single method technique exercise in this book is something that I Would give it to my own kids to use it really does work\nWere briefly touched on your thoughts about people going back into time in order to help their current life how do you do that\nYou know Georgia simple as just focusing mentally on what for example you might want to tell your younger self that's something that's a million to us we often think of that as novelties so it's easy to picture\nI made the determination I read about this and the final chapter America club at once I had come to feel that linear time was basically an illusion and everything is happening infinitely and all that\nTruly enter into a relax meditative state and picture of yourself into the scene going back\nGiving advice T younger self with whatever age maybe you want to avert a tragedy or disaster maybe you want to dispense a piece of advice\nIt can change your life right here and now in the present but be careful because sometimes things that we as experience\nAs challenges or tragedies also bring maturity to her life they also bring refinement to her life so you don't necessarily want to raise something there was a difficulty because that might have been a springboard\nTo some sort of greater maturity or lesson so reflect very very carefully on what you want to tell your younger self and then imagine yourself into that scene imagine yourself into that scene and write down what you want to tell your younger self\nBecause by writing it down you'll be able to actually have some sort of a compass point or vantage point\nFrom when you can tell whether things are different and I think you will find but things will be different\nWhy do you say that it could be dangerous to do that\nWell because if we go back and we are race adverse cities we could be a racing something that taught us a vital are necessary lessons sometimes\nThe aspects of our lives that were most proud of came to us\nFrom adversity so we want to be very careful this is not a game this is not a toy this is not something to play around with\nYou want to be really sure that whatever the consequence you want to go back and encourage your younger self to do something healthy unimportant and productive but don't think of it as just avoiding tragedy because tragedy can actually be a springboard to maturity\nNow here's the sixty four thousand dollar question Mitch yeah solid is or how\nDoes it work that is the question and I don't shy from that question the fact is I don't think we manifest things I think we select things\nI think as in the particle lab everything in our lives as in super position and it becomes localized only when we focus on it as if we are almost drawing up a matrix grid and when we isolate a spot or point in time on that grid we experience it as being as vividly real\nAs my voice that you're hearing right now\nSo our actual act of life\nIs an act of selectivity what we emotionally and mentally picture rise and focus upon is the experience that we enter into because everything is happening at once\nAnd we go in and out of these things the way a particle goes from a wave state and then it collapses into a localized particle steak\nSelect very carefully time is infinite and our minds our sensory tools are a measuring device by which we can help decide exactly what we're going to experience\nThat's going to marry in Rock Hill South Carolina on the wild card line ... go ahead\nHello there jarred water play games or\nYes

you haven't you have an email to ... you know while\nEating back on the show and ah you were really receptive in here you are but it's got to tell you a great story you've been on the program a couple of times but a couple of years ago when you were on with me you did an experiment where you had people bring their watches in clocks that were working the whole by the radio\nIn in you do this incredible thing and I got an email that night and for the following week from people who said oh my God my watch is working it hasn't worked in years the funny part about all this is\n... years later we ran part of that program on our weekend shows\nAnd I started getting emails from people\nAfter that scene George my watches are working my clock is working and going what's going on here or he was on two years ago and it didn't dawn on me that we had re run that show a couple of days before that the power of what you did was unbelievable\n[noise] yes you know George ... of people think that when I Am on television or radio and when I ask people to bring broken house appliances broken wants his old clothes and by the way we we can if you wish we can repeat the same experience sure and\nSo people think that it's actually um my energy that flies through the airwaves and and they come out of the radio and television but it's really know what I Do even simply trigger I'm I'm simply ... ... ... ...\nOh what I Do isn't simply a trigger I'm I'm simply and a cat two least to the ... of the mind of our listeners or the viewers um big TV shows\nThis is actually worked started my career it is very unusual way I was on and the BBC Nineteen Seventy three it was my first beak television show\nAnd they ended me for ... to band and I don't know why and what made me do this but I looked into the camera\nAnd I said every play at home going get your spoons and get broken watches I didn't realize that I sent around ten million people through the kitchen\nBecause everyone wanted to experience this phenomena first of all no one believed\nThat spoons and folks are going to bend and watches we've come alive but they nevertheless they brought this to be broke broken launches in Poughkeepsie porches and I mean it was massive and then I did my my thing I said one two three work we scream three times one two three work work work\nAnd lo and behold they send them on a Kurd exactly what happened to you people from all over England Wales and Scotland and Ireland [noise]\nYou know very you you didn't have\nThen um you know Twitter in face time and you you you just didn't have the Internet there were no more my phone was old fashioned black phone and what happened is the BBC's telephone system\nCouldn't take the hundreds of thousands of calls from people all across Britain any collapsed\nAnd the next day of course I was kind of the most famous person in in England the the the newspapers ran headline stories or we get our puts England in a band\nSo for years George I thought that I did it I really believe that I admitted that energy that speaks broken clerks and bend spoons but the day I discovered that I was wrong was in in Los Angeles\nUCLA and dumped to sell the most mhm invited me to her class\nAnd of course I did my my act\nAnd I left when I didn't know George is that she secretly recorded me while and I went back to New York two weeks later she took that heavy video remember those videos in Nineteen Seventy four Seventy five and Seventy six\nAnd she put that in her a video recorder she invited a new set of pupils students with broken watches\nAnd lo and behold there watches started taking from that video now she calls me in New York and she tells the story you just fix broken watches the you know scientists and I said no way what are you talking about\nI mean New York I didn't even know that you you're doing these experiments and that's when he don't want to me that it's basically I may trigger I make capital east I mean in may ... to the power of the mind of just ordinary people\nWhile when you were on the radio show with me you started watches and blocks all around the world and people will just for us to our gas it was amazing I first met early Geller back in Nineteen Ninety seven and St Louis he was an invited guest that the Jewish community center you remember remember that time ... yes I Do\nAnd I'm just a great time to place was packed\nIf I guess that the Jewish community center do you remember remember that time ... yes I Do\nIn a just a great time the place was packed in a I got a reason for nation and had him on my local show when I was the night talk and\nWe've stayed friends ever since lots of things have been going on in your life and we'll get into that or a lawyer with us but the big story that has started to come out has been the CIA recruiting you a long long time ago what did they want with you\n[noise] okay well it all started um when I was Thirteen Years old I Lived in Cyprus in equal CEO we left because my parents divorced my mother remarried Hungarian Jew living in the ... which is the capital of the cypress yes\nAnd he added tiny bed and breakfast type of a hotel with a Thirteen rooms\nAnd more found these renting damage and services they found out that we're from Israel so they basically turned the hotel into ... and into a more safe house oh\nSpies would come into the hotel they would check under you know teachers geology ... but they were really more of a sudden agents that we're\nFrom Cyprus where a flying out to Syria and Jordan and Egypt and Iraq to spy\nAnd there were problems in Cyprus if I remember during that time period because I always used to remember them talking about Cypriots fighting with Greek people and there was something going on there wasn't there\nOh yeah there was a civil war it was it was just awful yeah but I was when I when I came to ... I was only live and I didn't know English and I so people\nBlown up I I I mean\nNot doing anything out of more as I've seen everything ah curfews bombs exploding ah so being at that age it really changes your life so\nI went through the whole war the Greeks were killing the ... the British soldier the Turks were killing the Greeks\nBut why all this was going on I was a I befriended their Mossad agent who told me to you know run errands for him he would send me letters\nWe she didn't allow me to open but my task was to jump on the bicycling psycho them to the conflict in the Israeli conflict anyhow [noise] the reason I told you the story is because I already was excited\nAbout you know the the the life for fear of spy yeah and I love movies so [noise]\nTo make a long story short um when I became kind of wind known in Israel I met a golden Meyer who is the\nState's prime minister right [noise] and she introduced\nMe to Ari Sharon you know these are all of your gender rose in that they are returned introduced me to the intelligence community and they started using my ability\nHold on right there or we're going to take a break and let's come back and pick that up right from there because you truly ruined the middle of all that with some of the leaders of Israel who stayed leaders for a long long time we'll be back in a moment with the three Geller the paranormal as The Mentalist next on coast to coast day of\nAnd see if we can get those working for you but there are a you're talking about how you were with really the the leaders of Israel golden my year are real ... who ended up being the prime minister and then went into a coma lasted for longer than I ever thought he would but they they they recruited you're basically didn't they\nYes they introduced me to the head of a mosque out or they recruited me and I started doing some work for them which we weren't going to but they basically didn't have the technology to test my abilities and they picked up\nThe phone and the cold the CIA and it was a CIA scientists quote keeping green who took the cold basically talks about it in a fascinating documentary called the secret life before we gather produced by the BBC and on my website you can watch it [noise]\nUm my website is already gathered dot com\nAnd um they asked the CIA to test me they wanted to know they wanted information of how the mind works how can they put the occurred\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy two I left the insurance trade to California to Palo Alto to Stanford research Institute which is today Stanford University and I went through rigorous a laboratory controlled condition test\nAnd then I started working for the CIA doing\nFor them but just about a year ago I asked you mentioned before the CIA release that some of the documents um that concerned me and it was amazing it it when you know depressed too cold of this story any twin worldwide yes\nAnd die in these documents they show drawings that I've done um from you know inside\nParity cages are there there was experiments where kids green held a book in his hand let's just remind our listeners that there were no more by phones then and no Twitter and Instagram\nAnd I basically drew worked the was in the book and he also worked on that page I'm at their word architectural and I wrote the same word in Palo Alto in California so [noise]\nYeah that's the answer that I worked very hard that way these agencies worldwide\nWhen you were in the United states touring and uh you know when I was watching you on TV and the Johnny Carson show into were you recruited by the CIA at that time or afterwards\nIt at that time um but then he eats you know kind of um trickled into other areas where senator Claiborne Pell who was the head of the American Foreign Relations committee\nFlew me to Geneva we've invested their max campus then I'm next to me stood Al Gore\nAnd I was instructed to boom barred usually vote on so to sign the nuclear arms reduction treaty between America and Russia of course I was briefed by by these people in London\nAnd um I got very close to your liver on so I mean I was inches away from his head and I ...
