wrote several books\nExposing fake mediums and there are fraudulent methods\nHoudini of course died of a ruptured appendix on October the thirty first Nineteen twenty six Halloween four days after receiving for unexpected punches to his abdomen\nBy McGill University student backstage at the princes theater in Montreal Canadian connection there\nOn his deathbed Houdini allegedly told doctors that despite being a skeptic of after death communication if he were able to get a message to his beloved wide best he will do so then more than two years after his death his wife best attended assailants\nConducted by medium psychic Arthur for during which forward allegedly channeled the message from Harry using a secret coded message previously agreed to\nBy Harry invest initially best stated publicly and assigned and witness testimony that she believed Harry had in fact\nCommunicated to her from the grave later however she recanted and said publicly that no Harry had not communicated to er during the say odds\nDespite this best continue to hold highly publicized sales says in New York every Halloween on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nDuring all that time she said she received no communication from Harry finally after the last say also in October thirty first Nineteen thirty six best gave up\nHow did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an vowed to bunker didn't have time for spirit you listen yet he's good friend\nAnd his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did looked at the oil as the leader of the spiritual as\nA matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years and I think the friendship came about through fan just fame crossing pads and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of a discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading\nFor Harry where she claims that he brought she bought through Harry's mother\nAnd Harry's mother the spirit of Harry's mother plays an important part in this whole thing [noise]\nUm and Harry was supposedly moved but he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact\nAnd that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nI was he sort of outed her in public didn't need any out her ...\nYeah yes yes uh thirty taco view um some of this play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nNow no part of this debunking that that uh Harry and Bess engaged in ... would be to sort of demonstrate I guess the audience was how it works so they would sort of do their own\nSort of photo psychic act or on stage and I don't know if they'd been explained to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this secret coded method\nThat that Harry and best could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody method\nI think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to ah anybody that interested in this it's all explained in the essay quite clearly\nThere is a list of ten words and the tenth word is actually a phrase in each word corresponds to a number number one through can and number can can also be taken to be zero and so this was used to\nCorresponds to a number number one through Ken and number can can also be taken to be zero\nAnd so this was used to point most commonly to the date on a coin so that's how the trick would normally work when Harry invest first met and Eighteen Ninety four that's when they got married they would do this little trick where they would have someone volunteer they'd reaching their pocket ...\nAll right what does the last two digits on the coin\nAnd they these were rich and play answer say now tell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number and so they would work these words into an easy sent tens like\nQuickly area I Know you can do this and that would be number eight\nAnd so it has a natural ... to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nRight so if the coins at best held in our hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty eight\nAnd because she would say she's communicating to him verbal using these code words and she said quickly quickly is corresponds with a number eight it's the eight eight were in in the rye secret code emitted so so that he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right makes size right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just numbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the\nLetters that are passed number can but the way of doing that and that's what was used to make this code\nSo they would have had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases praying or say now tell please speak quickly look be quick\nAnd as you say all of this can be found in the essay let me just because people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical dot com infinitely mystical dot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work the essays posted there sorry I Know\nThere's a link on the coast to coast now let's talk about this call because after the message was delivered to bath and she said that it works somebody quickly said hey this was all in a book is all already published in a book this is no big deal\nI thought I had read this on line a number of times someone would say within a book but they wouldn't say the name of the book out of the people are saying it's on page da da da da da da da da\nAnd then I finally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought\nYou know I'm going to look in the Santa Barbara county library and see if that book is there and I was so surprised to find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county\nAnd for all of the twenty five cents they would move at book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out and eighty five year old book\nI couldn't believe it so I got the book and I scanned the relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just follow that may not say there's a link inside though they'll show you scan of this book and so that book does\nTalk about those ten words and how it's used to form numbers but not out of form or so\nThat's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book\nAnd um let's see I hear some bullet points about this that the code can be used to form words not just numbers how clever coating method works to form these words that they use this code in the afterlife experiment that the secret message would start with you\nCoding method works to form these words that they use this code in the afterlife experiment that the secret message would start with the unnamed coated word Roosevelt that the secret message would in code word to leave and the actual secret ten word message none of that was in the book\nAnd the person who claimed that it was in the book\nThis is important to ask you this is he also was a famous magician and he's a close personal friend\nOf Harry Houdini so in this person says ah it's not a trick it's in the book everyone just took him at his word did not look into the book and just believed that Ford was a fraud without looking into it anymore\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why it was important for you to point out\nThat this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini a and therefore it may have been possible for so much to know about that because now we get into the sale and and uh we should back up and explain that on Houdini deathbed\nIn Detroit and one of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this was actually true but allegedly told them that I'm a skeptic I I I'm a ... I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way I can get a message to bass I Will try\nAnd then she has contacted best is several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he hounded for get in touch with best\nWill out such an ad in just a minute but I just want to point out that I think that this worked because bath and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments\nChecking into reality as if it's a heartless machine and I think it's really important for us to think about how well we love one another and ... we are for kindness and compassion\nAnd we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine so back to your question um Ford was a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions\nAnd in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise]\nOne of his clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of Harry and his mother intrude into this session and in his on putting the word forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to death\nWell baskets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have\nAnd she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul and spirit was surviving death and sort of got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford was well aware of Houdini reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and\nWant to say going to jump in here forgive me Thomas I got to jump in with a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini and beds Houdini here's Jean night taking us into the break with do me on coast to coast them [noise]\nDon't let your dog itch scratch stink or said like crazy come to learn about for help\nEight five night for two weeks one thousand eight five nine four to eight when those are the I dunno V. I. T. S. dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nThomas resentful my guess is the author of living the paradox of enlightenment and the the essay\nWe're discussing a Houdini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com Thomas tight Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine\nAnd a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens [noise]\nUm are there for it shows up and he Arthur Ford usually worked for the spirit named Fletcher and Fletcher is in touch with Houdini and this ability for the spirit world to communicate to our physical world\nIs a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother the spirit of his mother was also present to make this all happened and they were able to make it kind of a um like a show a very theatrical show where\nHer he would work with best the same way they worked when they were on stage and use her as an assistant\nWell he was very poetic with her is very at times very touching and romantic\nAnd ah there were statements like throw open the curtain and all of this but what they did was they put this ten key words on the table and then they coated them\nAnd after it was decoded the message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I Want to explain that that is a nickname that Harry used for her was Roosevelt and this came about\nThrough a popular song right around the time when they got married and this song had a little bit or perhaps more\nOf this song I'm inside her wedding ring and So Harry Potter Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was Rosa bell believe\nAnd it really really touched bass and she was very very strong and clear and her language that her husband had spoken to her\nAnd that anyone noted did anyone know Arthur Ford no that Roosevelt was the pet named professor was this common knowledge\nIt might have been known throughout the close friends um [noise]\nSo I really can't say about that there's a story going around that I read just the other day on the Internet 'cause that's trying to brush up on his kind of set up\nSomeone said that uh there was a big romance between Arthur Ford and bass who is Twenty years older than he and he saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of it and saw where it said Roosevelt and blah blah blah I\nJust don't find this credible so I won't go into it but um yeah there are people that say that it's quite possible that they would have known that he referred to as Roosevelt with the believe is actually came through the decoding of those other ... and\nAnd again he just he he didn't of of Ford through his spirit guide Fletcher does just that showed the word believe they used the secret coating message that we had mentioned earlier\nUsing those keywords pray answer say now tell please speak quickly look and be quick in and these all windy coded spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe yes\nYes and um\nAnd she declared the success she declared it a success correct\nAbsolutely and I'm In fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who is president to say on set off this is a lot of nonsense that wasn't true and and so that's\nThat's why her statement says regardless of any statements made to the contrary I Wish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence\nGiven to me by Arthur Ford is the correct message prearrange between Mr Houdini and myself and then it's signed by not only hurt but three witnesses one of them as a representative of the United press\nAnother one is one of her lifelong friends and another one is someone from Scientific American\nAnd these this this letter was reprinted in the New York times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this was a success that it happened\n[noise] yeah I think so in effect of the newspaper articles that I was reading you could clearly see here in support for a good while\nAnd then around fourteen months after that there is a hard switch where she suddenly start that they're now denounce that anything was valid that there was any evidence whatsoever\nThat this was a genuine contact so it's it's quite shocking um\nBut before that before she sort of recanted there was another a reporter with a ... a either a magazine or a newspaper called the New York graph are we\nYou mentioned there was another a reporter with a ... a either a magazine or a newspaper called the New York graph or radical rather than your graphic and tell me about this reporter ... is it read ... I Can't pronounce the name but I don't remember\nOne name but I think the first name as R. E. A. and I think it's pronounced ... right um she had an apartment and she invited Arthur forward over to visit her and she was going to interview him and she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in a closet but they're hiding somewhere they're going to witness this exchange\nWell the person that shows up is not really author Ford it's someone that's been paid in person ate Arthur Ford and he shows up and he says uh I paid Mrs Houdini some money she gave me the code\nI'm just here to tell you the truth [laughter] I just you know it's really funny because bass\nHeard about at well as the reporter wrote this up and so vast responded in a letter\n'em to that same paper where she just completely denies it there she's been a party of fraud in any way and if Arthur Ford said\nThat they were in cahoots he's a liar I mean she was very clear in this letter goes on and on and I'd never seen this letter until um yesterday and it's in an article posted\nOn a website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nThis was written to Walter windshield the great Walter ...\nThat's what I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter ritual and he was um yes the social they go to guy you know and um but this kind of made it look like it was a letter written to this um the New York evening graphic\nBut it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was very supportive and these these were supposed to be private letters\nLetter starts off saying this letter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity\nYou know I'm just telling you I was no party Danny fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying oh we've got prove there's fraud he confessed and then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time\nSo Arthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point best Houdini further uh money's the water because although she has been insisting and insisting that had happened other than she does an abrupt about face\nYes and you know in the very first days after the message happened\nIn one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way my family and friends they don't buy this you know they don't believe in their communication you know and so and I think that this\nFester and she was tired of being ridiculed by her friends being labeled and not um and I think she just sold it and said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like\nIf anyone says they get in touch with me after my death and know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with anyone [noise]\nUm so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the ... and twenty nine was she re camping and changing their position\nI think it was about fourteen month\nFourteen months and but also she had at some point she had offered\nChanging their position\nI think it was about fourteen month\nFourteen months and but also she had at some point she had offered up a an award a reward a ten thousand dollar prize to any one to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so we really interesting\nTo yeah because you know if he really wasn't boots with Arthur Ford he could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple of weeks before this happened I retracted the offer well that sounds you know pretty pretty iffy\nWhereas if they were in cahoots he could've said I'm so happy that she is so generous but I don't want my spiritual progress\nWith Amazon Music uh voices all you need tens of

piling on and um they were ... they fall in love with this\nCommunist ideal and um you know of course they didn't know anything about it really it was just really great thing\nAnd it was through at 'em grow house and I'm I'm a geologist and actually ended up being system secretary than anybody and from their incentive to use the Roosevelt million and that the political connections in New York\nTo run for governor and then once governor I'm you know it was a it was a jump to the White House lawn\nAnd legal for them to come out of the time while I'm ah in even really some of the things that I Want it to\n'em over want it to do but you know he was all that kinda\nDidn't cooperate very well with was uh what are some of those were his ideas and um we don't have to jump right to a big jump right to the White House and started a he originally ran on tax cuts and everything and we realize that the that old isn't working you completely flip\nAnd went out with a socialist end of it and uh\nYou know we're raising the ... even tell you like watching the suffering so\nWell we'll get into the the new deal and the depression and and and so forth and and the fact that it will do this after the break but I just wanted to mention the idea that someone in a in a confined to a wheelchair warn that had a such a debilitating disease polio\nOr for that person to to rise to the White House at a time when as you point out in who murdered FDR at a time when a physical handicap like this was also also equated with sort of the moments of mind and how\nWithout I guess the complicity of the media that sort of agreed you know to not talk about\nSort of the moments of mind and how would that would I guess the complicity of the media that sort of agreed you know to not talk about it he never would have been president\nYou know it's amazing the parallels equal to cooperate so very sympathetic maybe it's just like today well now a days like today without whether I Know it was like well up in prison for\nSure [laughter] ... parallels that freedom he gets a free pass off of\nThe other was between these two guys will have to talk about when you get back on its its vigil history basically just repeating repeating itself with the Russians\nAnd the White House and you know just all kinds of things it's incredible uh what's happening it down and known known patches it you know that's something else\nBut how is it sets a that no one sort of you know nobody's store or said hey wait a minute\nOr president does in a in a wheelchair or he can barely walk is he equipped you know this is thinking back then I Know obviously we know better now but the idea that ... you know Seventy eighty years ago\nOr ... no one would take notice of that\nWell they they they pick their camera shots\nWell and that\nWhole people for five years ago just a few hours a day that this was a guy who if\nHe would he can really think on four or five thought processes that one if you really really really soft Joe when he would do is easy like with the help of someone ... you will lose their arm and the help but look brought your pain or something if he ...\nHe would appear to be walking to pick

days which is seen as being so important today in the media what does the president accomplish in his first hundred days that really started with FDR didn't it but the kind of cheated that a little bit\nYeah absolutely the um ... like this is complicated fire I'm distraught that's\nThe ... amendment had changed debate in which the president was going to be flown in from march until January so you didn't go go into effect until October of Nineteen thirty three which meant that Roosevelt had to wait to take off it was for the ... so\nThis mystery thing of the hundred days and they still

got in and fill it with the knowledge and lovers and raise the taxes and put some regulations on in here that fast\nAnd ah you know so here comes FDR and ... there's a lot of people who are really in trouble and suffering so he has this has low vision of legislation\nA in a you know in order to help these people in or so he thought and he did he did a great deal of help for a lot of people we put people to work and it was on the government or the gun route paycheck and um this was the experiment from the communists\nThe economy as part of the United states of America had already set up camp in Nineteen Nineteen in this country okay so all of this information or was coming through\nOr his friends and the Communist Party of the United states of America and they're still in existence by the way and then you know a New York city\nOr and so this is was their idea of how to help the workers in the working class and it was a flood of legislation or were they just basically regulated everything from banking to basically if you if you if you were able to take oxygen FDR regulated it at that point\nEverything from farms to banking food to securities act and all points in between\nSo this was done to put every once in a work on the government do so we could have this\nCradle to grave wonderful society that Stalin and the Soviets had fooled us into thinking existed new ideology they thought that it was going to be this great thing where we're going to escape the uh the peaks and valleys of communism and you know the government was in charge of everything and all this new wonderful\nPeaks and valleys of capitalism I think you meant the I think he's the communism set a ...\nI'm Sorry about that I Know where he's the pitfalls and valleys in ... of of of capitalism you know so right\nYou mean ... if I might you because you you are you you print a list of legislative\nAh um actions that were enacted a\nIn in who murdered FDR let me just read here um and demurred\nUh I'm actions that were enacted\nA in in who murdered FDR and just read here I'm In the emergency banking act the government economy acted beer wine revenue act of creation of the civilian conservation corps abandonment of gold standard the federal emergency relief act agricultural adjustment act\nEmergency far mortgage act Tennessee Valley authority act securities act aggregation of gold payment class homeowners look lone act Glass Steagall banking act national industrial Recovery Act emergency railroad transportation act\nAnd the farm credit act um and he I mean he did this really without much cooperation from the Congress didn't he\n[laughter] he just basically rendered through I wasn't going to bore everybody with Richard I'm Glad you did that I Will not\nDo that I'm happy to bore them with it here [laughter] so I mean it's just a laundry list but it's just it gives you a sense because you mentioned you know that this was right out of almost like the communist manifesto that that he had to kind of control that Stalin had in the Soviet Union which is kind of an interesting parallel\n... it's very true it granted it was the Walt Disney version of it but it was it certainly\nIt certainly was the same basic control he was carrying just like Stalin style and just push all of his enemies you know if you got in a way of style and you know you ended up that his first two wives his doctor who told things to\nUm you know he he just went crazy um the great purge was basically a show trials to put anybody to death that either disagree with America challenging politically\nAnd that kind of Stalin did it FDR did it by what packing the Supreme Court\nRight what happened is my Nineteen thirty six he had worried you know there was an election coming so you know he thought that people were getting a little bit you know wary of the new deal so he came out with a second new deal it also wasn't working to the extent that he thought\nOkay so well all of this was going on in Europe is great war is brewing you know he's seen lots of Europe's war we're going to do our thing we're in trouble we're staying out of it\nSo if this was a great a second new deal must be better so um and they start to put a you know implement and then the second new deal and they start to realize that\nSubstantial portions of it were unconstitutional so\nThe um he had to pack the Supreme Court to see if you get past than it was I mean he was really really fiddling with ... I mean a tremendous amounts and I know in the history books\nHistory books say a lot of things are I Know the history books paid him as this wonderful magical genie of or economics or says he wasn't there was an economic failure\nPeople were ah they were surviving and that was about it that was about all they were doing and the you know unless we got into that war and started to move some goods and services we were all you know we're we're we're still going to be in the new deal for until his death I mean that was it was a it was a ... it was a ... because I asked her feet\nHow do you use the trading with the enemy act or to to to gain more power lend lease there's music playing the you know the the trading trading with the enemy act\n[noise] well [laughter] again when he did was that was just an attempt to bolster the economy and the saying it was the same thing with the with the lend lease program\nHe was moving you know munitions in goods and services to the to the to the the the axis powers and he was giving them to the to our allies you know free France included and eventually this the Soviet Union\nSo that we could win and they were just running up a cash register to be paid back at a later time so there's a you know there's there's a lot going on here I mean he started or he had to do that because he started to realize the new deal was not working\nThere is a you know there's there's a lot going on here I mean he started to ... he had to do that because it started to realize the new deal was not working\nSo there was no there was a lot going on economically in in our country and then there came to a point where\nHe knew that we had to get into this war and the spies indeed and you know we have spies who I Know I Know it sounds terrible we do all countries have them we have spies to\nOur spies in Germany were starting to tell us\nThey're finishing your have you are experiments and with the beats who rockets to carry the nuclear weapons to all for it to the globe we'd be speaking German right now\nI mean they were on the brain so we had to get into this war for economic reasons and for other reasons it was a great catalyst hear what's going on fascinating time in history scary time in history\nSo in the book you argue as many I have\nThat that FDR new Japanese attack on the U.S was coming the only question was when um then the question is did he good he sort of make it happen duty let it happen or what he just sort of glad it happened\nYou know I say in my book that I think that the I was probably the greatest war president we ever had and that's because he just love war\nWe hear it all the time we see your magic valley electric vans everywhere our magic valley electric series Mansour pretty special specially designed to be stocked with just about any part that may be needed on any job\nWe\nDo with your nut job\nTrick or treat on his back into the family friendly way to go trick or treating October thirty first at the Fred Meyer parking lot for three thirty to sit at a free please bring a non perishable food items of donations to sell central community action partnership\nCensored by value that Mary county ... fire department urgent care and ... every restoration is radio Thirteen candidates has already counterfeit nice worthy of their income dot com\n[noise] news and talk on the radio dishes radio for change when all of a police\nOfficer shot and killed two suspects identified I man Carrick Fox News it happened to go in that County Georgia ... about twenty five miles north east of Atlanta\nOfficers were responding to a suspicious car near school as they approached shots were fired from inside the vehicle to teenage suspects Trump's now though we're in the vehicle along with a third person stopped by police\nPolice say Eighteen year old to remain or to fatally shot thirty year old officer ...

a instill at this point you know I I see pictures Roosevelt still looks pretty robust a you know he\nYou know by by the standards the Nineteen forties he was an older guy but by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy I'm when he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three [noise]\nUm but I Want to go back a minute and talk about the assassination squads Hitler we're sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nOh yeah they were what was going on the other side of history that has now been revealed and this is what's so interesting about about writing things afterwards because that bed confessions come out diaries or published a you know with a documents are declassified and then you can really go back\nAnd really and that's what I like to do um some people right to make friends I write to solve murders a call me crazy so he can really go back in pieced together the snippets of of what was going on so I'm the decay inspiring with the Nazis firing\nA was a large aspiring American history thirty three members and they were over here to assassinate and sabotage anything as they get their hands on\nUm operation Pistorius' or was another analogy aspiring eight members\nAre that are created after Pearl Harbor or they attack civilian targets that has a state and they were all caught and I leave\nEach one of them except for one seven of them got the electric chair one got Thirty years in prison because he flipped on the other ones did they ever get close to Roosevelt\nOh yeah absolutely they did but Stalin was closer Stalin had infiltrated so much Roosevelt Roosevelt is I'm White House it was a it was incredible so this is it this is what I was saying about\nThe parallels to modern day and people think oh this was Seventy some odd years every five years or whatever what have you\nAll this you know this was all history is not all his reasons repeating itself okay so here we have in the White House again\nI'm Roosevelt was basically screwing everything in the White House and here we have another up another president who's accused of all of these things prior to being in the White House\nAnd uh the the Russians had completely infiltrated the communist soup lately and frustrated I'm I'm FDR's whites\nBut then I'm sure it on the road and here we go again here's the Trump the same thing he's being accused of the Russians infiltrating his White House\nSo he's given example of give me an example in in Roosevelt White House of some of the the communists and they had here\nFor the first communist that overhead as there was a Monday house which was um a Woodrow Wilson's 'em right hand man as far as um the communists and so forth they came that were involved in um FDR's White House\nI couldn't list them all uh\nThere there were there were hundreds of them at least Fifteen high ranking officials enough the White House where knowing communist starting with Harry Dexter why all the way through the elder us\nAnd they were in all kinds of different uh in also Harry Hopkins which turned out later he was fingered in Nineteen Ninety and I'll talk about Harry Hopkins is a it links later so they don't get bored and go away it's more common [laughter]\nUm the or the White House at the White House had been infiltrated as in the following places that I could find the agricultural adjustment administration the attorney general's office the department of state the national labor relations board the labor advisory board\nOr the war productions board the price of administration the U.S Treasury Department U.S Treasury department was infiltrated by the communists was incredible and the public welfare committee\nSo I won't bore you one with a laundry list but it's in my book of all of the people who were you know who were in that list or who are high ranking officials in those are in that list of of people\nSo I mean he was just communists were all around them Harry Hopkins actually it was the HHS secretary of state\nHe was one of the architects of the new deal\nIt was one of FDR's closest friends in confidence and he was one of the top officials who sent to you know obviously every every I couldn't travel very well because of his affliction and you know the races in the wheelchair and so forth so we had to have someone fly over to talk to Stalin and so forth\nAnd uh that person was Harry Hopkins um who's Harry Hopkins actually was a friends of Eleanor Roosevelt 'em through the ah CPU essay the Communist Party United States of America which is still in existence by the way up north I mentioned that or not\nAnd how to Hopkins is down and get on\nFamously he was actually ... Harry Hopkins as time went by he was also architect could lend lease program to help the Soviets out\nSo Harry Hopkins famously got along with Joseph Stalin because Stalin was warming waters in America before all of this happen okay I'll get to that in a minute\nOr he was Harry Hopkins afterwards fire afterwards was fingered by a cage he'd be a factor and I'm going to butcher this name\nI'm old they grew up ... and there's a name here I just simply couldn't even begin to pronounce they both identified 'em they were both KGB defectors they both identified Harry Hopkins is the mysterious agent Nineteen who is contacting a Soviet Union\nAbout uh the the than on a project which of course we all know is a nuclear weaponry so here we have I mean there are informants and spies all around\nFDR so so the point where they he goes to the wrong conference you know I mean I see a style and knows more about Roosevelt than Roosevelt knows about Roosevelt and they're meeting at these conferences it was just it was incredible how how penetrated the Americans were er at the hands\nWell they're meeting at these conferences it was just it was incredible how how penetrated the Americans were\nUh at the hands of a lot of these weren't like that they didn't want information they just wanted to kill him Stalin right information he writes he had plans in the post war world of taking America does have communist anyway he\nHad plans of taking over America and making them a full communist country with him as a ruler so he was a little diluted in his own in his own right but\nHow this all happened was prior to this\nOf course this is a new ideology communism while this is great you know no one suffers and everyone does this and that and you know we don't have to go to work in every word is provided for well Stalin had sent invitations to\nUm to the directors in Hollywood a union leaders are college professors he knew the target\nAnd they would were sent invitations all expenses paid to go over to Russia to see how this this work and they went to a city in the city's names escaping me at home and it is are listed in my book\nIn the ... they were to observe how Russia did things and how everyone was care for and how this worked in how terrific it was and look at what we've done and you need to do this to your country because you're you know look at you look at your depression that's going on and so forth he really sees the opportunities town was not a stupid guy\nRight I I had an author on a couple of years ago who wrote a book about Ernest Hemingway and how are they tried to recruit anyway you add loudly\nSo it was a fictitious town that didn't exist that was made a cardboard basically\nSo they had been village a Potemkin village and there you\nGo um he sends all of these people home with literature and propaganda as to how they can transform their country meaning our country\nAnd to this wonderful new ideology you didn't know anything about evil umpires you know in the new deal you gotta cut Roosevelt will get a break here should never been done before so this was an experiment in amongst itself so\nThere's a lot going on here there's a lot a backdoor dealings in the spring party by Stalin Stalin is the puppet master\nHe uh he's this guy what he managed to accomplish\nIn his life was incredible he was one of the six original members of the votes of the revolution\nAnd he ended up there just to make fun of style and\nHe was nothing more than a he was to keep the party's journals and use the column\nComrade um with with the home Conrad index card used to call them gray blur used to make fun of him because he was just so worthless and the party\nOne by one knocked off everyone in the party to take control I mean the guy was it was just incredible what a what a ruthless megalomaniac this guy was\nThe Senate stop I'm I'm Sorry a lemon wrote that in his a quote from London's will become rich donors to root too dangerous remove

know you're on the east coast it's three forty in the morning and the three hours is a long stretch to talk so I just want to make sure you're you're doing OK and we appreciate you being here with us and staying up late so\nOurs is a long stretch to talk so I just want to make sure you're you're doing OK and we appreciate you being here with us and staying up late so I'm I wanted to talk about\nYou know so much of the post world a ... so much of the post war world is a result and then then the ensuing Cold War and and all of that really is a result\nOf FDR's frail condition he's greatly diminished mental capacity at the conference in your pain forty four when when that post war world was really carved up and style and obviously you know took advantage he seized upon Roosevelt spray all condition\nOr and and um FDR really didn't know what happened do you just was so out of it but I mean you you look at those pictures of FDR at the the L to conference and obviously he is is he looks like death warmed over but seven months before\nAt the Tehran Conference he looks is as fit as a federal I mean ... what is going on with what happened in those seven months\nWell up until this point we've been talking about the bond that we haven't talked much about the horrors that way we haven't talked about the murder and what's going on with them\nI'm happier as being slowly poison from within the White House and I have to be very careful here not to give this book away but it was a type of toys and let's see we're used to thinking of America is the leading edge on things and knowing all these things and\nWhat they were poisoning with with something that was plentiful that they didn't know was poisonous yet\nBut the rest of the world certainly did Europe certainly some of those countries in Europe or Fifteen hundred years old maybe older so in certain situations they hit a jump on us and you know\nI don't think grandpa Walton would've known anything about poisoning or the after effects of this poisoning especially because they didn't know it was poisonous at the time so\nFDR as being slowly poison from inside the White House\nEvery time he goes away too Warm Springs Georgia to sow his ailing legs and go on a retreat so he can mentally and physically rejuvenate himself he starts to get stronger every time he comes back to the White House he starts to get sick or so I [laughter]\nI did a little digging into this because it was just so what started me on this whole thing of FDR\nI thought it was a little suspicious and a little too convenient\nThat in the tiny march at Eighteen days a Roosevelt Hitler and Mussolini had all died conveniently at the end of the war I thought that was a little convenient\nSo this is what people actually it would just start looking into this for this and that I also thought it was all convenient that FDR just died of natural causes as allied troops were storming Hitler's bunker I thought that was a little to get a little bit convenient so\nAnd when I started to dig in and I saw that the the odd deterioration of this president during this time period I said you know wait a minute I've ever really got to look into this I didn't believe it in high school when we were taught about it back to them they actually taught history you know I mean\n[laughter] it but in the book you point out how his his doctors I guess Dr mcentire admiral a navy admiral mcentire his personal physician\nAnd is is cardiologist Dr Howard grew in they were they had no idea what was going on when he and they were doing X rays and take doing all of these tests they were really clueless\nWell and this is where you know this is where the rubber finally starting to meet the road for me they really work for what they were thinking the American public just thought oh\nWell and this is where you know this is where the rubber finally started to meet the road for me\nThey really work for what they were thinking the American public just thought oh he ... himself out for us and you know he was the advance of polio and this and that and the other thing in the symptoms of the his doctors were absolutely baffled he had a bunch of doctors Emma Ross McIntyre\nWas the White House physician he was also the vice admiral and in a surgeon surgeon general of the navy\nUm you know he was FDR's physician from thirty to forty five until he died\nA Dr Howard Bruins was a commander in the navy a course FDR's a navy guy who's going to have maybe doctors or he was chief of cardiology it but as though I mean these are heavy hitters they have no idea what's wrong with this guy no idea [noise]\nSo what they do is they take him to the doctor of the day and the reason why they're so\nBaffled as because FDR is getting sick after a meal times this is my first hand something was wrong in his blood pressure would bounce he would do normal and then it would do it would go roaring out of control three ten over one Ninety five or something\nAnd it would be up there and then it would come back and they were trying very hard to every ... wasn't responding his body wasn't responding to anything that they were giving him so we know when they when they got to this point they said look at you know\nNineteen forty four is ruined around this guy's going to run for president again again\nAnd we've got to get to the bottom of what the hell's going on here so they sent him to the doctor of the day\nDr frankly founder of the lead clinic in Boston and he's a surgeon and he is the guy in America at the time\nSo he examines FBI march in Nineteen forty four and um when he comes out was is a ... a glaring statement which is now available online you can look it up at the History Channel\nBasically saying that this is a dead man walking and do what he the laundry list of the symptoms that he reveals that FDR has does not align with the advance of polio they advance they align with the advance of poisoning\nFDR is being slowly poison\nStyling style and got him I can tell you that\nI'm styling wants FDR out of the picture or at least mentally incapacitated at the altar confidence because he wants to rule the world\nAfter yard he wanted to set up the for policemen of the world\nUm the United states Great Britain sign in the Soviet Union so they could all police there quarter of the world FDR didn't want to share the world with the answer is down didn't want to share of the world with FDR\nHe wanted to rule the world he was a megalomaniac with what he didn't Soviet Union of course we know that then it wasn't wasn't you know reveal to us until years later\nWho died that was part of the negotiation team in the U.S at ...\nOn the way back from the all time or one of Roosevelt aids died conveniently also on the brain and your as\nWell there are people dropping dead around FDR of rain any resumes all over the place that no one writes about again no one writes about this or his name was piled Watson and he was a high ranking naval officer he was on the way back I Believe from that surround conference dies on the ship\nOf a cerebral hemorrhage he gets back he being FDR he gets back a short time later I'm FDR's personal secretary also\nThe Americans are in relation to the doctor us Americans are he dies of his real hammer\nThe hours personal secretary\nAlso in the Americans are in relation to the doctor Ross McIntyre he dies with cerebral hemorrhage\nThe drug of the day is more free rat poison\nAnd its color was tasteless order Lewis and its circulating all over the place as a matter of fact style and got murdered was rat poison or offering them in from the internal is governor\nThat came out later as well so there's a lot going on war friend is not what got FBI would have been to sudden it would have thrown up too many red flags okay\nStyle wouldn't want it to deal with Harry Truman he wanted to deal with Harry Truman 'cause he wasn't as political savvy or so he thought he knew that FDR was um a tremendous mine and he couldn't outsmart them okay\nWe\nDo with your nut job\nTrick or treaters ambitious reduce back into the family friendly way to go trick or treating over thirty

[laughter] it was the same doctor who in Nineteen forty six wrote to the um the book being um the White House physician and that was a Ross and Ross McIntyre were they in on the murder I have absolutely no idea\nI I I couldn't say I have to say that they had good intentions they were just a little bit though they weren't maybe and\nAnd what happened to ... the Russian painter and her driver and and and um she tops husband\n[noise] well they just kind of disappeared into obscure I mean at the time or two afterwards well immediately afterwards well\nThey packed up the uh uh uh Robbins and assume it's off and they threw loose Lucy Mercer who he was having an affair with among others um [laughter]\nAnd um they tried to get a Warm Springs Georgia as fast as possible so in her book um her being I'm sure with off in her book she describes the place that they took to to get away from Warm Springs Georgia which I thought was a little crazy because\nIf it was a natural death um you know why I don't know why would you lie to flee the scene right right you know\nIt's you know and then there's a parallel here to the FDR's or to the JFK thing actually\nUm JFK shot in Dallas they break law to bring him to a lot of Dallas the autopsy should have been performed in Dallas they break law to bring him to besides the\nNow the law was the same in Nineteen sixty three it was it was a Nineteen forty five they did the same thing they broke the law removing FDR's body from Georgia bringing it to the pathologist so\nBoth you know both the JFK and FDR's body I removed a legally\nThey're both at but says though we're all kinds of fun things happen you know what this besides the could talk you know and then they they rushed this guy it's it's a little less than sixty nine hours from FDR's death to him in the open being buried they couldn't get this guy's body in the ground fast enough\nNo nor did by the way and no one involving no autopsy knowing bombing\nIs just one hour easier and crazier and crazier all the way through so I mean and there's other things in history to Richard I mean take a look at 'em you know not just this I'm going to be working on Princess Diana coming up next but there are other presidents in history who I also believe that a murder that they've lost over um\nWarren Harding Warren Harding\nWas it was that was obvious this guy was murdered and there's another one that we thoughts with us but as far as FDR is concerned I mean the the [laughter]\nThe information in my head just exploded when I started digging and digging and digging and it's still it's still boggles my mind in the book is going to publish for a little while now and I still even after the book is one published\nYou know I'll find a new fact and go wow I should have put that in the book\nI mean there's there'll be a volume three perhaps uh let me get the calls here and he's an Alabama and the wild card line any good morning walk because\n[noise] thank you Steve I'm calling to ask you about some written music ... she's one of several of Eleanor Roosevelt garden party she said to my aunt who work at the state department and manage your mind now\nI'd also like to ... cents an experience with the blood thinner prescribed for my grandmother which was worked for in a college student has things all over her looked like Bruce cities because it causes bleeding all in the body it's more than\n... ... pounds in eight you're isn't\nThere you go but you don't you say it wasn't a warfare and with Roosevelt because that would have been too quick\n[noise] yeah it was it wasn't people around him they were disposing of with the war for him because it and she's right she's right I mean it's been the blood out to to the point where if you touch a person they'll get you know either their their brains will either bleed or they'll have an ... or something or cerebral hemorrhage\nAnd they'll also and of course I Know Dr but you know my parents were both on it they're both on a variety of low center so\nLike my father was as well sure definitely cause breathing that any thanks for calling on\nThank you uh let's go back in the wild card line is it my dad in New York\nMy Hi there Matt Good morning okay a quick a three part of and I listen all over the and\nFinally I Love fall I heard um I'm In it gentlemen on the air I heard what had top plea or also believe that the waste waste a lot of it and I'd like to know if he said no you hadn't have is Haley around that\nI sat in ... and what is it that grasses so he would be someone\nThe ... with him and he is the area round at\nUs in ... and what is it the grasses so he would be someone that would talk about that new the new deal as a uh doing the right thing around that that they offer the so called Great Depression\nAnd so I like it thought on that and last late\nEvening in about both of the Russian connection and it's a both FDR and is a current stable genius if you will and the White House\nIs saying somewhat different because ah with the current administration they seem to have more to do with leading up to even now he wound up as president\nAnd of course the money that he had to go to encounter writes in Saudi Arabia and I'd like to elaborate on ... and and of course the ad that do see a fifty fifty sad you know we know that he has a ... and in\nMy I had if I could just jump in here because we're not talking about Trump I think if it's enough to put words in your mouth but I think you were being kind of facetious or\nAbout the Russian connection with Trump but let's just stick to to FDR where we could do a whole show perhaps another time on on the Russian dos and so forth but you're right ... a big fan of FDR\nI Know Webster a little bit in and I've had dinner with him and and he waxes on about the new deal uh obviously Steve you're you're not a fan did you have anything to add\n[noise] uh no I don't know the man I Would love to meet him sometime uh as far as the new deal I think it was probably the right thing at the time\nI think it was an experiment I don't think anybody knew how it was going to go 'cause I Want it to my knowledge there's never been done before so I mean it I have no doubt that they thought at the time it was a really good thing and help a lot of people um it just wasn't along sustaining campaign so\nAs far as the Russians in the current administration yeah I was kind of a little facetious as to how\nHow everyone is in our history you're kind of repeats itself what kind of doesn't you know um it's it's amazing how we have the [laughter] we\nWere right back in the same thing we have another red scare and in the country it's it's really it's really something else that village or who's also for her if it were alive you know it would it would really enjoy this I think\nRight so I think the point they're making their was that the the Russian connection during FDR's time was overt uh and today it's I guess you would to coin a phrase from CNN it's nothing burger [noise]\nRight I mean if I mean if they ever prove that with Trump which I don't know if they're ever going to um they may I don't know I'm not privy to that information but it's it's just interesting how how old the two of the history is another red scare it's starting to repeat it solve all over again\nAnd here we are Seventy some odd years past it's funny with is how history repeats itself becomes relevant actually\nA very interesting book I think you'll like it thanks for less than I ever growing up\nWe will ah we're heading into a break here at the bottom of the hour and then we will get to a more calls people are lined up in Chicago Pennsylvania Gulfport, Mississippi San Pedro California Sioux Falls South Dakota we'll get to as many of you as we can\nFor having me real quick to think wind up if you look at a at Roosevelt\nUh Nineteen forty four you look so bad I have a hard time thinking that it had to kill him because he was going to die anyway that's why they got rid of Henry Wallace may prove to buy for the night before or campaign 'cause they didn't think you've got a list\nOf all I don't I've read up on this or that they would do and how I got away with all the stuff when Roosevelt God dollar buddy to look at Roosevelt body apparently and make sure that a let's see if he would he would call you because I'm calling it a lot of that\nAnd I think he would prefer the story was that it was ... to ... he won the Roosevelt lip ... to break them up with a cold that the that Iran and uh you know and all that and gotten the deal he was afraid of but I I Can't buy the fact that the dollar one of the debt I I think he did not want him that he wanted to live on the top like that's just my take on it\nAll right interesting John ... bad shape you going to die anyway All right Steven you want to reply [noise] um\nYou know there's a lot of people who read up on things and to the Victor goes the spoils okay a lot of the things that we've been sold 'em have known slanted okay I'm not suggesting that what you said has been he look so bad in Nineteen forty four that was after almost two years of being poison systematically poison\nThat's why he looks so bad in Nineteen forty four this wasn't from the advance of polio and it spills without very very plainly in my book so it's it's an interesting time in history it was an awful lot of people who research those and I learned from\nTo know every little angle that's for sure but um as far as style in style in one of the rule the world he didn't he didn't have any interest in sharing anything with FDR\nSo if he sent something to look in the ... in the in the coffin sent someone to verify what was going on\nHe was already being where the death was already verified from the two Russians that were in front of him when he died\nSo if if indeed that happened and it may have I'm not suggesting that it didn't if indeed that had happened it was probably just so he could uh you know get recognition of the fact that we weren't giving them some sort of falls propaganda\nI John thank you for that to me to sing points there ah let's see how to James in Philadelphia\nHi James good morning lock up the coast to coast\nTrying to Richard I'm In fact my guess for my question for Mr ... is there still are banning it in your research physical\nOr did you come across or anything about this just to ... an attempted coup against a Roosevelt in the thirties and dad or if it did happen if you came across it how close was it a ... happening\nAnd that that causes ... uh it was a exposed by an army general smelly butler into one of the people involved was a I think was a Garth or did you come across anything about the coup how if it if it's true how posted it come the happening\nOr if it if it did happen if there was an attempted\nCoup against Roosevelt\nNot something that you discuss in the book or is it sees\nA James thanks for calling and I did run ran into that information but it was after the book was published so you won't find that information in there I thought it was fascinating when I did run across it didn't make the book I'm Sorry I Wish it did\nUm and ... yeah I don't really I don't know I guess that people say a lot of things I don't know how true that really is\nWith the amount of people who are round Roosevelt who didn't like him for multiple reasons\nI'm from you know suppressing the uh the the capitalist to holding office as long as he did it would not would not surprise me but I mean as far as as far as that's concerned I don't have any I don't have any great knowledge into that I discovered it after the book but I did run into it so\nThanks for your call and I'm Sorry I couldn't be of much help there like I said I I I I Would be lying if I said I felt that I knew everything\n[laughter] I like James thank you for that Wayne is in Chicago Wayne good morning welcome because\nYou're rich or one time you cannot do you feel richer out do you feel very returned from from nine to ...\nWell that's very kind of you to say but it's you know it's going to guess like Steve who who make my job very easy\nRight where are our two guys American minister um I think the Mars commercial back in the day to Mars period and commercial where we're to talk about a rich ... goop charcoal or just a matter of the regular commercial certain certain they're triggered a bar in the third criminal\nYeah [laughter] I was almost getting hungry Wayne and tell you had to bring up a church [laughter] I don't know I Know\n... remember the

NPR committed suicide nurse why Eleanor hurry up and buried him so nobody knew about it I I've been looking for the man on the on line on ... where are the sorts of rumors knock you're fine but he gave a very compelling period\nIt would be very ... million on induce gifts on right now to compare notes where do you think we're short I've I've\nBut I'd have to I'd have to look into that um [noise] I guess the question would be why why would he um why would he do that I don't even have you have you ever come across anything indicating that any theory that if that FDR means tried to take his own life or did they can go next\nYou know that's a new one on me uh I haven't heard that but again like I said I'm I'm you know I I Know what I Know I don't know what somebody else knows [laughter]\nI just I just I wrote this book and I thought I followed the line of facts that brought me to it and I found information along the line who who operate it\nYou know if somebody else has come up with that I don't I don't maybe as quality of life couldn't have been great you know with the with the situation in the head with this polio I mean anything's possible people said that Elvis Presley committed suicide to\nUm I certainly have certainly uncovered and who murdered Elvis I certainly uncovered information that the bones bad but\nI guess anything's possible I mean if there is a situation where I can get on the air with the other fellow you know what I mean I Would respectfully love to do so\nI'd like to look into that uh Wayne thank you for that can you hear Neal wall welders in Pennsylvania we're moving fast You're welcome morning welcome to coast to coast\nOr Richard nice to talk to once again likewise thank you\nWhy should I don't want their children up Mr ...

that sixty three FDR was already beating the odds soda ... big now\nA dish in the medical science she must primitive than that or we can go back bring the Elvis when Elvis died in Nineteen Seventy seven or the medical science compared to the day was permitted\nNow as I recall Mr obeying the I Believe I called the last time Mr Binnie when John and he said that Elvis had no history of heart disease now uh with all due respect Richard his mother\nWas born in Nineteen say steam died in Nineteen fifty eight which would make her at the most forty two and she died and his father died relatively young I Believe ... said when So Richard we have to ask ourselves whether or not it was in the genetic cards for outlets to level long live\nSteve can tell you that he's and then he talked to the person who held Elvis's hand heart in his hands and said that there was no loss the do you tell there was no evidence of a heart disease at least none that I Would be sufficient to kill him I mean it may have developed later but it wasn't present at the time of his death\nRight Hi well thanks again for your call I'm Gladys died because colonel Parker she was ... was ... okay\nColonel Parker till Gladys that you're obese and I can't fill me with Elvis and I wanted to take pictures with you with Elvis because people want to see Elvis his mother because there was a rumor out that Elvis had shot his mother\nWhich was ridiculous so he said I Want you to take his diet pills I Want to you skinny so I can put you in pictures with Elvis I'm the diet pills and the alcoholism combined is what killed her okay\nThat's what happened with that as far as all of us is concerned in his heart um there was no real evidence of a heart attack I'm In a I talked to Dan ... who was actually ... the autopsy\nAnd they took Elvis Presley is hard and they caught it they thinly sliced it\nEvery quarter inch\nTo look through everything and they held every quarter inch ... up to the light and you look at it\nThere was no real evidence of a heart attack there was no ... there was no hemorrhaging there was no nothing\nElvis frozen his heart was a little oversized whatsoever for all of his other organs he was years away from heart disease and you can clearly they said that um there was there was no uh Elvis Presley did not die from any sort of a a cardiac event now the coroner\nWho said that he died from a a cardiac arrhythmia was telling stories and mother goose here we have the autopsies not even finish these have certainly than any uh he's telling the world that Elvis Presley died of a

twenty for about two years and I think the friendship came about through fame just fan crossing pads and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of a discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I

so they would sort of do their own\nSort of photos psychic act or on stage and I don't know if they didn't explain to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this secret coated method\nThat that Harry and best could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody methods\nI think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to uh anybody that's interested in this it's all explained in the essay quite clearly\nThere is a list of ten words and the tenth word is actually a phrase in each word corresponds to a number number one through Ken and number can can also be taken to be zero\nAnd so this was used to point most commonly to the date on a coin so that's how the trick would normally work when Harry invest first met and Eighteen Ninety four that's when they got married they would do this little trick where they would\nHave someone volunteer they'd reaching their pocket ... ... what is the last two digits on the coin\nAnd they these were which ... play answer say now tell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number and so they would work these words into an easy sentence like\nQuickly Harry I Know you can do this and that would be number eight\nAnd so it has a natural miss to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nAnd that would be number eight and so it has a natural them is to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nRight so if the coins at best held in her hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty eight\nAnd because she would say she's communicating to him verbal using these code words and she said quickly quickly is corresponds with a number eight it's the eight eight were in in the rye secret code emitted so you know that he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right makes size right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just\nNumbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passed number tan but the way of doing that and that's what was used to make this code\nSo they would have had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases praying or say now ... please speak quickly look be quick and as you say all of this can be found in the essay let me just because people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical\nDot com infinitely mystical dot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work the essays posted there sorry I enjoy it\nThere's a link on their cars because now let's talk about this code because after the message was delivered took bath and she said that it works somebody quickly said hey this was all in a book is all already published in a book this is no big deal\nWell I thought I had read this on line a number of times someone would say within a book but they wouldn't say the name of the book out of the people were saying it's on page da da da da da da da da and then I finally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought\nYou know I'm going to look in the Santa Barbara county library and see if that book is there and I was so surprised to find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county\nAnd for all of twenty five cents they would move that book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out and eighty five year old book\nI couldn't believe it so I got the book\nAnd I scanned the relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just all of that may not say there's a link inside there to show you scan of this book and so that book does\nTalk about those ten words and how it's used to form numbers but not out a form or\nSo that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book\nAnd um let's see I hear a bullet points about this that the code can be used to form words not just numbers\nHow clever coating method works to form these words that they use this code and the afterlife experiment that the secret message would start with the onion coated word rose about that the secret message with in code word to leave and the actual\nSecret Ken word message none of that was in the book and the person who claimed that it was in the book\nThis is important to ask who this is he also is a famous magician and he's a close personal friend\nOf Harry Houdini so in this person says ah it's not a trick it's in the book everyone's you took him at his word did not look into the book and just believed that Ford was a fraud without looking into it anymore\nWe need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why was important for you to point out that this secret\nBecause we need to introduce a Ford and and why it was important for you to point out\nThat this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini a and therefore it may have been possible for so much to know about that because now we get into the sale\nAnd and uh we should back up and explain that on Houdini deathbed in Detroit and\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this was actually true but allegedly told them that\nI'm a skeptic I Am a dunk or I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way I can get a message to bass I Will try\nAnd then she has contacted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he hounded for get in touch with best\nWill\nI'll touch on that in just a minute but I just want to point out that I think that this worked because bass and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now\nScience runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine and I think it's really important for us to think about how well we love one another and how ... we are for kindness and compassion\nAnd we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine so back to your question um Ford was a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions\nAnd in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise]\nOne of its clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of hurricane Harry's mother intrude into this session and in his on putting the word forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to death\nWell that gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have\nAnd she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul and spirit with surviving gap and so she got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this any more they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford was well aware of Houdini his reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and\nHe did was I going to jump in here forgive me Thomas I got to jump in and got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini and best Houdini here's Jean night taking us into the break with do me on coast to coast them [noise]\nGo ahead and enjoyed the peace of mind ...\nToday for just Ninety nine dollars and music cardio dot com\nK. A. R. D. I. A. dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nThomas resentful my guess is the author of living the paradox of enlightenment and uh the uh essay we're discussing\nA Houdini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical dot com had promised Hi Thomas so let's get to the other say on a\nAt a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her or so so what happens [noise]\nUm are there Ford shows up and he either for it usually works the spirit named Fletcher and Fletcher is in touch with Houdini and this ability for the spirit world to communicate to our physical world\nIs a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother the spirit of his mother was also present to make this all happened and they were able to make it kind of a um like a show a very theatrical show where\nHarry would work with Beth the same way they work when they were on stage and user as an assistant and\nAnd have her a well he was very poetic with are very at times very touching and romantic\nAnd ah there were statements like throw open the curtain and all of this but what they did was they put this ten\nKey words on the table and then they decoded them\nAnd after it was decoded the message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I Want to explain that that's his nickname that Harry used for her with Roosevelt and this came about through a popular song right around the time when they got married\nAnd this song had a little bit or perhaps more of this song um\nAnd so have you called her Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was Roosevelt believe and it really really touched bass and she was very very strong and clear and her language that her husband had spoken to her\nAnd did anyone noted that anyone know that Arthur Ford no that Roosevelt was the pet name for best there was this common knowledge\nIt might have been known throughout the close friends um [noise]\nSo I really can't say about that there's a story going around that I read the other day on the Internet 'cause that's trying to brush up on his kind of set up someone said that uh there was a big\nRomance between Arthur Ford and bass who is Twenty years older than he had he saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of it and saw where it said Roosevelt and blah blah blah\nI just don't find this credible so I won't go into it but um yeah there are people that say that it's quite possible that they would have known that he referred to as Roosevelt but the believe is actually came through the decoding of those other ... and\nAnd again he just he he didn't of of forward through his spirit guide Fletcher just just didn't show the word believe they used the secret coding message and we had mentioned earlier using those keywords pray answer ... please speak quickly look can be quick in and these all\nWindy coded spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe\nYes [noise] yes and um and she declared easy access she declared it a success correct\nAbsolutely and I'm In fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who is president to say on set off this is a lot of nonsense that wasn't true and and so that's that's why her statement says regardless of any statements made to the contrary\nI Wish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence\nGiven to me by Arthur forward is the correct message prearrange between Mr Houdini and myself and then it's signed by not only herbal three witnesses one of them as a representative of the United press\nAnother one is one of her lifelong friends and another one is someone from Scientific American\nAnd these this this letter was reprinted in the New York times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this was a success that it happened\n[noise] yeah I think so in effect of the newspaper articles that I was reading you could clearly see here in support for a good while\nAnd then around fourteen months after this there's a hard switch where she suddenly start that they're now denounced that anything was valid that there was any evidence whatsoever\nThat this was a genuine contact so it's it's quite shocking um\nBut before that before she sort of recanted there was another a reporter with a ... a either a magazine or a newspaper called the New York graphs for ROTC rather than your graphic and tell me about this reporter ... is it ... ... I Can't pronounce the name but to go to another\nOne name but I think the first name as R. E. A. and I think it's pronounced ... right um she had an apartment and she invited Arthur forward over to visit her and she was going to interview him and she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in a closet but they're hiding somewhere and they're going to witness this exchange\nWell the person that shows up is not really author Fort it's someone that's been paid in person ate Arthur Ford and he shows up and he says uh I paid Mrs Houdini some money\nI'm just here to tell you the truth [laughter] I just you know it's really funny because ...\nHeard about at well as the reporter wrote this up and so has responded in a letter\n'em to that same paper where she just completely denies it there she's been a party of fraud in any way\nAnd if Arthur Ford said that they were in cahoots he's a liar I mean she was very clear in this letter goes on and on and I'd never seen this letter until um yesterday and it's in an article posted\nOn a website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nYou know and this was written to Walter windshield the great Walter ...\nThat's what I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter rental and he was um yes the social they go to guy you know and um but this kind of made it look like it was a letter written to this um the New York evening graphic\nBut it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was very supportive and these these were supposed to be private letters\nThe letter starts off saying this letter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity you know I'm just telling you I was no party Danny fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where\nIt looks like someone saying oh we've got prove there's fraud he can fast and then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time\nSo Arthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point best Houdini further uh money's the water because although she has been insisting and insisting that had happened then she does an abrupt about face\nYes and you know in the very first days after the message happened\nIn one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way my family and friends they don't buy this you know they don't believe in their communication you know and so and I think that this faster and she was tired of being ridiculed by her friends\nBeing labeled and not um and I think she just sold it and said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like\nIf anyone says they get in touch with me after my death and know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with anyone [noise]\nUm so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the sanson twenty nine was she recanted and changing their position\nI think it was about fourteen month\nFourteen months and but also she had at some point she had offered up a an award a reward ten thousand dollar prize to how anyone to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it said was really interesting\nTo yeah because you know if he really wasn't boots with Arthur Ford he could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple of weeks before this happened I retracted the offer well that sounds you know pretty pretty iffy\nWhereas if they were in cahoots he could've said I'm so happy that she is so generous but I don't want my spiritual progress to be hindered by some kind of monetary motivation you know would have been much more graceful you see it I mean but it was just days after where she says I'm not going to pay the money\n... connection you'll get the fastest Internet available download speeds up to nine hundred and forty ...\nTV phone added to your price guarantee off for Seventy nine Ninety nine per month with a two year agreement\nPlush get two hundred dollars toward a range of Google and that's smart um devices and a one hundred dollar visa prepaid card when you order online\nHurry offer ends October thirty first go to get ... switch to the one hundred percent fiber optic network\nOne hundred percent phenomenal\nWhat is every time you went out and you can cash in the capital when the required us for cash back on dining and entertainment light and their first have to walk them all\nAnd four percent cash back when you take your keep peeling museum for the first time [laughter] [noise]\nNo matter your reason for going out now you have four more introducing the new season card from capital on four percent combining and four percent on entertainment your wallet terms applied capital one bank usa in a\n[noise] news and talk on the radio\nRadio searching when men\nHunch in Georgia I'm Pam Susannah Fox News the fatal shooting of a police officer has authorities in Georgia looking for a teenager officer Anton Tony was killed yesterday in granite county\nSaucers a vehicle that show [laughter]\nTrump keeping the pressure on his political opponents democratic\nHas become an angry roof was on the mob determined to get power by any means necessary [noise] the president\nWrapping up a series of rallies in the west that one in Nevada where Senate Republican Dean Heller is facing a tough challenge from democratic congresswoman Jackie rose and Democrats also hitting Nevada hard no matter how\nYour your your never ever just read a lecture goes as consequential as the election nationally and\nLocally former vice president Joe Biden in Las Vegas former President Obama will visit Vegas tomorrow\nDeadly election disruptions in Afghanistan where a roadside bomb killed nearly a dozen civilians including several children today is a parliamentary elections got underway yesterday the first since twenty ten\nThe LA Dodgers and the Boston Red Sox for me to stay for game one of the world series the Dodgers knocking off the Milwaukee Brewers last night this is Fox News\n[noise]\nThis is ...

he's trying to buy a pair of socks at Kmart to show you know well he's just one of us and he had no idea what to do when he got up to the cash register [laughter] it's funny how that\nIt's funny how they will amongst us\nBut they have no idea what the hell were about it's incredible really the ultra rich off during the ... people who just hidden and they don't have any idea about us or what we do you know and sometimes I Wonder if they really want to but it's not the right All right it hits the fan too it was\nJust like they lived in the clouds but he had he not contracted polio uh he ... he may not have been well he may have been president but it's certainly changed the trajectory of his life as you would imagine it would but also his politics\nTalked me about how polio affected FDR more than just physically\nWell I'll tell you what this is where I had gained a lot of a lot of respect but ah if I was not necessarily you know the ... and I'm not much of a socialist personal but you know when somebody I'm Down way with will end up or relatives to the point where all the looters their head\nAnd they fight their way back\nUsing sure will um installing bars over over the Web so they can use their arms and then dragging your body to try and get themselves will walk every day and the ... when that happened to them you know FDR was uh\nStarted to you know obviously you know they don't treatments came in and actually work extended to identify with people who are suffering and who are maybe they're losing a gigantic twice zombie pirate actually change of life\nRight I mean he he displayed ... you'd have to call it of heroism\nOr in the face of this uh this disease I mean he basically dragged he's he he had on a ... in France but he would drag himself from miles\nYeah every day he had this regimen that um you know he had like ours installed out in front of liberals mansion and he would\n[noise] exception these braces and he would use crutches and he was in it's just incredible but it it's you know twelve pounds of steel on each leg\nAnd he's a dragging and solve it is the deal the parallel bars where he's exercising bombs and then from the parallel bars closest route ... in front of a\nA R and then he's turning around and dragging himself back you know quote unquote walking trying to fix stops and you know if this is talk about iron clad will mean that was\nI was a was really something else or you\nWant to come back that that that and then of course he ended up in Warm Springs Georgia where the warm waters with some of his wage and have been my children and other people with other selections and\nThat really have to live to identify with people in need and suffering so it really changes what for sure\nAnd then there's the fast track or to the White House I'm just sort of ... we we we we've got about five five minutes before we head into the break at the bottom of the hour but let's just give me a sort of a sudden they'll sketch of ... of his journey\nIt was governor of New York or is it under secretary of the navy\nIs trucks with a White House started or whether it Wilson and turtle huddle house actually who\nWoodrow Wilson was his idol colonel house was Woodrow Wilson's won't be like they didn't know what if they find that he was a it was it was a hostile only point and um they were ... they fall in love with this\nCommunist ideal and um you know of course they didn't know anything about it really that but it was just great then yeah it was through at um ... house and I'm\nI'm a geologist and actually that was the assistant secretary of identity and from their intended user Roosevelt man and that the political connections of New York to run for governor and then once governor I'm you know it was a\nWas a jump to the White House for him\nAnd he asked them to come out of the time when a game became really some of the things that I wanted to do\n'em over wanted to do but you know he was a hit gang a\nCooperating very well with the with over some of those were his ideas and um they don't have to jump right to a jump right to the White House and started a he originally ran on tax cuts and everything and we realize that the that old isn't working you completely flip\nAnd with a with a socialist end of it and uh you know we're raising them or ... even ... like watching the suffering so\nRight well we'll get into the the new deal in the depression and and and so forth and and the fact that it will do this after the break but I just wanted to mention the idea that someone in a in a confined to a wheelchair or and it had a such a debilitating disease polio\nOr for that person to to rise to the White House at a time when as you point out in who murdered FDR at a time when a physical handicap like this was also also equated with sort of see moments of mind and how\nWithout I guess the complicity of the media that sort of agreed you know to not talk about it he never would have been president\nYou know it's amazing the parallels he'd live very cooperative very sympathetic maybe they're just like today no ah [laughter] it's like today without whether I Know that I grew up in prison for\nSure [laughter] absolutely halo suffering as he gets a free pass to\nBe a total of between these two guys will have to talk about when you get that but uh it's it's it's a history basically just repeating repeating itself a blue\nThe Russians and the White House and you know just all kinds of things it's incredible are like happening it out and no one no one catches with you know that's really something else\nBut how is it that's a\nThat no one sort of you know notice store or said hey wait a minute our president is gonna is in a wheelchair where he can barely walk is he equipped you know this is the thinking back then you know obviously we know better now but the idea that back you know Seventy eighty years ago\nOr ... no one would take notice of that\nWell they they they pick their camera shots well and actually I Would hope people for a few hours a day that this was a guy and he was he could really think done four or five\nThought processes that one is that what you really really really really tough so what do you do is we can do it with ... someone ... you will lose their arm\nIt's really really tough when you do is usually like without someone ... you will come and help but watch or eight or something it\nWould appear to be walking picket couple of steps so it could I just you know by all the young is a little bit different than the shops and you know they they do remarkably well so or to ward off the fact that in case anything do you\nEat painting a shirt shopping to go public and claimed that you know if I lose experience was showing any for X amount of hours so I mean propaganda in those oils blowing Walsh jak done you know it's just that they knew was smaller and easier to control\nThat you didn't have other things you know cell phones and cameras on the phone so you know why they're at work\nWhen he won the the the first election or you know they'll get the whole idea of the one hundred days those first one hundred days which you're seen as being so important today in the media what does the president accomplish in his first hundred days that really started with FDR didn't it but ... the kind of cheated that a little bit\nYeah absolutely the um\n... like the ... it's higher I'm struck\nThe ... amendment had changed debate in which the president was going to be flown in from march until January so you didn't go into effect until October of Nineteen thirty three which meant that rules or at a waiter take office for or extra so this mystery\nThing all the hundred days and they still judge presidents by ... it

FDR is is one of those presidents that you either you either loved him or hated him\nAnd uh he certainly made a lot of uh of enemies rate out of the gates let's let's talk a little bit about\nUh what was happening in America when he came into the White House\nAnd of course the United states at this point is is in a mired in a in a horrible devastating depression like fifty percent unemployment and the banking system it failed and there's just so paint that picture for us how bad it was\nIt was pretty bad ah the president preceding Hoover ... county going and of course we remember the roaring twenties well let me go you know I'm you know things were starting to\nGoing and of course remember remember the roaring twenties well let me go you know\nI'm you know things were starting to where it started out selling to be able to afford luxuries and the country but Hoover got in and fill it with the knowledge and lovers and raise the taxes and put some regulations on and here that fast\nAnd ah you know so here comes FDR in ... there's a lot of people who are really in trouble and suffering so he has this has low vision of legislation\nA in a you know in order to help these people in or so he thought and he did he did a great deal of hell for a lot of people we put people to work and it was on the government or the government paycheck and um this was the experiment from the communists\nThe communist part of the United states of America had already set up camp in Nineteen Nineteen in this country okay so all of this information or was coming through\nOr his friends and the Communist Party of the United states of America and they're still in existence by the way and then you're a New York city\nOr and so this is was their idea of how to help the workers in the working class and it was a flood of legislation or were they just basically regulated everything from banking to basically if you if you if you were able to take oxygen FDR regulated it at that point\nEverything from farms to banking to securities act and all points in between\nSo this was done to put everyone to work on the government do so we could have this\nCradle to grave wonderful society that Stalin and the Soviets had fooled us into thinking existed new ideology they thought that it was going to be this great thing where we're going to escape the uh the peaks and valleys of communism and you know the government was in charge of everything and all this new wonderful\nPeaks and valleys in capitalism I think you meant the I think he's the communism ... I'm Sorry about that I hear the noise the\nPitfalls and valleys in ... of of of capitalism you know so right\nYou mean ... if I might you because you you are you you print a list of legislative\nUh um actions that were enacted\nA in in who murdered FDR and I'm just read here I'm In the emergency banking act the government economy at the beer wine revenue act of creation of the civilian conservation corps abandonment of gold standard the federal emergency relief act agricultural adjustment act\nEmergency far mortgage act Tennessee Valley authority act securities act aggregation of gold payment clause homeowners look lone act\nGlass Steagall banking act national industrial Recovery Act emergency railroad transportation act\nAnd the farm credit act um and he I mean he did this really without much cooperation from the Congress didn't he\n[laughter] he just basically ... through I wasn't going to bore everybody with that Richard I'm Glad you did that I Will\nDo that I'm happy to bore them with it here [laughter] so I mean it's just a laundry list\nBut it's just it gives you a sense because you mentioned you know that this was rate out of almost like the communist manifesto that that he had the kind of control that Stalin had in the Soviet Union which is kind of an interesting parallel\n... it's very true it granted it was the Walt Disney version of it but it was it certainly\nIt certainly was the same basic control he was carrying just like Stalin style and just Persian all of his enemies you know if you got in a way of style and you know you ended up that his first two wives his doctor who told things to\nUm you know he he just went crazy um the great purge was basically a show trials to put anybody to death that either disagree with him or to challenge them politically\nAnd that kind of Stalin did it FDR did it by what packing the Supreme Court\nRight what happened is my\nWorried you know there was an election coming so you know he thought that people were getting a little bit you know a weary of the new deal so he came out with a second new deal it also wasn't working to the extent that he thought okay\nSo well all of this was going on in Europe is great war is brewing you know he's seen lots of Europe's war we're going to do our thing we're in trouble we're staying out of it\nSo if this was a great a second new deal must be better so um and they start to put a you know implement and then the second new deal and they start to realize that\nSubstantial portions of it were unconstitutional so\nThe um he had to pack the Supreme Court to see if you get past than it was I mean he was really really fiddling with things I mean a tremendous amounts and I know in the history books\nHistory books say a lot of things are I Know the history books paid him as this wonderful magical genie of or economic success he wasn't there was an economic failure\nPeople were ah they were surviving and that was about it that was about all they were doing and the you know unless we got into that war and started to move some goods and services we were all you know we're we're we're still going to be in the new deal for until his death I mean it was it was a it was a ... it was a ... because I asked her feet\nHow do you use the trading with the enemy act or to to to gain more power lend lease there's new spring the you know the the trading trading with the enemy act\n[noise] [noise] well [laughter] again when he did was he was just an attempt to bolster the economy and the St Louis is the same thing with the with the lend lease program\nHe was moving you know munitions in goods and services to the to the to the ... the access powers and he was giving them to the to our allies you know a free France included and eventually this the Soviet Union\nSo that we could win and they were just running up a cash register to be paid back at a later time so there is a you know there's there's a lot going on here I mean he started or he had to do that because he started to realize the new deal was not working\nSo there was no there was a lot going on economically in in our country\nAnd then there came to a point where he knew that we had to get into this war and the spies indeed and you know we have spies too I Know I Know it sounds terrible we do all countries have them we have spies to\nOur spies in Germany were starting to tell us\nThey're finishing your have your water experiments and with the beats who rockets to carry the nuclear weapons to all for it to the globe we'd be speaking German right now I mean they were on the brain so we had to get into this war for economic reasons and for other reasons\nIt was a great catalyst hear what's going on fascinating time in history scary time in history\nSo when the book you argue as many I have a hand that that FDR new Japanese attack on the U.S was coming the only question was when um then the question is a good he sort of make it happen duty let it happen or when he just sort of glad that\nYou know I say in my book that I think that the I was probably the greatest war president we ever had and that's because he just loved war\nHe did everything to make World War two happening I'm going to catch flak for that but you know what the words too bad it's true Iraq um the Japanese were their oil debtor nation meaning they don't create enough oil to run what they

Hitler was sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nOh yeah they were what was going on the other side of history that has now been revealed and this is what's so interesting about about writing things afterwards because deathbed confessions come out diaries or published a you know ... ... documents are declassified and then you can really go back\nAnd really and that's what I like to do um some people right to make friends I write to solve murders a call me crazy so he can really go back and piece together the snippets of of what was going on so I'm the decay inspiring with the Nazis firing\nA was a large aspiring American history thirty three members and they were over here to assassinate and sabotage anything as they get their hands on um operation Pistorius' or was another notch he's firing eight members\nAre they retreated after Pearl Harbor or they attacked salient targets and has a state and they were all caught and I believe each one of them except for one seven of them got\nThe electric chair one got Thirty years in prison because he flipped on the other ones they ever get close to Roosevelt\nOh yeah absolutely they did but Stalin was closer Stalin had infiltrated so much Roosevelt Roosevelt is I'm White House it was a it was incredible so this is it this is what I was saying about\nThe parallels to modern day and people think oh this was Seventy some odd years Seventy five years or whatever what have you\nAll this you know this was all his ... his reasons repeating itself okay so here we have in the White House again\nI'm Roosevelt was basically screwing everything in the White House\nAnd here we have another up another president who was accused of all of these things prior to being in the White House and uh the the Russians had completely infiltrated the communist completely infiltrated I'm I'm at the White House\nAnd we'll talk about that I'm sure it on the road and here we go again here's the Trump the same thing he's being accused of the Russians infiltrating his White House\nSo he's been examples of give me an example in in Roseville as White House of some of the the communists and they had he's here\nFor the first communist overhead as there was a Monday house which was um a Woodrow Wilson's 'em right hand man as far as um the communists and so forth they came that were involved in um FDR's White House\nI couldn't list them all uh there there were there were hundreds of them at least Fifteen high ranking officials and half the White House were knowing communist starting with Harry Dexter why all the way through the elder us\nAnd they were in all kinds of different uh and also Harry Hopkins which turned out later he was fingered in Nineteen Ninety and I'll talk about ... into the er at length later so they don't get bored on the way it's more common [laughter]\nUm the or the White House at the White House had been infiltrated in the following places that I could find the agricultural adjustment administration the attorney general's office the department of state the national labor relations board the labor advisory board\nOr the war productions board the price of administration the U.S Treasury Department [laughter] U.S Treasury department was infiltrated by the communists was incredible and the public welfare committee\nSo I won't bore you on with the laundry list but it's in my book of all of the people who were you know who were in that list or who are high ranking officials in those are in that list of of people so I mean he was just communist we're all around them Harry Hawk\nSpecials in those are in that list of of people so I mean he was just communist we're all around them Harry Hopkins actually was the HHS secretary of state\nHe was one of the architects of the new deal\nIt was one of FDR's closest friends in confidence and he was one of the top officials who sent to you know obviously every FBI couldn't travel very well because of his affliction and you know the races in the wheelchair and so forth so we had to have someone fly over to talk to Stalin and so forth\nAnd uh that person was Harry Hopkins um who's Harry Hopkins actually was ... ah friends of Eleanor Roosevelt 'em through the CPU essay the Communist Party United States of America which is still in existence by the way up north I mentioned that or not\nAnd how they Hopkins is down and get on famously he was actually ... Harry Hopkins as time went by he was also architect could lend lease program to help\nThe Soviets out so\nHarry Hopkins ... famously got along with Joseph Stalin because Stalin was warming the waters and America before all of this happened okay I'll get to that in a minute\nOr he was Harry happens afterwards fire afterwards was fingered by a KGB the factor and I'm going to butcher this name\nI'm old they grew up ... and there's a name here I just simply couldn't even begin to pronounce they both identified 'em they were both KGB defectors they both identified Harry Hopkins is the mysterious agent Nineteen who is contacting a Soviet Union\nAbout uh the the than on a project which of course we all know was a nuclear weaponry so here we have I mean there are informants and spies all around the\nFDR so so the point where they he goes to the wrong conference\nYou know I mean that'd be a style and knows more about Roosevelt than Roosevelt knows about Roosevelt and they're meeting at these conferences it was just it was incredible how how penetrated the Americans were\nUh at the hands of a an odd sees weren't like that they didn't want information they just wanted to kill him styling white information right he had plans in the post war world of taking America was have communist anyway\nHe had plans are taking over America and making them a full communist country with him as a ruler so he was a little diluted in his own in his own right but\nHow this all happened was prior to this of course this was a new ideology communism wow this is great you know no one suffers and everyone does this and that and you know we don't have to go to work in every word is provided for well Stalin had sent invitations to\nUm to the directors in Hollywood a union leaders a\nCollege professors he knew who to target and they would were sent invitations all expenses paid to go over to Russia to see how this this work and they went to a city and the city's names escaping me at home and it is are listed in my book\nAnd the they were to observe how Russia did things and how everyone was care for and how this worked in how terrific it was and look at what we've done and you need to do this to your country because you're you know look at you look at your depression that's going on and so forth he really sees the opportunity Stalin was not a stupid guy\nRight I I had an author on a couple years ago who wrote a book about resigning land how how they tried to recruit anyway you add loudly\nSo it was a fictitious town that didn't exist there was made a cardboard and basically so they had been village a Potemkin village and there you go um he sends all of these people\nIt's hard work basically so they can village a Potemkin village and there you go\nUm he signs all of these people home with literature and propaganda as to how they can transform their country in the country\nAnd to this wonderful new ideology they didn't know anything about evil umpires you know in the new deal you gotta cut Roosevelt will get a break here should never been done before so this was an experiment in amongst itself so\nThere's a lot going on here there's a lot of the backdoor dealings and strength poison by stone stone is the puppet master he uh he's\nThis guy would he managed to accomplish and his wife was incredible it was one of the six original members of the most of the revolution and he ended up there just to make fun of style and he was nothing more than a he used to keep the party journals are used to call them\nComrade um what did they call them Conrad index card it was to come a blur used to make fun of them because he was just so worthless when the party\nOne by one knocked off everyone in the party to take control I mean the guy was it was just incredible what a what a ruthless megalomaniac this guy was\nStanding stop I'm I'm Sorry I'm Lenin wrote that in his a quote from lenders will come rich donors to root too dangerous remove him\nAnd after someone's death they they called him a you know a pencil pusher and all kinds of stupid things\nMurder have I gotta I gotta jump in here Steve will take a timeout Wilson ticket taking us into the break with everybody needs somebody and then more on who murdered FDR stay with us here in coast to coast them [noise]\nIf you're considering going back to school after the following questions do you

they their grandfather's ashes and the cookies she wants to she mentioned was the one to the gray Persian the famine in Russia under Stalin\nAnd what's really going on Rick uh anybody you know [laughter] yeah\nWell it never ceases to amaze of when I just wanted to check in many ways because people need to know it's what you know you're on the east coast it's three forty in the morning and the three hours is a long stretch to talk so I just want to make sure you're you're doing OK and we appreciate you being here with us and staying up\nLate so I'm I wanted to talk about\nYou know so much of the post world are so much of the post war world\nIs a result and then in the ensuing Cold War and and all of that\nReally is a result of\nFDR's frail condition his greatly diminished mental capacity at the conference in your to and forty four when when that post war world was really carved up and style and obviously you know took advantage he seized upon Roosevelt frail condition\nOr and and um [noise] FDR really didn't know what happened he just was so out of it but I mean you you look at those pictures of FDR at the the altar conference and obviously he is is he looks like death warmed over but seven months before\nAt the Tehran Conference he looks as as fit as a fiddle I mean ... what is going on with what happened in those seven months\nWell over to this point we've been talking about the bond that we haven't talked much about the horrors that way we haven't talked about the murder and what's going on with them\nUm every hour as being slowly poisoning from within the White House and I have to be very careful here not to get this book away but it was a type of poisons should we used to thinking of America is the leading edge on things and knowing all these things and\nWhat they were poisoning with with something that was wonderful that they didn't know was poisoned\nYeah John things and knowing all these things and\nWhat they were poisoning with with something that was plentiful that they didn't know was poisonous yet\nBut the rest of the world certainly did Europe certainly did some of those countries in Europe or Fifteen hundred years old maybe older so in certain situations they had to jump on us and you know\nI don't think grandpa Walton would've known anything about poisoning or the after effects of this poisoning especially 'cause they didn't know it was poisonous at the time so\nFDR as being slowly poisoning from inside the White House\nEvery time he goes away too Warm Springs Georgia to sow his ailing legs and go on a retreat so he can mentally and physically rejuvenating himself he starts to get stronger every time he comes back to the White House he starts to get sick or so you know I [laughter]\nI did a little digging into this because it was just so what started me on this whole thing of FDR\nI thought it was a little suspicious and a little too convenient that in the tiny march at Eighteen days a Roosevelt Hitler and Mussolini had all died conveniently at the end of the war I thought that was a little convenient\nSo this is what people asked me we just start looking into this for and this and that I also thought it was all convenient that FDR just died of natural causes as allied troops were storming Hitler's bunker I thought that was a little to get a little bit convenient so [noise]\nAnd when I started to dig in and I saw that the the odd deterioration of this president during this time period I said you know wait a minute I've ever really got to look into this I didn't believe that in high school when we were taught about it back then they actually taught history\nYou know I mean [laughter] but in the book you point out how he he doctors I guess Dr uh mcentire admiral a navy admiral mcentire his personal physician\nAnd his his cardiologist Dr Howard grew in they were they had no idea what was going on and they were doing X rays and take doing all of these tests they were really clueless\nWell and this is where you know this is where the rubber finally started to meet the road for me they really work for what they were thinking the American public just thought oh he ... himself out for us and\nYou know he was the advance of polio and this and that and the other thing in the symptoms of the his doctors were absolutely baffled he had a bunch of doctors Emma Ross McIntyre\nWho's the White House physician he was also the vice admiral and in a surgeon surgeon general of the navy\nUm you know he was FDR's physician from thirty to forty five until he died\nA Dr Howard brewing was a commander in the navy a course FDR's a navy guy who's going to have maybe doctors or he was chief of cardiology emphasize though I mean these are heavy hitters they have no idea what's wrong with this guy no idea [noise]\nSo what they do is they take him to the doctor of the day and the reason why they're so baffled as because FDR is getting sick after meal times\nThis is my first hand something was wrong in his blood pressure would bounce he would do normal and then it would go it will do roaring out of control three ten over one Ninety five or something\nAnd it would be up there and then it would come back and they were trying very hard to every any wasn't responding his body wasn't responding to anything that they were giving him\nSo we know when they when they\nTo this point they said look at you know Nineteen forty four is rolling around this guy's going to run for president again again we've got to get to the bottom with how's it going on here so they send them to the doctor of the day Dr Frank\nAnd again we've got to get to the bottom with how's it going on here so they send them to the doctor of the day\nDr frankly founder of the lead clinic in Boston and he's a surgeon and he is the guy\nIn America at the time so he examines after the march in Nineteen forty four\nAnd um when he comes out was is as a glaring statement which is now available online and you can look it up at the History Channel\nBasically saying that this was a dead man walking and the what he the laundry list of symptoms that he reveals that FDR has does not aligned with the advance of polio\nThey advance they align with the advance of poisoning FDR is being slowly\nPoison styling Stalin guide them I can tell you that I'm styling wants FDR out of the picture or at least mentally incapacitated at the altar confidence because he wants to rule the world after yard he wanted to set up the for policemen of the world\nUm the United states Great Britain China in the Soviet Union so they could all police there quarter of the world after you I didn't want to share the world with uncertainty Stalin didn't want to share of the world with FDR he wanted to rule the world\nHe was a megalomaniac with what he didn't Soviet Union of course we know that then it wasn't wasn't you know reveal to us until years later\nWho wants it they died that was part of the negotiations team in the U.S at ... ...\nOn the way back from the all time or one of Roosevelt aid died conveniently also on the brain and your as\nWell there are people dropping dead around FDR of rain any resumes all over the place that no one writes about again no one writes about this or his name was ... Watson and he was a high ranking naval officer he was on the way back I Believe from that surround confidence dies on\nThis ship all the cerebral hemorrhage he gets back he being FDR he gets back a short time later I'm FDR's personal secretary also named McIntyre into relation to the doctor us Americans are\nHe dies of his cerebral hemorrhage the drug of the day is more free rat poison\nAnd its colorless pays less order less\nThan it's circulating all over the place as a matter of fact style and got murdered with rat poison war for him from ... from the internal that his government that came out later as well so there's a lot going on war friend is not what got FDR would have been to sudden it would have thrown up too many red flags okay\nStalin wanted to deal with Harry Truman he wanted to deal with Harry Truman 'cause he wasn't as political savvy or so he thought he knew that FDR was um a tremendous mine", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "21"}
