and um when that controlled holistic environmental chamber in other words each person's in personal isolation booth and I speak to them when we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber\nAnd then I present\nEmmy sank which is a ... brain synchronization\nTo kind of technology plus guided meditation and we do five of these uh day typically and what what the idea here is to guide each person to go into a nice deep meditative state\nAnd every person listening in their own isolation chamber through their heads up\nNow is it like a cubicle or a ... a day and a client or how you know it's\nA it's a it's a cubicle each person has their own individual cubicle that's the size of like a single bad okay and you can it's you can close it off completely you can block out um\nIt's the whole idea is to create an isolation chamber why is that because you can go deeper with no or external stimulus\nActions like I'm In many ways the same concept behind um the float chambers exempt in this case you are not floating you're you're in this this controlled unit\nAnd all the sound is piped into the room we use special technologies like him he sank\nAnd he has headphones on\nYes everybody wears headphones and I talk to them in their control unit and I guide them through these series of exercises\nAnd they don't feel a loner isolated right no that's the idea you are isolated I mean they don't feel alone because you have the headphones on out\nThere they're listening through headphones and any exercise minor typically about a Fifteen minutes long each one\nAnd and people go on these incredible journey and they have a friend who and who's in several times um where where do you think now anything sanctions ON Technology is the minority trying to get someone into a feta hate\nYes the idea is to get them as deep as possible um and the fate is of course are ideal for many people but the idea is of course to put yourself\nBy Nora beat technologies been around for a long time that it helps as you go deeper faster that's a concept\nOkay All right and then where do you go on this journey when I was like you and I know that there's a pattern that you take people's you know it it's kind of a song and I write\nWell there is a yes or relaxation I use sometimes what would be considered to be light hypnosis um there's different progression setter used but it's basically a mess\nProgram that's guided often guided where you would just go along with the program and um and have your own experience everybody has different experiences\nDuring even my program\nI'm teaching people how to self initiate their own out of body experience but in my class for instance\nPeople have pets life regressions mhm they have contact with all kinds of let's just say a non physical being different kinds everybody has their own type of experience\nWhen we open up to her inner self people experience different kinds of\nAh let's just say I open mind opening expansive experiences mhm so it's not limited to just out of body experiences\nA for instance past life or ... or regression type flashes are quite common and there's the whole idea is to open up to this inner party yourself where the answers are where you can begin to explore your true self\nIn to open up to that awakened to that multi dimensional self within you\nSee what types of questions could you ask the house and then you write them down when you come out of this like write it down right away\nYes what I always suggest is that right after the exercise\nYou everybody receipt gets a journal or they bring a journal and you immediately after the exercise you begin to journal whatever ... whatever kind of information may have come to you or imagery because information can be\nTransmitted many different ways it's not necessarily all the boy can be through imagery or through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways so it's it's important to be open to the way that you receive information\nBut uh people have all kinds of profound experiences\nAnd they awakened to their their true self and they're the answers within them\nMhm yeah so the implications than personal growth and the spiritual awakening that are\nHappening in these can really be transformational and I like it because you guide your house and then I mean in a way your experience you William have died in in the direction that I Would have my own personal experience now\nMy friend my friend has been against on the show before she said that she has in the past encountered souls that need help and I think that sense and eating out a little bit but not\nSure ah we actually have an entire class devoted to that where people meet and guide those people that just means the systems\nAre that's but that will happen in um\nIn all the classes that can happen I that comes up in my class as well or where people have contact and um provide guidance let's say to people that in ... there are people that have died but they are law store\nFor instance someone that may have died um quickly and they're just disoriented and they may need some assistance I Know that that type of thing does happen quite a bit\nAnd um at at ... at the Monroe Institute we off\nSo that that type of thing does happen quite a bit\nAnd um at at ... at the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focuses on that type of guidance called guidelines\nI'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others in that um [noise] and to let's just say a system to go to a higher dimensional space\nMm mhm so to a system in crossing over have you ever done this after a a\nTragic incident and national tragic incident where ... you know one\nI have because I I ... I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven era and myself and I received a lot of contact ah during that period of time\nUm that was a that was one of those events where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way I imagine you're having coffee one morning in your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body is gone ... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to even wrap our minds around that\nSo there was a lot of people that we're assisting those uh people that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and its functions and different names and different cultures\nAnd Institute we we presented in\nI think I'm more or let's just say I'm very grounded in a scientific waves at least a scientific as we can ... that goes for all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented\nIn a very logical way that's a understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich is yeah which is great because really allowed to have their own experience but then all of that I Want to find out a little bit more than ... one of the culture or does this and when it's cold and other cultures are going to take a quick break William thank you so much and when we come back\nWe'll talk about what are their consciousness existing and also a little bit more on how you can do this on your own\nShe's the victim of a devastating crime called mortgage fraud\n... title and mortgage are kept on line where thieves foreign and domestic hack them it's simple they forge your title and borrow every penny of equity you happen to your home like this police officer I Know about title fraud so I register with home title walking discovered some states had already taken over title\nThank God I found out on time no bank I don't eat that program or insurance protects you hold tight lock will\nFor pennies today how tight lock puts a barrier around your whose title and mortgage the instant it detects tampering there on it helping to shut it down to find out if you're already a victim of title fraud get your hundred dollar search free with sign up this at home kind of luck dot com\nHome title luck dot com\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nWell ... ... am\nRyan Lee cigar and my guest is William both men were talking about out of the tiny exploration and\nSelf induced antibody exploration not to trauma that to an actual workshop or\nIt sounds fun regulated type of out of body exploration is a thing\nAnd it's also well done it's very well done it and something that William Bowman has led for almost Twenty years that's in the ... specifically if it touches on something you can do on your own William read what other cultures has this existed in history\n[noise] Alicia from the very beginning of time I'm Out of body experiences are probably the quintessential I'm\nA way that throughout history people had profound experiences I mean look at a biblical like revelations begins with I was in the spirit and if you look back through all the biblical text all the transformational type of experiences people\nThere are consciousness was projected or extended let's say beyond their physical limits\nAnd that is in itself a form of out of body exploration it's just that was in two thousand years ago wasn't called that on the train it goes all the way back to ancient Hindu Buddhist text [noise]\nUm [noise] to every culture and\nIt goes all the way back to ancient Hindu the Buddhist text\n'em to every culture and religion known to man if you start to read it objectively you'll see there's comments about this uh I was in the spirit or I was beyond my physical body let's put it that way and there they had this profound experience\nHow can an out of body and validate life after life\nWell it gives you that infinite number one it's a shocker for many people just to be aware of the fact that oh my God I continue its a verification that you continue beyond your body\nAnd that's a that's a ... in itself a big life change or for people it's a wake any\n'cause then they realize oh my God there's I continue there's other things that are that are going on beyond the single experience and it really opens people's minds to the potential what they are think about it there's um seven and a half billion people on the planet\nAnd people don't have a clue where they're going to death they don't know where they come from before they were born and they don't know really what they are they they assume there are human being because they were they found themselves in the human body mhm but in actuality a consciousness\nUh can take on any for I I Know from having out of body experiences encountering are all kinds of life forms including by the way animals many people contact a love love pets six cetera\nDuring their out of body experiences and the pets are having out of body experiences\nAny new ones that have crossed over already\nKnow or even the ones that are alive I write about this is my first book where my my dog McGregor would would follow me out of body and I also had a cat that would do that ... I mean these this is we're just real events that are happening the fascinating people all over the world\nI mean we're a multi dimensional beans that's what we are and are biological body\nYou know we have to realize we're not we're not biological beings we're only here for a very brief period of time and then we exit and we move on to another state of consciousness\nAnd another energy body and that's what we've discovered without a body exploration is that it's multi dimensional and that death is in a ... really I'm no no that's been said but\nOnce you encounter and experience and communicate with loved ones who are passed and you're doing is face to face this is life changing\nYou no longer need a psychic to act as the intermediary you you you're empowered to discover the answers for yourself and it's really to find out what kind of journey or we all on 'cause this is an amazing journey of consciousness we all share\nYeah it is but you know what I shared this with you and I just interviewed Raymond Moody on my show and you know the ... the grandfather and clean the terms a life after death and\nUm he had\nExpressed to me after fifty years doing is\nIs that\nDoesn't know for sure that that yeah life have to get things yes because scientifically it's never really been proven even though he's heard ... and the report people who have experienced it\nEven though he's heard thousands and thousands of report to people who have experienced as a life after life ... he still doesn't as a scientist as a load generation right now I Know for sure\nThis is exactly why self initiated out of body exploration is so important because you get that verification absolute personal verification that you need\nBooks study research will never give you that kind of verification you can read a thousand books you could spend your entire lifetime studying this topic\nAnd it's not going to give you the inside and the verification you'll get from one out of body experience\nBecause suddenly you know you go from being a researcher or a believer to an hour and that's the big huge step that all of humanity I think is moving towards\nI mean we need to we need to wake up to what we truly are\n... and to get away from this bickering and confusion and division I mean once you realize that you're you're not just a biological being you know you're continuing as you're involving beyond this temporary stage of development\nIt puts everything into a whole different perspective and I'm not the first time I mean this is not the Buddhist have been saying this for a long time\nThat you know we're more than our bodies and that were involved in beyond the body and we are all life is evolving beyond the body this is a temporary stage of our revolution\nYeah and I meant to say that rain and then he coined the term near death experience sorry I didn't mean like a\nAfterlife that's his website you know what I did my own Google Search on I just typed in near death experience in over twenty five million searches come up on Google were not the only ones that are interested in is this is becoming more and more of a\nA phenomenon a popular topic people are interested in what beyond disorder now I have been yeah you know sort of place and like I said as senior anymore but I Want to ask you you you had an experience like if you\nWere sick and you had this experience for you

I think that's very high\nIt yes it was it was pretty high remember that a lot of people responding to me also were not um they were open to the experience to some degree I have to acknowledge that that's a good point\nAh they were not let's say indoctrinated with this health far and damnation ... I'm a belief system that of course is nothing but fear\nHere is a control mechanism it's been used for centuries to control the population a and it's still used today right actively unfortunately the control um ... you know societies\nOr we'll notice there's always an enemy and there's always some kind of thing that needs to be a feared\nAnd ... that is one of the great things that I think we have an opportunity to realize when when you have an out of body experience you realize number one\nYou were a mortal and it sounds a little grandiose for him you know that you know my God I'm more than my body I Am a mortal I'm\nI'm not some um we pathetic\nBeing that needs to be manipulated or told what to think I you know I'm I'm a powerful non physical spiritual be and that's amazing shift in consciousness for the individual\nI Am more than my body really does help you and your level of consciousness and forget about tiny problems in life that you feel are so large because our brains make them that way\nBut surely they are in significant when you compare him to how vast our our universe really is I'm Talking about being beyond Bonnie yeah yeah\nVast our our universe really is I'm Talking about us being beyond our body yeah yeah\nAnd what's so important is for us to have our own transformation or experiences I think that's critical to our evolution individual and collectively otherwise when you have your own profound experience\nYou you you can no longer be manipulated by these external forces around you because you know better you just look at it like it it's just the drama it's the game that's being played all around us\nAnd you look at it like that and you know it and that makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance a political drama that that you don't get sucked into that stuff 'cause you realize it's a temporary drama\nAnd and you understand there was a bigger game it's foot here you know the big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience\nSo that you know the answers for yourself and you're no longer upon of anyone else any belief system government religion you are free of all of that indoctrination and that's that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the the ... that we tend to get in with his his terrible news that\nWe have you ever did kill us and you realize it's you know there's so much important stuff that we need to know about ourselves\nThe greatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self ... that's the core issue involved in all the ills that face humanity is lack of knowledge of self\nIf every one seven billion of it's suddenly awoke one day and knew what we were and where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'd be no wars are being not no ... none of that would occur ... because we would know better\nThan if we really truly knew we were all connect it but there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly all be connected to only the ones that want to be connected to [laughter]\nWell we go beyond the ego\nYeah we we were going to take another quick Brinkley and when we come back we're going to take your\nCalls to feel free to give us a call in I only think I can listen he goes to condemn\n\n[noise]\nWell come back to coast to coast am Ryan Lee cigar and my guess William Bowman is joining me his website again is astral\nInfo dot org now uh we have great callers come in ... cause sure and has to go to Jamie in Washington state first time caller here and coast to coast ... what is your question huh how's it going great\nWhat is your question my friends\nI'm Luther King says there's any relevance between the out of body experiences in a memory loss\nOr questioned questions you mean not remembering the experience or memory loss in general\nCoalition a little bit of both uh either long term memory\nAnd of the uh out of body experiences so\nBut not interfering with your like everyday memory of needing to recall of certain things that you use all the time so to speak like we're in stuff like that and drive in things like that\nOh I Would say definitely not a I can speak for myself I think my memory um is excellent and I've been having\nOut of body experiences for over forty years or so I I well like I don't see any ah um correlation\nLike a TV I Would be associated with memory loss and ... and um she's when you have a brain trauma but not so much the out of body techniques it doesn't just served their brain memory patterns and All right\nNo I've not seen any correlation for that I\nUm I absolutely not matter of fact a lot of people that have out of body experiences or have an incredibly productive and\nLives in their late years like Robert my road did and others that are written many books I'm In their later years let's say [noise]\nSo if anything I think they're the opposite I think ah you open up potentially um certain pathways\nThere's the opposite I think ah you open up potentially um certain pathways that enhance your ability to ah remember and to function\nSometimes the have you ever experienced is Jamie an added ...\n... you know the symptoms and I I too late to do something with and understand if they do myself out so to speak you know yeah ... ... that's a whole or whatnot with a sense of the\nGreat now that's great thank you so much the phone call I appreciate it yeah that's\nOne of the techniques that William talks about is discovering yourself through out of body travel and I do like the fact that it doesn't end isn't associated with the TV I any type of trauma\nOr brain injury we want to avoid those they they're not saying no no and that's\nAh unfortunately a lot of people do associate the two ... and it's and it's not the case at all now granted there are people do a for instance a lot of people correlate near death with obese because obese or an element of near death\nBut the two were actually even though ... obese are part of the near death experience there also independent of that so it's important a distinction to make\nMm interesting and I just go to Dave in New Jersey I well I like oh I hate Dave how are you tonight\nHey Lisa the call is Kelly from inside the studio\nAnd testing [laughter] right so\nThis is what am I get a little weird but I was a young boy I was growing up in a place called west town Pennsylvania we move there when I was about to where they started giving visitation that would these isn't patients they gave me um I first saw awful they account for the school\nWhere I found out of the scale mode by hands both by nice way to solve is two girls and their mouths winter ice skating it happened ... would pay what I saw the night before and the Dow but all they gave me a chance for our body\nI was younger I didn't know what it was how you liar of\nFascinating is very cool so you can be deeply competent is ...\nIs a cat and um there are multiple um experiences and reports of people that have a let's just say knowledge of events\nAre not only in the past but in the future or what we would perceive as a future you know it's interesting that you bring this up when you leave your body there is no time as we know we look at time is linear but yet those of us who have out of body experience is quickly realize\nThat for instance you can live a life in five minutes it's ... it's there is no time as we perceive it ... in non physical reality it's a whole ... all

barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter]\nI Can't wait [laughter] well the ghost of Shirley actually sue was not happy with me\nI'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\nOh [laughter] I thought it was just so precious that he had this imaginary friend I had an imaginary\nFriend when I was a child too and I didn't think much about it we'll see started telling him what to do like oh in the beginning it was really sweet like oh sue made me eat those cookies that you told me not to eat and I'd\nBe like that Phillies sue [laughter] you know\nInnocent but then\nI I I have to catch my breath because it really bothers me to even recall this story it is so hunting and chilling that my nephew begged me not to tell this story so when I wrote about it and my first book haunted managing springs I changed the name [laughter] okay\nThe people and how old is your nephew epigenetics at this time next okay and\nOne night in the middle of the night\nHe came into our bedroom crying and he was covered in scratch marks and he was bleeding okay he was\nBleeding and it looked like he had been bitten all over his body and I pulled off his shirt and he was bruised and he was crying and he was so scared and I said what is happening to you and he had his in his hands and I ran down to his room and he had to cut\nThe ear off of our cat and he said the stew made him do it oh dear you said stew I'm Sorry he kept calling it stew this goes through it wasn't sue I'm Sorry it was too\nWell it was after about two or three months\nMy nephew had a ... beach and had it meant\nAnd really what he was saying was soon he was saying sue and that was the former owners name the one that died now the one that did not like me anymore and write and before oh it was awful he said to me stupid doesn't want you any here anymore [laughter] no\nAnd then how when did you do did you\nLike I was so frightened you just even to recall it and\nLike I said my nephew doesn't even like me to tell that story um it it was\nThe ...\nWe had to I we had no choice right had no choice oh where did you do that oh we had no choice and then\nIf it's if it's to make matters even worse is like I told you I was having these um haunted wine and cheese parties and like I said in the beginning I just thought it was fun it was like oh that silly\nStew he stole\nSomething again you know and I might find oh my eyeglasses in the freezer or [laughter] or they might be missing completely for a week and then I might find them outside in the driveway and it was just kind of ... in the beginning and and and fairly innocent\nBut what I really think happened was not only did we have the ghost of the former owner there but um because see remember it was hunted before we bought it supposedly\nSeveral owners or several he wins or men knows I'm just\nGoing to say that well what we ended up finding out was that it was it was a portal [noise] it is it's it's really strongly haunted still I'm ...\nAfter five years we did get out we got out and the day that we left the day that we decided we had to leave every single doorbell and the house was going off with was a four story home and we had the rebels on every level and we took the door [laughter]\nThe batteries out of the door bells on the first level and then the second leveling off we took those batteries out the third level went off it it felt like they were driving as crazy\nLike driving you out would happen celebrating what came of their place what would happen to her\nWell actually after we sold it then the mad at family bought it and this was in two thousand five and they just sold it about two years ago but wildly owned it in two thousand fourteen [noise]\nOn a ledge was voted number six on the nation's top ten most haunted places just behind the ...\nBy USA Today and the Huffington Post who would buy something like that ah it actually you know what about how about\nTrue beauty what happened with this house is that it was actually bought by someone who turned it into a Buddhist a Buddhist retreat and it's wonderful because last I heard is that they cleared all the spirits away and that the house as happy again so I Am really\n[laughter] I Would take a lot of work but they have done so much work than men with ... experts\nAnd they uh they change the gardening they change the direction of certain you know that really works\n... apparently it worked because it's it's it's free\n[laughter] fascinating\nAbout a hundred years yeah it was tremendously haunted and then later after you know me being a historian and everything I wanted to know why the house was so haunted [noise] and I won't get into that right\nNow I really did find out that there was a reason there always is any time something tragic are horrible happens it leaves a psychic in in print or bruises if you will that can be felt by some people and I'm One of those people unfortunately\nWell at least you know that about yourself some people may feel it and not know how to interpret those feelings or interpret things that are happening in their lives in ...\nThis is so interesting that you should bring this up because I'm actually my children's stepmother um their mother died of cancer when they were one in three years old\nAnd so um they're both very smart people on both of them there have there a doctorate degree my son interesting enough um is a doctor at Stanford right now and he was the only one in our family who never saw a ghost when we were living it on a ledge or experience something paranormal\nAnd I really believe it was because he just didn't want to eat [laughter]\nNo he had an analytical mind do you want to become a doctor pitcher deathly he\nTotally turned it out so all these years I think he you know he always thought that I was a little bit crazy until\nI knew who knew what he does his friend no young my mom's to go turn [laughter] and uh\nIt it's it's it's a it's it's kind of sweet being validated finally\n[laughter] oh it has to be validated you\nOh yeah he believes me now he knows I'm good storyteller anyway\n[laughter] well that's that's what it's all about everything's about storytelling now used to live in managing springs right Joes little of the history of that area\nThis I Believe this is one and this is the most taunted I call it the hunted heart of the rock\nWell I'm sure you've heard of Nicholas ... right yeah oh well this was his home base he is to hang out here all the time\nBecause we have a lot of lightning here you know where we live in Little Rock he's ... and I'm so he actually built a lab on the top of pikes peak the man he was fascinated with manages springs especially because we have some very curious magnetic\nAnomalies in our town I can actually walk with my compass around the perimeter manages springs on these beautiful hiking trails that we have\nAnd my how this will shake my hand and never find true north I kid you not the the Indian American Native Americans knew about these sacred places\nAnd in these sacred places the trees actually grow kind of sideways and it's just curious but the hair on my back on my arms in my neck will go up when he um you can feel it um and the other thing that's curious about it is that\nBecause of these magnetic anomalies um Nicholas Tesla actually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the cliff house hotel and he was watching as these birds a gorgeous\nCircling over managing spring was like they didn't have any sense of direction like their innate sense of ability to find\nTheir way through north or south was gone and you know they had birds\nHave a little piece of him type crystal and their brain and it ... the he was saying he was leading that may be because of the magnetic anomalies at the Brits were hunting confused because they were actually behaving in a very strange manner by like diving into buildings and\nIn like ... how the pilot [laughter] interesting\nIt really is a very special place that is fascinating we will find out more about managing your Springs Colorado and we come back with my guest Stephanie waters I Am leads to garner listening to coast to coast am\nYou when we were talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there we're real in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just called you\nKnow I'm I think another reason why I'm that people were drawn to manage his springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary to five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pack\nBetween them that they would not fight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down\nTheir weapons and there was peace here forever\nUntil the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and what have you right over their natural minerals springs that was sacred to them and that the um native is actually curse the town after that and that's why it's so hot that\nMakes sense to me [laughter] yeah it does yeah does know you lived there I Do ... and you like it [laughter] you\nBut you know what you have to be careful if you live here and I am not kidding you I'm I'll tell you what happened to OK a year ago it was September eleventh I was taking a beautiful morning walk up the trail and I ran into a dead body hanging from the bridge\nNow this very old body it was awful he said he was suicide\nUm come to find out it was a homeless person and it was awful but you know it rocked my world and I started talking to people here in this town about what is wrong with people here there is a high incidence of drug abuse and alcoholism\nAnd I believe it's because the people here have not learned how to um processes that but they they don't know how to channel the energy of manage to\nThat is the leg and that that's why there is so there are so many um artist dancers singers musicians that live in this town because they can feel the energy but if you don't properly channel this energy for the powers of good [laughter]\nIf you actually get into a negative mind spot or you don't create because if you're an artist and you live here you have to create and if you don't ... it will turn against you it will become a negative force and I know that because it happened to me when I first moved here [laughter] uh\nAnd I see it happening to other people would I've worn them my a godsend moved in with me a year ago and I said I'm I was trying to help him out he was going through a hard time and I have this beautiful attic apartment two bedrooms and a kitchen and bathroom and I said he could live there for free\nJust needed to get a job he was only here for a week and he you know the the spirit a manatee Wilber took him and he goes I can feel that I can feel that I've never felt so good in my life you know [laughter]\nI said well you got to be careful though he burned out and about a month [laughter] and it was really sad\nHow do you suggest people process that energy wherever they live if it's a haunted house or\n[laughter] and it was really sad how do you\nSuggest people process that energy wherever they live if it's a haunted house or if it's a a relative how do you channel that energy\nWell I definitely don't want to be around in a negative energy anymore like I said I I Try to keep you know a healthy attitude about it if if I can call it bad [laughter]\nBecause you have to think about this why is it does appear why are they lingering that can't be good [laughter]\nBecause there is on his own business right\nWell yeah but I mean that's that's that's a lot of anger too if you think about it and [noise]\nUm what do you say that because you would have to have a lot of anger divvy it to be tethered here [noise] um if you are full of life and full of love and full of Christ\nConsciousness whatever you want to call it I don't think you'd be tethered here after life I think that you would want to move on and toward the light um\nYou know you got a good point there you'd these beings want to stay together here to home to disrupt people because they have a grudge\nWell some of them I Believe our conscious and some of them I don't think that they know that they are here still but they're they're all troubled\nI you know I Love these stories when people go on my bed and breakfast is haunted but only by a friendly spirit I'm like give me a great there are no such thing as a friendly those Casper or otherwise\n[laughter] will because it why would they why would they said that's a good point\nIs it's ... it's going and and when you know with this okay it it can it can lead\nYou down a dark road okay I've seen it happen to my friends I mean\nI don't watch TV and I haven't for Twenty years and it's funny that I'm In this business because now all these goes hunting shows or on TV [noise] um and I guess in the last year or two you hear all these stories about these people that are on these goes hunting that shows and they kill each other and [laughter] you heard about this stuff\nI think they get involved into a dark force you know it's nothing to play around with\nOur own goes troubled and our own lives\nThat I Believe so I think that everyone has a different opinion now I Want to tell you something this last book that I just wrote was actually written because of a ghost\nI was called on the telephone to write a story to help this poor person who has been demonized for the last hundred years\nI helped her crossover by writing this last book and I have that that is a matter of fact\nIs that been forgotten tails and Colorado says\nBoth legends and lore of the Rockies by shit for and it just came out\nAnd the very first story is true I Swear to God Knows about it [laughter]\nPardon Jones about it okay about its it actually begins in Nineteen eighty five I was a college student and I decided to go to this little mining town to um interview the owners of this old theater and I'm not going to mention the theater 'cause I Want people to buy my book [laughter]\nAnyway they go to I go to the theater\nAnd I have an amazing paranormal experience where\nI actually saw the former owner of the theater and she was crying and she was upset because her name had been tainted [noise]\nWell I didn't know what to do when I got back to school I'm not going to write this story they are going to think I'm not ... did not tell this story to anyone you know I've been single since I was a little kids so I sometimes to just put it out in my mind and don't tell anyone [noise]\nOkay so now flash forward to two thousand sixteen I have written for books on go go\nNow this was quite happy to rest on my little Rory laurels and I ... out of the blue got a telephone call from\nThe Colorado alarm company about an intrusion signal on Harrison Avenue and those historians out there might know where that is not only a historian with no where that was\nAnd that being said this was a message left on my home number now I was getting ready to take a walk I heard the phone rang and I was like no I'm not going to get it but something told me to get it so five minutes later I went and checked the phone and I'm like oh my gosh this is an intrusion signal\nAt the at the this place you know up in the mountains and I'm like what they call me I'm three hours a day\nAnd and furthermore I mean only I Would know where this place is because I'm a historian I mean this was really weird not even the same area code or anything so I called the Colorado alarm can be right back and I said why in the devil are you calling me is your tax number I don't even have the same area code as as this place\nAnd it was a man that answered the phone and it was a woman's voice on my answering machine and the man said I don't know what you're talking about lady and I gave my phone number and he goes we didn't call your house\nAnd I said I've got it on my answering machine he goes I don't know what you're talking about you're going to have to take this up with a theater [laughter] I called the police department and I said you know your alarms going off at the theater and they go yeah I got were on our way [laughter]\nNext morning I called the mayor of ... a discount animals have been him I called the mayor I called the theater\nI told everybody I could nobody could give me an answer so did you do have that voice on your side let everybody listen to the first person I called was one of my dear friends dory spent my business partner she is a psychic she's been on good morning America she's pretty well known and I called up and I said what the devil is going on with this\nAnd she listens to the the tapes you know on my tape recorder on my answering machine I let her listen to it\nAnd she went into a trance and she did a reading and she we found out that I had the same birthday\nAs the former owner of this I'm old theater and a lot more in common that was just mind ... and my friend said to me you were destined to write a story about this crying goes because she is very sad\nThat she has been demon all these all these years and no one has hurt her side of the story and she wants you to correct it for her [laughter] you're kidding me and I said she doesn't know I'm not kidding you so I call I call the I'm\nThe manager of this

[laughter] it's gone yeah I\nLive in time makes more sense where it could be a coming back into this dimension temporarily in a split second\nYes and see that doesn't have a consciousness the choir music that I heard did not have a consciousness what do you mean by no means it was just like I heard it in the room like some\nIt was a burping time does that make sense didn't have a conscious it's yeah it's just music that I heard like they came through sometimes believe it or not I can hear the trains that used to run behind my house and it ran\nIn over a hundred years yeah so yeah when I hear so I don't know if other people\nDo [laughter] you have anybody around that you could ask a much\nMore in tune with the higher laws of nature as I said delicately they can they can pick up on it too had children especially that's why I Love it when when little children come on my tour is because um I turned it down a little bit so I don't scare them so much but ah the kids have a great time because they haven't been taught not to the\nRight right so back to where people feel that they're afraid of ghost you're saying that they're not usually wanting to stay they want to move on or they should leave on it\nAnd move on I think it would be like you know when you're hungry you just know to eat\nHow do you help but uh being do that how would you suggest or how would you teach someone to assist this goes to move on\nWell you can always try talking to it I Swear it works but would you ask\nI tell it are you you need to move on you know you're not supposed to be here anymore and I know this is your house and you love it that you're not supposed to be here anymore your loved ones are waiting for you on the other side you need to go\nAnd just talk to them like a kind person would talk to anyone who was scared and confused the beans are just like they were on earth and some of them get caught here it's it's really sad if you think about these those centers that go out and our teasing them like they're\nLike they're like in the zoo or something you know he's not there\nVacuum them up and put them into two yeah when you asked this where you say to this this entity that might be hanging around and causing this just move on ... ... why do people get scared\nI think that you know what those hunting is addicting first of all it is so fascinating we've all been fascinating with what's on the other side and then once you have validation I tell you what it does not stop it that it's like gambling or something\nIt opens up a whole new world or possibility happily\nThis happened and then you do feel special because so many people want a validation that there is life after death let's be honest and when you do have it happen it blows your mind and you will never forget it and you will never let anyone talk you out of what you saw the that's what happened to me when I was a child\nMy parents told me that it was because they drop me on the head when I was a baby imagine that\nHere so I mean they all my life I just hope that I was crazy and I'm not [laughter] people have had it had just\nEnthusiastic I Would say [laughter] but now tell which do you started this wonderful convention this paranoia broke mentioned travels to various areas tell us a little bit about\n[noise] well um we call it a mood movable feast like I said and so when we go into different areas the very very very first thing that we do is we contact with the local historians and the local goes hunting groups\nAnd we say we want to be your advocate we are here to help you and your community it do you need to get rid of any of those were here we're not going to be like those guys so we're really like I Would call us paranormal psychologist [laughter]\nThere's such a germ yes\nAnd that's what we do and we're very kind and we're and we try to talk them over or do whatever we can write a book [laughter]\nThese so when you do the tours you have a group that comes with you and it's more of an active type of tour right\nMy two words it's because of the town itself is very active and this is how I Do my towards um if you look at my website managed to lead since that time you will see that there's very little information on there\nAfter Seventeen years there's a reason for that I don't have a meeting sites because before my tours I actually do a prayer and a meditation on ask for the spirits which one wants to come out and talk tonight so the tours do change night by night and you never know which is going to come out and play quite interesting [laughter]\nOh yeah does the use AOL specific date and time and all that you think are not as validated\nNo I didn't say that at all I'm just saying that's how I run my tours okay there are always different they always change because that's how the paranormal is it's always changing it's always different\nThere are some spirits that are pretty consistent but I called those as much like fishing I mean as much as I Love to go fishing sometimes I don't catch it's darn thing and that's how it goes hunting is you just never know what's gonna happen and then sometimes you'll it'll be hot and you'll catch a bunch

was save hundreds of dollars in my car insurance with Geico\nShoes or something more car insurance\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nHow great invention him\nOnly twenty four people can attend it's a world renowned\nAs being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop I'm generally what I mean each person is in a check unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah\nThese Akron as ... and um when that controlled holistic environmental chamber in other words each person's in and personal isolation both and I speak to them when we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber\nAnd then I present Emmy sank which is a ... a ... brain synchronization kind of technology plus guided meditation and we do five of these uh day typically\nAnd what with the idea here is to guide each person to go into a nice deep meditative state\nAnd every person listening in their own isolation chamber through the headphones\nNow hit like a cubicle or ... and ... and a decline or well hell no it's\nA it's a it's a cubicle each person has their own individual cubicle that's the size of like a single bad okay and you can it's you can close it off completely you can block out um\nIt's the whole idea is to create an isolation chamber why is that because you can go deeper with no or external stimulus\nActions like I'm In many ways the same concept behind um the flu chambers exempt in this case you're not floating you're you're in this this control unit\nAnd all the sound is piped into the room we use special technologies like him he sank\nAnd he has headphones on\nYes everybody wears headphones and I talk to them in their control unit and I guide them through these series of exercises\nAnd they don't feel a loner isolated right no that's the idea you are isolated I mean they don't feel alone because you have headphones on on you know\nThey they're listening through headphones and any exercise minor typically about a Fifteen minutes long each one\nAnd and people go on these incredible journey friend who's been several times um where where do you think now anything first of all the technology is the ... and went into a meta hate\nThe idea is to get them as deep as possible um and the fate is of course are ideal for many people but the idea is of course to put\nThe fate is of course are ideal for many people but the idea is of course to put yourself by neural beat technology it's been around for a long time that it helps us to go deeper faster that's a concept\nOkay All right and then where do you go on this journey where would you and I know that there's a pattern that you take people's you know it it's kind of a formula right\nWell there is a yes or the relaxation I use sometimes what would be considered to be light hypnosis um there's different progression setter used but it's basically a meditative type of program\nThat's guided often guided where you would just go along with the program\nAnd um and have your own experience everybody has different experiences\nDuring even my program I'm teaching people how to self initiate their own out of body experience but in my class for instance people have pets life regressions mhm they have contact with all kinds of let's just say a non physical\nBeing different kinds everybody has their own type of experience\nWhen we open up to her inner self people experience different kinds of ah let's just say I opening a mind opening expansive experiences mhm so it's not limited to just out of body experiences\nOr for instance past life or ... or regression type flashes are quite common and there's the whole idea is to open up to this inner party yourself where the answers are where you can begin to explore your true self\nWhat did you get into a open up to that awakened to that multi dimensional self within you\nKnow what types of questions could you ask yourself and then you write them down when you come out of this like write it down right away\nYes what I always suggest is that right after the exercise you everybody receipt gets a journal or they bring a journal\nAnd you immediately after the exercise you begin to journal whatever ... whatever kind of information may have come to you or imagery 'cause information can be\nTransmitted many different ways it's not necessarily all the boy can be through imagery or through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways so it's it's important to be open to the way that you receive information\nBut uh people have all kinds of profound experiences\nAnd they awakened to their their true self and they're the answers within them\nMhm yeah so the implications than personal growth in the spiritual awakening that are\nHappening in these can really be transformational and I like it because you find your cells and then I mean in a way your experience you William have died in in the direction that I Would have my own personal experience now\nMy friend mine I freeze has been a guest on the show before she said that she has in the past encountered souls that need help and I think that's fascinating city councils that\nSure um we actually have an entire class devoted to that\nI think that's fascinating in counseling that\nSure uh we actually have an entire class devoted to that where people meet and guide those people that just mean need assistance\nOr that's but that will happen in um\nIn all the classes that can happen that comes up in my class as well or where people have contact and um provide guidance let's say to people that and ... there are people that have died but they are law store\nFor instance someone that may have died um quickly and they were just disoriented and they may need some assistance I Know that that type of thing does happen quite a bit\nAnd um at at ... at the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focuses on that type of guidance it's called guidelines I'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others\nIn that um [noise] and do let's just say a system to go to a higher dimensional space\nMhm mhm so to assist him in crossing over have you ever done this after\nA a\nTragic incident and national tragic incident where Massachusetts so lean on one\nI have because I I ... I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven era and myself and I received a lot of contact\nOr during that period of time um that was a that was one of those events where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way my junior having coffee one morning and your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body is gone ... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to even wrap our minds around that\nSo there was a lot of people that we're assisting those um\nPeople that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and it it's it's functions in different names and different cultures and when I went to two we we presented in\nI think I'm more or let's just say I'm very grounded in a scientific waves at least the scientific as we can\nNow that goes for all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented in a very logical way that's um understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great because really allow the person to have their own experience it in all that and when you find out a little bit more now one of the culture a jazz is and what it's called in other countries\nAre going to take a quick break William thank you so much and when we come back we'll talk about what other countries just exist in and also a little bit more on how you can get in on your own and ... million booming and I am in are you listening to coast to coast and\nMessages data ... owning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload but what if there were\nA business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur isn't thought leaders and what if you could earn\nThat degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line to find out more\nChecks path to seven nine six four or five that's\nP.

and do is out\nOf body exploration not food trauma that to an actual workshop her\nItself a regulated type of out of body exploration is a thing\nAnd it's also well done it's very well then it and something that William Bowman has led for almost Twenty years that the Monroe Institute specifically but this is something you can do on your own we were what other cultures has this existed in history\nAlicia from the very big\nBody experiences are probably the quintessential I'm\nA way that throughout history people have had profound experiences I mean look at a biblical like the revelations begins with I was in the spirit and if you look back through all the biblical text all the transformational type of experiences people\nTheir their consciousness was projected or extended let's say beyond their physical limits\nAnd that is in itself a form of out of body exploration it's just that was in two thousand years ago wasn't called that and it goes all the way back to ancient Hindu Buddhist text\n'em to every culture and religion known to man if you start to read it objectively you'll see there's comments about this uh I was in the spirit or I was beyond my physical body let's put it that way and there they had this profound experience\nCan an added tiny and validate life after life\nWell it gives you that inside number one it's a shocker for many people just to be aware of the fact that oh my God I continue its a verification that you continue beyond your body\nAnd that's a that's a ... in itself a big life change or for people it's a wake any because then they realize oh my God there's\nI continue there's other things that are that are going on beyond the single experience and it really opens people's minds to the potential what they are [noise] think about it there's um seven and a half billion people on the planet\nAnd people don't have a clue where they're going to death they don't know where they come from before they were born and they don't know really what they are they they assume they're human being because they were they found themselves in the human body mhm but in actuality consciousness\nUh can take on any form I I Know from having out of body experiences encountering are all kinds of life forms including by the way animals\nMany people contact a lot lot pets six cetera during their out of body experiences and the pets are having out of body experience\nAny new ones to his customers are already\nKnow or even the ones that are alive I write about this and my first book where my my dog McGregor would would follow me out of body and I also had a cat that would do that I mean these this is we're just real events that are happening the fascinating people all over the world\nI mean we're a multi dimensional ... that's what we are and are biological body you know we have to realize we're not we're not biological beings we're only here for a very brief period of time and then we exit and we move on to another state of consciousness\nAnd another energy body\nAnd that's what we've discovered without a body exploration is that it's multi dimensional and that death is an illusion really you know that's been said but\nOnce you encounter and experience and communicate with loved ones who have passed and you're doing his face to face this is life changing\nYou no longer need a psychic to act as the intermediary you you you're empowered to discover the answers for yourself and it's really to find out what kind of journey are we all on 'cause this is an amazing journey of consciousness we all share\nYou shared this with you but I just interviewed Raymond Moody on my guy in show and you know the ... the grandfather and coined the term a life after death and um he had expressed to me after fifty years of doing this\nIs that he doesn't know for sure that that yeah life after death exists because scientifically it's never really been proven even though he's heard thousands and thousands of reports of people who have\nExperienced as a\nLife after life ... he still doesn't as a scientist as a low decision right has not know for sure this\nIs exactly why self initiated out of body exploration is so important because you get that verification absolute personal verification that you need\nBooks study research will never give you that kind of verification you can read a thousand books you could spend your entire lifetime studying this topic\nAnd it's not going to give you the inside and the verification you'll get\nFrom one out of body experience\nBecause suddenly you know you go from being a researcher or a believer to an hour and that's the big huge step that all of humanity I think is moving towards I mean we need to we need to wake up to what we truly are\nBig and to get away from this bickering and confusion in division\nI mean once you realize that you're you're not just a biological being you\nKnow you're continuing revolving beyond this temporary stage of development it puts everything into a whole different perspective and I'm not the first time I mean this is not the Buddhist or been saying this for a long drawn that you know we're more than our bodies\nAnd that were involved in beyond the body and we are all life is evolving beyond the body this is a temporary stage of our revolution\nYeah and I meant to say that ran in ... he coined the term near death experience sorry I didn't mean like a\nAfterlife that that's his website you know when I did my own Google Search on I just typed in near death experience in over twenty five million search has come up on Google were not the only ones that are interested in is this is becoming more and more of a\nA phenomenon a popular topic people are interested in what beyond disorder they always have been good enough for the place so much as senior anymore but I Want to ask you you could you had an experience like as if you\nWere sick and you had this experience for you um you worse that can you use this out of body experience to help you in some way can you tell us about that\nWell in two thousand eleven I I've discovered I had a serious a stage for cancer of the lymph nodes and tonsils and I it was a shock it was um on very quickly out a large tumor on my neck lymph nodes\nUh yeah the lymph nodes and try anyway it was a serious issue and I had to get immediate had to make quick decisions on this because it was a you know it spreads I'd ... broken and kept solution\nSo I I went through traditional um because it was so quick and so fast I did a traditional medicine but um during my recovery\nSome really profound out of body experiences and in a sequence of events which I did not itself initiate by the way these are just spontaneous out of body experiences which I was having why was recovering from cancer\nIs a I had a cease healing experiences\nAnd it's difficult to explain this but in one of them I found myself in this this white queue but was like a twelve meter pure

I'm a belief system that of course is nothing but fear\nHere is a controlling mechanism it's been used for centuries to control the population\nA and it still used today right actively unfortunate way to control um ... you know societies or we'll notice there's always an enemy and there's always some kind of thing that needs to be a feared\nAnd ... that is one of the great things that I think we have an opportunity to realize when when you have an out of body experience you realize number one\nYou were a mortal and it sounds a little grandiose playing you know that you know my God I'm more than my body I Am an immortal I'm\nI'm not some um week pathetic\nBeing that needs to be manipulated or told what to think I you know I'm I'm a powerful non physical spiritual be and that's amazing shift in consciousness for the individual\nI Am more than my body it really does help you and your level of consciousness and forget about tiny problems in life and you feel are so large because our brains me in that way but surely they are in significant when you compare and\nHow vast our our universe really is talking about being beyond funny yeah yeah\nAnd what's so important is for us to have our own transformation or experiences I think that's critical to our evolution individual\nFor us to have our own transformation or experiences I I think that's critical to our evolution individual and collectively otherwise when you have your own profound experience\nYou you you can no longer be manipulated by these external forces around you because you know better you just look at it like it it's just the drama it's the game that's being played all around us\nAnd you look at it like that and you know it and that makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance a political drama that that you don't get sucked into that stuff could you realize it's a temporary drama\nAnd and you understand there was a bigger game at foot here the big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience\nSo that you know the answers for yourself and you're no longer upon of anyone else any belief system government religion you are free of all of that indoctrination and that's and that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the ... that we tend to get in with his ear uncle news that we\n... ridiculous that's and you realize it's you know there's so much important stuff that we need to know about ourselves\nThe greatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self ... that's the core issue involved in all the ills that face humanity is lack of knowledge himself if every one seven billion of it suddenly awoke one day and knew what we were\nAnd where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'd be no wars there'll be no no ... none of that would occur ... because we would know better\nBase we really truly knew we were all connected but there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really to the old be connected to only the ones that want to be connected to [laughter]\nWell we go beyond the ego\nYeah we we were going to take another quick frankly and when we come back we're going to take your calls 'cause he'll give us a call and I only think I'm listening because you can stand\nInfo dot org now uh we have great callers come in William you may cause sure and has to go to Jamie in Washington state first time caller here and coast to coast ... what is your question huh how's it going great\nWhat is your question my friend\nI'm Luther King says there's any relevance between the out of the experiences and a memory loss\nGood question the question I mean not remembering the experience or memory loss in general\n... coalition a little bit of both uh either long term memory and of the uh out of body experiences so\nNot\nInterfering with your like everyday memory of needing to recall certain things that you use all the time so to speak like war and stuff like that and drive in things like that\nOh I Would say definitely not a I can speak for myself for I think my memory um is excellent and I've been having\nOut of body experiences for over forty years or so I I well like I don't see any ah um correlation\nLike a TV I Would be associated with memory loss and ... and I'm issues when you have a brain trauma but not so much the out of body techniques that doesn't just served a brain memory patterns and All right\nNo I've not seen any correlation for that or [noise]\nUm I absolutely not matter of fact a lot of people that have out of body experiences have an incredibly productive and\nLives in their late years like Robert Monroe did and others that are written many books I'm In their later years let's say [noise]\nSo if anything I think there's the opposite I think you're you open up potentially um certain pathways that enhance your ability to remember and to function\nSometimes the have you ever experienced is Jamie and out of body experience\n... in the shade them and I I can lead to political thinking on these shows\n...\nEven the symptoms and I I can relate to ... something woman who's trying to figure myself out so to speak you know yeah Mm make myself poll or whatnot with my phone so\nGreat now that's great thank you so much for your phone call I appreciate it yeah that's\nOne of the techniques that William talks about is discovering yourself through out of body travel and I do like the fact that it doesn't end isn't associated with the TV I any type of trauma\nOr a brain injury we want to avoid those they they are not fun now no\nAh unfortunately a lot of people do associate the two ... and it's and it's not the case at all now granted there are people do a for instance a lot of people correlate near death with obese because obese or an element of near death\nBut the two were actually even obese are part of the near death experience there also independent of them\nSo it's important a distinction to make\nMm interesting and I just go to Dave in New Jersey or ... or ... how are you tonight\nHey we said the call is Kelly from inside the studio\nAnd testing [laughter] right [laughter] you know\nThis is where am I get a little weird but I was a young boy I was growing up in a place called ... town Pennsylvania we move there when I was about to when I started getting visitation that would this visit patients they gave me um I first saw a ... a day I Can't wait for the school\nWhere I found out as gay load by hand by days where there's a there's two girls and their mouths were scared it happened in ... when the when I saw her life before added up at all they gave me a chance for our body\nI was younger I didn't know what it

to the past suddenly while we were out of town and um\nI I Will go back and I just didn't let them my laps view him to be in a casket so I didn't go off and I was upset about that and I had this dream and that was the least of the time\nAnd I was chasing the suspect for a ... a mall very familiar with but what I made the term I mean it was my dad he was standing right there and it wasn't fuzzy or

and I was I said to him I said dad don't leave pleased to leave and he was gone and I woke up but after I woke up I I it's stress and everything was all gone and I guess my question is\nWhy this dream of that 'cause I was stressed out about it and it was in my imagination or or\nDoes she think that maybe that was my dad actually contacted me from the ... you know life after death round settled down because it actually worked\nYeah I think it was I mean that's reported by my God countless people report that kind of contact and often it's perceived as a dream like experience\nUh the universe is a continuum of consciousness and dreams are part of that continuum and yes the people especially in within thirty days of an individual passing\nThe the the chance of contact is incredibly high a\nAnd often will perceive it and the dream like environment because we're more open when our ego mind is when we fall asleep or Hugo mind set aside and we can begin to\nExperience is but yeah I think that was a valid absolutely valid a contact Mm uh I Know I've had that with my mother on many occasions and almost everybody I Know it's had some form of contact\nAnd that we're kind of regard with a loved

Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you jumping Malone blew everything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter]\nI Can't wait till the ghost\nOf Shirley actually sue was not happy with me\nI'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue [laughter]\nI thought it was just so precious that he had this imaginary friend I had an imaginary friend when I was a child too and I didn't think much about it [noise]\nWilson started telling him what to do like oh in the beginning it was really sweet like oh sue made me eat those cookies that you told me not to eat and I'd be like that Phillies sue [laughter] you know innocent\nBut then\nI I I have to catch my breath because it really bothers me to even recall this story it is so hunting and chilling that my nephew begged me not to tell this story so when I wrote about it in my first book haunted managing springs I changed the name\n[laughter] okay the people and how old is your nephew epigenetics at this time next okay in one night in the middle of the night\nHe came into our bedroom crying and he was covered in scratch marks and he was bleeding okay he was bleeding and it looked like he has been fitness all over his body and I pulled off his shirt and he was\nBruised and he was crying and he was so scared and I said what is happening to you and he had his in his hand and I ran down to his room and he had cut\nThe ear off of our cat and he said that still made him do it oh dear you said stew I'm Sorry he kept calling it's due this goes through it wasn't sue I'm Sorry it was too\nWell it was after about two or three months\nMy nephew had his speech impediment\nAnd really what he was saying was soon he was saying sue and that was the former owners name the one that died now the one that did not like me anymore and write and before oh it was awful he said to me stupid doesn't want to do any here anymore [laughter] know\nHow when did you do did you\nOh my gosh I was so frightened you just even to recall it and like I said my nephew doesn't even like me to tell that story um\nIt it was the ... we had to I we had no choice right had no choice oh where did you do that\nOh we had no choice and then if it's if it's to make matters even worse is like I told you I was having these um haunted wine and cheese parties and like I said in the beginning I just thought it was fun it was like oh that's\nSilly stew he stole\nSomething again you know and I might find oh my eyeglasses in the freezer or [laughter] or they might be missing completely for a week and then I might find them outside in the driveway\n... and and and fairly innocent but what I really think happened was not only did we have the ghost of the former owner there but um because see remember it was hunted before we bought it supposedly\nSeveral owners or several ... wins or men you know I'm just going to say\nThat what what we ended up finding out was that it was it was signed a portal [noise] it is it's it's really strongly haunted still I'm ...\nAnd you are still living there\nNo milk no after five years we did get out we got out and the day that we left the day that we decided we had to leave every single doorbell and the house was going off with was a four story home and we had stored those on every level and we took the doorbell rang out\nThat the batteries out of the door bells on the first level and then the second leveling off we took those batteries out the third level went off it it felt like they were driving as crazy\nLike we're driving you out would happen celebrating\nWhat came of their place what would happen to it\nWill actually after we sold it then the Maddox family bought it and this was in two thousand five and they just sold it about two years ago but wildly owned it and two thousand fourteen [noise]\nOn a ledge was voted number six on the nation's top ten most haunted places just behind the lazy boarding house by USA Today and the Huffington Post\nWho would buy something like that\nAh it actually you know what about how about true beauty what happened with this house is that it was actually bought by someone who turned it into a Buddhist a Buddhist retreat and it's wonderful because last I\nHeard is that they cleared all the spirits away and that the house is happy again so I Am really\nGlad that I Would take a lot of work they have done so much work than\nMen with ... experts and they uh they change the gardening they change the direction of certain\nYou know that really works\nIt apparently it worked because it's it's it's free\n[laughter] fascinating about a hundred\nYears yeah it was tremendously haunted and then later after you know me being a historian and everything I wanted to know why the house was so haunted and\nI won't get into that right now I really did find out that there was a reason there always is anytime something tragic or horrible happens it leaves a psychic in in print or bruises if you will that can be felt by some people and I'm One of those people unfortunately\nWell at least you know that about yourself some people may feel it and not know how to interpret those feelings or interpret things that are happening in their lives and\nThis is so interesting that you should bring this up because I'm actually my children's stepmother um their mother died of cancer when they were one in three years old\nAnd so um they're both very smart people on both of them there have their doctorate degree my son interesting enough um is a doctor at Stanford right now and he was the only one in our family who never saw a ghost when we were living it on a ledge or experience something paranormal\nAnd I really believe it was because he just didn't want to eat [laughter]\nNo he had an analytical mind do want to become a doctor for deathly he\nTotally turned it out so all these years I think he you know he always thought that I was a little bit crazy until\nKnew I wanted to do with the Joneses friends oh yeah my mom's a ghostwriter\nYeah it it's it's it's a it's it's kind of sweet being validated finally\n[laughter] oh it has to be validated you\nOh yeah he believes me now he knows I'm good storyteller anyway\n[laughter] well that's that's what it's all about everything's about story jelly and now you still live in managing these springs right Joes a little of the history of that area\nWell this I Believe this is one this is the most taunted I call it the hunted heart of the Rockies and I'm not alone I'm sure you've heard of Nicholas ... right yeah oh well this was his home base he is to hang out here all the time\nBecause we have a lot of lightning here you know where we live in the Rockies ... and I'm so he actually built a lab on the top of pikes peak the man he was fascinated with manages springs especially because we have some very curious magnetic\nAnomalies in our town I can actually walk with my compass around the perimeter manages springs on these beautiful hiking trails that we have\nAnd my how this will shake my hand and never find true north I kid you not the the Indian American Native Americans knew about these sacred places\nAnd in these sacred places the trees actually grow kind of sideways and it's just curious about the hair on my back on my arms in my neck will go up when he um you can feel it um and the other thing that's curious about it is that\nBecause of these magnetic anomalies um Nicholas Tesla actually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the cliff house hotel and he was watching as these birds um we're just circling over managing spring it was like they didn't have any sense of direction\nLike their innate sense of ability to find\nTheir way through north or south was gone and you know they have birds have a little piece of him type crystal in their brain and it they he was saying he was speculating that maybe because of these magnetic anomalies at the Brits were hunting confused\nBecause they were actually behaving in a very strange manner by like diving into buildings and in like ... pilots [laughter] interesting\nIt really is a very special place that is fascinating we will find out more about managing Springs Colorado and we come back with my guest Stephanie water I Am the guardian listening to coast to coast am\nOh welcome back to coast to coast am I guess is Stephanie waters and she is only a professional to each other as we can tell but he's also the owner of the blue moon hunted history tours in Colorado so Stephanie chose a little bit more about\nYou when we were talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there we're ... in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just culture you\nKnow I'm I think another reason why I'm that people were drawn to manage his springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary to five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pack\nBetween them that they would not fight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down\nTheir weapons and there was peace here forever\nUntil the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nWhat have you right over their natural minerals springs that was sacred to them and that the um natives actually curse the town after that and that's why it's so hot that makes sense to me [laughter]\nYeah it does yeah it does now you live there I Do ... and you like it [laughter] I hate you\nBut you know what you have to be careful if you live here and I am not kidding you I'm I'll tell you what happened to OK a year ago it was September eleventh I was taking a beautiful morning walk up the trail and I ran into a dead body hanging from the bridge\nNow this for your own body it was awful he said he was suicide um come to find out it was a homeless person and it was awful but you know it rocked my world and I started talking to people here in this town about what is wrong with people here there is a\nHigh incidence of drug abuse and alcoholism and I believe it's because the people here have not learned how to um processed it but they they don't know how to channel the energy of manage to\nThat is the legend that that's why they're so there are so many um artist dancers singer musicians that live in this town because they can feel the energy but if you don't properly channel this energy for the power of good [laughter]\nIf you actually get into a negative mind spot or you don't create because if you're an artist and you live here you have to create and if you don't ... it will turn against you it will become a negative force and I know that because it happened to me when I first moved here [laughter] uh\nAnd I see it happening to other people when I was one of them my a godsend moved in with me a year ago and I said um\nYou're a and I see it happening to other people when I warned them my a godsend moved in with me a year ago and I said I was trying to help him out he was going through a hard time\nAnd I have this beautiful addict apartment two bedrooms and a kitchen and bathroom and I said he could live there for free just needed to get a job he was only here for a week and he you know the the spirit a manatee Wilber took him and he goes I can feel it I can feel that I've never felt so good in my life [laughter] you know [laughter]\nI said well he got to be careful though he burned out and about a month [laughter] and it was really sad how do you\nSuggest people process that energy wherever they live if it's a haunted house or if it's a a relative how do you channel that energy\nWell I definitely don't want to be around any negative energy anymore like I said I I Try to keep you know a healthy attitude about it if if I can call it that [laughter]\nBecause you have to think about this why is that those here why are they lingering that can't be good [laughter] because\nThere is on his own business right\nWell yeah but I mean that's that's that's a lot of anger too if you think about it and [noise] um what do you say that\nBecause you would have to have a lot of anger to beast it to be tethered here um if you are full of life and full of love and full of Christ\nConsciousness whatever you want to call it [noise] I don't think you'd be tethered here after life I think that you would want to move on and toward the light um\nYou know you got a good point there do these beings want this to each other here to hunter disrupt people because they have a grudge\nWell some of them I Believe our conscious and some of them I don't think that they know that they are here still but they're they're all troubled\nI you know I Love these stories when people go on my bed and breakfast is haunted but only by a friendly spirit I'm like give me a great there are no such thing as a friendly those Casper or otherwise\n[laughter] will because it why would they why would they said that's a good point\nIs it's true it's true and and when you messing around with this okay ... did it it can it can lead you\nDown a dark road okay I've seen it happen to my friends I mean\nI don't watch TV and I haven't for Twenty years and it's funny that I'm In this business because now all these goes hunting shows or on TV [noise] um and I guess in the last year or two you hear all these stories about these people that are on these goes hunting shows and they kill each other and [laughter] you heard about this stuff\nI think they get involved into a dark force you know it's nothing to play around with\nOur own goes troubled and our own lives that I Believe\nSo I think that everyone has a different opinion now I Want to tell you something\nThis last book that I just wrote was actually written because of a ghost I was called on the telephone to write a story to help this poor person who has been demonized for the last hundred years\nI helped her crossover by writing this last book and I have that that's a matter of fact\nHas that been forgotten jails and Colorado who says\nBoth legends allure of the Rockies by ship for and it just came out and\nThe very first story is true I Swear to God Knows about it [laughter]\nPardon joke about it okay about it it actually begins in Nineteen eighty five I was a college student and I decided to go to this little mining town to um interview the owners of this old theater and I'm not going to mention the theater 'cause I Want people to buy my book [laughter]\nAnyway they go to I go to the theater\nAnd I have an amazing paranormal experience\nI Want people to buy my book [laughter] anyway they go to I go to this theater and I have an amazing paranormal experience\nWhere I actually saw the former owner of the theater and she was crying and she was upset because her name had been painted [noise]\nWell I didn't know what to do when I got back to school I'm not going to write this story they are going to think I'm not ... did not tell this story to anyone you know I've been single since I was a little kids so I some times just put it out in my mind and don't tell anyone\nOkay so now flash forward to two thousand sixteen I had written for books on got goes legends lord of the Rocky Mountains and was quite happy to rest on my little Rory laurels\nAnd I out of the blue got a telephone call from the Colorado alarm company about an intrusion signal on Harrison Avenue and those historians out there might know where that is but\nA historian would know where that was\nAnd that being said this was a message left on my home number now I was getting ready to take a walk I heard the phone rang and I was like I'm not going to get it but something told me to get it so five minutes later I went and checked the phone and I'm like oh my gosh this is an intrusion signal\nAt the at the this place you know up in the mountains and I'm like what they call me I'm three hours a day\nAnd and furthermore I mean only I Would know where this place is because I'm a historian I mean this was really weird not even the same area code or anything so I called the Colorado alarm can be right back and I said why in the devil are you calling me is your tax number I don't even have the same area code as as this place\nAnd it was a man that answered the phone and it was a woman's voice on my answering machine and the man said I don't know what you're talking about lady and I gave my phone number and he goes we didn't call your house\nAnd I said I've got it on my answering machine he goes I don't know what you're talking about you're going to have to take this up with a theater [laughter] I call the police department and I said you know your alarms going off at the theater and they go yeah I got were on our way [laughter]\nNext morning I called the mayor of ... a discount almost\nHad been him I called the mayor I called the theater I probably everybody I could nobody could give me an answer so did you still have that voice on yet\nSo I might everybody listen to the first person I called was one of my dear friends dory spent my business partner she is a fact that she's been on good morning America she's pretty well known and I call up and I said don't let the devil is going on with this and she listens to the the tapes and you know on my tape recorder on my answering machine I let her listen to it\nAnd she went into a trans since she did a reading and she we found out that I had the same birthday\nAs the former owner of this I'm old theater and a lot more in common that was just mind blowing and my friend said to me you were destined to write a story about this crying goes because she is very sad\nThat she has been demon all these all these years and no one has hurt her side of the story and she wants you to correct it for her [laughter] you're kidding me and I said she doesn't know I'm not kidding you so I called I called the um\nThe manager of this theater and I told her all of this I go I Know you're going to be ... I think I'm Crazy relation to this message\nAnd she calls me back and she goes I Want you to come up here by your cells all alone watch but the polls in the winter okay and I said well it's November and she goes", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "14"}
