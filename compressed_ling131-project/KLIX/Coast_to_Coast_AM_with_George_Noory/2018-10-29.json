could actually uh applied to a number of these so called trip to says that cold\nAnd then you get into some real weird when the ballet and he'll in books like that and written about commonalities with these creatures though yeah maybe in that were reported long ago are now being reported ETs or aliens and it\nMay be the same beings that are in different forms are seen through a different culture in prison where you come down on that\nWell yeah I mean I'm a big I'm sort of follower of of John ... particularly and I think one of the things for me at least\nI mean I you know different people get difference you know responses from from reading his books but from my perspective I I kind of take the view that is most important um [noise]\nRevelation if you like or conclusion was that many of these phenomena seems to be multi connected if you like to connect said and by that you know you have a lot of reports where people have seen big foot type creatures on in the same location and timeframe\nOr say for example UFO activity I'm the most money point pleasant West Virginia in the sixties um when there was ... when they come off from the same soaring around the [noise]\nThe skies above ... point Pleasant Hill said a lot of encounters with men in black and UFO and cancer so I think some of these creatures that like some of the the we're the ones like my mind and the dog men and things like that\nI think I'm not even sure that I should fall into the category of crypto zoology all courageous aching because I'm not entirely sure they are creatures around him in the way we understand it um you know when you get reports of say a big foot vanishing in a flash of light\nOr you know the dog mine roaming around sort of sacred sites and that kind of thing\nIt makes me think that we daily with something that's perceived as an animal that night may not be I don't think Kael was I'm someone who is insightful enough way back in the sixties to make these connections but a lot of people\nJust didn't they just turn their heads I just did not want to know or at least didn't want to handle and Dale with the the way the side of these phenomena\nIn this book the book of monsters or several reports early in the book that sort of blend together at least in my head you got ... men go ugh men are we're ... we're cats sheep gestures are a lot of differences between the these creatures that are seen but also a lot of commonalities um\nOr or is it possible the role of the same thing are we talking about something different\n[noise] well I mean it's difficult to say really but I mean you know I I don't have any reports at all I should stress where somebody is you know at the turn of the full moon has changed into a Web well from a regular person\nOnly would imagery butts the fact that people do report saying I'm sort of large wolf like animals that seemed to have the ability to walk onto limbs unfold limbs\nUm I've got a lot I get a lot of reports like that but I've I've never gone to reports of someone you know literally\nShape shift the like in American we have all the London or anything like that\nUm but in a lot of these cases that I Do receive what I've found is that the the locations where they dug men type creatures said is intriguing it very often these ancient burial moms I'm Native American ally and\nUm some of the the the mysterious all mountains in Wisconsin and so on um so I find the fact that they seem to be tied to certain locations is intriguing rather than just saying that random\nYou had one where we'll case that was from a military base it's not ancient either it's more recent times remember that yes\nYeah this was um at a British a bicycle royal Airforce how can break and are actually was able to speak to the witness personally this case went back to Nineteen seven say\nAnd he was um that to an American guy but it's working a overseas are EFL come right in the Nineteen seventies when there were a number of vices which had\nI'm an American presence this was a high to the Cold War and he he saw that he saw this creature that was like about five to six feet tall covered in ...\nAnd would have sort of kind of look like a big for type ... was it not for five that just the the face was very difference\nTo how you're describing a knife and it was more like a lung muzzle with point today is very much like a a German Shepherd so if you imagine sort of big for about a with a with a German shepherds head on it that's pretty much what he described and um\nYou know I didn't see any reason why he should you know create a story like that'll fabricate the story like that he was um I was able to confer is a background in the military and he said he just wanted to share the story because they never forgotten about it and it was so if\nYou got a lot of stories in this book instances where people are report these huge dogs I mean right on um held or the ... you make that that comparison in your book as well as these gigantic cats\nAnd the you know you can see All right maybe as an animal scape from New or maybe in somebody's dog that got out in his living wild but these things are seen over centuries over and over again running wild in the ... the u._k. countryside\nAnd some of the encounters have been really dramatic can you share a couple of those start with the the dog was\nWell yeah I mean where is it over here you know we had the dog mom which kind of looks like a a dog like animal that's you know clearly is not\nWell in England or the okay we have what are known as find some black dogs now\nI'm Conan of Conan Doyle who wrote the Sherlock Holmes novel hand to the basket veils he actually based his novel on a pre existing legend I'm of one of these many black dog stories that you can find in the u._k.\nAnd that typically a much ... much larger than regular dogs are like these fiery blazing red eyes\nI mean a lot of the old legends and traditions of you to say one of these um find some black dogs with all the money that you would die or you know a close family member or friend would die I'm On the unlike the dog my entire often same at the same places like\nGraveyards um pricey like that in moderation is I've got several um reports of people saying to find some black dogs in the vicinity of stone circles in the u._k. not at Stonehenge which is obviously the most famous one but the you know there are many many um smaller\nUm formations around me okay and I've got two cases for Scotland where witnesses so one of these large black dogs there\nAnd like they okay see going back centuries the dog was that one second and then quite literally gum and ... you know just vanished into nothing\nUm and again it's hard to determine what based things are you know ... not normal dogs I mean all eyes the spirits of\nDogs that was a slave to um I guess the only downside with that is it that much bigger than regular dogs you know you'd imagine if I were the spirits of of that dogs would resemble their dogs they look like in real life I'm\n... and then the cats are even harder to explain in the u._k. I mean there's no big cats lived there\nAre well now you write in fact I become known as ... face I Am big cats\nAnd I get every year we get dozens and dozens of reports of papal saying large black cats robbing the cat now the occasional sort of ask I ask I pay you know from a zoo or menagerie whatever might explain a couple of cases\nAnd you know there are cases where I'm wild animals actually have a guy from shows but I've always been rounded up very very quickly\nThe problem is there are these large black cats robbing around the a K which simply defy explanation because the sheer number of reports from the bottom of England to the top of the top of Scotland he's hundreds every\nNow for that many reports to exist you know that must be anti colonies are these creatures roaming around that is a payoff flesh and blood regular animals which not every race or the phenomenon thinks that's the case you\nKnow we're going to get into some of the more exotic explanations in a moment

your TV show beyond belief with your ... simply go to beyond belief dot com Mm Mm\nIt seems every third in each brother come through you know at various times\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local news pipe for the ... post\nAnd somebody had same this um what looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or if soaring would be a better term to use over the woods or at a high speed um you know kind of a\nLike a flying man I'm not unlike I guess the you know the stories coming out of ...\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of ... in that respect than there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of them even spoke to the local police or the I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have this spate of weird activity in this area which he's all ready notorious for sightings of things interesting enough like the dog mine and ah the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nYou have a story or in the book about the terror you call it the terrible old man thing Nineteen Seventy seven services and the windshield of all places in Sunnyvale, California\n[noise] oh yeah that that's a really creepy story you know I guess appropriate for um Halloween I missed the story I give them to me by a lady named Terri and she had the same time to a Nineteen Seventy seven with well I can only call like a month and black\nAnd not many black has that been portrayed by Will Smith and told me late Jones in the movies but the rail Matty black I'm much weight of that sort of very pile and skiing a\nAnd don't look entirely human by sort of almost ... ... and ... like I Know a lot of power normal overtones attached to the rail many black stories you know\nWhereas in the movies that sort of secret agents you know of a sacred agency\nBut Terry telling me the story of hands Nineteen Seventy seven when she was just a a young girl at the time she was having lunch with a friend\nAnd they create demand in black time towards them sat down and proceeded to tell Terry I'm basically to the future of the the rest of her life\nAnd it was filled with sort of doom and gloom and tragedy and she said that just looking at him was like looking it's somebody who was dead and almost like demonic was ... was that sort of terminology\nAnd um it was sort of penetrating eyes this old black suits and just guys off the Israeli\nI'm sort of intimidating creepy five and didn't really come across as being completely human\nDidn't something I mean the thing\nTeaching creepy ... but it didn't really come across as being completely human\nDidn't something I mean the thing is that this guy said was going to happen to her I think they they did happen to her\nOr yes that's right so she had a lot of tragedy in a life and the kind of\nFull costume that to happen and um\nI think when it happened as a teenager you know she she never re forgot it's all ... states and I think you know to have that sort of trauma hanging over here for the rest of your life you know believing that's what this man said we'll things said\nI'm going to come true you know I mean you could understand how it would create a great deal of stress for summer\nYou know the man stories at least the movie version of more men is that this creature up years different forms the different people different times but it's a harbinger of doomed commented predates a bad things that are about to happen\nIs that sort of how you think it plays out in the ... point pleasant and beyond\nWell yeah I mean there's no doubt it's um you know when you look at them off my story that it's sort of saturated in weirdness and tragedy for people who don't know it kicked jumping like sixty six employing plays in West Virginia\nI when people started saying this creature that some people described as like a flying humanoid\nA few people said it looked vaguely like a terrorist act to others described as a giant bed\nAnd I'm ... whatever that I was seeing people would play that I Would say something way bigger than any normal but a ... or anything like that\nAnd when the sightings are that hides in sixty seven you had a lot of we had a UFO activity\nUm

should what happened\nOr whether there's some credibility to those sightings what's your take on it\nWell you know you do get strange creatures waves in the field of crypto zoology you know a lot they as you mentioned the the ... just said in Chicago last summer\nUm and we get kind of spite so old wives' of activity in relation to other creatures I mean for example in the Nineteen seventies in much

think that might be\nYou know something that suggests again a connection between these creatures even though they have that saved as being very difference of course but uh\nBut that that way of

on the contacts have but predominantly because they have this political salons\nOr in many of their claims buddy the important thing is\nAt the end of the day what it boils down to is that the FBI and the other agencies were opening surveillance files on people who claimed close encounters um with non human entities\nAre you in a report in the book that's coming out of the first of November a\nTop secret alien abduction vials Europe or something that I had read before it's about a brief famous case\nA Antonio ... was ... the the this is an abduction case in which the guy had reported that he had sex with an alien female and uh I'd never heard this new explanation but it takes the government surveillance do all different level still that story\nWell yeah this this is a strange one I mean the the conventional aspect if you if you can call it a conventional um aspect to the story goes back to the fifties and it's a famous case uh from Brazil where the young man named Antonio ... claim to fame taken on board\nA UFO and as you said he had sex with this beautiful looking um alien woman\nAnd I'm I'm ... he was taken on board against his will so he was abducted you know it wasn't Eileen abduction case\nUm we didn't you follow gee you know he saw the perceived as being a wishful thinking on the part of Sonia villa suppose\nAll you know it was a really weird aspects of the phenomena and\nNow there's this little I'm known aspect to to the story\nA which places an entirely different slant on it until now if you read carefully Antonio Baylor spouses a report that he put together for um a Brazilian a UFO researcher and a doctor named a lot of fun says\nUm he talks about how they craft that he was taken on board\nUm came down and he started to feel weird as if he'd been drug somehow and he said he was taken aboard this craft which he described as being sort of long rectangular and um he had like something on TALK like a dish that was spinning around very fast\nAnd he was making a Beijing noise that's kind of sounds not unlike a helicopter you know the the shape they the ...\nIt was making a Beijing noise and that kind of sounds not unlike a helicopter you know the shape they the spinning disk on top of the road to some debating noise says like the classic sound you get with a helicopter\nNow a man came forward um in the late Nineteen seventies but he's story didn't get very much a publicity is your name was Bosco metal ... and he had ties to ah to say I in various other agencies\nAnd um he told a racial a year for research rich Reynolds of what he said was the real story namely that um the the abduction was a fabrication\nAnd that's the one that he really did evolve alley cup to but they targeted um ... hours he was out to the ... lights at night\nUm they release some sort of aerosol illusion of Jenike aerosol er which incapacitated and choking on board the helicopter and the the woman was rarely that and the power was played out\nUm but he is in a sort of an old to states wasn't sure what was going on and that was that sort of an ceremony asleep dumped back on the ground\nAnd the the the rate of the story was but the agencies within governments that might well a vein rail abductions but they were also fabricating abductions to try and determine\nHow bad modest with the fifties love the CIA eyes and ... and things like they the plan was to try and determine\nTo want to extend the human mind could be altered and you know in other words if we can convince people that I can say I aliens we can convince them and anything that was basically what it came down to so metal ... claim that um [noise] the the the the abduction if you like was played out\nAnd buy kind of just then sat back and white hate to say how much of the story was taken in when I realized that the story of being embraced by you follow Jay and it was apparent in books\nIt was the case of a job well done and\nMakes you wonder you know you have several examples of these are pretty well documented abduction cases where the um the principal targets to think that that it's something beyond just some alien presidents that there's military or government involvement\nYeah I mean this is where it gets confusing if the you know throughout January and I didn't have adoptions and then you have agencies fabricating them to try and determine how the human mind can be altered and they use the UFO angle is the most taste to try and you know um to see how it works on people doesn't with\nSo you know it gets really confusing when the could be rail abductions and fabricated ones as well\nIt makes you wonder I mean is it possible there are agencies that are investigating the abductees messing with them a following them around losing their their phones but not investigating the abductions themselves to nominate cell or are they doing both than just not feeling\nWell yeah I think there's good evidence that it's um it's actually both because it's some of the duct tape that I spoke with said that they don't have a number of occasions I'd actually paying visited by military personnel and it wasn't like a a traumatic\nThreatening at my base situation it was more of these military personnel were actually approaching the abduct tastes quietly\nRequesting that I didn't talk about their experiences and some of them didn't and some of them have but I basically the ... it was as if the military were asking questions um along the lines of well can you give us some insight as to why this is being done\nIt was at least the military were asking questions\nUm along the lines of well can you give us some insight as to why they should have done so in other words I was trying to get to the hearts of what the abductions where why that would be done but in other cases there is good evidence also of um ... and stuff they have to pay a good example\nAnd somebody um it was tied to coast to coast I'm ...\nI'm Greg tell me how\nUm he had to pay to correspondents in the Nineteen nineties or with up to ... who wrote a number of good books on abductions and she was an ap duct tape herself\nAnd Greg Child may have you back in the early

I saw his name I was going to mention that in the book and ask you about it\nI mean there are a lot of people in the UFO field who you know are are not as credible is Greg who are sure that the government's watching him I'm and I'm not sure I Believe all of them I Believe him though he says it and you\nKnow I think sometimes you know there's no doubt that if you have a traumatic experience like an abduction then I think sometimes paypal can become sort of paranoid of every little thing in their life you know um which is a dangerous route to go down\nUm but in saying that I made another example is the whole issue of black helicopters which I think many papers shall Shiite them with capital ...\nI'll tell you what they were let's wait a second we'll get into that on the other side of save some time so people can ask you a couple of questions but we got some other ground to cover before then we're going to go into the break with a deep purple demons I think he's Seventy\nOne joined

cursory examination investigation that\nReally didn't get to the bottom of it and then nothing so what do you make of that and in combined with the the black helicopter phenomena that you're discussing this book\nWell I think you know the the black helicopter phenomena and I'm a clearly a rail one and it does seem to be tied to both ... and um [noise]\nThe abduction phenomena and one of the things that's as being no taste and I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that these whoever's flying these helicopters\nPotentially I think is part of an organization that up

the fate from I should act when you're dealing with private corporations which aren't covered by ah by the fate and information request\nSo in that sense I think you know the the phenomena knees rail and I think whether it's ... or abductions the Gulf seems to base of islands to try and figure out what's going on you know there there's so many\nCases of black helicopters and on ... helicopters turning up near the homes sometime precariously there the homes of alien abduction Hasan again kind of light with college entering Greg\nThey might be a degree of um intimidation but also it might be an attempt to just keep an eye on the abduct pays 'em and be able to to respond at high speed a fit in a a [noise]\nEvent that they have that the fable fly Matty cops his were actually able to catch an ad abduction going ahead you know in the ... of that very time\nSomebody who's as tuning in tonight for the first time has to think we're all crazy alien\nAnd you know in the recession that very time\nSomebody who's is tuning in tonight for the first time has to think we're all crazy alien abductions Kevin relations black helicopters and we're saying yeah stuff happens\nBut the files that you've obtain from US government from the u._k. government sheds light on these things and someone takes it seriously maybe the scariest part of this is\nThat there isn't anyone who really knows what's going on in their agencies different agencies in government small groups of people who are looking at this but really don't have answers about who's responsible and why this stuff happens\nWell yeah I mean that that that's a good point George because I mean government agencies don't always know what another agency knows a you know many many cases agencies came the information to themselves unless they used to be shed and if we daily with\nI had a group that actually isn't technically part of the government but the works farmed out to\nA private companies and things like that that's going to make it even more difficult but I mean in terms of the files on the um on the black helicopters I've probably got about three or four hundred pages\nI'm so that that includes the FBI stay classified files on Capitol mutilation is\nI'm a wave of and cancers that occurred in Seventy five and some of the the no native and know of and I'm bored of the United states in in the ... to Seventy five\nAnd I'm just various other cases including some from the u._k. when there was a wave of activity of UFOs in Seventy three and there was also a wave of black helicopters in the same areas\nSo I think we're seeing a pot and and then I think the violence and intimidation a sort of the the vine cooling cause that you know I'm explain why they're flying around\nYou know trying to figure out what's going on with these abductees experiences or to literally physically real or not it it's tough to to even though there are some really well documented cases it's tough to figure it out it's hard to figure out what\nSomeone else is looking for when they put people through this stuff you mentioned you bring up bubbles are in the in the book\nAnd I should mention that there was a film coming out about those are it'll be the thirtieth anniversary of when that story first came out the germ ... got to come out in December and then there's a book that's going to be published I think after the first year\nSo a lot of interest in the case but your angle was kind of an interesting one on one how it fits into the whole abductee aliens scenario\n[noise] well yeah I mean you know ... story is always intrigued me a lot of people dismiss you out rides but one of the things I've always found about this law is unlike a lot of pain flu hoax things\nThat you follow gee you know when this story runs out of feel um you know they suddenly out a new angle to it so they can get back on the ... and so on\nUm you know they are and I think that the big difference with ... or is he never

Jay and you know polling and\nHowever many you know dollars and so forth he doesn't you know regardless of the the controversial nature of the story it doesn't come across like your average ... so that's one of the thing that's always intrigued me but um you know the in relation to the book I talk about the connections\nBetween the abductions and paypal who\nIn relation to the book I talk about the connections between the abductions and paypal who claimed that in some way or another they the the grace of the aisle and grays new to the abductions that somehow they have this\nDeep and sort of sinister and disturbing interested in the human so um and they sort of ties in with ... when he claimed that he was given a bunch of a briefing papers to read out and ask for this portion of very fifty while he was working at allegedly\nAnd um he said that was the the Iranians or whatever they are viewed us as containers and um any speculated on the possibility of containers of cells\nIn other words if the grave had some sort of obsessive interesting in the human cell and one of the things I talk about in the book is\nI'm a number of abduct pays who were approached climbed steadily by these military agencies\nAre private corporations I'm Still ask questions about you know did you have any dreams afterwards if you've followed a veal salt leaving your body um\nDid you have any sort of like a religious confession after the abduction thing really weird questions but some of the questions kind of\nDove tiled wave the story that was always tell him as well\nYou know you you look at recent developments in regard to the UFO topic in general\nAnd then of course we've been told since Nineteen sixty nine the U.S military the air force and they stopped project ... they're not studying it is no threat to national security we don't care we're not looking at it and of course you know I don't know that anyone ever really believed that but\nThat was the cover story and and now we've learned last ten months that wasn't true that there were ongoing studies that were more than one in fact that they were collecting information on what seems like you know presumably is ridiculous topic um in light of the kind of files that you bring up in this book where there's surveillance and there's\nCounter intelligence and there's um you know just information and things that sort\nOf do you have concerns about the recent revelations I I I Would think that people who were suspicious sooner weary of this you know they were some history behind why they need to be careful\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know it is such a confusing angle judge you know this this angle of um rail abductions fabricated abductions the surveillance the government itself trying to get its had around what's going on\nYou know you put all this together and um [noise]\nYou know ... ... it really sort of a a difficult area which to work to try and figure out you know watch true what is and so\nWhat was it somewhere between the two you know and um and again that's why you know went on the way I've written the book is to demonstrate what we know the says you know what we speculate as to why the government or an agency might be doing this why might they be fabricating\nAnd abduction events but then at the same time also investigating a legitimate events\nYou know it's it's it's not ... now

experiences that people report over the centuries things that happened to them for real or not real they can't exist and therefore they don't\nKnow the disconnect between\nCenturies of human experience and rigid doctrine is maybe one reason why so many people have given up on science in ways that are probably inappropriate and unfair and also possibly dangerous is there a way to reconcile\nThe seemingly bizarre experiences that people have reported through the centuries out of body experiences missing time time slips near death encounters other realities of science versus spirituality science and religion is their way to bridge all of that well\nDr Christopher white has written a remarkable new book\nThat offers a unique a new understanding of topics that we often discuss here on this program but can't really explain other dimensions of the realities whether or not this reality might bleed into others and vice versa\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics\nThis is an laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions a fourth visual dimension that uh the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look that are on the equations with cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant\nUm um and so on so and in fact just to skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nUh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifty six Seventeen and more\nAnd these are string theorist I don't know um if you are\nYour members every audience of her string theory but sure yeah I'm using so yes string theory M theory brain theory so these these are basically mathematical theory is that incorporate these other dimensions and and they do it again in order to make make simpler\nAnd more elegant the basic equations that govern government the universe their string theorists in um theoretical physicists mathematicians who do this are really trying to wrestle with one problem that really is the the biggest problem in modern physics\nAnd the problem is that we have two sets of equations that seemed to govern reality um and we know that both sets the equations are correct\nBut we also know that they don't fit together we have we we have we had a set of equations that govern very small things in the universe and um that Governor governor some atomic world as the er the atomic world world of quantum\nAnd we know those equations work we know they're correct on the other hand we have a set of equations that govern the movement hum\nOf the of the very large so planet and sons and galaxies and it's on 'em and these are Einstein's\nTheory of general relativity week we know both of those sets of equations are correct\nBut we also can't see a way for them to fit together they don't they don't fit together so string theorists and others are\nAssuming that there are additional spatial dimensions and they're using them in order to come up with a single set of mathematical equations that would be encompassing and that would put together the other the other equations that we have it\nIn between sort of the ... version and the one to merge and things like spooky action at a distance which of scientists have struggled to explain and tangled theory right\nOh absolutely absolutely yeah I mean\nYou know a mathematician who who work on on these subjects are also have to wrestle with other mysteries right there are other mysteries revealed by quantum mechanics for sure [laughter] you know that they're definitely trying to wrestle with the problem with having two sets of equations that don't fit together\nAnd they're and they're using higher dimensional concepts to try to try to work on that but as you say yes there's there's other strange uncanny on implications of of quantum physics that uh that that have found their way into pop culture for sure you know and\nAnd ... and all these ideas I think to some extent have found their way into pop culture and I try to talk about that in the book as well\nRight and the book is not just about scientists working on these ideas the book is about scientists who work on these ideas but then\nI'm a scientist who then have religious experiences and then try to use these ideas to think about them and then even other people who who have religious experiences and start to talk about them is higher dimensional or or somehow related to some some concepts and physics\nOr maybe we could use flat land as an illustration it's both an illustration and sort of an inspiration for a lot of the people who you write about in this book or tell us about flat land and I guess it wasn't a pop culture but\nIn and sort of an inspiration for a lot of the people who you write about in this book or tell us about flat land and I guess it wasn't a pop culture phenomenon when it came out\nYeah absolutely yeah flatland a great little book um\nSo ... kind of a classic science fiction or nonfiction book written a long time ago a written an Eighteen eighty four but it has quite a cultural life and in fact\nI remember reading flatland in high school calculus so ... you know math students all over the world still read flatland as a way of kind of expanding are thinking about you know what is it what does it mean to live and uh the kinds of spaces and kind of dimensions we live in so\nThat's a great little book written by an Anglican priest named Edwin Abbott he was British he was he was raised in the middle of the nineteenth century I'm coming to coming to age in a in an era of science and wrestling with what it meant to be religious and scientific at the same time\nUm you know it was a time you know this Eighteen fifty nine was Darwin's origin of species and there were a number of\nUm there were a number of challenges I guess you'd say to Christianity\nAnd Edwin Abbott time so he he ended up writing this wonderful book flat land which is a book about a lower dimensional to mention the world and he wrote it in order to get people to get people think more about the possibility that\nUm other kinds of world could exist um embedded in in our own may maybe we live in a higher dimensional universe but habits flat world was it was a two dimensional world the book takes place in a two dimensional world this is a flat world that\nMight exist you know on on the surface of your table pop right so this this is a world that's completely flat and his populated by\nTwo dimensional objects as objects with just linked up with some of them were flat square some of them were flat circles are flat triangles and and even even lines they would all slide around on the surface of this flat world and of course they believe that\nUh they live in a two dimensional world until the climax\nUntil the climax of the of the novel when a three dimensional object\nA sphere inserts itself goes down in in ... inserts itself into the plane of flat land and there's a square character who looks out on his his flat land the rise and sees the appearance of this mysterious object he starts talking to them and the sphere says I'm you know I'm I'm a three dimensional object then I come from another\nAnother world and the spurs says this can't be possible in the sphere just cannot convince the square that they're flat a two dimensional world is is imbedded in a larger world so the sphere resorts to a more um like extreme measure any\nHe reaches over and pulls a square off of the plane world of flat lining up into three dimensional space and\nOf course the than the square looks around and looks down on his flat world and can for the first time I see the whole world spread out in front of them\nSo the square becomes a sort of a believer\nIn the existence of a higher dimension that there's a there's a third dimension and he goes back to his flat world of course and this is pretty enthusiastic about this and can't can't stay quiet about it is and unfortunately in ... when it's forbidden\nIt's forbidden by the by the high priest to talk about the existence of the higher dimension so he has put in jail where he where he stays for a number of years and years and and the story ends with this for flat square languishing in prison I'm hoping that\nHis readers ... some of his readers will be visionary enough to accept that there might be a more than meets the eye to to their reality so he sort of the idea that the high priest a flat land\nAnd I have to accept that there might be a more than meets the eye because of their reality so he sort of like\nThe idea that the high priest a flat land wouldn't allow anybody to talk about the other dimension I mean a commentary on sort of maybe rigid dogma of our time\nYeah yeah exactly exactly and he was he was very interesting comment on the\nSort of as you say the rigidity and and the social norms of Victorian England you know when he where he lived right sort of had to stay in your line and not have any wild um any wild Fox but at the square character did have these wild often and I even have the stationary experience right where he saw that there was\nThat there was another space or direction to reality and I'm\nSo happy I wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to\nThink about the possibility that above our three spaces are three spatial dimensions that might be others um that we don't see we go through our life I'm thinking about our world is the only world but you know maybe maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about it on to imagine um but when you combine higher dimensions and the ... it gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter]\nI tell you what we're gonna we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration I some of the stories that you tell about people who are inspired by this idea\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and they they go through\nTrials in turmoil in trying to get their head around it as as I have a at but we'll we'll get into that in a moment we're talking with Christopher white about other world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions of the doors break on through take us into the break\n\nTo find out where George ... speaking go to the coast to coast am dot com website scroll down to the bottom and click your just humid or\nTry to run\nThe and I\n\nExcuse me and and with wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension that has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual level levels are worlds to reality I Am hinted intends an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he he falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he he makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make [laughter]\nAll right and the situation as he he embraces mathematics and geometry as a kind of a\nAnd he kinda hangs on to that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty 'em to him so I think is his story is a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed as I say in the book he develops the whole way of\nThinking about higher spatial dimensions and he gets very interested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which\nI mentioned earlier in our conversation and then he he starts to think you know what if these what if these mathematical variables in my ... and you have these higher higher dimensions but I'm using what if they actually have a real existence somehow um\nYou know what if the math points to the real existence of these kinds of spaces and he he thought a lot about that and he he does something unusual and kind of unique he he develops of way of what he thought of as a sort of re educating the senses\nIn order to catch glimpses into this into the higher dimensional world so he developed a system of re educating the senses that involves um no it involves a set of twenty seven cubes that are labeled\nA all twenty seven are labeled and are stacked up into like a Rubik's Cube you know it's three by three by three\nUm and he and then he he memorize the positions of all of the squares and the Rubik's Cube and then he'll uh and then he'll rotate a Rubik's Cube and then he'll memorize all those positions it's essentially sort of an imaginative\nUm exercise but he believed that by doing it you're able to train yourself to perceive beyond the normal range of perceptions that we have so you know his mathematical colleagues\nSort of shook their heads I think uh you know he was he was he was an assistant professor of math at Princeton a for a while\nBut he didn't he didn't get tenure you know when you're trying to get tenure you should be publishing and um and doing your research but instead he he was doing things like putting this this uh this cue these keeps that together and helping coach the Princeton baseball team and he actually he actually also invented a pitching guy not just one of the first\nUm um you know automated pitching devices on ever invented so he did that and so he didn't get tenure Princeton [laughter]\nBut he went on to the University of Minnesota and then from there you just\nStarted writing popular books and articles about this idea that you know that there may be higher spatial dimensions and and these [noise] you know our ways of thinking about these things might be a new way to a new scientific way to talk about spirituality but as you say he was just one there there are many others in the book who are\nSeeking for new scientific answers to their spiritual questions\nWell as you documented trace I mean the this idea catches on it gets into pop culture you've got a ... in ... and I I Would think con men and religious leaders who grab onto it yeah they all use this idea for their own purposes\nYeah absolutely absolutely I mean I think a lot of people then you know and now a lot of people in the last hundred years are interested in scientific ideas as ways of\nUm as as new ways of thinking about spirit or spirituality or afterlife or heaven and so on and so I'd hindrance ideas and then a Abbott's ideas of course it's flat land both on both of their um [noise] you know the writings really become important so modern artists take these ideas\nOr spirits were writers take up these ideas a lot of religious people are in the U.S and then in Europe take these ideas a number of Christians take up these ideas as well um you know another person in the book [noise] chapter seven chapter eight is\nIs cs Lewis right which I'm ... who I'm sure many of your listeners have heard of cs Lewis are learning the ... famous British a Christian I'm Christian apologist and Christian writer probably the most twenty century is most famous Christian writer\nHe uh he incorporates these ideas as well you know he incorporates ideas about higher dimensions to rethink Christian ideas such as the trinity um and he\nHe incorporates them in a number of sermons ... and and his writings and then of course many people are familiar with the scent fantasy writings and the same ideas around there as well he's got he's got references higher dimensions at 'em\nAnd he uses these concepts there and and he he was interested in them spiritually to you know he\nHe was he was raised in the church but then he becomes an atheist or like many many characters in my book actually um he goes off to war\nAnd becomes disillusioned there's a number of people in there you know pre season there and James Bennett and I'm a number of people go off to World War one world war two in the book and they have they they get into combat situations OJ W diamonds and they're also also in combat\nThings happen ear and out of body experience right\nYeah right exactly a number of those people have these kinds of experiences that really shake them to the core and\nCause them to sort of rethink a reality and rethink religion and for some of them those war experiences and disillusioned them and turn them off from religion but others are like like James Bennett a he has this kind of out of body experience right but I talk about in chapter six um\nWhich is a chapter really about dreams that seem to predict the future I'm kind of a kind of a cool chapter I really like a chapter on so he has his out of body experience and then his his journey is trying to figure out how mathematics and science and especially the science of higher dimension how that might help explain what happened to him\nA lot of talk about dreams a little bit I explain it to me how how this would work how the idea of dreams are they coming from somewhere else Ohio reality another reality\nYeah yeah yeah no drinks are fascinating and um your dreams or seemed to be important and just about every culture around the world um you know and in many cultures people have dream interpreter is you know a special people who [noise]\nWhat it means um and we have that in our culture too right we have all kinds of uh [laughter] we have all kinds of dream interpretation books and we have people like the Swiss psychotherapist Carl young who many people know about who\nIs is really important for people as they think about interpreting their dreams and so yeah people have long thought about the spiritual meaning of of dreams and in my book uh especially in that chapter six people are also wondering about the the spiritual meaning of dreams\nI'm In that book uh there's a figure who is his name is Jay W done who was a British\nAaron article engineer also soldier and and goes into combat and the second bowler war in South Africa right around the turn of the twentieth century he's he's in combat and Nineteen oh two [noise]\nAnd he starts to have dreams that they're not surprised him he starts to have dreams are and nightmares really about terrible things happening and the dreams are then seem to happen in real life so he has\nHe has predicted dreams are what are sometimes called pre cognitive dreams he has dreams that seem to predict the future\nAnd these these surprise him I'm like I said they they do begin in ... as he's camped out uh with his with his platoon so they they seem to begin in combat situations and he started having them and he at first he wondered if he was maybe going insane I'm from the stress I'm In\nA battle and these kinds of things but he would have dreams and then he would wake up generally what happened was that he would have dreams and then you wake up and the next day or the day after that or the day after that he'd open the newspaper and see the event in the newspaper so one one of the dreams that he talks about in one of his book\nHe has a dream where he sort of standing on a hill he's looking down the hill towards the ocean and he's obviously on an island he recognizes the island as as I was someplace he's already been in his dreams he\nNoticed is that there's cracks and fissures in the ground and the decisions are venting gas on the ground is rumbling people seem to be going about their business they're speaking French\nBut he's panic and he's he's he's trying to alert people he's he knows that something is going to go wrong he knows it's going to be volcanic eruption so he's running around trying to get people's attention he doesn't speak French\nThey don't seem to speak English he ends up talking to one official after another official after another no one really believes him and he ends up waking up and kind of a sweat in a panic a couple of days later he opens up the newspaper and he reads about this a catastrophic\nVolcanic eruption and the island Martinique the French speaking island Martinique\n'em and several of the details from his dream or correct um\nAnd some of them aren't some of them aren't as well and he tries to think um you know how could this be how could how could in in my dreams how could I have seen an event that hasn't happened man he he keeps it to themselves for a while

hospital so once again another case in which\nUm you know you you're raised into a higher spatial dimension and then you can suddenly have this\nThese incredible powers a vision that you didn't have before right you can see through walls right you can see in places that you're not um so yeah people people end Moody's book um and and many others you know there's a lot of literature now about near death experiences they people do um sometimes use the language of higher dimensions to talk about what they experienced\nI'm not to say on says in the same category but you do a address say on this end up people's attempts to reach a higher a hour or an another world um [noise] yeah what's going on with those folks are they is there any legitimacy to that or or do you not want to pass judgment on it\nYeah I don't know um [noise] you know it's funny it's funny writing a book like this because you know I've never had any of these experiences [laughter] yeah I've never had a dream that seemed to predict the future um\nYou know I've never had an out of body experience right or or some of the um some of the experiences I've talked about\nSo you know I Know deja vu\nThat Asia who for sure yeah sure absolutely yeah um so in the book I Try to talk about a lot of experiences that other people are having um you know and I try to put him play their voices and and how they understand what's happening [noise]\nUm but I don't I don't know about fan since you know I I wouldn't rule it out as being as being possible you know I mean I think that I mean one thing if this book taught me one thing it would be that I think that the the world is is a much more complex\nAnd ah and amazing really than than we now uh you know I think there's much more to the universe than meets the guy um\nYou know I I I Do believe that a man and I think we know that from science I mean when you when you look at these or the physicist a cosmologist and read their\nRead their narratives about the universe read they're popular science publications I mean there's just there's more to the universe than meets the eye and so I really wouldn't rule out um spirits are ghosts are all those kinds of things you know I\nI I wouldn't be so arrogant as to as to you know sit here and say oh you know you definitely there's no way that anyone could have an experience like that um so I guess I Would just remain open to the open to those possibilities\nAnd you know I think what people would want to know is a is there a higher dimension that habit that would count as having an and if so do we go there and do we live live on beyond this\nYeah yeah right that's another big question that I Try to raise in the book you know the book it has all of these big\nLive on beyond this\nYeah yeah right that's another big question that I Try to raise in the book the book it has all of these big questions um\nYou know and and I don't answer that question in the book I think that's another question like a question about spirits and ghosts and found says I'm I'm certainly open to the to the possibilities there um and personally I I I Do believe that there is a now the world that we go to after the world I mean personally I Am I'm a believer you know I'm\nI Do believe in God and I do believe in spirit so I think I'm I think I'd line up more on that side of things with a kind of an openness to these different possibilities and like I say in the book I Try to put different voices in there and who have different opinions and and the reader kind of defined what they're saying you know I'm\nTrying to think what causes a bunch of folks on the phone to talk to you will go east of the Rockies Moses in Tallahassee you're on with Christopher white\nYou're more than ... hard as you go door\nTo mourn and

D. Priestley unethical Christopher here and if you've ever read\nWell anyway I I guess I could ask this question I don't know if you've ever read that J. D. priest leaves unethical Christopher here if you've ever read the pre ... a sort of a big essay on um it's called man in time it was published along with uh with one of the young books\nAs out of the wonderful book at the great books yeah yeah\nOh oh good so you have read it will very good well is there anything you can say about it I'm the one of the biggest issues are been happening is is with the I guess with physicists particularly you seem to still be attached it gets in the anthropology of physics it never really like them in there\nThat they're sort of preconceived\nTheir prejudices that come from their free services life I suppose uh uh toward a about time about the issue is a time and and you know sort of what it is how it arises\nHow would it can be even a fundamental dimension of our ah reality and and also the whole perception or not just the time but uh I mean I I when I look at things in a quantum level we we see that everything is everything is is a sort of waves\nAnd I mean of course people don't even ask what waves are frequencies are but but time becomes very essential 'cause it's just the existence of matter that\nYou do an art project or a perception of it anyway so I mean they're just\nAs any way to have any comments or thoughts about the\nThank you Charles appreciate the call\nYeah that's that's a great question and that's a that's a wonderful book come\nJ. B. briefly I talked about in chapter six quite a bit he's a fascinating character I'm a very famous British writer playwright and twentieth century and BBC broadcaster\nHe gets really I'm interested in higher dimensions on he reads a hint and who we talked about he read straight W done who have talked about\nUm and he comes up um and then all of his own theories interestingly Priestley like some of the other figures in the book has a combat experience he also fights in World War one and a young person and as um as an injured [noise]\nUm and he also has some he also has some unique experiences of feeling like he's out of time a feeling like he's out of body and then he writes this great book that the caller mentioned are called man and time\nUm and in the book he has all kinds of testimonials from people who have written to him about their pre cognitive dreams have their dreams that\nSeem to predict future events um he actually gets on the BBC in Nineteen sixty two sixty three can't remember and he he asked\nThe the viewing audience to writing letters if they've ever had an unusual time experience I've ever slipped out of time if they've ever had a dream that predict the future and uh he got over Fifteen hundred letters um from from the from the viewing audience the let many of the letters are still\nExtent this still at the University of Bradford I've been there to read through all the letters and I I incorporate\nA number of them in my book especially will be that Christopher white will take a break we are talking about other worlds with Chris white and Tom Petty takes us into the break we'll get some more of your calls and questions in a moment\nYou in the ... page with those members is great for show up they didn't do anything with other means new to these little ... like\nYeah no I I've never tried reflection of exercises although in my book I talk a bit about um [noise]\nAnd actually some classes I teach at Vassar College I talk about meditation on reflective surfaces so you know there's\nThere's even iPhones crying you know I don't know if you've heard that word is crying before but that is sort of meditating on a reflective surface it could be a computer screen or television screen or selective water or a crystal ball or a number of different services but I Know that that is a spiritual and and visionary practice that a number of people use\nIn order to you know what what we say reach a higher consciousness or um [noise] yeah so that sounds similar to the kind of practice you're talking about\nUh Marcia I just write that down I'm going to give that a try next year the suggestion\nThat dollar [laughter] censored\nI think the idea right east of the Rockies Michael in Connecticut I'm Michael\n\nWhat happened to me is I uh I started writing all of a dream journal and I I wrote the dream that my mother's husband who was dead was going to give me a car and almost some money so [noise]\nI didn't believe it was gonna happen but it did happen and I'm now drive in his car and I got the money to show it was very strange to me that a dream I wrote it down with him with a date on it and everything and it came true like months later [laughter]\nYeah yeah that's right yeah there's a there's a whole technique that Jay W done talks about in his book experiment with time that I talk about in my book about dream journal and how to do it sounds like you did that you know you keep a journal there you have a dream you get up you write it down right away and and um people hold journalism and think about\nThat sounds like you did that you know you keep a journal there you have a dream you get up you write it down right away and and um keep a whole journal and and think about your dreams and he believed that you know like you you believe everyone would start having these experiences where they would see these glimpses I'm going into the future and the dream so that's that's a cool experience\nThank you Michael for sharing a wildcard line Joe in Monterey, California good morning Joe\n[noise] good a good evening at George I'm I was about to ask your guest if he ever meditative but I thought that it might be better if I introduce another concept to him as a what they call a super conscious mind [noise]\nUm it's not um in remote a few in remote viewing has it's drawbacks this is um this is a mental where it is a mental travel or sold travel but it's also in a higher state of Seoul travel a call ... conscious mind and you can access these high of world\nUm I Do this with my clients and uh they go into these different worlds that different reasons whether it's healing whether it's me to love one uh for other reasons um it's an extremely um complex\nA multi verse and there's so many different things out there doing so much there's so many different things\nI was wondering if he ever a considered also a kind of um higher shelf of remote of writing is that it's not like you're writing automatic because that automatic writing is really listening to your higher shelf as I call it like taking dictation\nAnd all it does all you need to do is go into like an alpha state or a train stayed and just start writing but listening to your thoughts not thinking but listening to what comes to you and after a short time it will start to come out and you'll be channeling your higher self\nYeah yeah I liked that comment because it reminds me of um [noise]\nYou know sometimes the ways that people talk about higher dimensions as a as a as a dimension of consciousness right I'm In and you definitely have the\nTwentieth century psychologist and call you on that and many others um you know when we talk about there being three spatial dimensions to our world and if there was a fourth direction or dimension where would that be some people say well if it's going in you know it's not going out somebody's going to end that consciousness sort of um occupies the\nThe sort of a new direction um and yeah through meditative practices I think it is possible to\nTo access those those dimensions um you'd asked if I meditate I Do meditate you know I Do sort of mindfulness meditation and I definitely get into a right into his own or do you feel sort of peaceful and quiet and calm I haven't had any visionary experiences while meditating it's it's much more a\nMuch more mundane unfortunately but um but I Do I Do meditate um and and do some of those practices and in my book I talk about others who have these kind of visionary meditative practices um sounds like what you do\nThanks job for the call you know you read about a musicians and writers who suddenly get inspiration from just out of the blue ... you have written about you know writing yesterday you woke up with it in his hand yeah or or or other songwriters entire songs already written it came from somewhere else\nYeah and you talked and talked to scientists about scientific creativity and scientific convention and many scientists while the same kind of stories some of them will talk about during some of them will talk about other forms of inspiration some of them will say that these ideas came from somewhere else and I don't know where they came from\nSome of them will talk about different there there's different layers of consciousness um so I think there's a lot of mystery isn't there\nA garden in Lakeland, Florida good morning\nThere's different layers of consciousness um so I think there's a lot of mystery isn't there\nA Gordon in Lakeland, Florida good morning Gordon on the wild card mind your own with Chris white\nYou know George ... uh I don't think I've ever called in to your show I I use a columnist George Norris southern Dr Chris why thank you for taking my call but before I ask a question I wanted to just reference\n... at Salem is found in Hebrew chapter seven which makes reference to the king and stay on in the Old Testament genesis fourteen and\nSo I'm going to end up for reference\nFor the listeners and Kate and since you said you didn't have it now I Want to plan and get your opinion on my my feeling in my theory that the UFOs goes Angels Demons are usually the same but in some cases to be different for reference I'm a Christian\nThat whole to the um Iran and the Eighteen prohibition against us on collecting the spirit will now pay contact us then I have a theory that in most cases\nUm and and ... I wanted to ask your opinion whether the when you saw the video up there on on a they your post post side I think that they may be using magnets to make a that pops up a pencil and can jump around but I also think it's possible but there are genuine\nDemons angels uh spirits which may may actual I don't think it's likely later the spirit but it could be or maybe\nEating from another dimension and somehow the hold button in most cases the demon masquerading as UFOs and eat teams but in some cases there may be Eighteen so I'm going to stay on the line in case you're asking a question or something because this was pretty deep\nWell that's a lot on their Gordon let's let's get their take on some of that\nYeah there there's a lot there um [noise] there's a lot there and there's a you know there's a whole all of the uh all of the science fiction literature and um\nAnd even alien abduction literature uses that language of other dimensions rice says that these that these beans came from another dimension I'm so there definitely is a lot of that in my book and there's a lot of American Pop culture\nAbout um other dimensional or other dimensional beings um you also raise the question of\nYou know what is the relationship of UFOs an extra traditional\nTrash or all beings to ghosts and spirits or demons or not that's also a question that people raise 'em\nYou know I'm not sure I'd be able to shed any additional light on that I I Know that from just some of my reading and and not literature and here I'm thinking of like ... I don't know if you know but at least drivers and stuff I'm I'm young I'm communion or he actually has a new book I'm\nI'm On the subject as well that he he talks sort of like you do I mean he he also wonders um what's the relationship is between\nAlien abduction and extraterrestrials on the one hand versus um spirits and goes on the other so he I think Whitley is come to come to believe that there's there's a connection um and it sounds like you've you've come to believe that as well if there's a\nThat the connection somehow you know maybe the part of the spirit um our aliens or aliens are depart spirits\nI Know we we explore the idea of a unified theory of weirdness on the program a crush on him looking for his actions\nAnd you'd be amazed how many scientists or a behind the scenes are interested in those kinds of subjects as well whether there's a connection yeah look at the idea of the University of many worlds theory you talk about it in your book of course\nIt wasn't that long ago that that would have been too far out for just about any of them to accept the now it's it's not all that a controversial anymore\nIsn't it crazy yeah it's really crazy I mean\nJust about any of them to accept the now it's it's not all that a controversial anymore\nIsn't it crazy yeah it's really crazy I mean\nYeah and there's a number of ways of thinking about a a world or a universe with many worlds right and he mentioned the many worlds theory quantum mechanics and there's of course also the the multi first idea right the multiverse ideas that there's\nYou know I'm a large number or an infinite number of other universes in addition to our visible universe and you know I um I Believe now that that's a that's a very mainstream I'm I\nPrefer to conventional wisdom now among cosmologists and theoretical physicists that that there is a multi birth you know which is\nUm and that that's another fantastic scientific concept that there is not proof for there's really not proof for that idea but it it is it has become a kind of a healing idea to scientists and then you mentioned that sort of many infinite parallel universes of many worlds theory or the many worlds

for granted sometimes that all those ideas are real or at least we think we understand that wasn't always that way for people do how do we get to this point and what does it mean for us if there are other dimensions does it mean there are people in those other places and if so can they get here or maybe they're us\nThese are heavy topics but we have a great guess to help us get our heads around them\nChristopher white earned a PHD and religious studies from Harvard He's written a brilliant book called other worlds spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions which takes a look at how our understanding of the world around us and unseen worlds such as the future or heaven\nOr other dimensions have a ball or how it reconcile science and spirituality and makes room for exotic subjects that kind of things we discuss on this program near death experiences\nOut of body experiences ESP deja vu what happens\nTo us when we die for Halloween when spirit supposedly roam around among us so I figured this might be a good fit Dr white has written an entertaining and provocative masterpiece and I'm really looking forward to him joining us in the second half of the program coming up a bit later\nI did actually roam around India to bats and China so they're all there is a good chance that what we're saying we thought it was on animals could be surviving pockets of jog on to pay the costs now we don't know granted\nIf big votes um you know falls into that category because we don't really know\nHow gigantic this war you know did he was like a gorilla ordered it walk upright like us you know that would give us the answers but we don't have enough skeletal\nMaterial to make that sort of determination but ah you know I think the the idea of extinctions that might actually not be ... stings could actually uh applied to a number of these so called trip to says that cold\nAnd then you get into some real weird when the ballet and healing books like that and written about commonalities with these creatures\nThough yeah maybe illusion that were reported long ago are now being reported ETs or aliens and it may be the same beings that are in different forms are seen through a different culture in prison where you come down on that\nWell yeah I mean I'm a big I'm sort of follower of of John ... particularly and I think one of the things for me at least\nI mean I you know different people get difference you know responses from from reading his books but from my perspective I I kind of take the view that is most important um [noise]\nRevelation if you like or conclusion was that many of these phenomena seem to be multi connected if you like interconnected and by that you know you have a lot of reports where people have seen big for type creatures on in the same location and timeframe\nA site for example UFO activity I'm the most money point pleasant West Virginia or in the sixties um when there was ... when they come off from the same soaring around the [noise]\nThe skies above ... point pleasant he'll settle a lot of encounters with the men in black and you were following cancer so I think some of these creatures that way some of the the we're the ones like ... and the dog men and things like that\nI think I'm not even sure that I should fall into the category of crypto zoology will all courageous aching 'cause I'm not entirely sure they are creatures are animals in the way we understand it um you know when you get reports of say a big foot by Michigan a flash of light\nOr you know the dog mine roaming around sort of sacred sites and that kind of thing it makes me think that we daily with something that's perceived as an animal that night may not be I don't think Kael was I'm someone who is insightful enough way back in the sixties to make these connections\nMight not be I don't think Kael was I'm someone who is insightful enough way back in the sixties to make these connections but a lot of people just didn't they just turn their heads I just did not want to know or at least didn't want to handle and fail with the the way the site of these phenomena\nIn this book the book monsters there are several reports early in the book that sort of blend together at least in my head you got ... men go ugh men are we're ... we're cats sheep chapters are a lot of differences between the these creatures that are seen but also a lot of commonalities\nUm aren't there or is it possible there all the same thing are we talking about something different\n[noise] well I mean it's difficult to say really but I mean you know I I don't have any reports at all I should stress where somebody is you know at the turn of the full moon has changed into a Web well from a regular person you know that sort of all the\nThe Hollywood imagery butts the fact is that people do report saying I'm sort of large wolf like animals that seems to have the ability to walk onto limbs unfold limbs\nUm I've got a lot I get a lot of reports like that but I've I've never gone to reports of someone you know literally shape shift the like in you know American we have all the London or anything like that\nUm but in a lot of these cases that I Do receive what I've found is that the the locations where they dug men type creatures have said is intriguing it very often these ancient burial moms I'm Native American ally and\nUm some of the the the mysterious old mountains in Wisconsin and so on um so I find the fact that they seem to be tied to sit and locations is intriguing Bob and just saying that random\nYou had one uh where we'll case that was from a military base it's not ancient either it's more recent times remember that yes\nYeah this was um at a British a bicycle royal Airforce all can break\nAnd uh I actually was able to speak to the witness pass in this case went back to Nineteen Seventy and he was um that you are an American guy but it's working a overseas Ari how come right in the Nineteen seventies when there were a number of vices which had\nI'm an American presence there is there's a high to the Cold War and he he saw that he saw this creature that was like about five to six feet tall covered in ...\nAnd would have sort of kind of look like a big for type ... was it not for the five that just the the face was very different\nTo how you describe an ape and it was more like a lung muzzle with point today is very much like a a German Shepherd so if you imagine sort of big football today with a with a German shepherds head on it that's pretty much what he described and um [noise]\nYou know I didn't see any reason why he should you know create a story like that'll fabricate the story like that he was um I was able to confess as a background in the mail a tray and he said he just wanted to share the story because they never forgotten about it and it was so when\nYou got a lot of stories in this book instances where people are report these huge dogs I mean right out of ... you make that that comparison in your book\nAs well as these gigantic cats\nAnd the you know you can see All right maybe it's an animal scape from the zoo or maybe somebody's dog that got out in his living wild but these things are seen over centuries over and over again running wild in the ... or the u._k. countryside and some of the encounters have been really dramatic can use\nOver and over again running wild in the ... the u._k. countryside and some of the encounters have been really dramatic can you share a couple of those start with the the dog\n[noise] well yeah I mean where is it over here you know we have the dog mine which kind of looks like a a dog like animal that's you know clearly is not\nWell in England or the okay we have what are known as find some black dogs now\nI'm Conan of Conan Doyle who wrote the Sherlock Holmes novel behind the ... he actually based his novel on a pre existing legend I'm of one of these many black dog stories that you can find in the u._k.\nUm that typically a much ... much larger than regular dogs are like these fiery blazing red eyes\nI mean a lot of the old legends and traditions if you were to say one of these um find some black dog see what are the main that you would die or you know a close family member or friend would die\nI'm On the ... the dog my entire often same at the same places like um crossroads graveyards um places like that in moderation is I've got several um reports of people saying the find some black dogs\nIn the vicinity of stone circles in the u._k. not at Stonehenge which is obviously the most famous one but you know there are many many um smaller\nI'm full nations around the a K and I've got two cases from Scotland where witnesses saw one of these large black dogs that and like the old cases going back centuries the dog was that one second and then quite literally gum and next second you know just vanished into nothing\nUm and again it's hard to determine what these things all you know that clearly not normal dogs I mean all the ice the spirits of\nDogs that once lived um I guess the only downside with that is a much bigger than regular dogs you know you'd imagine if I were the spirits of of that dogs they would resemble the dogs they look like in real life I'm\n... and then the cats are even harder to explain in the u._k. I mean there's no big cats lived there\nAnd well now you write and they become known as I say I am big cats\nAnd I get every year we get dozens and dozens of reports of papal saying large black cats robbing the K now the occasional sort of ask I ask I pay you know from a zoo menagerie whatever might explain a couple of cases\nAnd you know there are cases where I'm wild animals actually have a sky from those but I've always been rounded up very very quickly the problem is\nThere are these large black cats roaming around the U. K. which simply defy explanation because the sheer number of reports from the bottom of England to the top of the top of Scotland these hundreds every year\nNow for that many reports to exist you know there must be anti colonies of these creatures roaming around that is if they are flesh and blood regular animals which not every race or to the phenomenon thinks that's the case you\nKnow we're going to get into some of the more exotic explanations in a moment talking with Nick red burn about who's the monster book creatures beach and beans nature of this could be the rock and roll theme song for Halloween ACDC hell's bells we'll be right back\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local newspaper the chase post\nAnd somebody as saying this um what looked like a humanoid Fager sort of literally flying or a soaring would be a better term to use our the woods are at high speed um you know kind of a\nLot of flying man I'm not unlike I guess they you know the stories coming out of ...\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of power outage in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of the ... to the local police or I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was in ... in that you know you have this spite of weird activity in this area which he's already notorious for sightings of things interesting a lot that dog man and or the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nYou have a story or in the book about the terror you call it the terrible old man thing Nineteen Seventy seven at services and the windshield of all places in Sunnyvale, California\nOh yeah that that's really crazy story and I guess appropriate for um Halloween and it's a story I gave them to me by a lady named Terri and she had these things can change a Nineteen Seventy\nCold like a mom in black and not many black as that put portrayed by Will Smith and told me late Jones in the movies but the real men in black and much weight of that sort of very pile and skiing a\nAnd don't and look entirely human by sort of almost ... ... ... like I Know a lot of power normal overtones attached to the rail many black stories you know\nWhereas in the movies that sort of secret agents you know all the sacred agency\nBut Terry telling me the story of hands Nineteen Seventy seven when she was just a a young girl at the time she was having lunch with a friend\nAnd they create demanding black time towards them sat down and proceeded to tell Terry I'm basically to the future of the the rest of her life\nAnd it was filled with sort of doom and gloom and tragedy and she said that just looking at him was like looking it's somebody who was dead and almost like demonic was ... was that sort of terminology\nAnd um it was sort of ... this old black suits and just gave off base really I'm sort of intimidating creepy ... didn't really come across as being completely human\nDidn't something I mean the thing is that this guy said was going to happen to her I think they they did happen to her\nOr yes that's right so she had a lot of tragedy in a life and the kind of\nFull costume that to happen and um\nI think when it happened as a teenager you know she she never really forgot it's all ... states and I think you know to have that sort of trauma hanging over here for the rest of your life you know believing that's what this mindset or things said\nI'm going to come true you know I mean you could understand how it would create a great deal of stress for summer\nYou know the man stories at least the movie version of more men is that this creature up years ... different forms to different people different times but it's a harbinger of doomed commented predates a bad things that are about to happen\nIs that sort of how you think it plays out in the men's I think the point wasn't and beyond\nWell yeah I mean there's no doubt it's um you know when you look at them off my story that it's sort of saturated in weirdness and tragedy for people who don't know it kicked off the lights sixty six important players in West Virginia\nI when people started seeing this creature that some people described as like a flying humanoid\nA few people said it looked vaguely like a terrorist act so others described as a giant bud\nAnd um but whatever that I was seeing people who play that I was saying something way bigger than any normal but a ... or anything like that\nAnd when the sightings were that hides in sixty seven you had a lot of we had a UFO activity\nUm the surfacing of this weird creepy character named injury cold it was like approach so many black and also a lot of other amyloid they unconscious and also reports of women and black\nTurning up and threatening a UFO witnesses out of the highlights of it of course you know you have the specter of the month month flying around town\nNow in December sixty seven um they the towns um as it's called or as he was called the silver bridge collapsed into the Ohio River a point pleasant someone side of the Ohio River in Ohio is on the other side obviously\nAnd um the bridge collapsed into the river killing dozens of papal and various race such as um addressed the the connection or the potential\nOff mine on the collapse of the bridge and the deaths and you have that was really sort of two overriding ferries one but my mom either caused the disaster but that's all that he was sort of a a warning and to tell you that in in its own strange way try to warn people\nOf looming um disasters and invite look\nI'm that's still very much divides people directed upon you know to this day but Sahm was also an English equivalent of it known as they our mind which also has a sort of had to try to red eyes and large wings in a a humanoid form\nAnd a friend of mine John Diamond says looked into this case deeply John eventually had to walk away from the research because he found that every time he started to get back into the\nRace a chicken investigated soon they all my stories about things would happen to him like car accidents and I'm ill health\nAnd it happens so many times close to just after we started doing the research that he realized from his perspective\nBut it really was as if you know a cloud of a dark cloud would come over him every time he got into he said he quite literally ... I've actually said I'm done you know I'm I'm staying away from it because he felt somehow it was getting his claws maintain\nA resurgence of interest in more men in recent times in the Chicago area a lot of reports of people who've seen the same thing and I I don't have a strong feeling of it either way\nWhether it is wishful thinking on the part of the people who follow this sort of stop and wish you what happened or whether there's some credibility to those sightings what's your take on it\nWell you know you do get strange creature waves in the field of crypto zoology you know a lot they as you mentioned the the ... just said in Chicago last summer\nUm and we get kind of spite so old waves of activity in relation to other creatures I mean for example in the Nineteen seventies in much of Pennsylvania um there was sudden spots and outbreaks of big activity\nUm some of these white bumps the stories you know that they won't be any side things for years and then suddenly there's you know a two week period we get a lot of things like that\nAnd um that kind of I'm I'm really feel like he's sort of paralleled throughout various other types of of creatures so again I'm inclined to think that may be\nYou know something that suggests again a connection between these creatures even though they are perceived as being very difference of course but uh\nBut that that way of activity in um Chicago last year it was very interesting now for my own perspective although I didn't really investigate the ... side things because um there are a lot of people\nUm who are already looking into it's one of them a friend of mine Alison John Lennon shaving two and a lot of good research into it but what I did I wrote a couple of articles about aids\nAnd in relation to have a number of witnesses to them off in Chicago had suddenly afterwards had lots of almost as ice or prevented dreams of nightmares of nuclear destruction and um [noise]\nAtomic mushroom clouds and you know the end of civilization\nAnd I actually had somebody in the ... region of close to thirty people respond to that article\nUm who many of them living in the Chicago area who felt that um you know something might happen or others I had these I continue um dreams and nightmares of atomic war in the United states and um\nThere's a hundred days I continue um dreams and nightmares of the atomic war in the United states and um and I felt somehow that he was connected with a sightings\nOf this my last month talked preacher so in that sense you know that was that was kind of a disturbing situation you know to get old days nuclear\nNightmares as I told him you know from paid with saying these strange ... was was kind of disturbing\nUm you know I think you're you're careful not to take too strong position in defense of some of these cases are actually you will make a comment that let your readers know where you are on that you will respond to a critics who try to just brush it off\nAnd I I Know you have

were opened on them so in other words yes we have files opened on the contacts have but predominantly because they have these political science\nOr in many of the claims buddy the important thing is at the end of the day what it boils down to is the FBI and the other agencies were opening serve islands files on papal who climbed close encounters um wave nonhuman entities\nAre you in a report in the book that's coming out of the first of November um\nTop secret alien abduction vials Europe or something that I had read before the ... case a Antonio BS boa ... the the this is an abduction case in which the guy had reported that he had sex with an alien female\nAnd uh I'd never heard this new explanation but it takes the government surveillance to all different level film that story\nWell yeah this this is a strange one I mean they the conventional aspect if you if you can call it a conventional um aspects of the story goes back to the fifties and he's a famous case\nUh from Brazil where these young man named Antonio ... claim to fame taken on board a UFO\nAnd as you said he had sex with this beautiful looking um I live in woman and um and ... he was taken on board against his will so he was abducted you know it was an alien abduction case\nI'm within you follow gee you know it's hard to say this ... a wasteful\nAbducted you know it was an alien abduction case\nUm we didn't you follow gee you know he saw the perceived as being a wishful thinking on the part of Antonina villa suppose\nAll you know it was a really weird aspects of the phenomena and\nNow there's this little I'm known aspect to the story\nA which places an entirely different slant on it until now if you read carefully Antonio ... says a report that he put together for um a Brazilian a UFO researcher and a doctor named ... says\nUm he talks about how they craft that he was taken on board\nUm came down on these started to feel weird as if he'd been drug somehow and he said he was taken aboard this craft which he described as being sort of long rectangular and um he had like something on TALK like a dish that was spinning around very fast\nAnd he was making the Beijing noise that's kind of sounds not unlike a helicopter you know the shape they the spinning disk on top of the road to the ... noise says like the classics and you get with a helicopter\nNow a mine came forward um in the late Nineteen seventies but he's still didn't get very much a publicity is nine was Bosco metal ... and he had ties to ah to say I and various other agencies\nAnd um he told a race or a year for research rich rentals of what he said was the real story namely that um the the abduction was a fabrication\nAnd that's the one that he really did evolve a helicopter but like targeted um ... hours he was out to the ... lights at night\nAnd I really some sort of aerosol illusion to Jenike aerosol\nEr which incapacitated in Tokyo rumbled the helicopter and the the a woman was rarely there and the power was played out\nUm but he is in a sort of an old to states wasn't sure what was going on and that was then soda and ceremony asleep dumped back on the ground\nAnd the the the re oh the story was but the agencies within governments that might well vein rail abductions but they were also fabricating abductions to try and determine\nHow bad monitors from the fifties love the CIA eyes and ... and things like they the plan was to try and determine\nTo want to extend the human mind could be altered and you know in other words if we can convince people that can say highly ends we can convince them and anything that was basically what it came down to some metal ... claim that um [noise] the the the the abduction if you like was played out\nAnd they kind of just then sat back and white to to say how much of the story was taken and I went I realized that the story of being embraced by you follow Jay and it was a parenting books it was the case of a job well done and\nMakes you wonder you know you have several examples of these are pretty well documented abduction cases where the um the principal targets to think that that it's something beyond just some alien presence that there's military or government involvement\nI mean this is where it gets confusing if they're you know throughout January in Iowa and abductions and then you have agencies fabricating them to try and determine how the human mind can be altered and I use the UFO angle is the most taste to try and you know um to see how it works on people doesn't work\nSo you know it gets really confusing\nI go to the ... to try and you know I'm just see how it works on paper doesn't work so you know it gets really confusing when the Kobe rail abductions and fabricated ones as well\nIt makes you wonder I mean is it possible there are agencies that are investigating the abductees messing with them a following them around listening or their phones but not investigating the abductions themselves the phenomena itself or are they doing both than just not telling us\nWell yeah I think there's good evidence that it's ah it's actually both because some of the duct tape that I spoke with said that they found a number of occasions I'd actually paying visited by military personnel and it wasn't like a a traumatic\nThreatening at my base situation it was more ... military personnel were actually approached should be up to pace quietly\nRequesting that I didn't talk about their experiences and some of them didn't have some of them have attacked basically they said that it was as if the military were asking questions\nUm along the lines of what can you give us some insight as to why they should be done so in other words I was trying to get to the hearts of what the abductions where why that would be done but in other cases there is good evidence also of um ... they have to pay a good example\nAnd somebody um it was tied to coast to coast I'm ... I'm Greg tell me how\nUm he had to pay to correspondence in the Nineteen nineties or with dumped caller China who wrote a number of good books on abductions and she was an ap duct tape has self\nAnd Greg tell me how you know back in the early nineties you know sort of pre Internet here um all of the lectures that I wrote to each other back and forth were opened and sailed back down with type\nAnd I'm now they can clearly be done you know a family without making it look like the ... I was throwing open race failed\nIt was almost as if whoever was doing they swam to Greg and college and to know that someone was opening their mail in other words he was sort of luck and intimidation hey you know we're watching it and that went on you know for for quite a period\nA Greg is working tonight at our Web master by the way so uh yeah I I saw his name was going to mention that in the book and ask you about it\nI mean there are a lot of people in the UFO field who you know are are not as credible is Greg who are sure that the government's watching him I'm and I'm not sure I Believe all of them I Believe him though he says it and you\nKnow I think sometimes you know there's no doubt that if you have a traumatic experience like an abduction then I think sometimes paypal can become sort of paranoid of every little thing in their life you know and which is a dangerous route to go down\nUm but in saying that I made another example is the whole issue of black helicopters which I I think many papers so Shiite them with ...\nI'll tell you when there were let's wait a second we'll get into that on the other side of save some time so people can ask you a couple of questions when we got some other ground to cover before then we're going to go into the break with a deep purple demons I think he's Seventy\nOne during the ... the bones have been ... ... ... ... [noise]\nThe FBI has some ... agents who looked at it a very cursory examination investigation that\nReally didn't get to the bottom of it and then nothing so what do you make of that and in combined with the black helicopter phenomena that you discuss in this book\nWell I think you know the the black helicopter phenomena and um he clearly a rail one and it does seem to be tied to both ... and um\nThe abduction phenomena and one of the things such as being notation I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that these whoever's flying these helicopters\nPotentially I think is part of an organization that up right outside of government\nYou know it may actually it may sort of do research and work for the government but it's not you know like the CIA or anybody like that fly helicopters I don't think I think it is sort of um [noise]\nYou know almost like a like a black budget ... kind of program designed to do the work and and most people think of them I don't know anything about it at all because it might not actually operates under the regular confines of the government itself you know my faith even\nSort of farmed out to private corporations which again would make it more difficult to get material for the fate Information Act when you're dealing with private corporations which aren't covered by\nAh by the fate and information request\nSo in that sense I think you know the the phenomenon these rail and I think whether it's ... or abductions the Gulf seems to base of islands\nThe phenomenon these rail and I think whether it's ... or abductions the Gulf seems to base of islands to try and figure out what's going on you know there are there's so many cases of black helicopters and other ... helicopters\nTo hang up near the homes sometime precariously there the homes\nOf alien abduction ... and again kind of light with college to enter and Greg\nThey might be a degree of um intimidation but also it might be an attempt to just keep an eye on the abduct taste um and be able to to respond at high speed a fit in the ah [noise]\nEvent that they have that the papal fly Matty cops his were actually able to capture the abduction going ahead you know in the ... very time\nSomebody who's is tuning in tonight for the first time\nHas to think we're all crazy alien abductions cattle mutilation black helicopters and we're saying yeah the stuff happens but the files that you've obtained from US government from the u._k. government sheds light on these things and someone takes it seriously maybe the scariest part of this is\nThat there isn't anyone who really knows what's going on their agencies different agencies and government small groups of people who are looking at this but really don't have answers about\nWho's responsible and why this stuff happens\nWell yeah I mean that that that's a good point George because I mean government agencies don't always know what another agency knows\nA you know many many cases agencies came the information to themselves unless they used to be shed and if we daily with I just had a group that actually isn't technically part of the government but the works farmed out to\nA private companies and things like that that's going to make it even more difficult but I mean in terms of the files on the um on the black helicopters I've probably got about three or four hundred pages\nI'm so that that includes the FBI stay classified files on Capitol Hill to Asians I'm a wave of and cancers that occurred in Seventy five in some of the the ... the north and I'm bored of the United states in in ... Seventy five\nAnd I'm just various other cases including some from the ... when there was a wave of activity of UFOs in Seventy three and there was also a wave of black helicopters in the same areas\nSo I think we're seeing a pot and on and I think the violence and intimidation a sort of the the mine coal and cause that you know I'm explain why they're flying around\nYou know trying to figure out what's going on whether these abductees experiences are literally physically real or not it it's tough to to even though there are some really well documented cases it's tough to figure it out it's tough to figure out what\nSomeone else is looking for when they put people through this stuff you mentioned you bring up bubbles are in the in the book\nAnd I should mention that there was a film coming out about those are it'll be the thirtieth anniversary of when that story first came out the ... got to come out in December and then there was a book that's going to be published a I think after the first year\nSo a lot of interest in the case but your angle was kind of an interesting one on one how it fits into the whole abductee aliens scenario\n[noise] well yeah I mean you know ... story is always intrigued me a lot of people dismiss you out rides but one of the things I've always found about ... is unlike a lot of paid Lou how things are in you follow gee you know when this story runs out of feel I\nDo I go to it so they can get back on the lecture circuit and so on um you know they are and I think that the big difference we ... is he never embroidered on the ... the original story be told as it was he's never expanded on it if he tells the same stories a Thirty Years' ago\nHe's hardly tried to put himself\nAt the forefront of you follow Jay and you know polling and\nHowever many you know dollars and so forth he doesn't you know regardless of the the controversial nature of the story it doesn't come across like your average house so that's one of the thing that's always intrigued me but um you know the in relation to the book I talk about the connections\nBetween the abductions\nAnd paypal who claimed that in some way or another they the the graze the Iranian Gray's who go the abductions that somehow they have this\nDeep and sort of sinister and disturbing in trashed and the humans so um and they sort of ties in with ... when he claimed that he was given a bunch of a briefing papers to read it asked for this this portion of area fifty while he was working at allegedly\nAnd um he said that was the the Iranians or whatever they are viewed us as containers and um any speculated on the possibility of containers of cells\nIn other words if the ... had some sort of obsessive interesting in the human cell and one of the things I talk about in the book is\nI'm a number of abduct pays who were approached clandestinely by these military agencies\nAre private corporations I'm Still ask questions about you know did you have any dreams afterwards if you're out of your soul leaving your body um\nDid you have any sort of like a religious confession after the abduction thing really weird questions but some of the questions kind of [noise]\nOf tiled wave the story that was always telling as well\nYou know you you look at recent developments in regard to the UFO topic in general\nAnd and of course we've been told in Nineteen sixty nine the U.S military the air force and they stopped project but they're not studying it is no threat to national security we don't care we're not looking at it\nAnd now of course you know I don't know that anyone ever really believed that but that was the cover story and and now we've learned last ten months that wasn't true but there were ongoing studies that were more than one in fact that they were collecting information\nOn what seems like you know presumably is ridiculous topic um in light of the kind of files that you bring up in this book where there's surveillance and there's counter intelligence and there's um you know just information and things that sort\nOf do you have concerns about the recent revelations I I I Would think that people who were suspicious sooner weary of this you know they were some history behind why they need to be careful\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know it is such a confusing angle judge you know this this angle of em [noise] rail abductions fabricated abductions the surveillance the government itself trying to get its had around what's going on you know you put all this together and um [noise]\nYou know ... ... it really is sort of a a difficult area which to work to try and figure out you know watch true what isn't so\nOr is it somewhere between the two you know and um and again that's why you know went on the way I've written a book is to demonstrate what we know the says you know what we speculate as to why the government\nDoing this why might they be fabricating\nAbduction events but then at the same time also investigating a legitimate events\nYou know it's it's it's not ... now where um you know being a just black and white you know it it's the lines of really blood and try to figure out what the overall goal is but there is but there is no doubt at all the you know that there is sort of extensive\nUm survivors of abductees\nThat's it's right now the X. files everything is great nothing black and white um we'll take one or two calls like east of the Rockies uh John and Virginia Hi John you're on Nicorette burn", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Twin
