killed the astronaut okay and they they're working on that for half a dozen years and they supposedly\nA habit that down now and I\nThe cost overruns eh we're probably due to that at that that\nIf it got down there shouldn't be any reason for Don sustainability in this project\nWell that's what they needed to dampen down the rock and I mean the why don't they braving like Neil Armstrong did I mean come on they got shaken before they went up and then it got really smooth after they got out of gravity pull right\nOkay yeah yeah but one of the insurance is is that\nThe liquid fuel is much dangerous that much more dangerous than they are showing you 'cause you're a member on the shuttle was a ... call us\nAt the uh over in a failed\nAnd it shut up blow torch into the liquid fuel the big liquid fuel tank and that's what blew up\nTo boosters just get\nThat shot often in two different directions without\nThe main carriage mhm big tank K. and shuttle\nBut uh I as far as I Know we were still scheduled to do\nA a a pre a Apollo a or a a\nFly by a visa the Apollo eight or with the uh new Orion and a constellation next year\nI Hope it fell on top but they're saying that it would cost overruns we may not see we may see an indefinite hold on a space exploration and they didn't say how many years but I mean Bush said twenty twenty or well actually said twenty Fifteen twenty ... theme of the moon base on the moon\nTwenty twenty or not they're not happening with SARS I Know but after I saw Robert Bigelow was working on a Bigelow Aerospace I thought yeah that that could be easily

uh inflatable or did they have for space stations on the moon for them\nYeah I I've seen those are those constructs and they look they look I don't know they look pretty slim but uh as as far as\nThe

well see that that's the big question though you know there's so many questions are unanswered about the sixty nine moon landing and whether or not they win whether or not they advance to advance up in a studio where they were orbiting the earth the whole time or even that's how it could have done the rocket went off the orbited the planet just like they do the space shuttle\nOr in the meantime they'd already a pre produced a number of uh shots on the moon and then it was time for them to come back to a B the ab a command module back to earth splashed down and no one was the wiser\n[laughter] [noise] I I I didn't get argue for it or not\nYou're a believer aren't you are absolutely\nOkay well I I have my questions I have my doubts I mean I don't know if that arise praise God does not go up and two years wouldn't that send a doubt in your head or at least next year window down through your mind that they're they're they're screwing with you there playing with your head\nWell my brother is working on the project it was on the shuttle project since its inception and he left and went to start a company and they got the ground test contracts for all the systems on their Ryan tribal inside and\nWell it'd be a Ryan goes off hot that doesn't mean we're going to the moon see that's the thing is I Want a guy I Want a man on the moon before I die that's that's what I Want to say I don't think I'm going to see it and it sucks because\nThe I I thought I'd be go to the moon as you said earlier now that it was just\nKind of that kind of twisted way quite a bit\nYeah well it hurts me enough to have my doubts that's only going to say [noise] but they can go and thank you I mean if I found out tomorrow that we did go to the moon and they can prove to me beyond doubt I'd shut up about it but no there's no I haven't\nYour way out there that I have ... either way I I think I Will come out and the next few years whether that it or not at all out there\nWell I don't think they're ever going to go back on their uh I mean there are going to go back on their idea they went to the moon but thinking about this you know before Kennedy died you know he was talking with the Russians about UFOs kinds of other crazy stuff I mean what if he said that the Russians\nHey we're gonna we're going to the moon and I were to try to go to ... go to the moon and uh you know we gave you a little bit of money you know you make this a little space race a little more interesting and I\nI just would say that you know the space race which wasn't really a space race it was Russia basically having an interest in space the United states saying wait a minute they can't have an interest in space we don't want them to spy on us and then they started to say well hey we challenge it to a race than\nI Am compared to like the fat kid\nGoing up to the the ... guy saying hey I'm going to I'm going I'm going to run a race with you and I'm going to beat you and then in the ... and ... and the the guy it's almost going to say OK guy given a chance and so one day the guy wakes up and says wait a minute he ... he won the race how did he do that\nAnd that's how I think Russia saw this thing and when we were before we were more successful in the United states was and now they're doing this how they do it how would they get Ben on the moon impossible\nYeah genius as a boss everybody went down\nYou know if ... if it was a good job of it was a genius Michael thank you for the call it's true it was a genius if that's if that's the case go to Doug in Pennsylvania Hi you're on ground zero\nDon't show is you think you have or don't believe in the technology that can label took a car up there with a little road around yeah [laughter] yeah just\nYou mean the technology that can ... and eight and took a car up there with him and ride around yeah [laughter]\nYeah I Know it just uh the money that would've taken to get there I was sure would have been a lot cheaper to fake it and I think that's why we're not going now because uh you can get up there in here there's a new one either isn't you\nKnow equipment parts and stop plan there\nWas that was the thing I remember I remember when we went to the moon is really cool and they started talking about the shuttle program and I thought to myself well why is the shuttle so so important that doesn't make any sense to me I thought\nThe shuttle came off to me like a bus it's like hey we're gonna drive a bus around the earth for a couple of more bits and then we're gonna we're just going to drop it like a rock through the atmosphere\nAnd I always thought to myself that's pretty lame you know we went to the moon I mean why is this such a big deal and I and to this day I Can't have anybody tell me why they show it was such a big deal he just\nHe wasn't a big deal it was like a a space plane in a big deal\nIt would have been a big deal if they would have used it to build something like a some sort of ... you know space ship to travel our solar system or something\nBut yeah I Would have been nice if they use it to build something in space but things got nowhere near the moon you go to somebody you say to them well you know how far does the space shuttle go into space they wouldn't know they didn't know they went like three hundred foreign mountain in space they didn't know about and then when you say well how far we've been moving they don't know that\nThe only two hundred thirty thousand miles away at so you know [noise] sorry about that that was my dog I well I don't know how big is I don't care\nIt's German Shepherd each about a hundred and thirty pounds wife just come home is\nSounding the devil dog from held the family you know I've been on my God we're over attack right here on the

couple of missions and was\nA supposedly walked on them in a in a policy in the Sistine mission ... ah yet I Can't prove that he did or not because I've been there myself that seem pretty convincing to me\nWhat you did you talk with him about it\nOh yeah yeah quite a bit yeah I remember in his son was about my age it's aimed at the time we were there and a kind of tell bad\nFor him because it seems you know when your dad has been into space and then on the ... and what do you do [laughter] you know it's it's gotta be tough to beat that kid right now I'm\nA pretty sure it was a replica of one of the rocks he brought back in his house or I don't think they would let him have ... you know that stuff was center lock and key in behind you know are under ... paramedics\nSeal uh-huh

security system has not been widely deployed to end users it's mostly the big ISPs and big corporations and things like that it's gradually spreading more\nSo there were concerns that not everybody especially not all of the all the ISPs would the fairly have made the right preparations for this there could be disruptive\nBut it was very carefully planned out and practice what happened is they

with us internationally recognized professionals psychic\nExorcist teacher specializes in the clearing of individuals' homes businesses a psychic protection Jeffrey is also an expert on hunting and homes and businesses psychic ability good goals such as spirit guide as well and we're tonight we're going to talk about demonic spirits Jeffrey welcome back\nThanks stores for having me back on your show the fifth time and a big how low ... everybody around are beautiful planet\nSuper you know this is a great time of year Halloween just brings out a lot of things with people but it seems to also bring out ghosts and spirits and strange things doesn't it do you feel that way\nI think that individual and the media a lot more attention to it certainly the time we think about all things supernatural a good and evil\nAre also in tradition um it's harvest time and ah in the tradition of that that there's a veil of energy that seems to be thin or this time of year\nUh I I've found that to be somewhat true but the thing that I deal with happen all the time and um but the media it pays more attention to it this time of year\nAnd that's fine anytime we talk about it and get a chance to inform the public on what is really happening around our world and also on the other side I think is really important\nDo you ever do you think demonic spirits and we'll get into what do you think they are but do you think they affect people to the point where strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people are tense uptight\nAnd yeah you know kind of angry about certain things do you think demonic spirits have something to do with that\nDefinitely uh we are certainly going through a lot of changes right now on the planet earth\nAnd this is a huge target for demonic spirits and also negative spirits and I'll get into the difference between those two are as we go along but absolutely targets on the back of people\nIt's between those two are as we go along\nBut absolutely targets on the back\nOf people that have power and can change the world for good or for ill and uh I think that there's never been a time in our history where demons have\nA greater opportunity to strike at the common person and also people who are very influential and so they're around more than ever\nI think so too so let's get your take Jeffrey on what is a demonic spirit in your opinion\nDemonic spirit is a very very powerful spirit it could be said that there was a counterpart of angels there that powerful they are not regular people who have died and just have a bad attitude into negative things\nThey've been around for a long time they are very involved and may have not ever lived in the physical realm or not to have lived in the physical realm for a long time they're very powerful\nAnd there are known to be able to affect physical reality and also the minds of individuals' a very easily and uh we're not looking out for it you know what we don't protect ourselves properly and we're taught that it's something a\nFrom Hollywood movies and it only happens to a few people\nIt's not going to happen to me but that's not true because I get calls every day from people that are under the attack of ah demonic spirits negative spirits and ah demonic spirits are\nAre able to reach in to the physical realm from the non physical route and actually produce physical effects\nAnd that is one difference between a ah demonic spirit in a negative spirit\nAlso demonic spirits are are much better equipped to uh influenced people on a psychological emotional level meaning that they can stand right next to us and we can see them and tell a path\nEthically trends for information into our system our emotional systems make us angry at each other other people at our cells get us to do things we would not normally do\nAnd we can see them we don't know that they're there\nSee that's what I think is happening now know are they the biblical version of fallen angels\nThey can be certainly that many demonic spirits are ones were good and there's such a thing as you go I Want to sit on your show that ego is the killer of The Exorcist yup and it's also true of spirits\nIt's also true that a demonic spirits a can change you know once they were no positive experience in their ego God's to them and\nNow that they're doing very very negative things and uh\nThe real danger that I see is that uh there are we're we're more susceptible than ever before to attack\nOf so many arguments you know between people today and they take advantage of that and spirits on all spirits do not have voiced boxes they communicate\nTake advantage of that and spirits and all spirits do not have voiced boxes they communicate George ... ethically and\nWe all communicate ... kind of like a river that travels underneath our consciousness\nAnd they communicate on that level and they whisper to us maybe at night maybe in the day maybe when people are intoxicated when people step out something steps in it's also very common\nAnd uh they try to get us to do things that we would not normally do violence things\nHurt our significant others wives husbands people\nAre not all of violent acts are due to are caused by demonic spirits but they certainly are around and they are around more than ever and sort negative spirits people who are dead\nAnd they were doing negative thing is when they were alive and continue to do negative things but demonic spirits\nAre very powerful and as an exorcist\nWhen I'm dealing with demonic spirits I have to be very careful because many of them are more powerful than me\nThat's right that's you know they can come and get you\n... if they do and the thing is is that they come when you least expect that when I'm working I'm really looking for it when I'm helping people deal with negative things in their homes negative feelings negative energy is\nI'm looking for it it's when I'm not looking forward to a vet the attacks on me or hurt it doesn't happen very often I've been doing this work\nSeven years now but it does happen and so I've been attacked or successfully a few times for short to rations and it's very unpleasant and it happens very quickly demonic spirits are able to assume any shape or form at a moment's notice\nCan you see them I can you\n... I was born with the ability to see spirits\nI thought everybody could it was shocking to me George when I when I was young in in elementary school in grade school\nI thought I saw spirits in the classroom some were standing over students and essentially trying to help them with their homework and help them with their schoolwork\nAnd some are looking at me like how can you see me what are you doing I don't like this and these are the one I had to watch out for and they'd actually come and start walking towards me in the classroom and I was very uncomfortable\nAll right stay with us Jeffrey we are going to get a break and we're gonna come back and talk more about the demonic spirits where do they come from what they want and the next hour we'll take phone calls all about the ...\nNow they protect more than two million people simply safe system is easy to use incredibly intuitive and takes just minutes to set up their no contracts are hidden fees and twenty four seven monitoring is only fourteen Ninety nine a month to visit simply signatory dot com the order you simply safe system now\nAnd you'll get free shipping and free returns that simply safe no re dot com simply say nor a dot com\nI Love it was a teenager deals at the ballot beauty bass\nSetting I have a nine ... every day on your favorite cosmetics and Franklin than say make a fifty dollar Omar media Franklin's ... and you get a free makeup bad like I like three hours and then I think I never mind the you can house I support the breast cancer research on they sent by making an inside any sense\nSpouse [noise] little things mean everything thousands packed in our states family I think ...\n... ... ... had a lodge top condition he's also the biggest killer had decided who stopped taking kind of more on it was just incredible feelings that I never felt before pins and needles ran my heart when I had the auditor and two and a half months later\nSomething amazing ... in which we really don't taste while I had actually have contracted staggering about this one\nWas speeding what you would come check off on south but\nI thought I could kind of sweet ... result started coming through like it kinda barbaric ... excuse the pun ... networks beautifully\nRichard Haass throw here we're talking about the power of waking up your immune system he says he'll this gentleman's hot perhaps the immune system can be called one of the bodies fears is powers to he'll visit C.

demons we'll take calls next to our as well before we get in the open lines Jeffrey what do you think\nThese demons the destruction of the human race\nA natural human said humans\nThey want nothing from us so many people have come to me over the years and said I can control spirits\nI can control demons but it's not true they have nothing that we want and so are they attack children in their cribs the ... attack people at work\nThey attack everybody we all have targets on her back and we need to realize that uh we can see them but they can see us they generate negative emotional energies they generate hatred and they're all around and they're using this time of uncertainty in our world today\nIn order to amplify are negative feelings towards each other and it's very important to understand what they're trying to do it don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think that it's a Hollywood myth or something like that and Hollywood makes great movies no problem with that but\nThe reality is is that they are around the spirits are around us all the time we just can't see them\nAnd they communicated with us tell a path to be the end game is to destroy us to destroy the fabric of the family to destroy businesses\nReason being is that that's how we make our money\nDestroy your business and destroy a person's ability to make money destroyed their family\nDestroy their lives and also to change or the way we think about each other right now they have us at each other's throats right where they wanna sell\nThey sure do and we have to stop it and there's there's ways to stop it you know and that's what I Do and I teach people how to stop\nWell do you have to realize that they're doing this to us as opposed to people saying it's just the human race it's all screwed up\nEverybody has a story everybody I've talked to has some kind of story of uh being in a home apartment condo a party a bar in a pub any ... any place\nWhere the scene or felt something strange they're picking up on negative emotional energy something that living humans generate we all generate on a non physical level emotional energy and so do spirits\nAnd they generate huge amounts of emotional energy and that can influence this by essentially getting into our energy fields are emotional systems\nAnd amplifying are feeling so it takes us from being sort of angry into complete road rage where we do things that we would not normally do how many times that people said that I Would not normally do that\nAnd some of them were angry that's when they attack\nImportant people making decisions around our world they work on them or they don't know that there are there and they may not believe in them but they are there you know most people believe in some kind of life after death\nSome something that happens not everybody but most people do so what happens\nWhen we simply drop or physical bodies and become non physical entity is their spirits most people are good summer not most spirits\nAre good summer nuts and so the ones that are not have a tendency to want to continue to hang around our world and you just do things that would not normally do demonic spirits are just experts at it they have weapons\nOut of non physical energy is just like spirits do\nSpirits change their forms like our our parents die as an old age or something they can immediately change and look younger by generating and thinking about generating a form of what they wanted to look like and also generating close because most people do not see\nMaking spirits so all these things are generated on a non physical level\nEmotional energy is generated on a non physical level as well so demonic spirits come close to us or even from a distance and focus in on us and generate hatred and rage\nWe think it's our own but it's not always completely our own are they under the direction of the double Jeffrey I'm not sure if there's one particular\nSpirit in charge of all negative spirits I Am on a spirits are kind of like criminals\nThey really don't even get along with each other they don't trust each other they most often work alone but that's not always the rule uh they do work in groups I have found that to be true and all the decades I've been doing this uh but they really do their best when they work alone and they take their time\nWorking on individuals and families are getting them to fight uh getting people to fight with each other and getting countries to fight with each other getting people to amplify\nWhat would normally be a small amount of anger into complete rage\nAnd very very good at it because the amount of anger that comes out of them is incredible and we just don't see it coming on I Know that when I've been attacked personally uh it happened so quickly one moment I see them\nNext moment you know some kind of very negative\nA beam of light all come out on attack I pull out my non physical sword they pull out their weapons and there is a fight going on\nBut everybody's not so fortunate that they can see them and know that they're coming and so there are around us and we don't know it around us that work and at home also negative spirit\nYou know and and negative spirits can work for them essentially and and sort of modeled themselves after that and\nLike I said most people are good and some are not and the ones that are not are also quite capable of doing a the very same thing generating hatred and anger and of course millions of people die all the time\nAnd lots of them are not good uh they were not good when they were living and they continue to do negative things and they'd attack people on a daily basis so\nEssentially the entire human race right now is under attack by negative spirits and uh unfortunately demonic spirits which are very very powerful spirits and like I said earlier\nMay not have ever lived in the physical realm or for a very very long time and they're they they practice\nAnd they're good at what they do they know how to generate hatred enraged\nAnd they know how to get it through our natural protection systems also known as the aura and to get us to react to they're angry and hateful feelings and they have no problem they would essentially\nKill a child in the cradle he had no problem with that I Know that's a scary thought it was horrible they have they just have humans\nSo they attack everybody they attack people least able to defend themselves and inner world right now we're having a lot of changes going on in a lot of problems a lot of anger\nAnd

questions I have some issues I didn't catch the beginning of the world\nHe's energy fields and we can also pick it up in any kind of store restaurant somebody's home\nI'm watching TV or you know a pub just every place there is emotional energy and our bodies energy field to be don't protect ourselves\nAnd most people don't that it actually permeates\nInto our energy field and mixes with our own emotional energy positive\nAnd negative and causes habits and this is one of the\nBiggest problems that people will call me have it's not always just demonic spirits the idea is is that we are filled full of emotional energy not a positive energy I don't touch I'm not even capable of doing that we only let go of what we want to let go\nAnd so I deal with essentially clearing out the negative emotional energy negative emotional energy is something that\nUh people want to release\nI bet they feel a hundred percent better when it's natural let's go to Terry in Houston, Texas welcome to the show Jerry go ahead\nYeah George or I guess what I'm a even as the original language or the scriptures and I'm I'm actually writing a book called that we really knows how it is\nAnd I studied the Bible in Nineteen eighty stay with I've dealt with a lot as a party a theme and I was going to ask you Jeffrey are you a Christian\nI don't belong to the Christian religion I Do believe in God I also think that ah the argument over creationist a series and a true scientific physical theories is ridiculous they pull work hand in hand\nFirst principle is creation spirits don't just sit around and clouds and do and do nothing higher spirits angels guide you know they create almost like a ... of a cake\nOn a non physical level the design of the universe and then comes the physical so that non physical proceeds the physical so the idea that you know creation is does that happen as the universe created absolutely\nBut also the big bang theory\nWhy not so it's essentially like I said like baking a cake you know that spirit guide angels are in the business\nOr in a wonderful business of actually creating an designing these things potentially right now as we speak not just in the beginning of time but right now\nAnd that filters up it's connected with a physical all things physical so each person has to levels of physical body which is very finite sixty eighty years or Fifteen Years or whatever\nAnd our spirit which is completely internal enter personality which never dies and and I'm really amazed at the argument that or not you have but I mean that is being fostered out there between religion and scientists which I agree with\nI'm I Am a non physical scientist essentially\nSo I Believe in all of this is science to me you know and I think that you know God has a personality\nYou know whether there was one or two I don't know I'm not sure you know but I Do believe that there I Know there are higher spirits out there because I work with them and I work for them and so I Do believe you know I worked Christians all the time\nAnd I respect that religion and so I you know I think when you're doing this marvelous you know I think that\nIt's just that there's a misinterpretation in needless argument between these two are theories that are both correct\nSo I should go ahead Teri uh yeah what\nI was gonna say is you're talking about religion religion teaches that probation a guy go to church give your money\nDo this don't do that that's not from guy the problem is is that we have many ministers out there that teach uh this type of stuff then basically do they make money off the guy\nThe problem is with this with this whole scenario as it turns people off like you Jeffrey and and I understand that I I really do understand that and I feel sorry for people that don't know this\nBut you got to understand that the only Christianity is not a religion it said if it's a relationship between you and God\nNow why is that well to be an arbitrator you have to be God man\nJesus is title is Jesus is Lord Jesus Christ lord Neve dia de Jesus means humanity and cry needs anointed why [noise]\nOkay so what happens is because we don't do this in order to be because none of us are perfect on this earth in fact in fact Peter said that I'm a I I that God is no respect or a person so we're all in the same boat\nNo matter how much knowledge we know we're all the same boat with God\nBecause we have a major because we're we're born and then because of Adam's then because we carry out and then\nUh our entire life we we are and and even all that there's that that none of us are the glory of God we were all on the same boat\nBut those demons seemed to be every where we're going to come back and take final calls in a moment on the coast to coast

California is with us say Thomas\nCharge thank you for taking my call sir here for a great work that you're doing carefree my question is about war and the battle field and Morris um how\nTo military personnel men and women in a battle situation protect themselves from the Monica fault I'm not talking about\nJust battling insurgents physically but there must be a lot of demonic energies in a war time battle field situation\nAnd you have any advice for men and women in the military to protect themselves\nI Do I was in the air force myself many years ago um and especially there are method through our rules on the other side emotional energy that we all generate and and it is in the battlefield hatred and anger and fear\nAnd there's killing going on and so it certainly is a\nA place where negative for sort of tracked into demonic spirits negative spirits as well terrible things are happening\nAnd so we need to build up and strengthen our energy\nNegative spirits as well terrible things are happening\nAnd so we need to build up and strengthen our energy fields or methods\nThere are rules on the other side like there are physical rules so there are things we can do in order to build shields around ourselves to protect us from the effects that negative energy that is generated by other people fear\nAround us were just natural in a battle situation\nOr emotional energy that just you know so intense on the battlefield\nThere are multiple layers that can be applied that actually work\nSo that negative energy actually bounces off of us this is something I teach people to do every day it's very important and so it's not you know uh you know just about me the idea is is that yes there are lots of things that people can do on the battlefield to protect themselves in the military\nYou just have to learn how to do them they're actually very simple\nAnd it can you know take the stuff I designed over the years with the help of my spirit guides and he brought up in five or ten seconds you need it fast you know the old style was doing things ten minutes in the morning in ten minutes in the evening I read all that stuff when I go to the service\nTen minutes in the morning in ten minutes leaving\nBut we need it's very different now it's very different we you know we didn't we need protection right away we don't know when things are going to hit us\nWe need to be able to bring up our protection systems immediately in order to deflect negative emotional energy or this being generated by the enemy by people around us are that are unhappy and are frightened and also by spirits that are trying to interfere\nAnd feed off of the killing and and also also a office here have you so I think that it's very important that we all learn that this kind of thing\nAnd it's a science it's not a religion what what I'm involved in is not religion I Would not even to say is really metaphysical is non physical science\nI have no problem with physical science I agree with everything that they have to say scientists do not call me up and to argue with me they are right I deal with non physical science which is essentially is the non physical part of our body\nAre emotional systems are personality everything else butter physical body that is susceptible to attack and also negative emotional energy by negative spirits demonic spirits and also people and really bad and scariest situations\nHave you seen demons attack businesses and why did they do that\nThey do it in order to destroy a person's life a hack the fabric of the family and the best way to do it is to pull out the resources money George to get it out\nIf they destroy your business than they have a two fold thing going on they have people that are fired that have to look for a job it can cause arguments at home it can cause people to lose their place or where they live all sorts of problems that can cause them to feel bad and actually react\nSometimes violent Lee\nAnd also it has an effect upon the actual business environment we're now you have a failed business I think most restaurants they fail within a year so restaurant after restaurant comes in or business after business comes in and you have problem is a failed businesses and that has an accumulation\nPlus you have all the people working or who don't necessarily get along as kind of like our our second family we're a family at home\nAnd we have our family at work and everybody doesn't get along and so essentially have a lot of emotional energy people at work who are sitting at their desks and maybe thinking I really hated here\nWhen they're doing that they're generating emotional energy and it can it can be positive or negative emotional energy but sometimes as negative accumulates in the environment\nThis also attracts some negative spirits and demonic spirits\nBecause if they can get somebody fired by you know doing or saying something uh you know inappropriate or a you know simply not doing their job or she'll be destroying the business itself by making of a the business atmosphere very uncomfortable emotionally\nEverybody's got a story about walking into a living environment a pub\nOr a business or restaurant and saying you know what this place doesn't feel right what they're picking up on George is emotional energy whether it be good or bad that's emotional energy they're picking up on everybody has a story about this place doesn't feel right it's emotional energy and the needs to be cleared out\nSo they attack businesses because they can actually make a business failed you might have two hundred or two thousand people out of work and now they're really unhappy they go home and there are arguments with their significant others with their kids\nAnd a and then it just

year\nIt was such a fast track and um [noise] so I just there overnight and a personal note I had a sick cat who passed away yesterday\nSo it was really emotionally you are very very difficult time he was my beloved buddy he's on his journey now how old was he he was eleven now\n... that's not tools for cat is\nNo it's not as I said I was really hoping to be here a few more years and um but as\nTime was it was time for him to go sadly and [noise] I'm gonna miss miss him dearly\nWell he's out there somewhere you know that he's here with us now yeah absolutely tell me about the watchers\nThe watchers incredible story very much very controversial of course there's a broad range of of viewpoints on the watchers ranging from the third demons they're evil they're controlling us people want to know\nA while what why are they here and and and what are they doing a why are they interfering with humanity and people actually blame the watchers first humanities ills\nAnd that's one very definite point of view but then the other point of view is that\nThey were here they came from the heavenly realm from the rump called ... according to the Bible the location of God's throne\nThey're dispatched to earth in order to bring a new teaching to humanity of teaching about\nHow humans can transform into angels and make the journey from the earthly round to the heavenly realm of sigh on\nIt it seems that what's happened in the intervening centuries and by the way it was the watchers were briefly mentioned in the Old Testament and the book of genesis and that it's the scenes about a hundred and fifty years before Jesus all of a sudden there's this wise of astounding what's known as apocalyptic material developed\nApocalyptic simply means that a human man is in contact with an otherworldly being a supernatural being angelic being maybe even an extraterrestrial in some people's view\nWho delivers knowledge about another supernatural world\nAnd this then became an explosion of of knowledge about the watchers and the ability of humans to cross over what the church considers a forbidden boundary between flash and light between spirit and flash\nNow these scenes did they not right to did see schools as well\nThat's exactly right the scenes there's no question that that after the destruction of the temple of Solomon and eighty Seventy when the scenes were attacked the Roman army came into into Jerusalem and the gala lady a scene bundled up their sacred tax which there were many\nHit them in caves and they were last until Nineteen forty seven when they were were rediscovered and this is when modern consciousness really begins to [noise] to understand the full story of the watchers\nThe watchers are the ... ... realm are they from\nTwo schools of thought there's some that believe that they're simply and only human beings ancient pagan royalty existed maybe going back to the time even before the flood and the that they were able to survive the flood and then continued with new bloodlines after the time of the flood\nThe second viewpoint is that they are and this comes from the Bible as well as the dead sea squirrels that they are celestial beings light being ephemeral beings who had the ability to phase into physical manifestation they could take flesh and blood bodies\nAnd face back and forth by the way between flesh and blood and their their light being status\nAnd then infiltrated human affairs\nThat sounds to me when\nThey are and this is where it gets kind of disturbing because as you can get begin to research the watchers it's you're presented with a crossroads you're either going to take the tack that they are purely evil and their demonic as many people do\nAnd if you take that path it's going to lead you down to the path where you're following their offspring who recalled than to feel them as these giant beings with the long gated skulls and in this whole axis of research which is\nVery interesting but if you're following that path chances are you are not probing deeply behind the tax and into the tax\nLeft by the scenes in your realizing that the the uh seems themselves\nWere utilizing ancient tax in teaching that they had developed and synthesize from ancient Babylon Egypt Iran Iraq the teachings of the address that were centered on how do we contact the watchers\nOne and two how do we transform ourselves into angels and in fact this is what the Dead Sea scrolls are all about is this is seen this group of the scenes Jewish mistakes a hundred and fifty years before the time of Jesus who were utilizing these teachings to congregate with the\nAngels the holy ones the angels of the lord the watchers and work transforming their bodies into light in other words into angels\n... which of course in the book of genesis to me either fallen angel I'm not sure what do you think\nI don't think so because when you look at the etymology of the ... the meaning of the word natural them it's far far from established fact the term fallen angel is ... means that they're evil beings or that they are being who were are somehow demonic\nThey their fallen because they came out of the higher vibration or if you will have an ...\nThe human body fat is they're great sin\nThey crossed with the church establishment views as a forbidden boundary you're not allowed to cross over from flesh into spirit with out God's permission and this is the whole crux of the question did the watchers\nWhen they descended from the heavenly realms and took on physicality the\n\nAgainst the will of God and that that's going to determine your whole viewpoint about the watchers and what happened was that early church fathers\nBased on some of the work of the scenes and others\nSimply decided that they were demonic being that they were a powers that were beyond human control\nAnd certain humans began teaching that we need to avoid the watchers at all cost do not seek to transform yourself into an angel without God's permission because in order to actually what the church terms is a sand or experience the rapture you have to be invited by God\nAnd that's the great crossing the line that the watchers\nTranscended are crossed over and came to teach human ... how to do how to turn into angels\nWilliam in your book to watch is you do talk about a luminous clouds were gods rode on them to me it sounds like CSI keels we'll it sounds kind of you will foolish doesn't it\nAbsolutely I mean in in the New Testament the Greek word for clouds is ... feel which is the ... where we get the word and a feeling from and so these are cloud riders and when you as I did in my book and in the watchers book I collected\nVarious examples of today a Judeo Christian art that shows the watchers including a Jesus riding upon cloud vehicles luminous clouds they're literally levitating on these clouds\nAnd what we learn is that this cloud is actually a symbol for their ascension body they're light Audi it's it's not a hardware UFO like a a flying Toyota\nIt's actually an organic light vehicle that is produced by the human body and it enables them to travel entered dimensional a and throughout the cosmos\nTalking with William Henry whose latest work to watchers and of course we're going to get into many things that he is an investigative miss all it just goes after these gone that uh visited us\nSpiritual physical\nSpiritual first who had the ability to phase into physicality and their hobbies are described actually as fluid they can virtually instantly according to the stories\nTransform from their acquiesce adaptable kind of\nA fluid shape into physicality they can even turn invisible\nAnd this is what we we discover and in some of the non stick taxed as well as in the dead sea scrolls where there were they're describing looking at these luminous beings who are radiating rainbow light who their bodies are described as full advised they're covered with feathers and they have certain teams type faces\nAnd when you add all this description together if precisely matches what the Tibetans describe as the rainbow body of light in\nThe Tibetan great perfection tradition they believe that humans can morph into a light body that they describe that what they tell us that are that the our body the frequency of our body can be accelerated until it dissolves into five color rainbow light leaving behind only hair toned fingernails\nAnd have no nerves to be transmitted the watchers could do this then I Believe that the the Tibetan great\nHi and only hair toned fingernails and have known nerves to be transmitted the watchers could do this and I believe that the the Tibetan great perfection tradition originates with the watchers and so these watchers

professional psychic\nExorcist teacher specializes in the clearing of individuals' homes businesses a psychic protection Jeffrey is also an expert on hunting and homes and businesses psychic ability good goals such as spirit guide as well and we're tonight we're going to talk about demonic spirits Jeffrey welcome back\nThanks jurors for having me back on your show the fifth time and a big hello to everybody around are beautiful planet\nSuper you know this is a great time of year Halloween just brings out a lot of things with people but it seems to also bring up ghosts and spirits and strange things doesn't it do you feel that way\nI think that individual in the media a lot more attention to it certainly the time we think about all things supernatural a good and evil\nAre also in tradition um it's harvest time and ah and the truth tradition of that that there's a veil of of energy that seems to be thin or this time of year\nUh I I've found that to be somewhat true but the thing is that I deal with happen all the time and um but the media it pays more attention to it this time of year\nAnd that's fine anytime we talk about it and get a chance to inform the public on what is really happening around our world and also on the other side I think is really important\nTo have reducing demonic spirits and we'll get into what do you think they are but do you think they affect people to the point where strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people are tense uptight\nAnd yeah you know kind of angry about certain things do you think demonic spirits have something to do with that\nDefinitely are we are certainly going through a lot of changes right now on the planet earth and this is a huge target for demonic spirits\nAnd also negative spirits and I'll get into the difference between those two are as we go along\nBut absolutely targets on the back\nOf people that have power and can change the world for good or for ill and uh I think that there's never been a time in our history where demons have\nA greater opportunity to strike at the common person and also people who are very influential and so they're around with more than ever\nI think so too so let's get your take Jeffrey on what is a demonic spirit in your opinion\nDemonic spirit is a very very powerful fear it it could be said that there was a counterpart of angels there that powerful\nFor a full spirit it could be said that there was a counterpart of angels there that powerful they are not regular people who have died and just have a bad attitude into negative things\nThey've been around for a long time there are very involved and may have not ever lived in the physical realm or not to have lived in the physical around for a long time they're very powerful\nAnd they are known to be able to affect physical reality and also the minds of individuals' a very easily and uh we're not looking out for it you know we don't protect ourselves properly and we're taught that it's something a\nFrom Hollywood movies and it only happens to a few people\nIt's not going to happen to me but that's not true because I get calls every day from people that are under the tack of ah demonic spirits negative spirits and ah demonic spirits are\nAre able to reach in to the physical realm from the non physical route and actually produce physical effects and that is one difference between a a demonic spirit in a negative spirit\nAlso demonic spirits are are much better equipped to uh influenced people on a psychological emotional level meaning that they can stand right next to us and we can see them and tell a path\nEthically trends for information into our system our emotional systems make us angry at each other the other people\nAt our cells get us to do things we would not normally do and we can't see them we don't know that they're there\nSee that's what I think is happening now know are they the biblical version of fallen angels\nThey can be certainly that many demonic spirits are ones were good and there's such a thing as ego I Want to sit on your show that ego is the killer of The Exorcist yup and it's also true of spirits\nIt's also true that a demonic spirits a can change you know once they were you know positive experience in their ego God's to them and now that they're doing very very negative things and uh\nThe real danger that I see is that uh there are we're we're more susceptible than ever before to attack\nOf so many arguments you know between people today and they take advantage of that and spirits on all spirits do not have voice boxes\nThey communicate George ... ethically and\nWe all communicate ... kind of like a river that travels underneath our consciousness\nAnd they communicate on that level and they whisper to us maybe at night maybe in the day maybe when people are intoxicated when people step out something steps in and it's also very common\nAnd uh they try to get us to do things that we would not normally do violence things\nHurt our significant others wives husbands people\nAre not all a violent acts are due to are caused by demonic spirits but they certainly are around and they are around\nActs are due to are caused by demonic

that's you know they can come and get you\n... if they do and the thing is is that they come when you least expect that when I'm working I'm really looking for it when I'm helping people deal with

work\nHe's seven years now but it does happen and so I've been attacked or successfully a few times for short duration than it is very unpleasant and it happens very quickly demonic spirits are able to assume any shape or form\nAt a moment's notice did you see them I can you ... I was\nBorn with the ability to see spirits\nI thought everybody could it was shocking to me George when I when I was young in in elementary school in grade school\nI thought I saw spirit in the classroom some were standing over students and essentially trying to help them with their homework and help from the school work\nAnd some are looking at me like how can you see me what are you doing I don't like this and these are the one I had to watch out for and they actually come and started walking towards me in the classroom when I was very uncomfortable\nAll right stay with us Jeffrey

they want these demons\nThe destruction of the human race ah\nThat's all humans have\nHumans they want nothing from us so many people have come to me over the years and said I can control spirits\nI can control daemon but it's not true they have nothing that we want and so ah they attack children in their cribs ... attack people at work\nThey attack everybody we all have targets on our back and we need to realize that\nUh we can't see them but they can see us they generate negative emotional energy they generate hatred and they're all around and they're using the time of uncertainty in our world today in order to\nIt gets the feelings towards each other and it's very important to understand what they're trying to do they don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think of it as a Hollywood myth or something like that Hollywood makes great movies no problem with that but\nThe reality is is that they are around the spirits are around us all the time we just can't see them\nAnd they communicated with us tell a path to either end game is to destroy us to destroy the fabric of the family to destroy businesses reason being is that that's how we make our money\nDestroy your business and you destroy a person's ability to make money destroyed their family destroy their lives and also ... to change or the way we think about each other\nRight now they have us at each other's throats right where they\nWant to sell they sure do and we have to stop it and there's there's ways to stop it you know and that's what I Do and I teach people how to stop\nWho do you have to realize that they're doing this to us as opposed to people saying it's just the human race it's all screwed up\nEverybody has a story everybody I've talked to has some kind of a story of of being in a home apartment condo a party a bar and a pile of any ... any place\nWhere they've seen or felt something strange they're picking up on negative emotional energy\nSomething that living humans generate we all generate on a non physical level emotional energy and so do spirits\nAnd they generate huge amounts of emotional energy and that can influence this by essentially getting into our energy fields are emotional systems\nAnd amplifying our feelings so it takes us from being sort of angry into complete road rage where we do things that we would not normally do how many times that people said that\nI Would not normally do that and some of them were angry that's when they attack important\nPeople making decisions around our world they work on them or they don't know that they're there they may not believe in them but they are there you know most people believe in some kind of life after death some something that happens not everybody\nBut most people do so what happens when we simply drop or physical bodies and become non physical entity is their spirits most people are good summer not most spirits\nAre good summer not and so the ones that are not have a tendency to want to continue to hang around our world and he just to do things he would not normally do demonic spirits are just experts\nAt it they have weapons they have devices that they make off of non physical energy is just like spirits do\nSpirits change their forms like our our parents die as an old age or something\nThey can immediately change and look younger by generating in thinking about generating a form of what they wanted to look like and also generating close because most people do not see naked spirit so all these things are generated on a non physical level\nEmotional energy is generated on a non physical level as well\nSo demonic spirits come close to us or even from a distance and focus in on us and generate hatred enrage we think it's our own but it's not always completely are on\nAre they under the direction of the double Jeffrey\nTo our own but it's not always completely are on are they under the direction of the double Jeffrey\nI'm not sure if there's one particular spirit in charge of all negative spirits I the the minor spirits are kind of like criminals\nThey really don't even get along with each other they don't trust each other they most often work alone but that's not always the rule or they do work in groups I have found that to be true and all the decades I've been doing this uh but they really do their best when they work alone and they take their time\nWorking on individuals and families\nGetting them to fight\nUh getting people to fight with each other or getting countries to fight with each other getting people to amplify what would normally be a small amount of anger into complete rage\nAnd very very good at it because the amount of anger that comes out of them is incredible and we just don't see it coming on I Know that when I've been attacked personally\nUh it happened so quickly one moment I see them next moment you know some kind of very negative a beam of light all come out on attack\nI pull out my non physical sword they pull out their weapons and there is a fight going on\nBut everybody is not so fortunate the vacancy them and know that they're coming and so there are around us and we don't know it around us that work and at home also negative spirits\nYou know and and negative spirits can work for them essentially and and sort of modeled themselves after that and\nLike I said most people are good and some are not and the ones that are not are also quite capable of doing the very same thing generating hatred and anger and of course millions of people die all the time\nAnd lots of them are not good uh they were not good news when they were living and they continue to do negative things and they'd attack\nPeople on a daily basis so\nEssentially the entire human race right now is under attack by negative spirits and uh unfortunately demonic spirits which are very very powerful spirits and like I said earlier may not have ever lived in the physical realm or for a very very long time and they're they they practice\nAnd they're good at what they do they know how to generate hatred enraged\nAnd they know how to get it through our natural protection systems also known as the Aurora and to get us to react to they're angry and hateful feelings and they have no problem they would essentially\nKill a child in the cradle he had no problem with that I Know that's a scary thought it was horrible\nThey have they just hate humans and so they attack everybody they attack people least able to defend themselves and inner world right now we're having a lot of changes going on in a lot of problems a lot of

soldiers Franken sends coal there's many substances that were very very well loosening up energy is kind of like spring something on the wall\nTo get something off of it but it doesn't alone get rid of the home see that's the problem is is that stage\nWill release it you know out into the atmosphere but it will not move it from your home will not removed from your living environment it has to be actually pushed down into the earth and away from the property in order for it to be removed because\nEssentially what I think it's going on here to Jay is you've you've been releasing it by doing these you know really positive things stage Franken says all of these things you recommend them certainly\nBut we're releasing them into the atmosphere they still have to be released from and pushed out from the home in order for them to be out of your life and I think what's going on is that is just accumulated a to the point where it's all around you\nAnd you're doing everything you can but now it needs to be forcibly pushed out of your home\nAnd this is where a lot of people have issues you know they do things\nYou know that they they learn on the Internet or from you know qualified people that actually work and to some extent but emotional energy negative spirits and all of these things need to be forcibly removed from the home so it's kind of like you know\nTaking the booming pushing it all the dust into the center of the room we still have to take a dust pan yet the you know a broom and get in the dust pan into the garbage has got to go into the garbage and that's what's not happening\nAll right thanks for them now tell us a little bit about what is exactly negative emotional energy Jeffrey\nPeople generate all positive animal a negative emotional energy is from the very first day that were born shortage\nAnd these things can be common trapped in our bodies energy fields also known as the ... but the or is not just a bunch of pretty lights it is who we are it's part of who we are a personality are our emotional systems\nHave an energy field that extends out from the very center of our non physical body which is our spirit\nOr maybe three or four feet outside of our physical body and emotional energy can become trapped over a period of time in just about everybody everybody has the issue so emotional energy this negative that we generate can be trapped\nIn just about everybody everybody has the issue so emotional energy this negative that we generate can be trapped in our bodies energy field and we can also pick it up in any kind of store restaurant somebody's\nHome or watching television or you know a pub just\nEvery place there is emotional energy and our bodies energy field to be don't protect ourselves\nAnd most people don't that it actually permeates into our energy field and mixes with our own emotional energy positive and negative and causes havoc and this is one of the biggest problems that people will call me have it's not always just demonic spirits\nThe idea is is that we are filled full of emotional energy not a positive energy I don't touch I'm not even capable of doing that we only let go of what we want to let\nGo and so I deal with essentially clearing out the negative emotional energy negative emotional energy is something that uh people want to release\nI bet they feel a hundred percent better when it's natural let's go to Terry in Houston, Texas welcome to the show Jerry go ahead\nYeah George or idea of why I'm a even as the original language or the scriptures and I'm I'm actually writing a book called that we really ... he is and I studied the Bible in Nineteen eighty six when I go with a lot of the party\nA theme and I was going to ask you Jeffrey are you a Christian\nI don't belong to the Christian religion I Do believe in guys I also think that ah the argument over creationist a series and a true scientific physical theories is ridiculous\nThey pull work hand in hand first\nPrince will is creation spirits don't just sit around and clouds and do and do nothing higher spirits angels guide\nYou know they create almost like a ... of a cake on a non physical level the design of the universe and then comes the physical so the non physical\nProceeds the physical so the idea that you know creation is does that happen as the universe created absolutely\nBut also the big bang theory\nWhy not so it's essentially like I said like baking a cake you know that spirit guide angels are in the business or in a wonderful business of actually creating in designing these things perpetually right now as we speak not just in the beginning of time but right now\nAnd that filters up it's connected with a physical all things physical\nSo each person has to levels of physical body which is very finite sixty eighty years or Fifteen Years or whatever\nAnd our spirits which is completely a turtle enter personality which never dies and and I'm really amazed at the argument that or not you have but I mean that is\nBeing fostered out there between religion and scientists which I agree with I'm I Am a non physical scientist essentially\nSo I Believe in all of this is science to me\nYou know and I think that you know God has a personality you know whether there was one or two I don't know I'm not sure you know but I Do believe that there I Know there are higher spirits are there because I work with him and I work for them and so I Do believe you know I worked Christians all the time\nAnd I respect that religion and so I you know I think when you're doing is marvelous you know I think\nAnd so I Do believe you know I worked Christians all the time and I respect that religion and so I you know I think what you're doing this marvelous you know I think that it's just that there's a misinterpretation and needless argument between these two are theories that are both correct\nAnd let's go back to the jury for the other question go ahead Teri\nUh yeah what I was gonna say is you're talking about religion religion teaches at probation a God go to church give your money\nDo this don't do that that's not from guy the problem is is that we have many ministers out there that teach uh this type of stuff then basically do they make money off the guy\nThe problem is with this with this whole scenario as it turns people off like you Jeffrey and and I understand that\nI really do understand that and I feel sorry for people that don't know that but you got to understand that the only Christianity is not a religion it said if it's a relationship between you and God\nNow why is that well to be an arbitrator you have to be God man\nJesus is title is Jesus is Lord Jesus Christ lord needs the anti genes this means humanity and Christ needs and only did one\nOkay so what happens is because we don't do this in order to be because none of us are perfect on this earth in fact in fact Peter said that I'm a I I that God is no respect or a person so we're all in the same boat\nYou no matter how much knowledge we know where all the same boat with God\nBecause we habits did nature because we're we're born in San because of Adam's then because we carry out and then\nUh our entire life we we are and have you been all that this that that none of us are the glory of God we were all in the same boat\nBut those demons seemed to be everywhere we're going to come back and take final

California is with us say Thomas\nCharge thank you for taking my call sir down here for a great work that you're doing ... my question is about war and the battle field and wars um\nHow to military personnel men and women in a battle situation protect themselves from the Monica fault I'm not talking about\nJust battling insurgents physically but there must be a lot of demonic energies in a wartime battle field situation\nAnd you have any advice for men and women in the military to protect themselves\nI Do I was in the air force myself many years ago um and especially there are methods there are rules on the other side of motion all energy that we all generate and is\nIn the battlefield hatred and anger and fear and there's killing going on and so it certainly is a\nA place where negative fares are attracted to demonic spirits negative spirits as well terrible things are happening\nAnd so we need to build up and strengthen our energy field\nBut ... says well terrible things are happening\nAnd so we need to build up and strengthen our energy field there are methods\nThere are rules on the other side like there are physical rules so there are things we can do in order to build shields around ourselves to protect us from the effects that negative energy that is generated by other people fear\nAround us were just natural in a battle situation\nUh emotional energy that's just you know so intense on the battlefield\nThere are multiple layers that can be applied that actually work\nSo that negative energy actually bounces off of us this is something I teach people to do every day it's very important and so it's not you know uh you know just about me the idea is is that yes there are lots of things that people can do on the battlefield to protect themselves in the military\nYou just have to learn how to do them they're actually very simple and it can you know take this stuff I designed over the years with the help of my spirit guides\nCan be brought up in five or ten seconds you needed fast you know the old style was doing things ten minutes in the morning in ten minutes in the evening I read all that stuff when I got into the service\nTen minutes to the morning in ten minutes in the evening\nBut we need it's very different now it's very different we you know we didn't we need protection right away we don't know when things are going to hit us we need to be able to bring up our protection systems immediately\nIn order to deflect negative emotional energy or this being generated by the enemy by people around us are that are unhappy and are frightened and also by spirits that are trying to interfere\nAnd feed off of the killing and and also also are off the fear and here so I think that it's very important that we all learn that this kind of thing\nAnd it's a science it's not a religion what what I'm involved in is not religion I Would not even to say it's really a metaphysical is non physical science\nI have no problem with physical science I agree with everything that they have to say scientist or not call me up and to argue with me they are right I deal with non physical science which is essentially is the non physical part of our body\nAre emotional systems are personality everything else butter physical body that is susceptible to attack and also negative emotional energy by negative spirits demonic spirits and also people and really bad and scary situations\nHave you seen demons attack businesses and why did they do that\nDo it in order to destroy a person's life a hack the fabric of the family in the best way to do it is to pull out the resources money George to get it out\nIf they destroy your business and they have a two fold thing going on they have people that are fired that have to look for a job it can cause arguments at home it can cause people to lose their place\nOr where they live all sorts of problems that can cause them to feel bad and actually react sometimes violent Lee\nAnd also it has an effect upon the actual business environment where now you have a failed business I think most restaurants they fail within a year so restaurant after restaurant comes in or business after business comes in and you have problem is a failed businesses and that has an accumulation of uh most\nPlus you have all the people working uh who don't necessarily get along is kind of like our our second family we have a family at home\nAnd we have our family at work and everybody doesn't get along and so essentially we have a lot of emotional energy people at work were sitting at their desks and maybe thinking I really hated here\nWhen they're doing that they're generating emotional energy and it can it can be positive or negative emotional energy but sometimes it's negative ... accumulates in the environment\nThis also attracts negative spirits and demonic spirits\nBecause if they can get somebody fired by you know doing or saying something uh you know inappropriate or a you know simply not doing their job or she'll be destroying the business itself by making of a the business atmosphere very uncomfortable emotionally\nEverybody's got a story about walking into a living environment a pub\nA business a restaurant and saying you know what this place doesn't feel right what sort of picking up on George is emotional energy whether it be good or bad that's emotional energy they're picking up on everybody has the story of that this place doesn't feel right is emotional energy that needs to be cleared out\nSo they attacked businesses because they can actually make a business failed you might have two hundred or two thousand people out of work and now they're really unhappy they go home and there are arguments with their significant others with their kids and a and then it just snowballs\nMatched up let's go the Monique in some lose someone like California Hi Monique go ahead\nHi George I'm way the twenty eight million that God or hacked\nBy face the only
