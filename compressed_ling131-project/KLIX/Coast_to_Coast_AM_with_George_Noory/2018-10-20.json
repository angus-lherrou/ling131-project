endangered American national security\nWell I I think that it has and in fact ... said that once again this week that he believes that Trump clearly wants to stabilize and improve U.S Russian ties\nYou know when they met together and Helsinki this July\nUh they talked about a host of issues now of course all those are are not out in the open because president's talking confidence about things of concern but one of the things he talked about was ridiculed reduction of nuclear weapons throughout the world and of course it starts with both Russia and\nAh the United states I I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of get the rhetoric ...\nAh the United states I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of get the rhetoric lower or not only with the Russians but with the Chinese now if people argue well what's he doing with this trade war and and like\nWell he's representing if you look at the national security strategy and the national defense strategy that\nWere published in the last year he is trying to make sure that people understand America is first he's not going to sit back and see other countries take advantage of it is but at the same time he does want stability he does want to end the tensions uh but at the same time it's very high today for a variety of reasons\nWell let's pay the China you mentioned the trade wars are ... and how people need to appreciate how this trade war strategy or terrorists\nUh against China is is not just economic it's also national security and that if I Would argue if we don't engage in this trade war now\nWe're going to have to end up fighting on the battlefield ... is this and it can't to weaken China significantly economically so that they can't uh\nA cheese military supremacy over the United states\nMore clearly we have as the number one and number two\nEconomic powers in the world there is a lot of competition but there's a lot of commonality a lot of mutual interest to keep both economy's going along and the Chinese and in the last year or so have seemed somewhat of a depth [noise]\nYou know there are what six and a half percent growth in the last quarter which is down over the previous quarters [noise] uh [noise] but the fact is that we need one another\nAnd yet if we continue to allow them to take jobs\nTo manipulate you know our businesses and Robert intellectual property and Trump says well we're losing something like three hundred billion dollars of intellectual property to\nChinese and not only cyber attacks but through your company the company relationship and company to state relationship with Beijing then that's a national security issue he makes it very clear and the national security strategy that\nYou know economics is national security we can't afford to lose jobs we can't afford to let\nOur wealth go to China and so he's trying to level the playing field he wants a fair playing field arguably president she said much the same but from a very different position so\nAre there hopefully going to be within the month maybe in Argentina will see and if they do maybe we can get kind of movement in the right direction I Know the Chinese media is is trying to figure out Trump you know just like the\nAmbassador to Washington from Beijing said on Fox News this past weekend they can't figure him out and I think that's to the Americans advantage you always want to keep your opponent you're adversary or even your friends to a certain degree guessing and Mr Trump certainly does that\nIt is a ... alliance of evil yeah between the Russians and the Chinese and perhaps there are other uh\nComponents to this Islamic terrorism perhaps but in terms of their the Russians and the Chinese becoming a bed may is is driven by ... gene any way or are there still vestiges of a communist\nThe bed me is is driven by ... gene anyway are are there still vestiges of a communist ideology here or is this simply about hedging many\nWell as a combination of things I I don't it's not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy as it was I Would argue during the old Cold War a\nPotent for his own ideology is about order and bringing jobs back to Russia bringing confidence in where the nation is as opposed to what they would call and a moral west\nAh and the things that they represent they paint the wife says what Hollywood is spewing all over the world and they said you don't want that in fact\nYou know putting is is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and\nAnd the things that you know used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so he\nYou know even though he ... he still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man in the in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him that he has adversaries but you know it was just this week\nYou had you know a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russians constitutional court who even started to you know hit\nAt perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent in this case to serve beyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh yeah this past march [noise]\nYou know they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to ah keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that food is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident in President Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting prudent as\nAn evil adversary and yet the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal why should we be fearing ... and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political corps and\nA predatory economics strategic extortion information warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and there was a long history and in fact an alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just\nYour title and mortgage are kept on

Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived who do you perceive as the greater threat right now to the United States Russia or China\nImmediate threat Richard Russia a given\nTheir provocation but also a their military capability or which they're not shy to exercise around the globe\nI'm very you know the chief of naval operations animal rich or have said recently we were in the fourth battle of the Atlantic the first one was in World War one Second World war two the old Cold War with third one\nOr the Russians have put in place a nuclear submarine and and I ... a diesel powered submarines that are just as capable almost as certainly hours not only in the Atlantic for the Mediterranean and elsewhere\nAnd of course are confronting enough uh militarily or in the air or they're back off our coastlines\nSwear and of course they're confronting us militarily or in the air or they're back off our coastlines\nAre they're very aggressive in terms of cyber as we know all about the allegations and in justifiably are the sanctions put in place because of their interference in the twenty sixteen election in here recently or in the twenty Eighteen mid terms we arrested\nOr someone of course this was a Chinese person or in Belgium you know these sorts of things are not to be ignored or the Russians are bellicose and they're you know claims against us and to a certain degree or we're pushing back\nYou know President Trump's not a you know backing down and that\nAnd given that there's you know some given some take but maybe a it's not a favoring\nAn outcome that uh is going to suit is all ah and then of course you joined up with what's going on with the Chinese and perhaps in the south China Sea East China sea and of course their belt and road strategy ... an issue all over the world where they're buying\nUp infrastructure and using that as a\nWay of planting their People's Liberation army capabilities you know literally across the globe you know do I say Russia is more dangerous now China is certainly the long term more dangerous adversary\n[noise] while we vanquished the former Soviet Union economically we brought them to their knees or they have an economy which is what their GDP about the size of Texas now why why couldn't we do that again with another arms race\nWell we are in an arms race or I mentioned earlier the hyper sonic weapons that are putting puts forward keep in mind you know you're right there GDP is miniscule compared to ours\nUm but they hide a lot of the stuff so it's not really as obvious as one would think in terms of how much they're really plowing into their capabilities\nAnd he said this week you know we have these capabilities and our experts don't contest that yes they are working on capabilities and they probably will feel them and and the near future and are they willing to use it well put and says\nYou know he's not going to be the first to use nuclear weapons even though you know there is a strategy called escalate to de escalate which is in there twenty Fifteen doctrine that in fact they might use a tactical nuclear weapons which is\nYou know why the U.S Congress or in the national defense authorization act twenty Nineteen now wants to fund a new counter to\nAh that to provide us a tactical capability in Europe so you've got all these kind of flattering around there I I Would say right now because of the capabilities that Russia is posing against NATO\nOr and they of course the more strategic capability that he's been modernizing with his platforms and his uh weapons\nAre that they're the the mere threat in the long term threatened and especially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed out earlier with a defense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok twenty Eighteen joined exercise which is going to be an annual exercise\nThese sorts of indicators that demonstrates that uh these two nations are pushing back against the former yeah dominance that we had across the world and arguably you know you can\nYou come up with the conclusion I think that uh perhaps were not as dominant perhaps we are weakening or certainly up until the ah the Trump Administration came in and started to\nThat perhaps we are weakening or certainly up until the ah the Trump Administration came in and started to refuel our defense industry\nA and our Pentagon to have capabilities that we were really bleeding a and therefore we're not able to stand toe to toe with the rising Chinese\nMilitary and of course though not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have capabilities that are clearly we don't have and then we're trying to catch up with even now\nLet me ask you about NATO article five course the cornerstone of the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization an attack on one member of NATO was an attack on all of its members should we really go to war with Russia if let's say they roll tanks across the stony and border we want to go to war maybe World War three ...\nWell that's a that's why you know Trump has been over there you know trying to shake them up saying you've got to spend more and yet you know even the idea of accepting Macedonia we already have twenty nine members do we need to all these other little countries\nYou know might Russia go in and and and disturbed that country and then as you're right we could clear article five and we have to go to war now there's only been one of the declaration of course that was two thousand and one when we were attacked\nOr you know in New York and Washington and Pennsylvania and and the like and we declared war on terror and we're all over the place to include Afghanistan et cetera so [noise]\nUh no I I don't think that we should you know jump at that and I think that's what is in the back of Trump's mind says you know I'm not sure I Want to throw my entire nation's capability and wealth and and statue in future into the hands of these little tiny nations knee that may not have\nThe wherewithal not only to push back against the Russians but to ah you know make these tough decision so uh that I think is very much on the forefront that's what John Bolton perhaps is going to talk to his counterpart in crime on next week\nYou know certainly you know the defense ministers are are talking that I Know the general Dunford was just over at his counterparts than NATO and and he was saying look you folks you've got to wake up and he said yeah they are waking up to the threat posed by Russia [noise]\nUh but we as a nation you certainly the United states\nAnd I had better make it very clear that if\nIf we can't back a an article five declaration by even one of these little tiny countries that are threatened Lithuania Estonia or even pollen which is a\nYou know really a very concerned about the Russian Bear and what they might do perhaps similar to what they did with Ukraine these are all issues of great\nA magnitude that um we've got to decide and thus far we haven't backed out of NATO but perhaps that's something we need to rethink\nLet's talk about China um we've been hearing all about Russian collusion in elections and so forth a Nikki Haley the UN ambassador and the president has accused the Chinese of of meddling in\nThe mid mid term elections uh there's obviously a huge amount of economic integration with China in the United states\nI'm the big concern as I see it again comes back to cyber warfare and all these talks about a Chinese made computer chips in components in electronics they may have a back door or even in US military equipment taught me about the series the seriousness of that threat\nWell it is a very serious threat in fact over the last year and certainly the Pentagon and I will be a defense\nPut out a mandate said look you know even in these Chinese made yeah phones you know who you were not going to sell them in our\nIn our post exchanges are you know our our stores are we're not going to buy certain items because we're suspect\nOr that the Chinese have\nAnd somehow you know put chips in these devices that can turn on and transmit information that we don't want to lose so it's not only impacting individuals it's impacting the institution and of course you're right you know we're in bed with the Chinese on all sorts of

phone calls or open up the phone lines at the bottom of the hour questions and comments\nAbout the possibility that we are staring a new dual Cold War in the face and could lead to events that open the door for the biblical times we'll get to all that in the moment just to remind also at the top of the next hour are open lines segment begins for two hours of creepy piece of footage from a family in Ireland\nSeems to show some kind of figure momentarily appear on a baby monitor in the video a couple are setting up the device so they can keep an eye on their baby has the husband remotely

glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what everyone wants to alternately\n... it's just too rich so the the the the turkey is buying um air defense system that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO a sensibly used to protect NATO from Russian missile\nYes and that yeah because we will not connect our patriots and other fads to a Russian S. four hundred a that's why yeah there's a it's a non sack what're we just won't do it\nUh and that is a major um bone of contention and of course are there others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk tried to secular rise that nation uh everyone is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it a witness Islam ec viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire [noise]\nAh so NATO no I I don't think that they should be a member of NATO you know NATO such a complex thing for us today as we mentioned in the last hour or because you know anyone could you know call for an article five say you know the Russians are picking on me please come to my rescue\nOr do we want to be tethered in the future war world to that well\nYou know we have that alliance and to keep in mind I have no doubt that the Russians and the Chinese\nAre just you know very tight now out of necessity\nThey don't want to be contained by us and I don't know that we can contain them but they want to form their own little alliance and to a certain degree this belt and road strategy of president Xi around the world and collaboration with the Russians in military exercises this is all painting a picture\nWhere you can see a divided world emerging a so to abandon NATO even though it has all sorts of you know warts and problems with it at this point might not be well advised but certainly allowing turkey into our secrets into our\nSystems with a Russian made here defense system is not a good idea you\nKnow far from it for me to to um stand up for the house of Saud by a given that so much of the narrative of the ... a\nMurder has come from the Turks and also cutter\nOr another sort of sworn enemy of Saudi Arabia is it possible do you think there's anything to the the idea that that cutter turkey are trying to drive a wedge between the United states and uh there's there are their allies the Saudis with is\nOf course you know that's a sort of thing that you know\nKind of the poker and the Internet ... political world that takes place all the time behind the scenes\nYou know who were the people that were in the [noise]\nYou know the Saudi embassy that night uh I suppose some details will eventually come out\nBut the clandestine type of operations for one nation to another or perhaps not nation states but other activities take place unfortunately all the time you know we're in a tight spot what can President Trump to he can sanction entities and into\nTake place unfortunately all the time you know we're in a tight spot what can President Trump to he can sanction entities and individuals or even if ... ... was you know demonstrated to have been\nMurdered as it would appear to be by a Hinch men that were under the leadership of saw him on don't know but that could be clearly we could cancel the arms deal but I mean we've been not only a hundred and ten billion it's far in excess of that\nAnd we have a lot of people on the ground working hand in glove with them but we risk a relationship\nWith a with the Saudis against Iran and of course the Saudis interestingly are aligned with Pakistan Pakistan has nuclear weapons\nUm and the packs of course distance from us now aligned with the Chinese so you you've got to look at second and third order effects of any decision geopolitically and that part of the world\nOr otherwise you end up with no one that you can go to and work with a given your your vested interests and of course the the Yemen situation we've been helping them a great deal there ria Riyadh government\nAnd trying to battle the who cheese and the others of course the Iranians you know through proxies in that part of the world um\nI Wish it were simple it's not simple uh the world's divided\nAnd of course as we see is what I call the alliance of evil Russia and China you using the mechanisms behind the scenes the variety of proxies not just the north Koreans in the Iranians but others\nI think are a air to one is going to be one of those proxies to a certain degree even though he would like to think that he can rule the the Muslim world um I think the Chinese have a better idea for him\nA ... if you were in John Bolton supposition or you had the president here who knows maybe you do or what would you be advising how how is this how do we counteract or just how do we step back from the brink of of war\nI I Do believe that a boat and we will talk to his counterpart about uh\nYou know renewing new start which expires in twenty Twenty one we've got to do that it's in their country's best interest to not have a I have an agreement that isn't for civil the problem is and the Russians notice that a Nineteen eighty seven ins treaty was\nWas violated or with their own cruise missiles\nAnd uh you know they probably will admit that behind the scenes or you know we've done a lot of in the open a so I think that will will get something I Know that\nYou know they had was from Trump asked for you met with putting in Helsinki in July that yeah they did talk about that issue and potent surreal is you know yeah he he has grandiose ideas about the fact that he can meet with the world's leader ah on the west Trump\nYou know in the eyes of the the Russian people means that they are great power again and of course you know putting his meetings with President Xi on a frequent basis just solidifies that viewpoint so if I were both ... and I I'm pretty you know I I've I've talked to John Bolton before and so I just\nI I kind of have a sense that that's what he's going to do you know he's a real pragmatist he is a tough guy and but he does have the president's year and I think that that's it that's going to be the top of the agenda and of course uh he'll probably try to deal with\nThe issues in Syria um and with air to won a fan of course uh the Iranian the Iranians\nUh we we have no question I think after Netanyahu revealed months ago you know those volumes and volumes of evidence regarding their nuclear programs\nHave we don't acknowledge a lot of things but I suspect that uh you know there's good reason to believe the Iranians are up to no good\nOr is there were to be regime regime change in in Iran and and hopefully that will come about by the Iranian people are just getting fed up with the situation with and chasing the mullahs out of there if Iran were to become kind of a secular\nNon align nation or you know again leaning to the west as they did for many many decades how would that change the situation because obviously what's going on in Syria\nIs it's not about a civil war it's about a proxy war and it's about Iran so if Iran has regime change how does that change the equation [noise]\nWell if you don't have the ayatollah running of the\nYou know the military and their diplomacy or you know for to promote their their sheer world view\nA and the autocratic rule view of of the removal of when I I think that you find that they're not involved with the ... are not involved with Assad rather less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests\nAnd perhaps even to a certain degree with China\nUm [noise] and it's the problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia the Riyadh in Iran is going to continue um but it it if you're not involved in you know and fueling terrorism such as his ... in\nSouthern Lebanon and you know encouraging him off and you know Palestine and so forth and\nYou know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them a Iranians are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope that they will\nReplace their autocrats with people that are have a a more a better sense of history and were were they ought to be going but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another follow from that are positive aspect of that might be a\nLiberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the hobbits were sort of seen as a counter measure to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nSome positive effects in in Saudi Arabia as well here's ... van Morrison taking us into the break with a band low stairway will open up the phone lines questions and comments for lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis when coast to coast continues right after this\n\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis is with us before we go to the phones a Bob let me ask you the last three years well projecting into next year\nThe Trump Administration is earmarked proximate lead to point to a to point three billion dollars increase defense spending we had seven hundred and sixty billion a couple of years ago seven hundred and five I think last year in another seven hundred coming up this year\nUh is is that enough I mean a lot of that obviously is going to salaries and so forth but is it enough\nYou know half of it you're right does go to salaries and that's why people often say well gosh\nYou know [noise] you know how can the Russians and the Chinese beat such an adversary and competitive with us while they hide most of what they're spending on their own national security you know the answer is uh we'll see\nUm the concern is here this past week the president came and said we're going to all parts of the U.S government must cut five percent well we went through this quest ration period in which had just crippled our readiness our ability to go out and trained to be ready to fight\nTo replace you know with your new aircraft for these antiques that we're trying to fly around the world the same thing was ships you know it's an incredibly expensive\nTo have an armed forces and you know it reminded me of of something that Ronald Reagan said you know this was obviously a few years ago and basically says that\nIf you want to be free you have to be willing basically to to pay the price and the price in this case is to have a moderate armed forces nobody's going to seek to contest well today we're being contested are furiously on all fronts by\nA both China and Russia are specially combined a fair forming a new one alliance\nAnd so if we don't sustain as you know the chiefs of staff and the and the chairman of the joint chiefs General Joe\nAnd so if we don't sustain as you know the chiefs of staff and the and the chairman of the joint chiefs General Joe Dunford if we don't sustained the investment in long term capabilities uh then we're going to fall behind were already falling behind in terms of hyper sonics\nAnd artificial intelligence or even in an investment in our our blue water navy uh uh the last couple of years have been great it's only putting it on our rights glide path if we can sustain it\nLet's say say hello to the west of the Rockies in Las Vegas Skinny Me good morning Steve welcome to coast to coast am\nThank you very much a Robert you were talking about the uh Chinese tapping our electronics for information well what I'm really concerned about is what if the Chinese have programmed to an end date into all of these electronic chips\nSo that everything shuts down at the same time some time in the future you know it's it sounds a little paranoid but I think it's very feasible and that's really a something major that could happen\nQuick question Steve is that possible Bob\n[noise] well I'm not an electronics are no expert however I Do understand the question and I share that concern\nA and that's something that I think that uh Jim Mattis our defense secretary a is concerned about that\nThings like that could undermine the complexity of our systems and if we get a programmable and reversible inundated electronics aboard our satellites or missiles are aircraft\nAre ships and it's and so forth and we could find that this could be catastrophic so\nI I think there's plenty of caution today a there's a wakeup call across or certainly the U.S military and I think our allies are are joining that understanding that this is a very new world that we're facing\nAnd we have to be very careful of of the type of equipment that we do embrace and so this is I don't think it's out of the possibility\nIt reminds me of um winter I'm the U.S spy plane that held in ... was held in China for some time\nUh I think it was maybe a near collision involved and and I'm I'm just wondering if that it it that might be what we're talking about here perhaps it was ... it was ... it landed there because of being hacked into somehow\nYou know well you know that's a sort of thing that we are very concerned about a cyber the battleground has a you know cyber is one of the four that I point out an alliance of

Bo a sick about six years ago and the football game you played the Steelers it's on YouTube you can type in the Boeing halo\nYou'll see a giant halo falling over to the football stadium that day a giant circle and this guy or people standing in the stands not push up staying in the stands commonality a halo for people hit over Denver\nIt's the same game that all the three sixteen showed up from John three sixteen in the Bible\nPeople have yes or no\nPeople it painted drunk three sixteen on his eye patch is three years before that game when ... when he wanted to be the the championship game against Oklahoma\nSo three years to the day he he played the Steelers he had the halo showed up he had John three sixteen in passing three Fifteen yards thirty one point six average per catch even CBS carry the game the rating for the game was thirty one point six percent was eyes reading again got for the game but I remember I said I have the time of position thirty one minute it's like ...\nThe only interception was there down at sixteen ... through the interception of people that a white horse to the top of the stadium on the one in the ... mile high to the bronco\nVeggies when he said it's I think in the stadium you see this guy in the clouds above it with a white horse will Jesus returns in a way towards with clouds so it has a symbol red revelation of Jesus return on a lake or some revelation the opening kickoff in America opening kick off because it couldn't happen but I won't tell you that 'cause they'll take the long but anyway go ahead and I I Would I Want to get those facts I'll tell you before\nMy phone cut off [laughter] it's ... it's remarkable and I I remember some of that not all of the details now is he not in the New York Mets a farm system now do you need you left football and he's in baseball now as any\nYou know it was really interesting in baseball is really fascinating but I mean the other is kind of like uh\nThe symbol read Jesus is coming back you know that there's no doubt that the oldest coincidences we're not a coincidence that there are too many even the opening takeoff hit the cross bar in the back of the end zone which is located tenure to sleep in the end zone Rickey said back thirty yards\nBack toward the kicker and put herself on the twenty to start the game where you put put it for a touch back\nThere is no way that can happen that ever happened to him again anywhere near you close to that but it happened the beginning of that can nobody knew was going to be a blessed game until I Want to go cut the one in touch them or one plane over time the marriage Thomas cut the eighty or passing over time just one player was over in the overtime he was born on Christmas twelve twenty five Nineteen eighty seven he ended the game the people that are three hundred and sixteen\nYears ago in the baseball\nAnd yes he is and and he sort of continuing on and that in that realm he was on the pitchers man I Believe one game and he saw someone struggling in the in the stands\nAmong you hear whether they were having grass he was getting ready to sign on hats right any kind of pet it epilepsy feet or something\nOr ... where he I thought he may be resuscitated this this individual but he will he would've\nBeen over and prayed for them and the guy all of a sudden came back he got his breath and then he was choking he couldn't get his breath he was going to pass out\nAnd maybe die I don't know but he he bent over and tests that guy's leg and then we did a prayer and um people were standing around the lady couple of ladies standing around one of them are we thought that she had ... ... you know one of those tax\nThat she thought she may be witness the miracle or because the guy was a you know two paramedics or something there and they couldn't get either be\nAble to breathe he's an incredible individual and granted I think I'll\nTell you one more thing is really interesting he he he when he played for the Mets have paid for the Mets minor league thing when he played the river dogs who are to New York Yankee team back last year round the in the gym\nHe played that team in the end they mocked him every every play they go up to bat the plague hallelujah chorus music they show on the scoreboard crying when he cried when he lost the Alabama\nIn the in the playoff game I guess and he also the issue of the river dogs people will remember do with the black patches and the guy jumping over him you know mocking John three sixteen the bottle\nSo what happened later in the year people last like two or three of those games I Believe the later in the year when the big thing was when they were winning three games to two or whatever all of a sudden they lost the third game and the fourth game and he asked her was when it instead of them\nAnd so God remembers you though [laughter] that was more and more and more important than the other thing with people in the minor league team with the river dogs that was the major league team didn't get in and they didn't you didn't move here either so maybe there is a little thing going on there with God and the market three countries sixteen you know and then the

America is locked in a new kind of dual Cold War with the Russians and the Chinese\nThe Russian Federation under a populist off the authoritarian leader seriously threatens the west through cyberspace and military uh thanks to that country's heavy investment in sophisticated mass killing weapons\nThe People's Republic of China is a great power with global ambitions led by a new kind of communist leader focused on rapidly growing his nation economically and militarily and together China and Russia collaborate\nTo dominate our future and that pseudo alliance could well become\nThe catalyst that

could exchange some veal recipes because there's absolutely nothing going on right [laughter]\nI actually remember slow news day news days back in the nineties when we would sit around and say wow there's nothing going on well that certainly isn't the case these days\nAgainst the Baltics against Poland yeah hungry Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down\nCame to this country met with Bush Camp David we had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crimes we could have a brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir potent\nAnd you know potent of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result as you know really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that a ... they're somewhat um I Would argue blind or to perhaps what the West is looking at because\nThey want to rise again they want to be a great power again and they do have them the means through their nuclear arsenal and of course I'm putting you know here even this week when he was down and so she was arguing that\nYou know we have a modern weapons systems\nOf that really a push against the emergent and they're very capable west and he talked about the oven guard a twenty time speed of found a nuclear capable go anywhere breakthrough any a defense system\nWeapon system a hyper sonic weapon system much like what the Chinese are working on so the Russians are really for to find themselves they're pushing back\nThey are concerned about NATO and we did violate a the initial trust that we wouldn't push against them we did and so we find ourselves in a very dangerous position today a visa V. not only of course putting but also president Xi in China\n[noise] how much has the narrative of Russian collusion\nHand cost the Trump Administration into perhaps smoothing over relations pulling back from the break if you will because now because everyone is seeing a I'm a Russian under their bed in the closet in the White House\nOr that he has to be asked to appear\nAlmost overly aggressive against the Russian how much has this this Russian collusion narrative endangered American national security\nWell I I think that it has and in fact ... said you know once again this week that he believes that Trump clearly wants to stabilize and improve U.S Russian ties\nYou know when they met together\nAnd Helsinki this July uh they talked about a host of issues now of course all those are a an not out in the open because presidents and talk and confidence about things of concern but one of the things he talked about was ridiculed reduction of nuclear weapons throughout the world and of course it starts with both Russia and\nAh the United states I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of get the rhetoric lower or not only with the Russians but with the Chinese now as people argue well was he doing\nWell he's representing if you look at the national security strategy and the national defense strategy that\nWere published in the last year he is trying to make sure that people understand America is first he's not going to sit back and see other countries take advantage of it but at the same time he doesn't want stability he does want to end the tensions ah but at the same time it's very high today for a variety of reasons\nTo pay the China you mentioned the trade wars [laughter] uh ... and how people need to appreciate how this trade war strategy or terrorists\nUh against China is is not just economic it's also national security and that if I Would argue if we don't engage in this trade war now\nWe're going to have to end up fighting on the battlefield linger is this and it tends to weaken China significantly economically so that they can't uh\nA cheese military supremacy over the United states\nWell clearly we have as the number one and number two\nEconomic powers in the world there is a lot of competition but there's a lot of commonality a lot of mutual interest to keep both the economy's going along and the Chinese and in the last year or so I have seen somewhat of a death\nYou know there is what six and a half percent growth and the last quarter which is down over the previous quarters [noise] uh [noise] but the fact is that we need one another\nAnd yet if we continue to allow them to take jobs to manipulate and our businesses and Robert intellectual property in in Trump's says well we're losing something like three hundred billion dollars of intellectual property to\nChinese you know not only cyber attacks but through your company the company relationship and company to state relationship with Beijing then that's a national security issue he makes it very clear and the national security strategy that\nYou know economics is national security we can't afford to lose jobs we can't afford to let\nOur wealth go to China and so he's trying to level the playing field he wants a fair playing field arguably president she said much the same but from a very different position so\nAre there hopefully going to be within the month maybe in Argentina will see and if they do maybe we can get kind of movement in the right direction I Know the Chinese media is is trying to figure out Trump you know just like the\nAmbassador to Washington from Beijing said on Fox News this past weekend they can't figure him out and I think that's to the Americans advantage you always want to keep\nYour opponent you're adversary or even your friends to a certain degree guessing and Mr Trump certainly does that\nIt is a ... alliance of evil yeah between the Russians and the Chinese and perhaps there are other uh\nComponents to this Islamic terrorism perhaps an ... in terms of the the Russians and the Chinese becoming a bed made is is driven by ... in any way or are there still messages of\nA communist ideology here or is this simply about hedging many\nWell as a combination of things uh I don't it's not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy as it was I Would argue during the old Cold War a potent\nIs about order and bringing jobs back to Russia bringing confidence and we're the nation is as opposed to what they would call and a moral west\nAh and the things that they represent they paint or the west is what Hollywood is spewing all over the world and they said you don't want that in fact\nYou know putting is is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and\nYeah and the things that you know used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so he\nYou know even though we suffer Terry and he still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man in the in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know they have adversaries but you know it was just this week\nYou had you know a a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russia's constitutional court who even started to you know hit\nAt perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent in this case to serve beyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh yeah this past march\nYou know they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to ah keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that ... is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident in President Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting prudent as\nAn evil adversary and yet the ... the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal why should we be fearing ... and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political coercion\nA predatory economics strategic extortion information warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and there's a long history and in fact an alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just\nCome out alive and they they like blinking red lights\nAnd they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests and in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime

perceive us the greater threat right now to the United States Russia or China\nImmediate threat Richard is Russia a given their provocations but also a their military capability or which they're not shy to exercise around the globe\nI'm very you know the chief of naval operations that more rich you know have said recently we were in the fourth battle of the Atlantic the first one was in World War one Second World war two the old Cold War with the third one\nOr the Russians have put in place a nuclear submarine and and I ... a diesel powered submarines that are just as capable almost as certainly hours not only in the\nAtlantic for the Mediterranean and elsewhere\nAnd of course they're confronting enough or militarily or in the air or they're back off our coastlines\nAre they're very aggressive in terms of fiber as we know all about the allegations in justifiably are the sanctions put in place because of their interference in the twenties sixteen election and here recently or in the twenty Eighteen mid terms we arrested uh someone\nTwenty sixteen election in here recently or in the twenty eighth team in terms we arrested\nOr someone of course this was Chinese person or in Belgium you know these sorts of things are not to be ignored or the Russians are bellicose in there you know claims against us and to a certain degree or we're pushing back\nYou know President Trump's not a you know backing down and that\nGiven that there's you know some given some take but maybe\nIt's not a favoring an outcome that uh is going to suit is all ah and then of course you joined that with what's going on with the Chinese and perhaps in the south China Sea East China sea and of course their belt and road strategy a new issue all over the world where they're buying up\nInfrastructure and using that as a way of planting their People's Liberation army capabilities you know literally across the globe\nYou know do I say Russia is more dangerous now China is certainly the long term more dangerous adversary\n[noise] while we vanquished the former Soviet Union economically we brought them to their knees or they have an economy which is what they're GDP about the size of Texas now why why couldn't we do that again with another arms race\nWell we are in an arms race or I mentioned earlier the hyper sonic weapons that are putting puts forward keep in mind you know you're right there GDP is miniscule compared to ours\nUm but they hide a lot of the stuff so it's not really as obvious as one would think in terms of how much they're really plowing into their capabilities\nAnd he said this week you know we have these capabilities and our experts don't contest that yes they are working on capabilities and they probably will feel them and and the near future and are they willing to use it well put and says\nYou know he's not going to be the first to use nuclear weapons even though you know there is a strategy called escalate to de escalate which isn't there twenty Fifteen doctrine that's in fact they might use a tactical nuclear weapons which is\nYou know why the U.S Congress or in the national defense authorization act twenty Nineteen uh wants to fund a new counter to ah that to provide us a tactical capability in Europe so you've got all these kind of flattering around there\nI I Would say right now because of the capabilities that Russia is posing against NATO\nOr and they of course the more strategic capability that he's been modernizing with his platforms and his uh weapons\nAre that they're the the mere threat in the long term threatening specially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed out earlier with defense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok twenty Eighteen joined exercise which is going to be an annual exercise\nThese sorts of indicators that demonstrates that uh these two nations are pushing back against the former yeah dominance that we had across the world and arguably you know you can come up with the conclusion I think that\nUh perhaps were not as dominant perhaps we are weakening or certainly up until the ah the Trump Administration came in and started to refuel our defense industry\nA and our Pentagon to have capabilities that we were really bleeding a and therefore we're not able to stand toe to toe with the rising Chinese military and of course though not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have case\nOh oh with the rising Chinese military and of course though not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have capabilities that are clearly we don't have and they were trying to catch up with even now\nLet me ask you about NATO article five course the cornerstone of the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization an attack on one member of NATO was an attack on all of its members should we really go to war with Russia if let's say they roll tanks across the stony and border we want to go to war maybe World War three over a stone ya\nWell that's a that's why you know Trump has been over there you know trying to shake them up saying you've got to spend more and yet you know even the idea of accepting Macedonia we already have twenty nine members do we need to all these other little countries\nYou know might Russia go in and and and disturbed that country and then as you're right we could clear article five and we have to go to war now there's only been one of the declaration of course that was two thousand and one when we were attacked\nOr you know in New York and Washington and Pennsylvania and and the like and we declared a war on terror and we're all over the place to include Afghanistan et cetera so [noise]\nUm no I I don't think that we should you know jump at that and I think that's what is in the back of Trump's mind says you know I'm not sure I Want to throw my entire nation's capability and wealth and and statue in future into the hands of these little tiny nations need that may not have\nThe wherewithal not only to push back against the Russians but to ah you know make these tough decision so\nUh that I think is very much on the forefront that's what John Bolton perhaps is going to talk to his counterpart in the Kremlin next week\nYou know certainly you know the defense ministers are are talking that I Know the general Dunford was just over at his counterparts than NATO and and he was saying look you folks you've got to wake up and he said yeah they are waking up to the threat posed by Russia [noise]\nUh but we as a nation the certainly the United states\nHad better make it very clear that if\nIf we can't back a an article five declaration by even one of these little tiny countries that are threatened Lithuania Estonia or even Poland which is a\nYou know really a very concerned about the Russian Bear and what they might do perhaps similar to what they did with Ukraine these are all issues of great\nUh you know magnitude that um we've got to decide and thus far we haven't backed out a NATO but perhaps that's something we need to rethink\nUs to talk about China um we've been hearing all about Russian collusion in elections and so forth are Nikki Haley the UN ambassador and the president has accused the Chinese as of meddling in\nThe mid mid term elections uh there's obviously a huge amount of economic integration with China in the United states\nI'm the big concern as I see it again comes back to cyber warfare and all these talks about a Chinese made computer chips and components in electronics they may have a back door or even in US military equipment taught me about the series the seriousness of that threat\nWell it is a very serious threat in fact over the last year and certainly the Pentagon you know the a defense secretary Jim Mattis uh put out a mandate say look you know even in these Chinese made yeah phones you know who you were not going to sell them in our\nIn our post exchanges are you know our our stores are we're not going

a moment the author of alliance of evil and we will open up the phone calls or open up the phone lines at the bottom of the hour questions and comments\nAbout the possibility that we are staring a new dual Cold War in the face and could lead to events that open the door for the biblical times we'll get to all that in the moment just a reminder also at the top of the next hour are open lines segment begins for two hours of creepy piece of footage from a family in Ireland\nSeems to show some kind of figure momentarily appear on a baby monitor in the video a couple are setting up the device so they can keep an eye on their baby has the husband remotely adjusts the camera so it shows his wife's face he has stunned\nTo see what appears to be someone's head poke out of a doorway behind his wife\nAfter unleashing a be wielded cry the man runs into the room to track down the oddity but finds that there is no one there\nExcept for his wife and the baby nonetheless he insists that he saw something in some online viewers agree suggesting the anomaly with some kind of edgy or perhaps even a ghost you can read all about it see the video for yourself and the highlight carousel up the coast to coast am where webmaster show a lot of shore as posted that\nYeah and that puts you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what everyone wants to alternately\nOne of the it's just too rich so the the the the turkey is buying um air defense systems that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO offensively used to protect NATO from Russian missile\nChefs and that yeah because we will not connect our a patriots and other uh fat to a Russian as four hundred a that's why there's a it's a non ... we just won't do it\nUh and that is a major bone of contention and of course are there others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk practice secular rise that nation uh everyone is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it with his Islam ec a viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire\nOr so NATO no I I don't think that they should be of member of NATO you know NATO such a complex thing for us today as we mentioned in the last hour or because you know anyone could you know call for an article five say you know the Russians are picking on me please come to my rescue\nOr do we want to be tethered in the future war world to that well\nYou know we have that alliance and but keep in mind I have no doubt that the Russians and the Chinese\nAre just you know very tight now out of necessity they don't want to be contained by us and I don't know that we can contain them but\nThey want to form their own little alliance and to a certain degree this belt and road strategy of president Xi around the world and collaboration with the Russians and military exercises this is all painting a picture where you can see a divided world\nEmerging a so to abandon NATO even though it has all sorts of you know warts and problems with it\nAt this point might not be well advised\nBut certainly allowing to turkey into our secrets into our\nSystems with a Russian made here defense system is not a good idea you\nKnow far from for me to to um stand up for the house of Saud mud\nAnd given that so much of the narrative of the show the\nMurder has come from the Turks and also cutter\nOr another sort of sworn enemy of Saudi Arabia is it possible do you think there's anything to the the idea that that cutter turkey are trying to drive a wedge between the United states and uh there's there are their allies the Saudis with is\nOf course you know that's a sort of thing that you know\nKind of the poker and the Internet geo political world that takes place all the time behind the scenes you know who were the people that were in the [noise]\nYou know the Saudi embassy that night uh I suppose some details will eventually come out\nWith a clandestine type of operations from one nation to another or perhaps not nation states but other activities\nTake place unfortunately all the time you know we're in a tight spot what can President Trump to he can sanction entities and individuals or even if ... ... was you know demonstrated to have been\nMurdered as it would appear to be by a Hinch men that were under the leadership of saw him on don't know but that could be\nClearly we could cancel the arms deal but I mean we've been\nSo far in excess of that and we have a lot of people on the ground working hand in glove with him but we risk a relationship\nWith a with the Saudis against Iran and of course the Saudis interestingly are aligned with Pakistan Pakistan has nuclear weapons\nUm and the packs of course distance from us now aligned with the Chinese so you you've got to look at second and third order effects of any decision geopolitically and that part of the world\nOr otherwise you end up with no one that you can go to and I work with and given your your vested interests and of course the the Yemen situation we've been helping them a great deal there ria Riyadh government\nAnd trying to battle the who teased and others of course the Iranians you know through proxies in that part of the world um [noise]\nI Wish it were simple it's not simple uh the world's divided\nAnd of course as we see is what I call the alliance of evil Russia and China you using the mechanisms behind the scenes the variety of proxies not just a North Korean some Iranians but others\nI think are a air to one is going to be one of those proxies to a certain degree even though he would like to think that he can rule the the Muslim world um I think the Chinese have a better idea for him\nA ... if you were in John Bolton supposition you had the president's ear who knows maybe you do or what would you be advising have how is this how do we counteract this how do we step back from the brink of of war\nWell I I Do believe that a boat and we will talk to his counterpart about uh\nYou know renewing new start which expires in twenty Twenty one we've got to do that it's in neither country's best interest to not have a an agreement that isn't for civil the problem is and the Russians notice that a Nineteen eighty seven ins treaty was\nWas violated or with their own cruise missiles\nAnd uh you know they probably will admit that behind the scenes or [noise] you know we've done a lot of in the open a so I I think that will will get something I Know that\nYou know they had was from Trump asked for you met with putting in Helsinki in July that yeah they did talk about that issue and potent surreal is you know yeah he he has grandiose ideas about the fact that he can meet with the world leader ah on the west Trump\nYou know in the eyes of the the Russian people means that they are great power again and of course you know putting his meetings with President Xi on a frequent basis just solidifies that viewpoint so if I were both ... and I I'm pretty you know I I've talked to John Bolton before and so I ...\nI kind of have a sense that that's what he's going to do you know he's a real pragmatist he's a tough guy and but he does have the president's year and I think that that's a that's going to be the top of the agenda and of course I he'll probably try to deal with\nThe issues in Syria um and with air to want a ... of course uh the Iranians the Iranians are our problem for Israel\nUh we we have no question I think after Netanyahu revealed months ago you know those volumes and volumes of evidence regarding their nuclear programs [noise]\nUm we don't acknowledge a lot of things but I suspect that uh you know there's good reason to believe the Iranians are up to no good\nIf they were to be regime regime change in in Iran and and hopefully that will come about by the Iranian people\nThe fed up with the situation with you and chasing the mullahs out of there if Iran were to become sort of a secular non align nation or you know again leaning to the west as they did for many many decades how would that change the situation because obviously what's going on in Syria\nIs it's not about a civil war it's about a proxy war and it's about Iran so if Iran has regime change how does that change the equation\n[noise] well if you don't have the ayatollah running you know the you know the military and their diplomacy or you know for me to\nPromote their their sheer world view\nA and the autocratic rule view of of the removal of when I think that you find that they're not involved with a hoot teaser not involved with Assad ah there are less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests\nAnd perhaps even to a certain degree with China um\n[noise] and it's\nThe problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia Riyadh and tear on it's going to continue a buddy ... if you're not involved in you know in fueling terrorism such as his ... in\nSouthern Lebanon and you know encouraging Hamas and and Palestine and so forth and\nYou know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them a Iranians are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope that they will\nReplace their autocrats with people that are have a more a better sense of history and were were they ought to be going but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another follow from that are positive aspect of that might be a\nLiberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the habits were sort of seen as a counter measures to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nSome positive effects in in Saudi Arabia is well here's van Morrison taking is into the break with the band low stairway will open up the phone lines questions and comments for lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis when coast to coast continues right after this\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis is with us before we go to the phones are Bob let me ask you the last three years well projecting into next year\nThe Trump Administration is earmarked up trucks mentally to point to a to point three billion dollars increase defense spending we had seven hundred and sixty billion a couple of years ago seven hundred and five I think last year and another seven hundred coming up this year\nA ... is is that enough I mean a lot of that obviously is going to salaries and so forth but is it enough\nYou know half of it you're right does go to salaries and that's why people often say well gosh\nYou know [noise] you know how can the Russians and the Chinese be such an adversary and competitive with us while they hide most of what they're spending on their own national security you know the answer is uh we'll see\nUm the concern is here this past week the president came and said we're going to all parts of the U.S government must cut five percent well we went through this quest ration period in which had just crippled our readiness our ability to go out and trained to be ready to fight\nTo replace you know with your new aircraft for these antiques that we're trying to fly around the world the same thing with ships\nYou know it's an incredibly expensive\nTo have an armed forces and you know it reminded me of of something that a Ronald Reagan said you know and this was obviously a few years ago and basically says that\nIf you want to be free you have to be willing basically to pay the price and the price in this case is to have a moderate armed forces nobody's going to seek to contest well today we're being contested a furiously on all fronts by\nA both China and Russia especially combined a fair forming a new one alliance\nAnd so if we don't sustain as you know the chiefs of staff and the and the chairman of the joint chiefs General Joe Dunford if we don't sustain the investment in long term capabilities uh then we're going to fall behind were already falling behind in terms of hyper sonics\nAnd artificial intelligence or even in investment in our our blue water navy uh uh the last couple of years have been great it's only putting it on the white glide path if we can sustain it\nLet's say say hello to the west of the Rockies in Las Vegas good evening good morning\nIf we can sustain it\nLet's say a say hello to the west of the Rockies in Las Vegas getting a good morning Steve welcome to coast to coast am\nThank you very much a Robert you were talking about the uh Chinese tapping our electronics for information what I'm really concerned about is what if the Chinese have programmed to an end date into all of these electronic chips\nSo that everything shuts down at the same time some time in the future you know it's it sounds a little paranoid but I think it's very feasible and that's really a something major that could happen\nQuick question Steve is that possible Bob\n[noise] well I'm not an electronics are no expert however I Do understand the question and I share that concern a and that's something that I think that uh Jim Mattis our defense secretary a is concerned about that\nThings like that could undermine the complexity of our systems and if we\nGet a programmable and reversible inundated electronics aboard our satellites or missiles or aircraft\nAre ships and it's and so forth and we could find that this could be catastrophic so\nYou know I I think there's plenty of caution today a there's a wakeup call across or certainly the U.S military and I think our allies are are joining that understanding that uh this is a very new world that we're facing\nAnd we have to be very careful of\nOf the type of equipment that we do embrace and so this is I don't think it's out of the possibility\nIt reminds me of um winter and um the the us spy plane that held in ... was held in China for some time\nUh I think it was maybe a near collision involved in and I'm I'm just wondering if that made it that might be what we're talking about here perhaps it was ... it was ... it landed there because of being hacked into somehow\nYou know well you know that's the sort of thing that we are very concerned about a cyber the battleground of cyber as a woman before that I point out on the lines of evil and\nGo into great detail is two and not only the threat\nOf taking down our own infrastructure a hacking into our elections and doing all sorts of things that we hear about every day\nAnd this is an existential threat to us and in fact when you look at the president's strategy and he says that there's a there's a possibility that we would respond to\nA cyber attack a with a nuclear weapon that's

this country and uh haven't went anywhere around the world at all I have never left the country and it seems extremely obvious to me\nThat uh something has happened to our government or over the last fifty some years and it seems a little old and a lot of people think that uh\nUh you know they preach uh patriotism they preach uh [noise] uh you know go defend our our country's three of them and a charm\nMilitary uh\nIn our military really is and our military anymore as far as I'm concerned it seems obvious that we're not really in control of our government anymore it seems very\nObvious and uh it seems like a [noise] people as a you know I ... a course for younger people don't really you know remember America is was you know in the fifties and sixties and uh\nThey've lost touch\nWith me I Would they didn't lose touch it just it ... it was never a savvy to them or what came before them in a [noise]\nA a you know a lot of the country has opened up prisons around the world can carry gay

said something about ending the draft yeah the\nDraft shouldn't be ended the draft she'll be reinstated as what I'm really saying I mean that's that's one problem but I mean here's the problem we're not in control of our government anymore and I don't blame Russia oh it it seems to me as an American\nNever been to how the country have oh I was raised in Indiana and that that you know\nIn the middle of this country why should I feel this way Kennedy was shot in the head when I was maybe ten years old I remember that\nI was Catholic of course I was that was a direct assault on or you

thank you for the call [noise] well I'll be for Kennedy was McKinley and there was Garfield and there was Lincoln and there were\nMultiple attempts on other presidents um I don't know that that certainly something changed since Kennedy [noise]\nUm but has much changed I think once the United states\nAre sort of grew up in matured and became a major player certainly after the civil war or after the first World War and began to engage in multilateral trade organizations\nAnd ah he did all of those things that some of the founding fathers sort of warned against foreign entanglements I think is what they called they called it a\n... ... these sorts of\nUm games dirty wars and so forth are almost inevitable when you become entangled in in uh in other countries' business and and\nYou put yourself out there or you end up fighting wars on foreign lands so that those wars don't visit upon your own soil\nAnd yes it's it's nasty and it's dirty but one thing that the United states has I think that most other countries don't have and that is the power of redemption [noise]\nAnd I'm I'm a Canadian so I'm a bit of a neutral Oprah but I have strong emotional ties to the United states and I believe strongly in the idea of the United states and I believe in American exceptionalism it hasn't been fulfilled perhaps the way we'd like it but the United states yes\nThey they have been involved if you talk about to lend day in Chile and the overthrow the government in ... in Iran and in in the in Nineteen fifty three and in Guatemala and so forth\n[noise] this doesn't this isn't ... to the United states\nMost other countries that have the kind of a power and responsibility\nAt the United states has they do the same thing but they\nDon't reflect upon those those dark chapters in their history the way the United states does they don't talk about it on public forums they can't they're not allowed and there is no redemption\nAt least in the United states that exists\nWe reflect
