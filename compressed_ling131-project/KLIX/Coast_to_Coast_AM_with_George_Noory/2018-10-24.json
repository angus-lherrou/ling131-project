intertwined with the um paranormal\nPhenomena and and and with the the parasitic ... at least as I was\nBeginning to think that they were and so uh it's a very complex and dangerous path I think to start um ... just start down and as far as the blaming apparently for physical loan illnesses and I should point out that in the gospels there was a clear distinction made from time to time between people who are crazy and people who are possessed\nShore and ... and the division there in the idea that their leisure thanks yeah how valuable but how can we get it out of him and ... you know this

every three thirty seven hundred I'm Lewis Ulysses ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\nThat okay well I mean what has been reading my question I've had\nSeveral gas on the show\nAre talking about the way to at least\nSubdue or a I guess you could say get a demon out or forced the demon out or somehow and tell to go and we always get in and one of the things that I I really really really hate is when I watch ghost or a hunter say go to the light\nTo the light and I and I said of the centers I say you know what that's like telling someone to go to the bathroom go to the bathroom I don't want to go\nTo bathroom I don't want him to the same thing you don't tell it goes to go to like you don't tell us to go to like the stupidest thing I've ever heard don't do that okay I always laugh and say well the the light as a trap\nDon't go there the second thing is that so many people and I always get into arguments because I've had experiences investigating ghosts and investigating demons too and they always say all you gotta say quite as I review given the name of Jesus Christ and it goes away\nNo it doesn't and I've always had the argument no it doesn't because you cannot and I and I tell you that sometimes we have entities\nThat are in places that seem to be older or even pre atomic demons bitter there it somehow don't even know what we're talking about they just look at it didn't laugh\nI'm just curious is that\nI mean I I always say well that's the that's the first antibiotic to use it that doesn't work then what and and people as it always works well no it doesn't always work out can you tell me because I've been noticing to that in horror films lately they don't use Satan anymore they're using ... or vow like or\nOr can you tell me because I've been you know noticing to that in horror films lately they don't use Satan anymore they're using timing or\nVow like or as Modi is rather demons opposite view view of course was in The Exorcist they're using all these other demons and people like going well they're all Satan anyway no they're not there are there there's a hierarchy of demons even Solomon said so so what's your take on the idea that the the the whole I review human Jesus Christ\nOr antibiotic the redeeming\nWell if you believe it yeah\nYou know ... you don't just sit there like a lump climate stuff happens to you you bring something to it or whether it be a big for the spirits UFO ... whatever or possession or as as we call it now which is actually I got a voluntary bonding\nAnd uh I I agree with everything you've said\nWell I mean I I just don't see a point in bringing a priest into a Muslim household and an avid June he commanded by a Christian priest to get out of a home in a gym doesn't answer to Jesus\nAbsolutely I don't think they're the ... the same as ours at all yeah there are about nine different species of these things at least ... that we've dealt with and I think you know in the cases of eggs are systems that I assisted appraised with they were using them against us you know the\nWhole ... you know the position of authority you know the the three different ... within the ritual itself the command to give it to name a\nI think the most horrifying thing that ever happened to me was that at the time\nThey I don't like to talk about this but we're in the St Lawrence state hospital when the priest demanded that\nThe thing that we thought was possessing Barbara Seventeen year old girl a demand that or give it its name and and I told the presents I said how do you always telling the truth\nYou know as well because the U.S and it's it's a it's bound by the authority of Christ tell us a trip and uh they they send the ritual because Jesus did it twice in the gossip is a bit but this thing\nUh I didn't believe it said his name was shall\nSee age AOL I assume and had told the girl that was a guiding spirit to her and all this but and\nIn my mind I didn't say it it just in my mind I said yeah right mhm\nThe thing immediately addressed me\nIn a language that turned out to be mainly of all things and the doctor had to look it up 'cause he was recording all this I don't know where these tapes I remember that the Vatican by now but he um\n[noise] they wouldn't tell me what he said at the until the end of the school year and a father a Lawrence or the price just said he didn't feel right not telling me what that was addressed to me he said yes and the thing\nI mean I I when I was seven years old I witnessed my father's suicide and and that was something that that got me into\nIt would be interested in what happened to my father right and this thing and perfect male I said that it had been there when my father committed suicide and it had told him to do it and\nHad he had this thing spoken to me in English I Would have lost it obviously right there and and that's why they didn't want to tell me right so I Try to live with that the words of this thing\nAnd I just don't [noise] excuse me\nI just don't think these things have the same theology so they're using it against us and it got stronger as a matter of fact within three years a barber was dead of a drug\nOverdose and of of the six or seven people we ah had to deal with at that point a father Lawrence after I graduated left ahead as we exercise them again and I guess this was at times will take months and involve several praise\nIt it takes it takes a while and ah you know and the reason why I I I used to be of the you know Jesus Christ works all things a mindset which at one time I was at a a place or they were they called me in to do\nYou know Jesus Christ works all things a mindset until one time I was at a a place or they were ... they called me in to do an investigation and it was a former theater former\nA mortuary that turned into a bar they turned into a bar in the bar was haunted had all kinds of problems cream mentor him in the basement of all places it was hard it was crazy and\nUh we decided that we were going to go in and we had this room and we wanted to find out just what was going on you know what was haunting the place\nAnd one of the things that happened and is the scariest thing that's ever happened you know when you when you do say ounces or when you do things like this you always tell people one\nIf you're going to be part of the ... you can't have any alcohol at least after you're done you're going to go have whatever beer you want but don't have any alcohol don't come into the sounds drunk don't come into the say on a you know the the way you know they just under any medications because there's some definitely\nCreate a problem and we had a woman that demanded that she'd come into the stance that we were doing to try and contact whatever he was going on there\nCome to find out what happened is we had corners in the same as we had women that were standing at the corners of the same as to make sure watching everything to make sure everything was going okay no demons or anything or getting into the room where we're using a several ways several or goals to look into what was going on\nAnd all of a sudden I'm I realized something was wrong in the circle and I noticed the women in the room were buckling over you know there were doubling over in pain every woman was doubling over and pain except for\nThis one young girl who was at a table in his older woman and I was seeing what the hell's going on here all of a sudden and this is not no joke and I\nHave a a a guy named Aaron who I worked with who was doing this and he was there with me and there was another girl and say to your kid may as well she was kind of describe what we're getting from ... from other things and\nAnd uh all of a sudden this ah this demon we've found it was a demon calls itself the average suit\nAnd I realized what was it was the demon that hunts down children in the womb and kills them and I was noticing all the way we're doubling over now I realize that something was wrong and I and I told everybody to get away get out of it get out\nOf the bar they all had to evacuate we evacuated the bar come to find out there was a woman the woman demanded to be in the sale has actually had been drinking that night and we found out she was pregnant\nAnd we were furious because this was something that attracted the demon\nAnd the demon was actually a Mesopotamia demon that basically hunted down women to go into their homes and killed their children and the reason why these women were doubling over is because of the fact that whatever was going on in that room that demon was going from woman the woman to try and find that baby and the only reason why the older woman\nDidn't double over she had a hysterectomy and the other girl was not of age to be in a bar and we found that out too and so this was one of the scariest moments I ever had and it wasn't the power of Jesus I had to take it out we had the command that\nCalling upon angel after angel and even some of the names of other demons and and and just calling out we had a a medium that we had a priest there we had a number of people there and we were doing every everything we kept my poor friend air and who was working with the he was actually\nShot indoor wall and he was stuck on the wall as if he was Velcro to the wall and he had asthma\nAnd he could not breathe so we had to get 'em an inhaler and once he took a breathtaking halo he fell off the wall it was the scariest experience I ever had to that because one person violated the rules you know that's the thing is when you're doing things like this people don't realize how powerful it is and they will challenge it\nThey will challenge it by either being drunk or drug or they'll do something that they're not supposed to do and that's why we hear horror stories about ... board that's where your horror stories about turtle cards it's because people don't realize how powerful they are and they play with them as if their toys and they're not\nOr horror stories about ... board that's where your horror stories about turtle cards is because people don't realize how powerful they are and they play with them as if their toys and they're not towards its like playing with a plastic bag input overhead you'll suffocate and that's that's how I feel about that what do you say about that\nI agree a hundred percent maybe you should have done the science and the first place well yet you know\nWe knew we had to do it do because we we were the ghost investigators were there that we had\nAnd they will do the best years they're competent one we had a priest that they demand that because the problem was that the the building was having all kinds of problems I mean they had sewer backing up they had this black\n... back you up in the in the ... in the basement and they said it was this this is having to go ... what are you going to do so I organized a group of people to go in and and take care of it\nBut uh you know one of the things they did was they wanted to hold a say on and and it was very well done uh but we made sure we had to make sure that people that came in were responsible and apparently they weren't responsible we didn't take it seriously\nMy main thing\nYou can see signs of opposition in southern and young Eighteen months\nEarly intervention we make a lifetime of

the amount of influence with the Iranians were spreading a little bit on\nWhere the Israelis and the Americans to people that have a vested interest in keeping 'em the Iranians way out of Lebanon\nFred is Hezbollah as dangerous or more so than what we have known as el ...\n[noise] well George I think that's a relative or statement uh before uh Osama bin Laden came along a Hezbollah certainly had a more American and Israeli blood on their hands than\nThan any other group I Know from that time period from investigating the attacks on the u._s. embassies and the hijackings and the assassinations and\nAnd certainly the kidnapping of the CIA station chief which\nUh Georgia when you look at this from an intelligence perspective and you look back on the on the course of a kind of for some history\nOr does it never been done this was an organization that had a literally a snatched or the United states of America is number one intelligence officer assigned to the country to rebuild\nA all the intelligence operations after the uh first a U.S embassy bombing\nUh so uh this was unprecedented its time and um it it was certainly shocking for us or that it occurred uh but I'm also a a great sense of failure on our part to because\nUh I Know when we were looking for Bill Bill Buckley uh we we just simply did not have the human intelligence to be able to tell us exactly where he was so [noise] um [noise] it was one of those tragic moments in in the course of a of history that are\nCertainly a um I'll never forget and um but I Know that there was a heck of a whole heck of a lot of us that that certainly tried to find bill who certainly was an American hero\nAnd we were getting into that story you want to get your reaction to a jak Anderson article that ran in Nineteen eighty eight is Wilfrid heard what what do we say to Americans who simply say look this is in the middle east it's not here in the United states why do I have to worry about this what do you tell them\n[noise] Georgia and it's a fair question or you can only look back on the events of ah\nNine eleven and the planes flying into the twin towers and the plane that went down in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and certainly that hit the Pentagon or as an example of we have to be cognizant of the geopolitics of the region\nOr why we need a footprint\nUh in the area why we need to take the fight to the enemy a and a a take out these individuals are so they don't carry out attacks on us soil\nAnd uh that's the the critical geopolitical reason why we're doing this\nOr we're going to talk about William Buckley you're just a moment we're with red Burton Samuel Katz new book is called the babe Ruth rules next hour we'll take phone calls with them on what truly is\nA very important story that's been going on that is not to a well publicized in hopefully for a than Sam you're with your book be rules you're getting more and more exposure to what's happening\nOver there in the if you can say I'm In a couple of minutes we have before the break give us an update before we get into the book and William Buckley after the break\nGive us an update of what's happening in Syria today\nSpeaking of Hezbollah um the has the forces have been fighting from the onset alongside rainy and special\nBut I'm the Hezbollah forces have been fighting from the onset alongside\nIranian special forces to help keep 'em president off of um regime in power um Hezbollah has been transformed from an underground fourth\nI'm In the Nineteen eighties on the period we're ... and I wrote about William Buckley in the early emergence of um the fundamentalists suicide Shiite brands of terrorism and it has emerged into probably one of the stronger almost conventional armies in the middle east\nUm it is for the United states in Iraq it was um it was absolutely in a central player in helping the Shiite militias in Iraq developed there I'm ... I'm strategies and tactics that killed so many American servicemen I'm In two thousand six launched\nA I'm a horrific war against Israel where I'm laid\nSiege to a movie of indiscriminate rocket fire against Israel cities um it does involve the narco terrorism it as one of the world's largest cocaine and I'm I'm traffickers in the world and it is a force to be reckoned with\nThat we cannot ignore 'em specifically because it has its sleeper cells and operatives in this country has for many years\nAnd it is an arm and the extension of Iran was um a desire to be a regional player if not regional superpower in the middle east region of the world that is um ultra important in the U.S national interest\nAll countries of course work through straw parties we worked with some uh bin Laden and the mujahideen in Afghanistan to get the Soviets out of there giving them cash and arms and everything else so I can understand why the Iranians are doing this with Hezbollah\nBut why are we getting top with Iran over this why are we talking about sanctions why don't we just say enough stopped feeding these people stopped supplying them well we're gonna one night like why don't we do that Sam\nI I think that this country has been very apprehensive about engaging Iran militarily since\nOur hostages were seized with the U.S embassy in Tehran I'm a many many years ago I think there were um numerous um declarations of war by Iran and Hezbollah against the United states the bombing of the U.S embassy bombing of a second and to see the bombing of marine barracks\nWhich was um uh on the thirty five years ago to this day\nOut on hold on for a second sample come back to this point and we'll talk with you and Fred as well about your book Babe Ruth rules next on coast to coast to you know\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast for Burton with her Samuel Katz their book is called be rude rules Sam you were mentioning of course that the Hezbollah may have sleeper cells in the United states is that possibly one reason we haven't gone after Iran militarily and attack them because we're afraid that those cells could be activated\nNo I don't think so I think um we haven't gone after Iran militarily because we're not really sure or a direct military conflict with Iran might bring I think the Iranian you of groups like Hezbollah to export terrorism throughout the middle east\nAnd the rest of the world is daunting enough for 'em policy planners in this country for generations it was a directly responsible for a lack of response to suicide truck bombing of\nThe embassies the marine and the kidnapping of a CIA station chief\nFrom things that was unheard of in the world of espionage up until that point and ever since I'm William Buckley was the only fish is she from the CIA that was ever kidnapped and murdered in the history of the agency\nFor Burton tell us about William Buckley\nA bill was a a a true patriot Georgia he grew up in a stone I'm a Massachusetts\nAnd by the way for people just listening this is not the journalists were talking about\nNo it's not there is actually a funny side stored it to that because the other William F Buckley was also associated with the CIA and our William F Buckley actually received a few of his paychecks over the years and uh our bill thought it was very funny and a thought about a cashing them but I'm\nA bill grow up in the Boston area a salmon I were lucky enough to uh get the cooperation of bills a family has a elderly companion\nThere isn't a sister who just told us wonderful stories about a bill growing up ah\nI'm In he went off after high school into the U.S army and enlisted and went to Korea as a young kid and um where he was a silver star recipient and are\nAlso a Purple Heart I'm at which was an amazing kind of a research task or we uncovered with the first calvary division where bill first enlisted into\nWhen it comes back on the GI Bill goes to Boston University\nUm graduates or gets hooked up with the CIA or in the early fifties says it was very murky or as to exactly what he was doing at that time period and we could not find a anybody that can tell us specifically what he was up to\nA lot regardless I'm a he leaves the CIA and becomes a librarian of all things when you know\nDidn't surprise me because of ah the nature of it as a curiosity and his language is and you know ... to\nTo just I'm a study history is specially military history [noise] uh so uh in Nineteen sixty he uh he joins or the U.S army again\nA an goes under special forces are and um it was also a associated with the CIA and that time period or he was recruited by this mysterious figure by the name of girl\nUm who was in the Boston area who was a CIA spotter in recruiter and I'm Bill goes off or\nTo Vietnam and where he is also a again awarded the silver star or for courage under fire\nA so this was a man George that was always running towards danger and uh he he reminds me of the NYPD a cops and firefighters running towards the twin towers\nYou up you know you know they just did what they had to do\nIt exactly and um and and off the bill uh was uh uh the only guy to raise his hand to volunteer to go to Beirut or at the CIA uh after this devastating embassy bombing in Nineteen eighty three where the entire CIA station has wiped out so\nUm that was to Bill Buckley was a you know he was a true American Hero\nNow was his assignments bread in Bay roots clandestine war was a pretty well known by people\nWell I'm the station chief or um is usually declared towards the government meaning ah the the local Lebanese the liaison intelligence service knows exactly who he is\nA although he does have a diplomatic passport or he's known as the or the CIA officer the cheapest station\nAnd of course the other ... intelligence liaison services know that too I have such as the Jordanians the French the Israel and so forth so I'm Bill is not a and a undercover physician during that time period\nSomebody read it on you know do\nWell uh it was very difficult to operate in Beirut in that time period or\n... you know in order to do your job you have to get out and about meat sources meat snitches uh and so forth and so um you know bill was that kind of person\nAnd I'm In essence a leading his apartment one day a in Nineteen eighty four you know he's he's kidnapped these overwhelmed by a multiple vehicles are\nAnd Hezbollah grab them and um they're begins is a time in captivity\nWhy didn't you have security around there it's a good question or I can tell you a first hand from that time period a it was an unusual for station chief not\nIt's the same and I did our last book on bin ... uh where you had a whole Qadri a professional uh security personnel to specifically watch a CIA officers backs are in that time period\nAre they really didn't exist you could request security you could get a you know folks coming over to to help or maybe some assistance from the military at times but\nUh you can't really do your job is a is a secret agent to use that phrase it with an entourage so ah the nature of the job in that in that time period was ah you were a single time you were kind of like a a Lone Ranger you're out on your own\nHe was held captive for what about Nineteen months before they finally kill him\n[noise] he was kidnapped on march sixteenth Nineteen eighty four and um I was part of the hostage debriefing team where uh we were assigned to at the CIA to hunt for Bill Buckley specifically as well as the other hostages\nAnd uh we did not know bill had died um until father Martin Django came out to who was a wonderful man I spoke to him and then at the spot and Germany after he had been held in captivity\nAnd and he told his bill had died and that bill had been tortured and bill was very sick\nAnd it was one of those moments George I'm In life where um we we knew that we had failed bill and it was like the weight of the world came upon us because um we had devoted this entire operation to find him and we just couldn't find him so [noise]\nUh then it became a recovery mission you know let's try to find the body and go from there\nWell must have been like looking for a needle in a haystack for it huh\n[noise] oh my goodness George I can't tell you how how difficult it was not time period\nUm you know we had a we didn't have a lot of human assets on the ground then\nUm we we didn't have a lot of collateral intelligence of course the Israelis tried to help and and other intelligence services but\nUm it it was it was very difficult it was trying to find a person in a building or in a very barracks um and we literally could not put him in a in a neighborhood a at times so\nAre we just had the huge or intelligence gaps and it was extraordinarily frustrating uh I tell you one of the fascinating things that Sam and I turned up in the story a George was\nA at one point or the FBI believe that uh\nThrough through their source network that bill had actually been flown to Tehran a and another time actually held inside the Iranian embassy in Beirut while I'm which I'm not you certainly a smoking gun or as to who was directly behind a you know the kidnapping\nAnd Sam ... let me ask you this back in Nineteen eighty eight columnist at the time jak Anderson wrote an article about William Buckley simply saying\nHe was tortured to death and he gave up secrets or you know and I'm not up to slap the man's name by any means but where do you think of ... column accurate or not\nI I think if I'm fairly safe to assume that under torture I'm Bill Buckley are revealed information\nI'm a very classified nature I'm a station chief um he was the supervisor he was

over there or outside of Israel and look at all the American blood been spilled over there over the decades and it just seems like nothing has changed\nBut my question is uh which William Buckley this is the forgotten history that nobody you know really remembers\nBut if he gave up secrets and I don't know you know begin or not was there any trickle down collateral damage to the field officer of the ... of the CIA that were out in the field\nOr from the information that he might have given up and keep up the good work and I'll take my answer off\nThe air and got in front of give you that question [noise] sure a good\nQuestion Brian uh the answer your question is uh uh at the time or the agency the CIA um\nCould not take any more chances meaning ah in essence they they removed all of this personnel assigned to the station or got them out of a country a set up a they had to shut down or their source network or in an anticipate a the entire source chain that that had been compromised their\nUh they had to shut down safe houses are where are you meet with informants are in anticipation that perhaps bill or had disclosed that uh so uh you have that trickle down effect and there's also a damage assessment that comes into play here to\nWhere you start thinking about um you know the intelligence services exist to steal secrets and so here you have a uh the CIA the CIA point man in Lebanon\nThat have access to everything or what value is that to another intelligence service so if you're the intelligence service for example a Kenny horse trader swap with a let's say of the Russian KGB at the time [noise]\nSo those are the kinds of things that you have to anticipate and you look at it from a worst case scenario and you shut down everything so ah was ah operations compromised a [noise] a operations were certainly shutdown stopped\nA until a complete damage assessment is done to see how bad things are and then you have to restart a your entire um human collection network which is never easy\nSam what's happening delivered on today what's the situation there\nUh well I'm a Hezbollah is perhaps the most powerful political party in the country while

why do they deal with the cartels are that are in a you know South America\n[noise] um yes there is a very large Shiite\nPopulation in South America in Argentina in Columbia Venezuela I'm In a previous work that I did um [noise] um [noise] we learned that um the the government of president mature in Venezuela um had a um a a a shuttle service\nOn the Venezuelan UM Airlines traveling to

dot com Freda want to get your take on these ... situation of course and uh of course the Saudi royals lied about the case or in the beginning\nA truly was killed at the consulate butchered uh yeah I guess because of what his uh his writings were about the royal family and about Saudi Arabia\nOr but she's my gosh what's your take on that\n[noise] my goodness Georgia I can never remember another incident like that on a diplomatic a facility in the history of time\nAnd now I'm sure the Russians have possibly ah ah disposed of somebody's via similar methods so we're just not aware of just knowing how the KGB operates a\nIn this arena but ah I just uh I cannot imagine how a this operation was put put together a to actually do this or inside a diplomatic facility\nOr with all the eyes and ears that are on every diplomatic facility in the world\nAre you certainly could could have thought of a a a much better operation and and\nSo uh either it was done with a purposeful intent to resonate are all do it or how it appears that this just was a a a tremendous fiasco and uh I I certainly don't think we've seen the last of this now that curious part to George with us as\nA based on some of the research we've done here at strapped for a there appears to then a few other of Saudi princes that have disappeared too so um\nSince ... since the royal prince basically took over\nA correct or and before a this incident uh and ... both so uh this just might be part and parcel\nCorrect a and before or this incident uh and ... so\nUh this just might be part and parcel to a Saudi a outreach and covert action or to a target and eliminate a dissidents or any enemies of a of the royal family but uh\nUh it's certainly an unprecedented a mess\nBecause when he came in with his daughter base when his father basically said hey you're going to be in charge here or did he put a lot of boils away at the Ritz Carlton a in Riyadh and basically held them as hostage\nOr yes he did and you know you get back to a you know the the CIA director uh is en route or or just arrived there for meetings or\nA which is always very interesting because uh those meetings never happened in a vacuum or I Would not be surprised to see a some sort of a a effort behind the scenes to to try to make sense of what took place and and to move forward\nOr you know that's the other interesting thing and these kinds of cases George you know behind the scenes\nA you know the intelligence services just go about their business\nAnd um because you know the the world doesn't shut down with threats with liaison work and uh and the curious part there is you know the Saudis ah for all their dysfunction and chaos\nAh there's still a an intelligence provider no that that gets funneled into the to the big intelligence community\nSo uh it it certainly is a a fiasco though\nIt's like a partnership with a double isn't it\n[noise] well most relationships with governments are a long time [laughter]\nYeah

experience they they do not come out the way they went in\nA lot cheaper photos of seeing lots of kind of floating or upstairs or um uh the creatures the animals come right up to people they don't have any fear of um human same things with a with the fish\nI'm just people she just kind of strange creatures you know are walking around in the place of people have seen the styles change shape and in with the different distinct patterns over their head and\nAll kinds of very very odd stories people going in with with the um you know a terminal diseases coming out cured now the strange thing about this place is that an industry that really gets me is that uh once they started letting people in Russian journalist and there was this gentleman or who\nHad been in the army and the washed out of the army because of um\nA medical reasons he kind of bounced around in Moscow for a while and then he uh caught on as a journalist and got an assignment to go into the I'm trying to allow this guy once again he didn't go to anything like a college or anything he was basically\nSomeone who was drafted into the Russian Army and couldn't make it so he went to the ... only one on a um one of these camping expeditions for two weeks\nHas this life changing experience I came back to Moscow and suddenly as odd as this sounds suddenly he had this um he was an lightened as to pasture aerospace physics\nOr he had never studied it before but all of a sudden this came very very easily to him and within a couple of years he was the cosmonauts and he put this all he said the reason I changed was because of my time and the triangle\nSo you know a lot of people um you don't call it heaven on earth you know and just you're on the ... some of the stories and you know maybe if there is a having an earth maybe that's maybe this is it\nI bet there's enough material on those planets right twenty of these sports\nEasily yeah twenty or boy yep yep it sure is\nGoing to the phones were okay she'll join the Bronx taken away Joe getting started George how are you enjoy\nA Mac you know we're speaking about UFOs I've seen to UFOs in my life I'm hope we're circular here around this shade ones um [noise]\nUh if there is so much of this activity in the sky and it doesn't that kind of make disclosure\nIf there are so much of this activity in the sky and it doesn't that kind of make disclosure a moot point in a way\nAnd are is there something else specifically a belt either extraterrestrials or these UFOs\nThat the government those are more people to know other than that the UFOs do exist\nTaking us in the eating us\nYou know it's it's just it's this idea that ... and it's been bouncing around for years is that you know we as the you know the population of this planet\nWon't be able to handle the truth that there may be you know being some other worlds are out there and maybe visiting us I Know that will Winston Churchill during World War two somebody gave him a very detailed photograph of what they called foo fighters back down but the UFOs\nAnd he did not want that released to the public relations\nYeah that's right because he he thought of religion would fail that that was histories and all that you know law religion based you know we're based in if we find out that you know we're not dealing with in the universe\nIt put some new questions on um a lot of the major religions so you know can we not handle it I don't believe that I think they were the vast majority of people on this earth\nWant to know what's going on what we'd like to know that there are other being's out there you know it's what it wants to get it would be like the greatest stories and and all of history why they keep it from us though that's just if they know what these things are and they're keeping that uh information from us\nAnd that's that's a crime of it's not just the century but of climate history why should they know when we do\nWell you know as David Jacobs believes max or could be something very serious going on here\nCould be you know uh we had a guest on our show the other night and he was someone who uh works for the MCI yes and that in fact his office actually give story ideas to the TV show and I'm of the blue he said yeah we asked him what he thought of um just UFOs in general what you see what are you seeing as travel\nAnd and I said well you know as soon as I heard this idea of being dancing around about the space for us\nNot maybe this was something that we know you have\nWhat they got a very quickly you know for some reason that might be an affair yes ah\nThe central characters out there and live time\nLet's go to Terry in Modesto, California Hi Jerry go ahead and\nDid my height yes sixty years ago I did teletype pollen

come in some way or another with his job where some of us get very ill and blacked out apparently narrowly but not physically\nNow when you tell us so you can't tell us what you saw or you won't tell us when we\nI Can't I have no idea because I Am mentally but not to secondly\nI Can't get anyone to do research on it this is something that research is done needs to be done right time say because there are definitely I'm sure other people lots of us who were in military who Ellen Davis\nLots of us are afraid and ashamed to speak at it because the way down to every time we carry around right eye doctors lawyers every one\nBut this gentleman here that's reading a book about it I'm very proud of him\nAnd it every day can ever write stories that some of us who have blacked out and even a doctor does not know\nIn June of two thousand Fifteen and I was at ... six days while out I Walk outside and emergency room at a hospital the doctor didn't know anything apparently it was wrong ... and ... may lead to better\nSenator is just kind of a person can walk in top normal\nAnd learned these days I Hope and pray ... much\nWeight and we we talk on a radio show a lot about a recall it amnesty for veterans because we hear the stories over and over that they saw some during the military service or were told by higher officers to talk about it never to tell anybody about it and they actually say things like you know you get patch and get benefits will be you know suspended if you're\nTalking about these things I Know people my own family with all these things you know and what we would like to see is some kind of you know amnesty for these people you know they have the Pentagon say okay if anyone was threatened not to talk about UFOs\nYou have a blanket amnesty go out and talk you mentioned the tidal wave of new research that we give to do when all these veterans felt free to talk about their experiences um\nYou know maybe some day that would happen yeah who knows but we do hear that story over and over that something very odd happened to people during the military service having to do with your up close and they were basically threatened did not talking about\n[noise] you know the old men in black situation ... did you come across anything like that you work\n[noise] well you know once again just suddenly the stories you know of the fifties and sixties and you know

right after we came out with your photos and a lot of time that\nThat um after nine eleven or the reports from military pilots have UFOs went up at a dramatic way\nAnd not that you oppose had anything to do with nine eleven but the fact was was that there were just more of a military jets in the air round the clock back then to make sure it didn't happen again\nAnd therefore more military pilots up there\nMore UFOs a scene\nBut that just tells me that uh you know these things are there yeah everyone always wants to think that you oppose hide from us but they're not they're around us all the time

I'm\nUnderground Iranian proxy group\nThat was of formulating around the time of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in Nineteen eighty two um Lebanon is you know of all we split between the Sunni the Christian and the Shiite population for domination of the country\nAnd the sheer were always relegated to third class status\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy eight one of the Shiites spiritual leader of 'em was murdered in Libya and left the vacuum in the country and and that coincided with the onset of\nAyatollah Khomeini and Iran and the Iranian Revolution and they ... the uranium for a possible

that time period from investigating the attacks on the u._s. embassies and the hijackings in the assassinations and and certainly the kidnapping of the CIA station chief which\nUh Georgia when you look at this from an intelligence perspective and you look back on the on the course of a kind of parts of history\nA this has never been done this was an organization that had\nA literally a snatched or the United states of America is number one intelligence officer assigned to the country to rebuild a all the intelligence operations after the uh first a U.S embassy bombing\nUh so uh this was unprecedented its time and um it was certainly shocking for us or that it occurred\nUh but I'm also a a great sense of failure on our part to because uh I Know when we were looking for Bill Bill Buckley uh we we just simply did not have the human intelligence to be able to tell us exactly where he was so [noise]\nUm [noise] it was one of those tragic moments in in the course of a\nOf history that are\nCertainly a um I'll never forget and um but I Know that there was a ... a heck of a lot of us that that certainly tried to find bill who certainly was an American hero\n... get into that story or want to get your reaction to a jak Anderson article that ran in Nineteen eighty eight as Well Fred heard what what do we say to Americans who simply say look this is in the middle east it's not here in the United states why do I have to worry about this what do you tell them\n[noise] Georgia and it's a fair question uh you can only look back on the events of ah nine eleven and the planes flying into the twin towers and\nThe plane that went down in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and certainly that hit the Pentagon or as an example of we have to be cognizant of the geopolitics of the region or why we need a footprint\nUh in the area why we need to take the fight to the enemy a and a a take out these individuals are so they don't carry out attacks on us soil and\nUh that's the the

into probably one of the stronger almost conventional armies in the middle east\nUm is this for the United states and Iraq it was um it was absolutely in a central player in helping the Shiite militias in Iraq developed there I'm ... I'm strategies and tactics that killed so many American servicemen I'm In two thousand ... launched\nA I'm a horrific war against Israel where I'm laid siege to a movie of indiscriminate rocket fire against Israel cities um it does involve the narco terrorism it is one of the world's largest cocaine and I'm I'm traffickers in the world and it is a force to be reckoned with\nThat we cannot ignore 'em specifically because it has if we were cells and operatives in this country he has for many years\nAnd it is an arm and extension of Iran is I'm a desire to be a regional player if not regional superpower in the middle east region of the world that is um ultra important in the U.S national interest\nAll countries in the course work through straw parties we worked with will Selma bin Laden and the mujahideen in Afghanistan to get the Soviets out of there giving them cash and arms and everything else so I can understand why the Iranians are doing this with Hezbollah\nBut why are we getting talks with Iran over this why are we talking about sanctions\nWhy don't we just say enough stopped feeding these people stopped supplying them well we're going to ... why don't we do that Sam\nI think that this country has been very apprehensive about engaging Iran militarily since\nOur hostages were seized with the U.S embassy in Tehran I'm a many many years ago I think there were um numerous um declarations of war by Iran and Hezbollah against the United states the bombing of the U.S embassy bombing of a second and to see the bombing of the marine barracks\nWhich was um on the thirty five years ago to this day\nOut on hold on for a second sample come back to this point and we'll talk with you and Fred as well about your book Babe Ruth rules next on the coast to coast that you\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast for Burton with her Samuel Katz their book is called be rude rules Sam you were mentioning of course that a Hezbollah may have sleeper cells in the United states is that possibly one reason we haven't gone after Iran militarily and attack them because we're afraid that those cells could be activated\nNo I don't think so I think um we haven't gone after Iran militarily because we're not really sure or a direct military conflict with Iran might bring I think the Iranian you of groups like Hezbollah to export terrorism throughout the middle east\nAnd the rest of the world is daunting enough for 'em policy planners in this country\nFor generations it was um directly responsible for a lack of response to suicide truck bombing of empathy Murray and ... and the kidnapping of a CIA station chief\nFrom things that was unheard of in the world of espionage up until that point and ever since I'm William Buckley was the only\nStation she from the CIA that was ever kidnapped and murdered in the history of the age of ...\nFor a burden and tell us about William Buckley\n[noise] uh there was a a a true patriot Georgia he grew up in a stone I'm a Massachusetts\nAnd by the way for people just listening this is not the journalists were talking about\nNo it's not there's actually a funny Side Story to that because the other William F Buckley was also associated with the CIA I and our William F Buckley actually received a few of his paychecks over the years wrote them and uh our bill thought it was pretty funny and a thought about a cashing them but I'm\nA bill grow up in the Boston area a seminar were lucky enough to uh get the cooperation of bills or family has a elderly companion that he's lived with for many many years and a sister who just told us wonderful stories about a bill growing up uh [noise]\nUm and he went off after ...\nMe and and lifted and went to Korea as a young kid and um where he was a silver star recipient and are also a Purple Heart I'm it which was an amazing kind of a research task or\nWe uncovered with the first calvary division where bill first enlisted into\nWhen it comes back on the GI Bill goes to Boston University um graduates or gets hooked up with the CIA or in the early fifties says it was very murky or as to exactly what he was doing at that time period and we cannot find a anybody that could tell us specifically what he was up to\nA but regardless I'm a he leaves the CIA and becomes a librarian of all things when you know\nDidn't surprise me because of ah the nature of it as a curiosity and his language is ... ... to\nTo just I'm a study history is specially military history [noise] uh so uh in Nineteen sixty or he joins or the U.S army again\nOr an goes under special forces are and um and it's also a associated with the CIA and that time period or he was recruited by this mysterious figure by the name of girl\nUm who was in the Boston area who was a CIA spotter in recruiter\nAnd I'm Bill goes off or\nTo Vietnam and where he is also a again awarded the silver star or for courage under fire\nA so this was a man George that was always running towards danger and uh he he reminds me of the NYPD a cops and firefighters running towards the twin towers I don't\nKnow you know you know they just did what they had to do\nIt exactly and um and and also to build a was a uh the only guy to raise his hand to to volunteer to go to Beirut or at the CIA or after this devastating embassy bombing in Nineteen eighty three where the entire CIA station has wiped out so\nUm that was who Bill Buckley was a you know he was a true American Hero\nNow was his assignments bread in Beirut clandestine or was it pretty well known by people\nWell ah the station chief or um is usually declared towards the government meaning ah the the local Lebanese the liaison intelligence service knows exactly who he is\nA although he does have a diplomatic passport or he's known as the uh the CIA officer the cheapest station\nAnd of course the other ... intelligence liaison services know that to such as the Jordanians the French the Israel and so forth so I'm Bill is not a in a undercover position during that time period\nSomebody read it on him no doubt\nWell uh it was very difficult to operate in Bay rooted in that time period um\nIt you know in order to do your job you have to get out and about meat sources meat snitches uh and so forth and so um you know bill was that kind of person and I'm In essence are leaving his apartment one day\nA in Nineteen eighty four you know he's he's kidnapped these overwhelmed by a multiple vehicles are\nAnd Hezbollah grab them and um they're begins is a time in captivity\nWhy didn't he have security around it\n[noise] it's a good question or I can tell you a first hand from that time period a it was an unusual for station chiefs and not to have security uh salmon I did our last book on been godly or where you had a whole Qadri a professional uh security personnel too\nOf CIA officers backs are in that time period are they really didn't exist you could request security you could get a you know folks coming over to to help or maybe some assistance from the military at times but\nUh you can't really do your job is a is a secret agent to use that phrase it with an entourage so ah the nature of the job and not in that time period was a you're a single time you were kind of like a a Lone Ranger you're out on your own\nHe was held captive for water about Nineteen months before they finally kill him\n[noise] he was kidnapped on march sixteenth Nineteen eighty four and um I was part of the hostage debriefing team where uh we were assigned to at the CIA to hunt for Bill Buckley specifically as well as the other hostages\nAnd uh we did not know bill had died um until father Martin Django came out to who was a wonderful man I spoke to him in ... at the spot and Germany after he had been held in captivity\nAnd and he told his bill had died and that bill had been tortured and bill was very sick\nAnd it was one of those moments George I'm In life where um we we knew that we had failed bill and it was like the weight of the world came upon us because um we had devoted this entire operation to find him and we just couldn't find him so [noise]\nUh then it became a recovery mission you know let's try to find the body and go from there\nWell must have been like looking for a needle in a haystack for it huh\nOh my goodness George I can't tell you how how difficult it was a time period\nUm you know we had a we didn't have a lot of human assets on the ground then\nUm we we didn't have a lot of collateral intelligence of course the Israelis tried to help and and other intelligence services but um it it was it was very difficult it was trying to find a person in a building or in a very barracks\nUm and we literally could not put him in a in a neighborhood a at times so are we just had these huge or intelligence gaps and it was extraordinarily frustrating [noise] ah I tell you one of the fascinating things at salmon I turned up in the story a George was\nA at one point or the FBI believed that uh through through their source network that bill had actually been flown to Tehran a and another time actually held inside the Iranian embassy in Beirut while I'm which I'm\nNot you certainly a smoking gun or as to who was directly behind a you know the kidnapping\nAnd Sam wouldn't let me ask you this back in Nineteen eighty eight columnist at the time jak ambition wrote an article about William Buckley simply saying\nHe was tortured to death and he gave up secrets or you know and I'm not up to slap the man's name by any means but where do you think of ... column accurate or not\nI think if I'm fairly safe to assume that under torture I'm Bill Buckley are revealed information\nI'm a very classified nature I'm a station chief um he was the supervisor who

I got to tell you the dentist is not just having property it's where it is a in this course the Palestinians and the Israelis are truly want more they are because it's the holy land that's it's where\nJesus and everything else began for them and they don't want to move to Kansas City or Iowa or Nebraska or anything like that we've got the land available there's no doubt about that but it's

years after you've had the fifteenth slice of pizza I I I think what's important to understand about the Arab Israeli conflict\nIs that the expert the state department diplomats and everyone has been using a formula\nVast um you know the it'll that the Israelis and the Palestinians\nBe an end to go she ate a case like everyone else and they're missing what I Believe is a critical point and that is that the mathematical equation that they're working on is flawed as the state of Israel was um oil is created the Israelis DNA dictates\nThat the Jews never again be forced to um to do anything at the

Sammy used to ride all the horses are wrong are no good over there I thought of Israel and look at all the American blood it's been spilled over there over the decades\nAnd it just seems like nothing has changed\nBut my question is uh which William Buckley this is the forgotten the history that nobody you know really remembers\nBut if he gave up secrets in I don't know you know he did or not was there any trickle down collateral damage to the field officer of the ... of the CIA that were out in the field\nOr from the information that he might have given up a man or keep up the good work and I'll take my answer off\nThe air and got in front of give you that question [noise] sure a good\nQuestion Brian uh the answer your question is uh uh at the time or the agency the CIA um\nCould not take any more chances meaning a in essence they they removed all of this personnel assigned to the station or got them out of a country eighth up a they had to shut down or their source network a and an anticipate the entire ... chain that that had been compromised their\nUh they had to shut down safe houses are where are you meet with informants are in anticipation that perhaps bill or had disclosed that uh so uh you have that trickle down effect and there's also a damage assessment that comes into play here to\nWhere you start thinking about um you know the intelligence services exist to steal secrets and so here you have a uh the CIA the CIA point man in Lebanon\nThat has access to everything or what value is that to another intelligence service so if you're the Iranian intelligence service for example a Kenny horse trader swap with a let's say of the Russian KGB at the time [noise]\nSo those are the kinds of things that you have to anticipate and you look at it from a worst case scenario and you shut down everything so ah was ah operations compromise or\nA operations were certainly shutdown stopped a until a complete damage assessment is done to see how bad things are and then you have to restart a your entire um human collection network or which is never easy\nSam what's happening to Lebanon today what's the situation there\nUh well I'm ... perhaps the most powerful political party in the country while I'm has little has um stockpiles hundreds of thousands of rockets and missiles that aims that Israel\nHas a little of fighters are getting on on

the consulate butchered\nUh yeah I guess because of what his uh his writings were about the royal family and about Saudi Arabia [noise] uh but she's my gosh what's your take on that\n[noise] like goodness Georgia I can never remember another incident like that on a diplomatic a facility in the history of time\nAnd now I'm sure the Russians have possibly ah ah disposed of somebody's via similar methods so we're just not aware of just knowing how the KGB operates or\nIn this arena but ah I just uh I cannot imagine how a this operation was put put together a to actually do this or inside a diplomatic facility or with all the eyes and ears that are on every diplomatic facility in the world\nAre you certainly could could have thought of a a a much better operation and and\nSo uh either it was done with a purposeful intent is to resonate\nUh although it or how it appears that this just was a\nA a tremendous fiasco and uh I I certainly don't think we've seen the last of this now the curious part to George with us as a based on some of the research we've done here at strapped for a there appears to then a few other a Saudi prince lives that have disappeared too so um\nSince then since the royal prince basically took over\nA correct a and before or this incident a an ... so uh this just might be part and parcel to ah Saudi a outreach and covert action or to a target and eliminate a dissidents or any enemies of a\nOf the royal family but ah\nAh it's certainly an unprecedented a mess\nBecause when he came in with his daughter ... when his father basically said hey you're going to be in charge here or did he put a lot of memorials away at the Ritz Carlton a in Riyadh and basically held them as hostage\nOr yes he did and you know you get back to a you know the the CIA director uh is en route or or just arrived there for meetings\nIt's very interesting because uh those meetings never happened in a vacuum or I Would not be surprised to see a some sort of a a effort behind the scenes to to try to ah make sense of what took place and and to move forward\nA you know that's the other interesting thing and these kinds of cases George you know behind the scenes or you know the intelligence services just go about their business\nAnd um because you know the the world doesn't shut down with threats with liaison work and uh and the curious part there is you know the Saudis are for all their dysfunction and chaos\nAh there's still an intelligence provider no that that gets funneled into the to the big intelligence community so uh it it certainly is a a fiasco though\nIt's like a partnership with a double isn't it\n[noise] well most relationships with governments are a long time [laughter]\nYeah I'm a front side to say and it's just the nature of the business uh you know some a rock along steadily without uh any hiccups like ah with our five eyes relationships I'm not you know those don't or at times working smoothly as a as most people think\nAh because remember a you know there are no friendly intelligence services so that's the one monitor that you learn and and basic agent school\nIs a there are no friendly intelligence services and each nation state is going to operate and what they feel is the best interests of their country\nThen you're more cars Yogi apparently was the nephew of the late Saudi arms dealer Adnan ... uh there was so they you know there's been this power group within the royal family for years what what did he right that was so devastating that they want to kill him over\nWell that's the fascinating part I was talking to a couple of our ah Saudi analysts this morning here in the office and uh one of the analysts actually had a went in and watched him at a at a local speaking event\nUh this is an individual that are really wasn't that high profile uh and you probably could have lifted you know a dozen others that are more vocal against\nThe ... more well known now dead and then he was alive\nWell exactly and you know was at one of these cases where are you know you look at what the Russian what putting in the KGB did going into the u._k. and and taking out scribe Paul when ... you know the poisoning or you know\nSo uh you know do do these intelligence services see these a nation state moves like this and say well heck why can't we do this too I I mean it might boiled down to being something as simple as that\nYeah it's crazy and Fifteen people and apparently they are going to arrest most of them which is interesting because of the big are they going to rat on the person who said get this done for me and I think we all know words leading a or are they going to keep quiet and the hope that they get leniency and get out of prison in a year or two\n[noise] well when you don't want to be

is Yemen I mean it gives the United states a very ugly face and name\nAnd how can you uh how can it be said that they want peace between Israel and the Palestinians\nWhen they have this ... when they
