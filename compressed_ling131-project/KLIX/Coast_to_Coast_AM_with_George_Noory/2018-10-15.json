markets\nAre you take a moment and if you ask yourself how did I get here but it basically you know I I was just like anyone else watching History Channel Discovery Channel and you know off and on about Egypt and it was interesting but it wasn't really such a you know it wasn't really a ... in in focus\nAnd then a ... years ago I um I think somebody gave me the aligned mystery by Robert Duvall\nAnd that changed quite a bit for me that was just an amazing story um you know that the Germans were aligned with the stars and it's just that that just kind of open something up and and so I started reading a little bit more\nAnd uh and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off um and and then I said I had to you know I wanted to meet some of these people I\nStarted a you know communicating and I've met a Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise and uh and I met Robert shock or a few months later and um you know just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing um few a couple of years in\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a white papers are on his website and we're going to be discussing those ads linked tonight on the program\nAnd you can get to my news website by clicking add a coast to coast am scroll down and you will see in the paper section everything listed in the row a new is the first\nAnd so before we get to the great pyramid which is the subject of the show tonight uh you and a Robert football and Robert shock\nSat down and started discussing uh the the snakes\nAnd punished that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulbs started going off that got you involved in all of this\n[laughter] yeah well you know this is a this goes back to override mystery so I you know while I was reading things I hadn't met the two gentlemen yet the authors\nUm I I was a you know I thought to myself if\nIf an architect ah builds the three pyramids a and a line and and want it to align them with the three belt stars of or when\nThey had to be some kind of record and you know it was it causes believe that uh the architect of the great care of it the first one of the three it was you know and so I looked at the statue I started looking at the statue of you know looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove\nThat he actually conceive that that way\nAnd and so while as I looked at the statue and that was something that um was interesting there was a symbol of ...\nAnd and so while I so I looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol of a line that's on that are on the pedestal off that statue\nUm I notice it and then I just kind of put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in Croatia he gave me the uh the book the that they just have coauthored origins of the things which is an amazing book by the way it is\nYeah um and so I was reading the book and you know in Robert section he's developing a you know something that he knows the dreams the law which is you know in front of the policy of the ... between the positive things\nAnd there was a a so he was talking basically about the things in the sky and he developed that part of the book and\nAnd then I asked myself well what about this things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it um as far as we know before the rivers were built if there was a ... then it's it would have been such an amazing monument that they should have been no mention of it\nAnd that's how this came together so then I remember the statue I remembered the lion is on the pedestal\nOne thing led to another I posted something on my Facebook page Robert sawed and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know or at the um I think it was caused origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shock and we were sitting\nAt breakfast and I knew I only you know I had to get this out in less than a minute and\nIt was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out in less than a minute and we uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it this uh this could be very important and that's how that paper came about why\nIs it I Know that you listened to my opening comments tonight yeah why is it that the mother gives applied to in general but you had the great pyramid the grades things\nAre two things that dominate everything that you can see for miles\nBut he's not documented the anywhere in Egypt history where you would think well you know the ... love to write everything that he loved to go and tell their story and not only that but taxes and an accounting in season everything\nAll of their daily lives all of the stories are told except for the grades things in the great pyramid why isn't missing in history\nThat that's a it's an excellent point I um I I of course I don't know Jimmy um I I mean you know the you want to answer you could give is that maybe we just we haven't found records or the records were destroyed um but it is there is a there is a striking paucity or or maybe total absence\nUm and of course that was the problem with the things you know I thought to myself that\nIf we want to prove if we want to go into each apology territory and give them the kind of proof that they won an inscription that refers to the ... for example than ah than we have to really look we have to we have to take a good look at what we have\nAnd hope to find something and you know I think I think we found something that leads to things um [noise]\nThe pyramids we um you know when you're on ... when you buy the great pyramid there is a tool in front of the six a dynasty maybe a hundred and fifty years two hundred years\nAfter a you know who fu ...\nWas alive and if you walk into that to him to is actually a reference to the great pyramid and also to the uh in in in the two um it's called uh the whole rise of hopeful and next to it it's the um the you know the the conference grade so in in in ...\nAll the the whole rise of coup fool and next to it it's the um the you know the the ... grade so in in in the old kingdom the great pyramid was actually ... pyramid\nSo they call that cover his grade and Google's pyramid was called the whole rise of Google and so this was a priest that was a you know supervising or other priests that were on the plot so\nAnd so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct it is that is the glaring exception you don't really see too much\nYou aren't the pyramid yeah you would expect and like I said an owner's manual we don't have right but there isn't even a general reference to to point is in the direction\nAnd forget about the other something about how was builder who built into the year was built you know we still don't even understand the purpose and that it gives you all\nThe way to her auditors um you know fifth century but see now this was in doing Persian rule um two thousand years after the fact and and what it is the writing the way he describes it raises more questions than answers\nUm I mean he does get into a little bit of details you know are you saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the plateau and then the pyramid was done at Twenty years um and there were machines that were hauling up the blocks but you would think that you know just like what you just said you would think it should be a\nDetailed account of how it was done\nBut uh it's not to\nThe uh the other part of this or that is just is confusing is ... and we also have those same issues and if it wasn't for the dream style a while and the inventory Stella we may not know anything at all\nBut yes the world the dream still a is a ... you know there was a dispute or at the turn of the um twentieth century that may be tougher laws to fourth who is the author of the dream still up between the positive things\nThat he is the one to build it that was actually being debated um but uh and there is a there is a small reference to cooperate but it's it's it's broken away so there's no way you can say that um that keep it definitely does not say that he built it [noise]\nUm and so that's the dream still at the end mentors the ... the other hand is very direct it specifically states\nUm first of all it makes it very clear that when ... when I ... I mean ... I don't know some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same at the ... the Greek name coup posed the Egyptian name it's the same person so that even towards the United states very under critically would Kuiper came\nTo the ... already exist that in fact it was broken he repair it and then he built his pyramid and that was the end the pyramid of his queen Knutson\nOkay let's take a break right here will pick up when we come back where we are leaving off right now the coast to coast am murals to be church against my news said is ... and it's all the great pyramid all night long we'll be right back stay with us\nMoney to ... years moons you see is\n\nTake unlimited Katie's morning noon or night you can always know how your heart is doing cardio ... peace of mind and your pocket for only Ninety nine dollars ... visit party a dot com K. A. R. D. I. A. dot com\n[noise]\n\n\nWalking back to the coast to coast am I ... church it's the great pyramid all might be or we get to the great pyramid\nOr ... minute say Saudi and my new\nUh we were talking about the inventory style and the dream Stella right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we started to move forward\nAnd in the dream still up a tent most of the fourth says mentions and and illustrates too ... says there\nAnd desert Fox just tweeted\nIs there a second Spanx well there's two ... says there I Know that Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the second ... being in the sky I think it's actually west of the great pyramid behind it that stuff's might take\nA but is there a second ...\nA great question on so that was for that was Robert Duvall um who is interpreting the second things uh as the celestial things in other words the constellation Leo [noise]\nBut uh and you brought this up in the last interview and it's a it's a great question that's a good point um there are actually depictions of uh\nAnd that double headed sings is in the underworld and of course he's a is a ... you know a cemetery and I know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end by as things\nAnd these depictions are um you know they're on the unmistakable\nSo so the answer to this question specifically of course it hasn't been found there is there are stories uh Arab historians referred to an actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the granted was used to build mosques\nSo they're they're apparently was physical things are on the other side of the Nile but is there are things buried under the fans are that say west of a conference beer that it's possible\nThe\n... you had mentioned that a coup food shops\nSaid that he repaired the species but builds agreed pyramid there are others that have interpreted the imagery Stella is saying that he was just to repair guy\nBut he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why the discrepancy\nYeah uh let me preface it real quick um because I mentioned as he had of course ecologist most Egypt causes do not accept a in mentors dealer as a historical document\nAnd ah for various reasons and Robert shocking I recently published a paper where we countered there's arguments so we're actually saying is it is authentic and we think that it's mostly factual so I just wanted to say that but just to be fair to both sides um so it to your question\nUm they're the uh you have to go to the texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of this still out there is a strip of text\nAnd on in that text or the ... it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS and the specific symbol we discuss this last time is a symbol\nThat in Egypt she means to read it means repeat again and if you combine that symbol with the with the with the word for building which is a bad\nAh so they'll come the combination is pet him if you if you put those two together it means you're rebuilding on the other side of this still a a is a is a strip of ... where you know the pyramid building as mentioned and the the verb that that this is not further\nA qualified with this word and based on that is that I was saying\nThat the pyramid was built the temple was rebuilt um is that a hundred per cent proof no of course not and people have criticized even the you know the ... of ... that was founded in ... in the red sea\nYou know they're saying well you okay this is the ... talks about to a store and being ... a ... a a but it doesn't prove that the entire pyramid was built it could just be could have just been repaired\nAnd I have to admit that's correct I I think we can only say we can only go by what it actually states and what it actually states is that ... was being shipped to ease up of course Chris Dodd and ah who I mean it was a it means they interview you within the other day he made a good point you said that\nUh he thinks the way it was billed as that first of all the perimeter was built and then it was back failed\nAnd so that means that if you ship tour I took ... that means you were building you know some part of the perimeter or as you went up the courses and then you back so later so that means it was probably a you know part of the ...\nPerimeter or as you went up to courses and then you back so later so that means it was probably a you know part of the actual construction of the pyramid but you know I just wanted to bring up some of the issues and I just want to be even handed about it and just you know a deliver the information and then people have to make up their mind about it\nAnd there was a quite a bit of relatives or a you know pyramid like who who is dealing with uh also one of the games a plateau Rite Aid could there be a reference to one of those smaller pyramids\nThat are you oh you mean in the image oyster yes\nYes yes there is a there is a reference to a head Knutson um hit Knutson uh this is also you know a ... a contentious subject so who went to a new and so she was supposedly is queen\nAnd uh he build a pyramid for her the southern most of the three ah off the three uh queen ... on on the east field or on the eastern side of the great pyramid and um\nBut in the human Tories though it says that she was a princess and\nBased on that comment each opposes that is one of the reasons why they're rejecting to spell out because they're saying there is no evidence that they knew it was a print says so again Robert shock and I are diffusing that argument in the paper so we actually ah submit proof that gee I in fact was a princess\nOr at least that we're saying we we think is the poop shows that she was a prince says\nSo that was one of the relatives mentioned um and then do you know there's mentions of ISIS and hop or a an old Cyrus on this Stella and that those are much further reasons why she pauses reject this though because they're saying you know if this were an old kingdom story or at the time of coup who\nHe's got a you know ISIS on his eyes were not yet a work being worship there were not official states sanctions or the ...\nAnd we also you know try to diffuse that argument as well um but you know it's it's contentious I I I don't want to make it sound like we have the outs or we have all the answers perfectly locked up\nAnd there's another glaring issue here and that is all of the surroundings smaller pyramids\nAre crumbling may don't even look like they were built by the same engineers or by the same answer with the same care right and those would be more simple to build\nAnd you would you would expect those to be just as elegant if even you know more complex yeah they're not and they're the stone work is is is just awful\nYeah well that I saw the problem is of course that the ... have been a you know robbed of their stones\nAnd so what we're seeing a A R is the left over um I actually you know I was interested in that same ... you just common that you just made I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago and I went to a nuisance pyramid to see you know a little bit ... take a closer look at the craftsmanship and I was very impressed with the few casing stones that were left in place\nAnd I would say that they are in terms of uh in terms of the quality\nOr you know they're smaller size but in terms of the quality I didn't really think that there's any difference to uh the casing stones around the great pyramid um so I but I think the core yes it looks pretty dilapidated uh and of course the pyramids after the old King I'm\nI'm a you know middle ... most of them are falling apart so you know you're absolutely correct the the\nThe workman ship definitely declined um after the old kingdom\nNow let's get to what happened last year which was the big news about this new chamber\nAnd now let's get to or what happened last year which was the big news about this new chamber above the grand gallery\nYes after we had been told over and over again and it it hasn't stopped that there is nothing to find inside of the great pyramid there's nothing there\nWell clearly that is not the case there is something above the grand gallery what it is we do not know but wouldn't have\nTo drill holes you didn't have to you know like a forest they used dynamite sticks to blow themselves into these monuments which was awful\nAnd nowadays uh it's kind of like the pyramid is telling us\nYou know you wait until you have the technology to\nTo find out about me or without destroying me and I think now we're getting to that point\nGetting easy to read a report that to you every month you can log into your site

I'm going to get to the top down from the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding for quite a while to speak with you my new let's go to Barry in South Carolina Barry welcome back to coast\nEl Al ... and you know what I'm getting ready to say yeah man\nYeah go ahead Barry it's yours\nGo back ... Kathy\nYou like that my news you liked that area [laughter] okay I\nAm a day or I always love here is that all that it may have more do you place great for me to keep it up now\nAnd thank you bury what do you have for a minute tonight\nOh I've got two questions and then I've got a great little short green quick ... about um a town just sit there and help out\nThe first question is who is credited with Jimmy ... or the deciphering\nAnd learning to read hieroglyphics and then the second question is all the Howard graphics around go make repairs in Egypt in that area of the world the same however good things that are found in the pyramids of Mexico central and south ...\n... is the ... so the question is how are you asking if there are a hero cliff cliff again scriptures in Beckley ... is that what you're asking\nOh no I'm asking are all the hieroglyphics that are written all the ... and Egypt on ... and so forth and go back like that the all the same Ira Glass fix that are found on the air is in Mexico and central and South America\nAh okay I understand I'm not I don't think so they are there different higher there are different ... and it's interesting you I've seen this question because you are you are basically giving a conclusion that I'm investigating as we speak you are saying that they're here lipic inscriptions\nIn Quebec you can't be in other words you're implying there is a there is there is writing there\nAnd um and I am currently looking into that I think you might be onto something\nNow there is I'm going to say one thing let me jump in Barry okay although I'm not an archaeologist and I don't have any fancy degrees after my name\nRight but there are certain things that are are in not only under stones at at go Beckley tabby but also in Egypt and tend to repeat around the world with different cultures are they the same I don't know there is an H on the belts\nThat uh it looks very similar to the age blocks in ... are are they related I don't know\nThat there are some astrological signs in Beckley tabby\nOr they are they representing the zodiac uh that uh we're in then Darrow\nAnd throughout Egypt and throughout the rest of the world after that are they the same I don't know but uh go back lead happy being that old\nCertainly is indicating that they were the first than it is the oldest is at the same language and then that no I I don't think so but the the zodiac symbols and some of the other symbolic she liked the\nI call it the army's age on the bells and lose when that looks like but did that\nSome of the other symbolic chief Mike I call it the army's age on the bells and then when it looks like they did that he met ages repeated a\nThere's a very exciting possibility um regarding that question that they're asking go back to Debbie I'm ... and it's regarding the simple that you mentioned Jimmy there's a very exciting possibility but I Can't prove it yet but I probably I might be able to prove that so and then we'll let you when we'll let everybody know\nWhen you do right here on coast to coast oh there was one other uh one other point that I wanted to make about a ... a go Beckley happy and it just got away from me very it was right there but it just disappeared\nI mentioned it later on in the show thank you very no problem I throw a absolutely and uh the phone lines Manu I expected this or are completely jammed up let's get in one more call them on all of them yeah let's let's go to\nThis is what's going to go to my dad in New York my uh Europe next\nYes good morning gentlemen and ... and now new\nI guess I have a two part Christ and I like to know if he um had looked at any of the pope highways such as that the pilots of any age and I\nAnd I'm also I think that might be the one that deals with the founding medical knowledge that they have that if if I'm correct on that particular one the second part and I'll listen over there and\nIs whether he and and and Rob it and and shock ... had can sit at some of the um the African African American scholars\nWho studied the net net net too at a which is the name of the the language which is is is still out of that that meant doing that to a phrase itself deals with the sacred and whether he looked at\nPeople who call themselves a huge cabinet for instead of the ditch and you know a before they that Greeks gay men and consider themselves that they can that college is committed when we got word from for chemistry\nAnd also um [noise] the what you call this thing was that was the word that degree Scott came up with and to me\nWhat they define with the little is not what it is and the African American the guy was that I'm thinking of they call it a little odd that horizon so they use that turns her real saw said if you follow him on my question and I'll listen off the air\nThank you mad great okay three questions and my new I'm going to get to them but that just goes to show you the the extent of knowledge here with the coast audience or they don't play around uh uh\nThe first question um I I I Am all I have heard of the ... but the the one that I have looked at more specifically regarding medical information is the ... actually in my book um because on the reverse of the eagles PR piracy there is an interesting calendar\nOr that's fixed Egypt colleges and I think\nUm I found a solution to a this calendar and that's described in the book\nUm and and yes it's a this was in ... so the medical knowledge just incredible we're talking about it for pirates that's I think over sixty foot long ah it describing seven hundred at these different seven hundred different ailments and their remedies\nRenowned university if you answered yes to any of these questions Arizona State university is the perfect school

of not only chambers inside of the great pyramid but his formula in his white paper they published last week and how to locate them and I want to say really quick Manu that Twitter I expected this uh is is going a bit nuts right now\nAnd you can follow me on Twitter at a ... church radio and post your questions or comments about Tonight Show either of for me or my new right there and this question just came in before we get to a a page out three twenty eight of of of this report\nA minute this is the question this is from ... Kim\nShe says is it true that the measurements of the great pyramid or possibly coordinates and that does coordinate point to somewhere um in in the past that they believe are coordinates to have in\nHeaven yes um I I don't know what to propose\nGreat to see this is this is what I really enjoy a about the coast audience and and I guess like yourself there is so much information out there but there's also the lack of information and we are trying to figure out the great mystery of of of the pyramid\nYeah and this is one of those questions where the math of the of the great pyramid\nHas revealed so many different not only a\nA mathematical equations but number\nHere amid has revealed so many different not only a\nA mathematical equations but numbers that are beyond coincidence and they are they're all over the great pyramid\nI have I have one piece of information that might be interesting to the listener um there isn't a good friend of mine and author Alison green who is look he's a Shakespeare expert and he has been able to connect uh the uh the title page of the ... Shakespeare sonnet\nTo the coordinates or not to heaven but uh of course Allen might say it is ever write a ... to the coordinates of the great pyramid and specifically ah the the coordinate Thad Allen is discovered\nA fall right next to the ... which is next for the great pyramid\nAllen's work is some of the most groundbreaking game changing work out there I'm going to have him on coast a a very soon probably next month\nAnd is you're absolutely right in the title page of the sonnets with a Shakespeare and his work Alan Greenspan work at deciphering that page and ... what is revealed\nIs I have never been as freaked out as I was uh when I saw his presentation with that and interviewed him about it\nIt is absolutely incredible and we'll have Marcos next month or no case so now as the the top half of the pyramid yes as you said at the beginning of the show let's get to this it's a page number three twenty eight everybody in the ... the the ... report PDF\nThe top half you had said at the beginning of the show possibly six to eight additional chambers where we had been told there are none\nRight right and so um you know when we talked about a I'm a ... Rudolph got to break last time a Jimmy um remember we're talking about the queen of the southern shaft of the queen chamber and there is something that I forgot to mention she was so what guns and bring a found\nIs when you get to guns and brings door\nUh just before the the the floor off the off the off the canal drops suddenly it's there's a depression and the way he isn't ... one of the two ways he interpreted that is that must be a space\nThat allow that forward to cave in slightly so that that's what he proposed in Nineteen Ninety three and if I look at the um you know these courses that we've just been discussing is a good possibility that that that he is right there is probably a space that made that came in\nAnd that might correlate with or if I go back to three twenty six will quick\nThat could correlate with of course that's marked with ten twenty fifth [noise] um and and then they go and so you know so there's some there is evidence that there are spaces and uh this particular space not been a detected by me ...\nMe now the row let's let's let's get to this first second and the\nUh the audience is going to look at the numbers that you have more presented here which is a starting at ... eighty four which is a shaft\nUm and uh it is going up words every body of one o seven a and I'm looking at it here as it continues a these are rose layers of the\nConstruction that have a different size in a different thickness on these roads right\nThe construction that have a different sides of the different thickness on these roads right\nRight right yeah and and in this graphic or you know one of these canals as the show and going all the way to the surface and that's incorrect so I just use this illustration is is an old illustration um so that if that particular chef did not go to the surface of the wall\nBut yes so we have all the different courses that have round fractions of twenty fifth in in terms of the surface area ratio\nAnd um and by ah by the rules that you know I Am basically establishing in the lower part of the pyramid I'm proposing that every single one of these courses is associated with the ceiling in other words\nThere is a space at designed space not not you know an accidental space\nAnd designed space that correlates with each one of these particular courses\nNo you just got back from Egypt yes we have to discuss the ongoing moves on a project their wage uh did help them find this cavities is new chamber above the grand gallery\nYou describe what you saw in the grand gallery well when you were there\nRight so I saw new detectors being placed um I at this time in a different location than last time so last time the detectors were placed inside the queen chamber and this time it's very obvious you walk up to a grand gallery to the king chamber and there are I think twenty seven twenty eight boxes\nAnd I kind of knew their detectors but I asked to confirm and there was confirmed as the scanning\nNow for the audience tell them what the new on detectors actually do where do they used for\nBy so these are particles that are created in the stratosphere so when a cosmic radiation hits the atmosphere a particle called him yuan has created enemy on is a negative charge like an electron um uh but it is a is a bit heavier\nAh than electron but it can pass through solid matter it's travels at the speed of light it's lifetime is just over two seconds\nI'm and but it can penetrate through solid objects\nAnd so because of those properties you can use it just like an X ray and you know you take an extra person you can see the bones you can see somebody organs\nAnd in this case you can basically quote unquote X ray to pyramid you put the detectors below where you think there is something and then uh it showed ... then you have a chance\nTo see a space or because the yarns will travel more rapidly through open air then you know through solid stolen so if you have a space in the pathway of what you're what you're looking for than those nuance will arrive more rapidly and they and more often will arrive and you will be able to see that on the detector\nWould these detectors placed in the grand gallery could they be used to find the [noise] the chambers that you were proposing in the upper half of the pyramid\nHere it is possible um I think the reason why they're doing that is because they got criticized by an Egypt colleges are that the data maybe artifact tool\nAnd I think they using this angle to confirm that the big void is real what it is possible to your point that in that in that particular field of\nToday during a disaster you may not be able to stay in touch with your family or friends as easily as you think\nAnd it's not always as simple as using your cell phone that's why now is the time to take action\n...

published last week\nThat seems to show up formula for finding new chambers in the great pyramid more beer phone calls him more with ... knew when we come back after this short break this has coast to coast am [noise]\nYes so there is that there is a space or in inside the head of the things and it's been a basically locked up there's a there's a little hatch and I'm I'm I think Robert a bow vow I was telling me about\nBasically locked up there's a there's a little hatch and I'm I'm I think Roberts ah ... was telling me about this I think uh you can there's you can't stand in there it's maybe six foot deep\nI'm but I'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is it's basically a blind LBJ but um but you know maybe there's some maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that\nUm I can tell you that the uh you know the world to ... um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth charted under this thing's a and this was published in the thirties by a chronic a person that was chronicling the court will seclusion\nAnd he has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nUm there is a a there's another line pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves\nOr into the things that are looking for chambers and then you know the one that you just mentioned of course we know from seismic analysis that they are here to our space is under this things\nAnd one of those spaces specifically which is what Robert truck or a was studying uh years ago um he's has a regular uh has corners and has seems to have a man made sort of features and we think that um they might be something in it that's of interest\nYou know he did the seismic research there and both of you are looking to go back with another research expedition to bleed room right\nYeah yeah first well what we are what we would like to do first is to map this again with a you know a little bit more advanced uh five small graffiti and maybe electric conductivity studies and to really get a very detailed look\nEspecially the depth Jimmy that was the problem or you know if you if you remember there was a Japanese Group that came in eighty seven and ... and did exactly the same experiment and they saw space about two meters\nA deep and uh and and then Roberts ah you know if his studies ... a couple of years later and Robert is estimating that this phase is five meters deep so\nWe have a little bit of a death problem and then of course you know that's I have a Boston Market leaner drilled in that area but we think that they missed it uh and I mean they are they the the drill angle was too shallow and they were too far west from where we think the chamber is so\nThey didn't really uh you know they didn't really use a good map\nTo guide them in of course they had other reasons why they were drilling so what we want to do is you know just like a you know just like a radiologist you know the first one to do a non evasive study and really find map the space\nAnd we'll be having a good idea where it is then with permission of course then we'll try a small probe into that space and see what's in it\nHow amazing would it be to finally located that hall of records that you know Edgar Casey is talk to about ... and there's there's there's there's rumors going around yeah for quite a while it would just be great to finally a witness to bed wouldn't\nAbsolutely we think that if we think there's a possibility that this chamber is filled with water and in fact when I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago um I was standing in front of the valley temple and thinks temple and there was a little depression and it's wet um you can just you can just see the the water coming up and\nIf if that is groundwater than it is in that chamber and so you know if if let's say if we find a chamber or the very first thing we have to do is to\nA very slowly and meticulously drained a water out\nAmber or the very first thing we have to do is to\nA very slowly and meticulously drained a water out and rescue whatever it might be inside um you know sufficient enough itself becomes a very difficult project but it's doable Robert thinks it's a it's doable you just have to do it really slowly speaking\nOf those things tissues came in on Twitter this is from Baldwin is uh\nOn Twitter and I have heard that this things may have been a woman's face and that it was changed and that is why it's head is too small for words body\nYes well if we think we think it was a female lie and so that part is partially we agree with that yes\nI don't think it was a person's head so um but we think that was a lie in this there before and the head of the line as was weak carved into a what we see today\nNow um I Know that you tend to be a little reticent to talk about alien jury tee when it comes to geese\nI leave all doors open myself but this comes in from Lucy in winter and and and this is I'm just gonna have to read this directly as in Egypt Janine images it seems like all of the pyramids in Mexico\nHave an alien in this space craft depicted somewhere any comments\n[noise] yeah I I Know I I remember reading this long time ago and I've found myself in agreement with that uh\nThat's one way you could read it I you know I think I was ... data can invite that originally the history she's talking about the ... yeah or the right the lid off the ... or ... or ... right I have\nHave that's our topic is in my studio in the long hair\nAnd I have a reproduction of it hanging on the wall but and I stop and I look at that my new and I don't have any other way to look at that ... for the controls hand controls an oxygen mask and it's lame coming out of a a rocket motor on the bottom\nI you know I don't have any problem with that I I think this is a this is one way you can explain it and everything is in this day and age everything is on cable you just said we're going to Mars\nAre the odds that there is in Tel I I Know somebody recently published an article saying that there may not be intelligent life out there but I think uh I think there is it's a very likely\nAnd especially the physics of of a of the universe you know the holographic universe I don't know if people are following this\nBut it you know this one way that you can explain everything as a projection and if that's the case a dentist like Robert Duvall proposed in Cosby gloom is one way you can explain a some of these contacts is there may be a message that gets broadcasts across the universe through you know through um\nAh through a quantum fields\nAnd that message ends up on our end somehow it causes someone to do something that they otherwise wouldn't have like you know design a pyramid um I think it's possible I I think it's on the table I'm not going to close my mind to it is\nBut we have to have some proof I I I mean I'm I'm not going to embrace a theory like that until I see from solid proof of it but I think it's on the table\nLet's go to the international line or a Robin Vancouver Rob really quick before we can break what do you have for a minute\nOr absolute under speaker does really critically a notion struck me when your doctor of structured space who's a ... couple of quick jumps and laundered looking at the idea of uh\nWhen you talked about structured space is a look or make a couple of quick jumps in larger\nLooking at the idea of a Greek scare the architect terminal attribute ... super big jump starting to Templar is a farming old knowledge building big golf ... structures\nUh who's to say I mean you could do you know I guess people assume that the the ... the ah periods are solid\nBecause you know maybe just maybe you're safe structured spaces be actually filled with voids you've ordered rocks and everything you know arches inside big cavities but hemp all\nYeah Rob go look at a news research paper on his website and and read through it that's a ... actually the conclusions are that by news presenting in this paper my new we mentioned already six to eight and boy could there be more\nYeah so I I have to you know I've been a neat I have to mention shop here will do so he of course proposed an internal ramp years ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book\nAnd he proposed this is the these are just ticks basis basically to get the stores up the pure of it and this cat from last year business show it but I think the theory is all that I think it's possible that the scanner was not sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that this that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I'm seeing that could be theological and shop you dealt with probably disagree with me\nOr you know he reviewed the paper a but he still thinks it's possible that there were logistical spaces in it but you know beat out of it may so we agree\nThere are probably space is up there and um I just want to ask you a quick uh because the pyramid of cool pool\nIt's is it hot spaces inside researches in his sixties wet to offer his fear of it because they thought it kept how can it be that we have all these spaces inside you know corporate pyramid buddy ... pyramid all we have is built on each chamber\nWell let me jump

that uh my new gardening beaten in Egypt\nUm yeah I well first of all I I Want to recommend an author to you a merry I'm\nA David roles so he's a he's really done some excellent work on\nA ... a basically tracing biblical stories back to Egypt\nUm and so you may find some answers or you know with him so I think he's producing a television series and he's with books about it um those are great documentary a couple of years ago by I think in the holy if I remember this correctly um\nBut yeah I think it's an interesting subject I think uh I think the uh the early ... um what they were in Egypt\nThere is for specially Joseph I'm that's what the role is describing Joseph real figure and a live in a in a in a place called a virus which is in the delta and had a palace and was that was basically a\nA N tuned in a pyramid and he was such an important official at the court\nAnd I'm a and then all of a sudden I'm you know this virus community disappears and this is archaeological evidence and well piece together\nUm and David role is basically saying that ah where are you worried historians got it wrong is that they they were looking for the biblical story in a\nIn the new kingdom and if it David role is finding that it was probably a couple of centuries earlier\nThis or just came in on Twitter this is from Jay Z and she says I heard that surgeon tools for found indeed ... pyramids that doctors use now true or false\nUm I well what was found is that a is a a tool that looks like a ... a like a smaller scale like a fish tell\n'em what on I I'm not sure that was a surgeon's tool but of course we don't know um it was found in the I think it was in the northern ... a shaft of the queen chamber by a ... Dickson\nUm and he uh ended snow in the British Museum a with a with a ... with a granted ball um but whether or not that was a surgery to and other than that I don't know of any surgical tools found inside of the ...\nLet's go to bill up in Oregon bill you're up next time goes out to my new\nName on there Hi Jimmy yeah this is the really academic discussion tonight and I've got nothing you know nothing against that I congratulate you on your discovery\nBut my question is um okay so I'm just once you speculate a little bit\nIf these chambers or for construction in engineering could they be like for instance for architects to put gold on the Internet\nOr could um if their theological could be you know some sort of burial chambers for for those are the king wanted to proceed him into the um afterlife yeah great question decorating question bill\nI'm Glad I'm Glad you asked that because I Will speculate now I I'm I'm looking forward to ... I think because there is obviously I'm proposing up to ten chambers I was thinking well what if it's the logical what could that be and I think the answer is the end that\nSo in ... ah the ah the ... was known for the center of the worship of the nine major God this kind of like the pantheon of of the ancient Egyptians\nAnd I think ah these chambers are dedicated to each one of these deities and and the one that's dedicated to sauce is the one that is the crucial chamber\nOr wherever we may find the kind of things that you just mentioned are but I'm suspecting there could be ... and there are with inscriptions I'm so that would be very exciting if that if we're if that were ever to be found\nUm but I think it's along the lines of that and if it's a logistical then I'm all I think I'm with John P o do I think this it's still on the table that there may have been spaces there that help the workers to pull up the stones or to the top it's possible\nUm and we'll just have to wait for the next scan I think the next county will give us some new information\nNow I have heard some rumors minute that they have already got inside of the new chamber above the grand gallery\nAnd there and they will be on display when the new grand museum opens next month\nYeah I I I'm not I haven't heard those rumors but um I Am a I wouldn't be all I wouldn't be completely surprised let's split it that way\nIt would certainly help the tourism I mean it ... the less right\nWhich has dropped off I Am heard you know you just got back from Egypt\nWhere I Am heard from so many friends that have been going to Egypt for decades and that you can as a tourist because ... years past it was crowded all the buses were there you had to wait in line and there was a you know thousands of people on the use of plateau\nBut today you can ... virtually be the only person there\nYeah that I had there was a couple of days when I felt like that Jimmy I um you know it was not\nThere were there are parts of think he's a plug toll where I was the only person walking around besides the guards and the camel riders\nSo yeah tourism has been down and they um you know they want to build a new museum and uh and of course they have to if they discover something they are they're going to show it to the world so that people come and look at it I that's why I'm hopeful that if they have something that they haven't shown us yet that we'll we'll find out about\nThis uh this is from Twitter this is from David I Love this question actually did the Nazis research Egyptian areas as depicted in the raiders of

walk [noise] ah [noise] yeah there's a there's an opening yes um yeah I I take it that within the past year then you ... have a renewal of about a half dozen walk I had a\nWhole back by the tail walk by the tail end yeah yes\nYeah it wasn't an organized or the south side\nThe ladder get over it and you have any comments like we're looking for hidden chambers that obviously we've already found them right there when we get to know what's inside\nYeah he's talking about the south side of the rear of the things\nThis ... I see the south side yes\nUm there is\nA robber so Robert scan did show on both sides if I remember this correctly or there were spaces under under the flanks of the things which were extending backwards yes um\nAnd ah\nBut I mean I have no ... I don't know you know if when it when a antiquities goes and investigate those things and they're all published that data you know there's no way for me to know what they found\nUm you know so your guess is a good mind but I Am based on a base on to the chamber under the left paw that we think exists and we think it's a manmade chamber\nI Am pretty sure that's not a blind chamber I think that chamber may just be the entry all to something that goes further back you know um and so yeah I'm with you I think uh I think uh there's more more than than we know and maybe they know it and they haven't published it\nJ widen or ... told me that he was down in that very same area\nAnd he's walking around he was alone and there was nobody around him so he goes to the back of a those things in the south side by the tail and he looks down on the ground and he sees what he thinks is a piece of wood covered with dirt\nYeah so he he leads over grabs would picks it up and it's a a piece of plywood\nAnd he'd lifted up and looked and it was an entry way it was a tunnel going straight down and as he was looking into the whole a guard came up and yelled at him he dropped the wood and he was escorted out of there\nYeah and he's a Jimmy I'm here to tell you I no matter what I personally lifted up a piece of wood and looked into a tunnel underneath the south side\nThat's like by the scale of this things and he saw himself but yet they'll say that it doesn't exist but he saw with his own eyes\nYeah I I don't have any doubts about ah the ... the I think that there is there's the ours bases under this things the main question is does it go anywhere or there's just a blind polish that's the main question\nWell you brought up something else too about I'm Andrew\nCollins now his his that is one of the craziest videos I've ever seen I mean it it is nerve wracking and if you've got claustrophobia in any way you watch that video and you almost can't get through it but he did find a a tunnel\nA that started in the north west corner where the bird uh two was ... and he finds a hole in the back of one of the tunes are for these birds that were there\nAnd it it it turned out to be hundreds and hundreds of feet long been stretched out and appeared to continue underneath the pyramid complex there wasn't supposed to be anything there then he high was who I denied that there were any tunnels there\nLater went on to his own expedition and film crew and went into the tunnel complex which again was supposed to exist but it does\nBut there's also a potential pathway from the ... or from the uh the Cyrus shaft um you know that's I I don't know if it was ever explored but I Know Robert was down there ... was down there filming and it was actually a documentary years ago\nI'm In you know he was really excited about the shaft um of course Egypt colleges are telling us that these are you know late period shops and these are not from they don't dare to the old kingdom\nUm but you know I'm not so sure it might be that the upper ... the I'm Talking about the specifically I'm Talking about the old Cyrus chef it's possible that the upper two layers are laid kingdom but the the lower level is much older we we don't we I don't think we know for sure\nAnd it may connect um but yeah without a probing um nowadays we have the technology to pro very small spaces um but yeah and until we get the data we just don't know\nYeah you're talking about the two of us iris\nYeah the to write the axis is on the south side of the ... of conflict causeway\nUh and then that's how you and then you go under it and then uh it's three layers or or ... three levels rather\nAnd the lowest one is the one where you had this our topic is submerged in water and the surrounding the base and that sort of the shape of the era glove for a house I'm a and a and you know they had this conference inside and and the the four pillars around and it was fascinating\nUm you know this ah the some the symbolism of it but the dating of it I I'm I'm a I'm a little bit doubtful about the official story\nWell he went down almost a hundred feet and the and the Hitler's that were surrounding the area where there is our topic is again underwater or those four pillars had fallen over but it was something that was also supposed to exist on the key supply into and there was\nThat's right and so any inventories the ... you know we talked about it earlier there are so Robert and I think they're the uh the the the MIT dimension of the house of Cyrus\nOr on the inventories steal it actually may be referring to\nHave two that are ... or Cyrus shop we think it's possible that it's referring to that or Campbell's too now my cleaner is saying that Congress to them is a late period to belonging to a no official called um ...\nRemember the name but again this is the same issue you know how do we know for sure that that wasn't a an older to him and then it was being intruded on\nYou know we I don't think we know\nThe ... before we had to the break ... ... how much do you think is still love to be discovered on the gays applied to there's an awful lot of sand there\nYeah but well my my favorite place to look at it and and of course Robert Robert favorite place to look would be a besides the you know a besides the left paw is in front of the two temples if we could dig deep in front of the temple is you know where people nowadays uh watch the light show\nA there could be the actual entry to this passage\nThat we think is out of the things that could be in front of the things temple and then the other thing is we I predict inanimate towards the a paper we're predicting\nThat there may have been also a temple or east of the valley temple a and that it was dedicated to Cyrus and that would be also underground so that would be one of my favorite places and then you mentioned as things on the other side is there's things on the west side\nYou know of course if that's a great place to look a is there another things maybe those three places will be my favorite places to go\nWhen you look at when I find the the most intriguing about the gays applied to of course everything facing west and pacing the Nile uh there's there's a lot there had been for reasons with the causeway and the entrances and so forth but\nWhen you look at the original survey maps that were done in the Eighteen hundreds of the gays applied to there is an awful lot of that is being ... the uh the pyramid complex facing\nA west in northwest there's a lot there and\nUh not only were the tunnels represented all the way back into the uh early Eighteen hundreds but there is a construction that is represented in those original survey maps there really hasn't been explored sense\nYeah yeah that's right that's right there there there are some places in Egypt that cannot be export because there are military zones or you know for example the the northern a pyramid of his ally yet or are we on a you know this is an incredible amazing place\nOr with a huge trends and this Oval Office placement\nUm but there's nothing nothing going on since the sixties because it's a military zone so yeah I mean to your point in the in the west field way out and I do notice for a fact I don't know if this is a military zone right now but you know some areas are basically off limits and yet their secrets hiding under the fat and potentially\nAnd who knows where we are going to be able to on earth them\nWe'll be right back this coast to coast am stay with us\nUm [noise] I'm\nNever missed a detail issue

five electricity and you may know all that's already happened and maybe we're done that\nI've heard the theories yes um especially you know the electricity theory I've heard about that of course at gr Casey\nEnergy the tell your occurrence earth currents denial is rerouted it did route are adjacent to the pyramid or under the pyramid and the uh the purpose of it was to generate a electricity\nWell Larry let me ask you a question as sort of you asking my new a question are you reading if I can answer to cure absolutely\nIn the uh you know and Christopher done and others have talked about ah the pyramid being a machine and possibly a generator a power and energy on that is the case Larry what would they have used it for\n... to ... to provide a labor free energy\nYeah you know wind and Larry thank you for the phone call my new that's exactly what a Christopher done\nAs said to me last week while he's talked about it for years of course is um it wasn't a big revelation with me but that it was energy for the for the people of Cairo in Egypt\nYeah you know you know what I really love about Christopher done this that he\nHe looks at the observations and he puts it into a model that is a completely uncovered by prejudices and biases\nHe just fits all the observations into a model and that is ... you know if I if I were doing the investigation he'd be the first call to have them on board um you know so I yeah I he's amazing absolutely I I Love the interview and I've read has worked before and very impressive person\nYou know so I yeah I he's amazing ah absolutely I I Love the

years ago\nIt made national news twice that they found some artifact and that they may have found Cleopatra him and it was underground oh did you hear anything about that\nThough I as long as I Know it's I I I haven't looked into this in detail as far as I Know a tomb is not discovered but you know maybe it has been discovered and it's not published as possible\nA move is your second question Carol\nAh without being in archaeology is how do you go about getting involved with one of their research grants\nYeah that's a great question so yeah I have to I Want to make sure I explained to every one so I'm not an archaeologist I'm also not a credential Egypt calls is this is for me it started as a hobby and all of course it's a serious endeavor\nOr you have to be associated with an Institute a research place or university which I Am now I Am a you know association affiliated with Boston University\nUm and so then you can apply for permits and you have to you know you have to do the application you have is\nA they have to review the application and they may say no and you don't have a recourse um you know so we'll have to see if they allow us but if it's not me it's okay or somebody else you know my my I think you know I wanted to get the information out there are other people can see it other researchers\nAnd they might be able to get a permit to investigate further and that's okay with me\nYou should do the same thing Carol are you researching on your own now\nI'm just interested in what they found and I was curious why nothing out there than that of that and that that made national news you twice\nYeah and and Carol or one of the things that that I like to do and I encourage others is blog right research and and and publish and self publish yourself\nAnd and continue because once you start to do that because I Do it myself and it's certainly so does my new that others out there\nAre attracted to you and they will find your information and then they

this planet\nAnd everyone on it it's the great pyramid of Egypt you don't have to look any further it is the gift that keeps on giving the great pyramid\nIs forty two stories tall it sits on over Thirteen acres of perfectly leveled rock\nPointing exactly at true north of south east and west and it's been looking at us for almost five thousand years allegedly and yet we know nothing about it\nA few short decades after Cleopatra's rain as pharaoh any knowledge of the great pyramid and Egyptian history\nWas forgotten and it seemed that everything just died with her\nNobody knew how to read Hi Howard lipsticks nobody knew how to speak the language or to be honest they didn't know anything about anything and it all happen virtually overnight travelers explorers they would travel to Cairo and they look across the Nile and say\nYou know I'm I'm using air quotes here right wow that's amazing what is that\nYou know and the answer air quotes\nWe don't know you know but it's really big [laughter] that's that's hit it took nearly Eighteen\nAre you take a moment and if you ask yourself how did I get here but it basically you know I I was just like anyone else watching History Channel Discovery Channel and you know off and on about Egypt and it was interesting but it wasn't really such a you know it wasn't really a ... and focus\nAnd then a ... years ago I um I think somebody gave me the vine mystery by Robert Duvall\nAnd that changed quite a bit for me that was just an amazing story um you know that the pyramids were aligned with the stars and it's just that that just kind of open something up and and so I started reading a little bit more\nAnd uh and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off um and and then I said I had to you know I I wanted to meet some of these people I\nStarted a you know communicating and I've met a Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise and uh and I met Robert shark or a few months later and um you know it's just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing um a few a couple of years\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a white papers are on his website and we're going to be discussing those ads linked to night on the program\nAnd you can get to my news website by clicking add a coast to coast damn scroll down and you will see in the paper section everything listed in the

snakes\nAnd published that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulbs started going off that got you involved in all of this\n[laughter] yeah well you know this is a this goes back to override mystery so I you know while I was reading things I hadn't met the two gentlemen yet the authors\nUm I I was a you know I thought to myself if\nIf an architect ah builds the three pyramids a and a line and and wanted to align them with a three belt stars of her life and\nThey had to be some kind of record and you know it was it just causes believe that uh the architect of the great care of it the first one of the three with him you know and so I looked at the statue I started looking at the statue of email and looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue\nThat uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceded that way\nAnd and so while as I looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol of a line that's on that are on the pedestal of this\nI looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol of a line that's on that are on the pedestal if that statue\nUm I notice it and then I just kind of put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in ... he gave me the uh the book the that they just have coauthored origins of the things which is an amazing book by the way it is\nYeah um and so I was reading the book and you know in Robert section he's developing a you know something that he knows the dreams the law which is you know in front of the policy of the ... between the positive things\nAnd there was a a so he was talking basically about the things in this guy and he developed a part of the book and and then I asked myself well what about this things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it\nUm as far as we know before the servants were built if there was a schemes then it's it would have been such an amazing monument that they should have been a mention of it and that's how this came together so then I remember the statue I remembered the lion is on the pedestal\nOne thing led to another I posted something on my Facebook page Robert sawed and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know ah at the um I think it was causing the origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shock and we were sitting\nAt breakfast at night I knew I only you know I had to get this out in less than a minute and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out in less than ... minutes and\nWe uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it this uh this could be very important and that's how that paper came about why\nIs it I Know that you listened to my opening comments tonight you know why is it that the mother gives applied to in general but you had the great pyramid the grades things\nAre two things that dominate everything that you can see for miles\nBut he's not documented the anywhere in Egypt history where you would think well you know the ... love to write everything that he loved to scold didn't tell their story and not only that but taxes and\nAn accounting in season everything all of their daily lives all of the stories are told except for the great things in the great pyramid why is it missing in history\nYeah that that's a it's an excellent point I um I I of course I don't know Jimmy on I mean you know the one answer you could give is that maybe we just we haven't found the records or the records were destroyed um but it is there is a there is a striking paucity or or maybe total absence\nUm and of course that was the problem with this things you know I thought to myself that if we want to prove if we want to go into each apology territory and give them the kind of proof that they won\nAn inscription that refers to the ... for example than ah than we have to really look we have to we have to take a good look at what we have\nAnd hope to find something and you know I think I think we found something that leads to things um [noise]\nThe pyramids we um you know when you are in ... when you buy the great pyramid there's two of them from the six a dynasty maybe a hundred and fifty years two hundred years\nAfter a you know who fu ... was alive and if you walk into that to him to is actually a reference\nTo the great pyramid and also to the uh in in in the two of them is called uh the whole rise of coup fool and next to it it's the um the you know the the conference grade so in in in the old kingdom the great pyramid\nIt's the um the you know the the ... grade so in in in the old kingdom the great pyramid was actually hot phrase pyramid\nSo they call that cover his grade and kudos pyramid was called the whole rise of Google and so this was a priest that was a you know supervising or other priests that were on the plot so and so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct it is that is declaring exception you don't really see too much\nYou earn the pyramid yeah you would expect and like I said an owner's manual we don't have right but there isn't even a general reference to to point is in the direction\nAnd forget about the other something about how was builder who built into the year was built you know we still don't even understand the purpose and that it gives you all\nThe way to her auditors um you know fifth century but see now this was out in doing Persian rule um two thousand years after the fact and\nAnd what it is the writing the way he describes it raises more questions than answers um\nI mean he does get into a little bit of detail you know are you saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the plateau and then the pyramid was done in Twenty years um and there were machines that were hauling up to blocks but you would think that you know just like what you just said you would think it should be a detailed account of how it was done\nBut uh it's not to\nThe uh the other part of this or that is just is confusing is the great things yet we also have those same issues and if it wasn't for the dream style a while and the inventory Stella we may not know anything at all\nBut yes\nThe world the dream still a is a ... you know there was a dispute or at the turn of the um twentieth century that may be tougher laws to force who is the author of the dream sell up between the positive things that he has to want to build it that was actually being debated\nUm but uh and there is a there is a small reference to cooperate but it's\nIt's it's broken away so there's no way you can say that um that keep it does definitely does not say that he built it [noise] um and so that's the dream still at the end mentors the ... the other hand is very direct it specifically states\nUm first of all it makes it very clear that when ... when I ... I mean ... I don't know if some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same at the ... the Greek name who posed the\nEgyptian name it's the same person so that even towards the

I'm going to get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding for quite a while to speak with you my new let's go to Barry in South Carolina Barry welcome back to coast\nHello there ... and you know what I'm getting ready to say yeah man\nYeah go ahead Barry it's yours\nGo back ... Kathy\nYou like that my news you liked that area [laughter] okay\nI Am a day or I always love here is that all that it may have more do you play so great for me to keep the power\nAnd thank you bury what do you have for a minute tonight\nI got two questions and then I've got a great little short clean quick joke about their armored Tyler just at the end of the first question is who is credited with Jimmy ... or the deciphering\nAnd learning to read hieroglyphics and then the second question is all the higher\nGraphics found go bike repair in Egypt in that area of the world the same however are good things that are found in the pyramids of Mexico central and south ...\n... is the ... so the question is how are you asking if there are a hero cliff cliff picking scriptures in go back like that that is that what you're asking\nOh no I'm asking are all the ... that are written all the ... and Egypt ... the civil war and go back like that the all the same Ira Glass settle down on the pyramids and Mexico and central and South America\nAh okay I understand I'm not I don't think so they're they're different ... there are different ... and it's interesting you I've seen this question because you are you are basically giving a conclusion that I'm investigating as we speak you are saying that the era lipic inscriptions\nIn Quebec you can't be in other words you're implying there is a there is there's writing there\nAnd um and I am currently looking into that I think you might be onto something\nNow there is I'm going to say one thing let me jump in Barry okay although I'm not an archaeologist I don't have\nSomething now there is I'm going to say one thing let me jump in Barry okay although I'm not an archaeologist I don't have any fancy degrees after my name\nRight but there are certain things that are are in not only under stones at at go backwards happy but also in Egypt and tend to repeat around the world with different cultures are they the same I don't know there is an H M the belt\nThat uh it looks very similar to the age blocks in ... who are are they related I don't know\nBut there are some astrological signs in Beckley tabby\nOr they are they representing the zodiac uh that uh we're in then Darrow\nAnd throughout Egypt and throughout the rest of the world after that\nAre they the same I don't know but uh go back lead happy being that old\nCertainly is indicating that they were the first than it is the oldest is it the same language and then that no I I don't think so but the the zodiac symbols and some of the other symbolic she liked the\nI call it the army's age on the bells didn't lose when it looks like\nBut at that age that age is repeated a\nThere's a very exciting possibility um regarding that question that very often go back to the um and it's regarding the civil that you mentioned Jimmy there's a very exciting possibility but I Can't prove it yet but I probably I might be able to prove it so and then we'll let you when we'll let everybody know\n... will do right here on coast to coast oh there was one other uh one other point that I wanted to make about a ... a go Beckley happy and it just got away from me bury it was right there but it just disappeared\nI mentioned it later on in the show thank you very no problem I throw at absolutely and uh the phone lines Manu I expected this or are completely jammed up let's get in one more call bring him on all of them yeah let's let's go to\nThis is a let's go to the skin to my dad in New York my uh Europe next\nYes good morning gentlemen at great ... and ... I guess I have a two part question than I'd like to know if he had looked at any of that ... highway fact is that the pilots of any age and I\nAnd I'm also I think that might be the one that deals with the astounding medical knowledge that they had that if if I'm correct on that particular widen the second part and I'll listen over there and\nIs whether he and and and Rob it and and shot at ad can sit at some of the um the African and African American college who studied the net net net too at\nA which is the name of the language which is is is that not doing that to a phrase itself deals with say quit\nAnd whether he looked at\nPeople who call themselves a cabinet for and that in the kitchen you know before they that Greeks gay men and consider themselves that they can that colleges cabinet is where we got word from for chemistry\nAnd also um [noise] the what you call the thing was that we get word that degree Scott came up with and to me [noise] what they define what the riddle is not what it is and the African or not\nWell Matt how do I ride ... oh God of fat if you follow them I'm not quite an outlet in over the air\nThank you dad great okay three great questions and my new I'm going to get to them but that just goes to show you the extent of knowledge here with the coast audience or they don't play around with the first\nQuestion um I I I Am all I have heard of the ... for pirates of any but uh the one that I have looked at more specifically regarding medical information is the ... that's right actually in my book um because on the reverse of the eagles piracy there is an interesting calendar\nOr that's next Egypt colleges and I think\nUm I found a solution to a this calendar and that's described in the book um and and yes it's a this is an ... so the medical knowledge just incredible we're talking about piracy that's I think over sixty foot long\nUh it describing seven hundred at these different seven hundred different ailments\nAnd their remedies um and this ... I Believe dates to the middle kingdom and and reaches back a most likely a probably to him or taps time so um yes there were there were very skilled positions or the ancient Egyptians I'm\nThe second part yeah Ken Mitch and which was the name of Egypt of course kind of a group that's an\nExcellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can so um as far as we understand it the Egyptian language originally\nWas a composite of two different cultures the one culture was the southern Egyptian culture and that script was mostly phonetic um and the evidence from that comes from two of 'em you Jay a king scorpions and that is I think were the African roots lie\nThe other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt a ... probably from Bhutto\nAnd Bhutto was a sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably mess up with a mia with the live on\nAnd so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a fixture all so it was picked up graphs um so what you saw is what it meant while in the south what you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the\nUh the southern Egyptian script was probably a originally Africa and maybe you know ... maybe I'm maybe even further south than that\nAnd she brought up another really good point before we get to the break we got about thirty seconds Manu ... the Greeks adapting ah the etymology a mystery coming from candidate\nRight yes ... as she I think she mentioned is saying so uh my uh we we think this thinks was my heat before uh before Africa game I think there was a we would think it was the lioness and her name was made eat and by the way that's also probably an African of African origin\nLet's take a break right here coast to coast am it's all Great Pyramid all Egypt all night long or guessing I my new saved day his paper is right there click on his website a coast to coast am we're going to discuss the rest of it after the break stay with us\nMore about tonight's gifts to log on to do ... do you mean\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions Arizona State university is the perfect school for you\nArizona State university offers over one hundred and fifty highly rain degree programs one hundred percent on line you learn the same degree as what on campus from wherever you are on your scheduled press the one line except for the most transfer credits for information to fly to three five\nFive line seven learned for yourself ... ... ranked number one for innovation by US News and World Report and learn to thrive with Arizona State university for more information about all the one line tax live two three five five one seven\nThat's I I the two three five five wind setting\n[noise]\n\n\nBack to the coast to coast am I'm your host Jimmy church I guess tonight and my new save Saturday more talking about are the great pyramid and the discovery of not only chambers inside of the great pyramid\nBut his formula in his white paper they published last week and how to locate them and I want to say\nThe great pyramid but his formula in his white paper they published last week and how to locate them and I want to say really quick Manu that winter I expected this ah is is going a bit nuts right now\nAnd you can follow me on Twitter at a ... church radio and post your questions or comments about Tonight Show either of for me or my new right there and this question just came in before we get to a a page or three twenty eight of of of this report\nA minute this is the question is is for mama Kim\nShe says is it true that the measurements of the great pyramid or possibly coordinates and that those coordinates point to somewhere um in in the past that they believe are coordinates to have it in\nHeaven yes um I haven't I propose\nIt's great to see this is this is what I really enjoy a about the coast audience and and I guess like yourself there is so much information out there\nBut there's also the lack of information and we are trying to figure out the great mystery of of of the pyramid yeah and this is one of those questions where the math of the great pyramid\nHas revealed so many different not only a\nA mathematical equations but numbers that are beyond coincidence and they are they're all over the great pyramid\nI have I have one piece of information that might be interesting to the listener um there isn't a good friend of mine and author Alison green who is Louisa Shakespeare expert and he has been able to collect uh the uh the title age of the ... Shakespeare solid\nTo the coordinates a lot to heaven but uh of course Allen might say it'd ever write a ... to the corners of the great pyramid and typically a that a coordinate Thad Allen is discovered\nA fall right next to the ... of him you know which is like for the great pyramid\nAllen's work is some of the most groundbreaking game changing work out there I'm going to have him on coast a very soon probably next month\nAnd is you're absolutely right in the title page of the sonnets with a Shakespeare\nAnd his work Allen greens work at deciphering that page and ... what is revealed\nIs I have never been as freaked out as I was uh when I saw his presentation with that and interviewed him about it\nIt's it's absolutely incredible and we'll have Marcos next month okay so now as the the top half of the pyramid yes as you said at the beginning of the show let's get to this it's a page number three twenty eight everybody in the ... the the where a reporter PDF\nThe top half you had said at the beginning of the show possibly six to eight additional chambers where we had been told there are none\nBy right and so um you know when we talked about a um a gun thing you're Rudolph got to break last time a Jimmy um remember we're talking about the queen of the southern shaft of the queen chamber and there is something that I forgot to mention she was so what guns and bring a pound\nIs when you get to guns and brings door\nJust before the the the floor off the off the off the canal drops suddenly there's a depression and the way he's interpret one of the two ways he interpreted that\nThat allowed that forward to cave in slightly so that that's what he proposed in Nineteen Ninety three and if I look at the um you know these courses that we've just been discussing there is a good possibility that that that he is right there is probably a space that made that came in\nAnd that might correlate with or if I go back to three twenty six will quick\nThat could correlate with of course that's marked with ten twenty fifth [noise] um and and then then let's go and so you know so there's some there is evidence that there are spaces and died this particular space not been a detected by me on scan\nAnd now the row mutts or let's let's get to this for a second and the\nUh the ... going to look at the numbers that you have more presented here which is a starting in a row eighty four which is a shaft\n'em and are you going up words every body of one of those seven a\nAnd I'm looking at it here as it continues a these are rose layers of the construction that have a different sides of the different thickness on these roads right\nRight right yeah and and in this graphic or you know one of these canals as a show and going all the way to the surface and that is incorrect so I just use the illustration is is an old illustration um so that if that particular chef did not go to the surface of the wall\nBut yes so we have all the different courses that have round fractions of twenty fifth in in terms of the surface area ratio\nAnd um and by ah by the rules that you know I Am basically establishing in the lower part of the pyramid I'm proposing that every single one of these courses is associated with the the ring in other words there is a space at designed space not not you know an accidental space\nAnd designed space that correlates with each one of these particular courses\nNo you just got back from Egypt yes we have to discuss the ongoing moves on a project there which\nI did help them find this cavity there's new chamber above the grand gallery you describe what you saw in the grand gallery well when you were there\nRight so I saw new detectors being place um I at this time in a different location and last time so last time the detectors were placed inside the queen chamber and this time it's very obvious you walk up the ground gallery to the king chamber and there are I think twenty seven twenty eight boxes\nAnd I kind of knew their detectors but I asked to confirm and there was confirmed that there are a scanning\nNow for the audience tell them what to do on detectors actually do where do they used for\nBy so these are particles that are created in the stratosphere so when the cosmic radiation hit the atmosphere of particle called him you on his created enemy on is a negative they charge like an electron um uh but it is a is a bit heavier\nOr didn't electron but it can pop through solid matter if it's it travels at the speed of light it's lifetime is just over two seconds\nI'm and but it can penetrate through solid objects\nAnd so because of those properties you can use it just like an X ray and you know you take an extra person you can see the bones you can see somebody organs\nAnd in this case you can basically quote unquote X rayed a pyramid you put the detectors below where you think there is something and then a show and then you have a chance to see a space or because the yarns will travel\nYou think there is something and then a show and then you have a chance\nTo see his face or because the yarns will travel more rapidly through open air than you know through solid still and so if you have a space in the ... way of what you're what you're looking for than those nuance will arrive more rapidly and they and more often will arrive and you will be able to see that on the detector\nWould these detectors placed in the grand gallery could they be used to find the [noise] the chambers that you were proposing in the upper half of the pyramid\nIt is possible um I think the reason why they're doing that is because they got criticized by an Egypt colleges are that the data maybe ought to factual\nAnd I think they using this angle to confer that's a big voice is real what it is possible to your point that in that in that particular field of", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Twin Falls", "day": "15"}
