examples longer term issue in Greece were not showing in the park label\nI've always heard about this but they have been actually going after dietary supplements that have been a manufactured in there and they're talking about how they're also pharmaceuticals are being sold on the Internet but also to include a certain types of chemicals that are not good for the body\nSo are we really looking at a time now where you have to find\nA credible places to get the stuff that you'll have to have purity I mean they can't regulate a these supplements so how are they going to keep the purity and clarity because I Know the FDA and others who say that you know selling settlements a snake oil but the thing is the ... the the pharmaceutical companies felt a supplements as well so who\nDo we have ... ... they make 'em a um a lot of supplements or the nutrition made by by drug companies but first first of all ... there's a couple of points first of all I'm yet to make a distinction between dietary supplements and nutrition\nDietary supplements oftener formulations that contain herbs and plant material is different from what we call the essential or the mighty Ninety essential nutrient Ninety essential nutrients their vitamins minerals amino acids\nAnd fatty acids that the body must have they are not optional\nYou suffer a disease or without any individual essential nutrient a is defined as the substance that you better have suffered disease from a deficiency disease from hers are not in that category and supplements that the the hundreds of suffering contain these these tainted products for the most part or herbal medicine\nHerbal formulation the second thing is that your point is very well taken\nYou gotta have a certain sense of similarity with the company you're buying your ... your your nutrition from I\nPersonally was elected to the mighty Ninety essential nutrients and I would you know I I've been part of the ... family now for twenty plus years because I trust the company I Know the people personally could formulate the product they know the people personally who manufacture\nThe products and I I have a at a decades long as two decades long two plus decades long relationship with the company so yeah you got to latch onto a company that you trust as best as you can try to buy your supplements from that\nCompany that's sometimes you have to have multiple sources and there are other good companies but I like the ... the company and and that's why in with them\nFor so long yeah I like them because they came to me and offered me help and they've helped me a lot and of course they're helping my wife a lot to with her cancer surgery isn't and giving her nutritional supplements to the reduced to actually reduced uh the the the tumor a swelling routed

because I went to his girlfriend's house with a couple of years ago and I hadn't smoked marijuana for like thirty five years and I took one head held it as long as I could and I couldn't leave her

effects it's amazing and so that's why I said yes my city is\nBroke a well thank you so much\nJane thank you for calling to program tonight let's go to a school to know in Pennsylvania I Know you're on ground zero\nNo out our new al how are you at all the talking a jail cells and especially\nIn that I have um sun\nAnd had some problems and the thing is that if you want to find a\nUm\nOr so says all you have is there are tens of thousands if not hundred thousand is\nParents who have children\nWho are vaccine injured\nAnd then they went on to have other children with no vaccinations what oh Albert and I happen to be connected and many of those people on line and those children are the LPs\nChildren of all though what we do is we start with injecting pregnant women\nAnd then only and check the baby the day it on with that but tidy thing about being an only below ... a damage\nThan natural immune stop over time and then when something comes along children can get sick or as what happened with my son um he had a bad vaccine reaction that was physical me I was kind of in denial of the other injuries before that\nWhen he was five years old and I had the latest vaccination than I had\nSpread them out and uh there was a the day after he was in the green to me\nAnd um he laid on the floor and bomb it ... out of them and I said to myself that then I'm done I'm not going to inject them anymore I'm not going to all these things that the doctors\nAnd so two years later I'm In the hospital and doctors telling me that my son has diabetes type one at his immune system went crazy and kill the beta cells in the area and I say well what caused the debt\nAnd she says I don't know we don't know and you know doctors just don't Mart all the time except when you want to know what causing all of this died in ... they don't know what they say they have no light the is there a difference\nWell I can at the last great and I went on a research research or a year on lifetime in diabetes and try to read it like that I could do that\nAnd as I don't vote upon vaccine and start let feel like they were Floyd it's tied attack green power\nWhich you have any you know and diabetes type one and it hit me like Iraq and that I put not only that\nI had had a hand in clay thing that I can I started to get on line with people with similar Hillary ten people owe it to the story\nWell there are always you know Noel there's always there's always the the story and I I have a friend of mine close to me\nWho are used to be a ... his wife used to be pro vaccine until their little boy had a reaction and are the schools were just so cruel about it and he said well you can't take certainly can take certain things that I said well he can't come to school and was he gets the shots and everything and I think that's so draconian when people have reactions fit\nThere there's so there's so brainwashed by the big pharmaceutical companies have their kids vaccinated that sometimes if they have a bad reaction is still forced to do this and what's your opinion on this\nHundred percent ... gallon so right on a autoimmune diseases are just one of the things that can happen\nWhen you get vaccinated and I would advise that parents to be really really cautious and do their own research when it comes to vaccinating their kid is just too much literature that's the the us supports the idea that people are injecting only God Knows what into their kid bloodstream\nBy passing their liver bypassing you're buying a built in ... system stick and stuff right into the blood it's a really bad\nIdea not just because of the ... of the vaccine itself but the chemicals they put in the ... the price we have no idea what goes into those vaccines in terms of preservatives and stabilizers in vehicles and agitation\nAnd all the other things that are in with the vaccine aside from the fact that this is gals pointing out of the ideas depressing and knocking out the ... or affecting negatively affect the immune system now you got to deal with talks all the toxicity is going right into the bloodstream I'd be really cautious about any vaccine\nMen one question about these kids will be in terrible virus do you think that maybe this is a result of of being exposed to a mosquitoes or do you think it's being exposed to the vaccines that are that they're being given because these kids are getting sick and they're having the paralysis what's your opinion on that\nFully up polio is a sequel to oral virus\nIn other words it only comes from the commentary and Tyrone means the digestive system some\nWisdom to digest the virus lives in the digestive tract supposed to get a screening\nIn during the feces but for people don't wash their hands when you know all the ways that you have people transition of of of of a virus is a ... that's where the polio virus comes from within a very interesting about polio is there's lots of polio life\nDiseases and whether something is a is considered to be officially polio or a polio like diseases the matter is an arbitrary distinction say\nYou have for her smile at trends first my\nWife got a septic meningitis got Guillain Barre syndrome you've got the\nOr this or what you were just talking about the huge plastic paralysis you got a A R ... you're going to even lead poisoning can mimic some of the science of of of a so called polio so whether polio was totally eradicate or not is really we don't really know that because\nSo all polio so letter polio is totally eradicate or not is really\nWe don't really know that because all they did was create artificial distinctions innocent ... every year there are all almost a hundred thousand cases of polio laced illnesses in the United state and the only reason they don't call a polio is because they are fairly\nCreated a semantic an artificial semantic distinction so if we could very well still have polio for all we know while it's\nJust a question of the name this this condition that the kids are suffering from it it could just be a continuation of\nAll of the just the polio is that the viruses and the uh the uh uh equally administer\nPushing for me to be better if

connection with the Washington Post may have made him a useful tool for the church to\nRod Serling was an absolute genius was any\nHe was he was I mean there's no doubt about it or not only was he a genius but he was a prolific genius he um he proved it over and over again or he was just unbelievably productive and he just wrote so many great grapes shows for for television and film\nOr one of my friends marches decree I wrote a book about the twilight zone or in his subsequent book the twilight zone companion he said that rod Serling you do write most of his shows by dictating in a Dictaphone while he was floating in his pool\n[laughter] well he he definitely wrote most of the shows by dictating he did dictate from pretty much from Nineteen fifty five on word\nUm I don't know if he did most of them in the pool in the pool but he's certainly dictated most of the scripts and and honestly I don't know how he did it I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly was a rare breed or he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nLet's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little bit about rod Serling who he was he was a veteran was he not\nShow was yeah he um he he enlisted in the army the day after high school graduation so he was um [noise] you know he was had the patriotic fervor of you know having seen you know Pearl Harbor and he he wanted to do his part of so he enlisted as soon as he possibly could\nAnd he had this um this idea that he wanted to be a paratrooper aid that was just he was gung ho on it he wanted to be a paratrooper and he got his wish she was assigned to the five hundred eleventh parachute infantry regiment of the eleventh airborne\nAnd he saw some pretty heavy combat in in the Philippines and lady and a and lose on 'em and its stardom it's caught him for life and and it affected pretty much everything that he that he did from that point forward\nSome of his episodes for the twilight zone had a war type of personality to them and did he get that from his combat oh he certainly has as its yeah he\nUm he went back to the battlefield um several times a before the twilight zone during the twilight zone after the twilight zone so [noise] um it was always there was always part of his makeup you know the the experiences that he had so yeah there are a couple of\nTwilight zone episodes particularly one called the purple testament which is actually set in lady um during World War two so that was as close as he got to literally revisiting his his combat experience in twilight zone and then several other other shows like I said before and after this while I\nWas fortunate to be born right in that golden age of television was any\nHe uh he certainly was it was a time when\nTelevision was obviously the new kid on the block you know radio is still king in the late forties when rod was first coming up\nAnd television needed writers I it was it was it was this fast you know the vast wasteland it was a vast medium that was just\nDevoid of talent at the time and rod you know a jumped right into it and he said he was so prolific and he wrote so much that he just sent stuff out and stuff out and so finally started being accepted and and soon enough he was you know it shows were you know we're all over the place\nDid you have a chance to talk to Scott Carol Serling rods wife\nDid not unfortunately no you know the what he had a a treat with that quite a person indeed I bet yeah\nCarol Serling rods wife I did not unfortunately no no the what he had a a treat with that quite a person indeed I bet yeah yeah\nNow with with rod he started before he got in the twilight zone and he was a writer for other kinds of shows was any\nOh sure sure there are some people may not know this but rod Serling was\nWithout question the most prestigious writer in television before the twilight zone he had written you know he won three consecutive Emmy Award for best dramatic writing in Nineteen fifty five fifty six and fifty seven a twilight zone started and fifty nine I'm so he was at the top of the of the heap\nOr before the twilight zone came out and he just kind of took that dramatic you know just straight for drama sensibility into the twilight zone and gave it that little fantasy twist on it\nHe was very socially minded and I think he was frustrated because a lot of times when he wanted to put social things in his writings tired of twilight zone the sponsors went ballistic and always tried to a critique him editorialize and even controlling\n[noise] yeah yeah that was that was the big you know the big problem that is throwing ran into is that he believe that\nIt's a writer's job to do those things as a writer job to address the issues of his time and every time he tried to address any issue of any social import on television the censors would get this way the sponsors we'd gotten this way\nAnd it was frustrating for him and thankfully for ... for ... he was successful enough and he had built such a name for himself that they were willing to give him his own show and he had always loved science fiction he loved fantasy science fiction horror you\nKnow all that kind of things so he created the twilight zone because he's always wanted to do a show like the twilight zone but he also was able to take it and say you know what I can probably get some of this stuff by if I did it in a fantasy or science fiction setting when it will be a little less controversial\nEvery twilight zone episode that I recall every twilight zone episode had some kind of social issue or a meaning behind it it wasn't just a television show with a cool ending it had a message that in it\nOh absolutely if it was a a television series that just had\nA cruel twist ending we wouldn't be talking about it right now you know it's a it was always deeper than that certainly certainly episodes were always deeper than that um because he again believe that that was part of a the artists job the art if it's going to be art it has to do what he would say that has to say something about something\nAnd you know it has to be entertaining he did want to entertain but at the same time he had to say something about something\nWhat do you think some of the ... that he wanted to address in his work\nWell you know throughout his career of the big the biggest issue was prejudice um rot had this this innate aversion to prejudice and he believed it was\n... I Believe that all evils stemmed from prejudice that that's the beginning and that's the root of all of them so he wanted to address that idea that um we have this\nUm this tendency to look to other people to ah for our own faults and we should be looking within will blame somebody else instead and that that idea came out constantly throughout the twilight zone before and after\nHe has some of the things that he wrote about of course we're pretty dramatic but what do you think has kept the twilight zone so strong all these years I mean we're talking about six years now\nAnd next next year will be the sixtieth anniversary of the you know the debut in Nineteen fifty nine and yeah it is you know I just recently there was a magazine was released I'm a science fiction magazine that but it it was ranking the top one hundred\nIt is you know I just recently there was a magazine was released um science fiction magazine that but it it was ranking the top one hundred television series of all time and it wasn't just science fiction as all television series and the only black and white TV series on the cover was the twilight zone is the only the only one who made it\nAnd at this point you know you ask the average twenty five year old\nThey're not getting any black and white TV series but they know what the twilight zone is it's entered the consciousness\nJust as a term you know people know that\nThe twilight zone means what you think it means it means something is off kilter or something is strange something is you know not quite right and it lasted all this time because of of routes messages and because quite frankly just because it was it was so good you know it was just so well written so well produced so well acted\nA it was just a first class production from from get from point a to point the you know so so that's I think white has lasted all these years\nI've got this great letter in my office in Los Angeles from Ray Bradbury who wrote the script I sing the body electric for the twilight zone and it was one of my favorites and I it's a Bradbury had heard about it and I had written an article about it in a what we had was called the after dark newsletter\nIn a bread Bree just loved it he said this was one of the greatest things I've ever seen about ... shows and thank you so much and so he sends me this letter that I got and that's you know posted on my uh my board in my office about what role I didn't write all the scripts he oversaw things but he did right he had some writers like Bradbury\nSure no no listen nobody could write every script on you know a rod wrote in Ninety two of the hundred and fifty six twilight zone episodes over five seed that's pretty prolific\nThat is that's ridiculous I mean nobody writes Ninety two shows in a five year five season periods just if you know and and at the same time he was doing other things you know so the amount that he produced is just is just off the charts I I'm just convinced he never slept you just never slept from Nineteen fifty Nineteen Seventy five that was it [laughter]\nHe smoked a lot though didn't he\nYeah he sure did unfortunately he was he was just addicted have is just addicted to it maybe he got that in in the war as well um but um it was ultimately a big part of his mother's death\nUm yeah I absolutely had heart issues and that's what's on the demand you said that brought down the road to well over two hundred and fifty total scripts on some of the things he did I mean that's amazing if he wrote Ninety two twilight zones and two hundred and fifty others the total shows that's crazy isn't it\nIt really is you know when I was researching the book it it's\nYou know this couple of things that are really really impressive it's that well first of all yeah you run Ninety two twilight zone episodes he also wrote thirty eight of the night gallery stories ha ha so if you know they do is that's a hundred and thirty scripts right there so there's a hundred and at least a hundred and twenty other things he did besides it's why it's on the night gallery\nStay with us deck we're going to take a break we'll come back and talk more next hour we'll take phone calls with him

changed all that much really really still waiting for puberty the strike what can I say\nYou were in three twilight zone episodes right\nThree of the original and then I was in the future and and I wrote one of the UPN episodes and then we return to it's a good life with ... and my daughter lowly ana for it's still a good life back in two thousand three so I kinda got six notches on my belt when it comes to the tea zone\nAnd when you were in those episodes and they were being done was rod Serling around there was he was he there\nAbsolutely I yeah I was on the set when he did as you know bumpers and intros and ah [noise] yeah he was definitely around and you know it's interesting because there was no regular cast\nOn a twilight zone so he was the only regular cast\nMember and every time he was on the set because you know he and the producer buck out and we're really seeing kilo in charge of the vision of that show and wrestled\nControl from network hassling as much as they could\nUh every all the heads of all the different departments were always very happy to see Mr certainly when he was on the set and talk to him about what was coming up and the next episode her so usually when an executive producer or creator comes onto was said and they were but it gets a little uptight though that you know or when Alan's here [laughter]\nOr whatever but uh I recall quite clearly that are on rod Serling was on the set everybody was delighted to be around to\nTalk with you yeah yeah sure we went out for margaritas every night and you know that's right and how old were you you're a little kid\nI was six or six and seven and nine\nThat's how did they find you believe in these parts\n[noise] um well actually the one of the very first lead roles like it was a an episode of ... to young show that was directed by James Sheldon the chorus Leishman played by mom and a and the director of that show brought me and for the first twilight zone James Sheldon he brought me in for a long distance call and he also directed\nIt's a good life so having to under my belt\nOr I guess they just you know just called me up for in praise of pet\nBusy guy and you were you were in ... now what do you do in these days really what's new well Angela car\nRight now I've just released are novel a fantasy novel I think we talked about it when we were first writing in the time and go charge on purpose it's called the devil seek revenge against and all that as Harry his weapon\nFlow you set yourself with some uh for the show OK\nYeah love to do that and I'm ... thrown ancient aliens and you know I'm playing the real Dr Smith on the new lost in space so [noise]\nMaking music to you this is the key Billy thinks that's it you got it by George really moved me isn't that a treat neck and I was thinking George so that was great\nYou as a I did run certainly for you on this show you never know\n[laughter] my yeah my calling from the from the other side\nWhat inspired you to write the book about certainly\n[noise] well I mean I became a a twilight zone fanatic when I was a kid nine ten years old I was just you know mesmerized by the show and and so that started everything [noise]\nAnd then really since then I've just uh it's been a very gradual process of becoming aware of all this other stuff that he had written a you know so much of it that was great\nAnd I I just wanted to collect all this information about all of these shows that he had written and it was it was just surprising to me that no one had actually\nI'm done this type of thing where for example you know there wasn't even really a complete a list of all the shows that certain rod sterling wrote that were produced TV or film\nThere wasn't even really a complete a list of all the shows that certain rod Serling wrote that were produced or television or or or film believe it or not I mean every list I went to had things missing had ever had you had gaps whatever but\nSo that had never been done so the first thing I wanted to do is I wanted to know exactly what he wrote you know for his entire career that was produced in any form whatsoever so\nAnd then once I did that I just I just you know just snowball from there I wanted to give some information about these shows I wanted to present them in a way that you know the reader who is never going to see a lot of these shows I mean they're not the twilight zone and not in that gallery there not been at it I haven't been commercially released\nUm I wanted to give that reader an idea of what these shows were about\nSo you know so that that was the idea behind the whole thing and then the book became you know it's part that is part you know a videographer you reference guide but it's also part biography in this part you know critical analysis of the the theme certainly was was dealing with and the character types that he you know that he researched and you know dealt into an ex cetera\nDid you come across anything that surprised you in your research\nI came across several things that surprised me yes I'm\nProbably the most surprising thing that I found was you may have heard of a particular shall we talked about the sponsors before and how they would you know bought up against sterling whenever he tried to do anything that was remotely controversial whether there's one show that's particularly infamous in that regard it's called it's called noon on doomsday\nIt was broad certainly is attempt to tell some kind of version of the Emmett Till lynching in Mississippi I'm for those who don't know him until it was a\nFourteen year old African American a boy who was lynched in Mississippi after allegedly whistling at a white woman and this really just\nDestroyed rod Serling she wants to sell some version of the story\nAnd Everytime he tried to he you know he met resistance well I was able to find the ... the actual first draft of the script that rod wrote before any of these um you know any of these in a interference is came into play\nAnd there have been several studies of this particular show in the evolution that it's so from from you know the where it was initially to to what aired on on on television well but none of those studies had the actual first draft and I just luckily\nFound the actual first draft in that surprised me because of all spoil it for you know it's not all that much different than what actually aired on television so this book is going to tell you a completely different version of that noon on doomsday controversies story than than you've ever heard anywhere else\nNovember twenty second Nineteen sixty three president John F. Kennedy was assassinated how did that affect the rod Serling\nIt uh it devastated them he was um [noise] you know superficially he was a Kennedy admirer he was he agreed with his politics and he he admired Kennedy but beyond that it was just it really you know I I came across a letter that rotted written to um\nTo his ... can't say pastor but he was a Unitarian of most of his life for most of his adult life rod Serling was and he wrote a letter to one of his Unitarian a priest so to speak and\nAnd he just said how it just kind of it just took away his faith in humanity that something like this could happen he felt that we were in you know in a dark age in dark ages whereas something like this could happen so\nIt really it just yeah it it it throw him for it threw him into a dark place for a little while and strangely enough what happened was the day after the assassination he and William fruit that one of the producers on this while its own were contacted by the state department\nAnd ask to produce a film to introduce Lyndon Johnson to the world while it was a document they needed\nThat by the state department and ask to produce a film to introduce Lyndon Johnson to the world while it was a documented they needed a documentary they thought you know this and we got to get something quick\nThat we can just send to our allies and present to people so you know here's here's the new president and so rod Serling the day after the assassination when he was you know depressed for sure flew to Washington DC and began immediately working on this documentary to introduce President Johnson to the world\nSo he did that he finished\nYeah in fact the you know the uh\nThe the people who asked him to do this I said we ... we need this in five days [laughter] and and and William fruit said listen that's not going to happen we we can't do it in five days but we'll do the best we possibly can and they you know as we said before Roger so prolific and he was so such a fast writer he did get through it pretty quickly and they had they had it ready\nYou're struggling with your mortgage payments and bills began to pile\nNot knowing what to do more you do nothing at all\nAnd that's the worst thing you can do\nBecause if you take action\nIf you do something about your mortgage problems\nHousing expert about the options that are right for you\nOr visit making before the dot com or do something\n[noise] news then talk on the radio\nDishes news radio ... onto\nAnkara love jak Callahan Fox News secretary of state Mike Pompeo has left to Saudi Arabia with a promise they'll get to the bottom of the disappearance of journalists ...\nThan it would be a thorough complete and transferred investigation will all see the results of that they made a commitment to show the entire world the results of their investigation they also indicated they would get this done quickly and secretary\nPompeo says the Saudis have promised to hold anyone involved accountable up to and including members of the Saudi royal family next up meetings with government leaders in Turkey who say\nThey have recordings that proved cause she'll be was tortured and killed in the city council it in the eastern bowl after Andrew Brunson metal sharing details of his arrest unless he says were trumped up terror charges in Turkey\nTelling Fox's Sean Hannity that after he was taken into custody he was in a Turkish prison cell design for eight people but it was filled with twenty other prisoners are\nPart of that time it was a very crowded crowded sale and part of the time I was also in isolation so it was a very difficult time\nBrunson also saying there was another reason he felt isolated and it\nWas very difficult to be the only Christian among them\nBernstein says he's probably one of the most hated man in Turkey after being accused of being the reason for Turkey's economic problems because of sanctions imposed against the country by the Trump Administration flux\nOf Joel de do Brunson was freed friday return to the U.S on Saturday they lit up the early morning skies along Florida's Space Coast early Wednesday the United launch alliance blasting Annapolis five rocket from Cape Canaveral boosting an Airforce\nSatellite into space designed to become part of a network to provide some just secure communications for the military that sound you heard late Tuesday night as they announced the wedding numbers you know the six hundred sixty seven million dollar mega millions jackpot millions of tickets sold not a single winter among them friday's estimated\n... eight hundred sixty eight million [noise] list is Fox News [noise]\nThis is ...

was a tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nUh he has horrible horrible incident I'm a helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set a as yeah yeah cast they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation you know in Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead you're high\nLike a couple of questions or one would be the first one would be a vaccine like it was very escapist\nWere then maybe someone stay back in the sixties I'm just speculating that you had a record job and they came home and watch the twilight zone that would be almost like an escape from your daily reality\nAnd I guess people might have wanted that I'm Wondering if there are any other shows really like that\nMy second question would be about the mysterious endings which I think a lot of that could be almost a not necessarily ethic book could've unfolded into actual movies additional scenes\nUh where uh someone could take a twilight zone episode and kinda unfolded into an actual movie you know like a planet of the apes\nYeah I I I agree with you on that and and to get to the first question you know the\nYeah the escapist aspect of the twilight zone and that's I think that is part of all science fiction and fantasy of course is that that a scape is tone to it um but you know it's funny that you you mentioned that because that has actually something that rod Serling uh often pointed to about ... gallery or in the early seventies during the end of the Vietnam\nEra he felt that night gallery was giving people in the ... from the nightly news and seeing you know the stuff on you know stuff on the news about war and everything else they would they go into the gallery an escape\nA through that so he never really said that about the ... but I think the similar a point can be made about the twilight zone as well [noise]\nUh and it is surprising that that that someone hasn't taken you know a twilight zone episode and expanded it into a feature film all those there's been there have been plenty of films that are certainly it's twilight zone in ... you know influenced that could very well we'll just as just as well because while its own movies that are called the twilight zone\nWas it Jack Lemmon on one of the twilight zones\nHe started for twilight zone yeah actually they actually started one with the movie um in praise of tip that's right yeah yeah and he was terrific guy Jack Lemmon probably gave my favorite performances on the twilight zone in in three of the episodes that he was he was he a trumpet player in one of them exactly yes there's one called the passage for trumpet rod wrote that one\nForman says on the twilight zone in in three of the episodes that he was he\nWas he a trumpet player in one of them\nExactly yes there's one called the passes for trumpet ride wrote that one and I'll tell you a quick story about that episode you know he the director\nUm jak called me was so good in that episode is just so good that the director actually wrote were called rod and said listen I don't want to take the camera off of this guy I just want to keep filming [laughter] there any way we can make this into a two part episode he wanted to expand into an allergist because jak cotton was so good\nAnd rod said you know there's some you just can't they don't have the budget we can't can't do more than half an hour but that's\nThat's saying something with the director says listen I'm just gonna let this guy going I'm just going to film whatever does\nClassic classic classic Jason in Portland, Oregon is with us now Jason go ahead sir\nWell where are you folks wherever that Presidents Day there's they why like those radios theater and they take some of the old episode he ran from the radio and they also incorporate\nResidents

thought the end it thank you and I think with the sterling stay\nCool did you know about that Nick\nI I was not aware of the current uh uh uh current radio series no there actually was a twilight zone a series of radio dramas of the original episodes that was produced some uh not too long ago but no I wasn't aware of a of a currently no\nDidn't write ever writes for radio in his early days\nOh sure yeah that's that's where he really got his start was in radio his first cells were to or where to a series called Grand Central station that air and I think on CBS um CBS network\nAnd the road you know for radio or in college\nAnd so yeah that was that was the beginning before he broke and and actually the funny thing is he actually went back to radio and created a radio series in Nineteen fifty four so basically four years after he had broken into television he actually went back to work\nIn Cincinnati and created this radio series called it happens to you and it was a series of Thirteen um original radio script\nWhere did he end up living Los Angeles\nA yes or while he once he lived in most and Pacific palisades where most of his a professional career and then he always went back to uh Africa in upstate New York every summer and then he was teaching it if it gets so we kind of gradually spent more time uh and it's like the later in life\nWhen he got sick was a long illness or did you go suddenly\nUm [noise] well it was it was pretty sudden he you know he had\nWho's fifty years old was any or something like that was fifty yeah he was supposed to then get a couple of heart attacks and he went in for a bypass procedure which was fairly you know cardiac bypassed procedure which was and it was in New\nYork time uh and you know it's interesting you know how new it was because if you read some of the news stories at the time about the surgery they'll explain to you exactly what the surgery is you know they're going to take a ... you know artery from this here and put it here it's like nowadays you wouldn't have to say any of that you know what a cardiac bypasses but that back then it was so new that that explains\nThe surgery and he had the surgery and the doctors thought he was successful and um by the time they were selling 'em up he had another attack on the table and that was pretty much a\nSteve's with us first time caller in Pittsburgh,

the the fake shrunken heads what they there by the way it shrunk it has worked a fortune\nAlright really come from the islands and stuff where this was medicine to people okay this was you know part of their culture and it was it was a very small culture so these are very rare I Hope\nThey did it with those who died rather than kill someone to do it\nUm I don't know I think I have to think about that\nBut ah my hand handle one of those years ago and you know it wasn't a monkey had it was something a little strange and all these little are they how small are they the very small about the size of softball how do they do that I had no idea if I could answer that correctly I don't think you'd want to know me anymore would ya [laughter]\nTrue they do it with a boy on them down and not different types of medicinal spirits and also little magic remember everybody has a magic in our culture and all the other thing that I uh found that [noise]\nI found the pre Columbian pottery all and

alien yeah\nAnd it's actually talking now the there have been a bunch of these would have been found and they're they're pretty interesting alone and they all look to saying he's actually talking on a

D. V. copies of this big area type and pass them around from city to city to city\nHall right and\nThis book ... has a picture of both Craig's\n[noise] um [noise] am broke type and the paper copies that they made of this this this these three children that they passed around from city to city to city bench up in Boston a woman says\nThose are my three such children while those to my husband right before Gettysburg I haven't heard from a sense I'm Sorry he died they go on and tell her the story\nThat spooky enough but then ... says Wayne\nScoping your attic and scrounge around ... takes this is right after he gave me this book\nAnd Craig says Wayne scoping your attic and scrounge around ... takes this is right after he gave me this book go up the my attic is I live in Eighteen forty house has\nA few books of its own right go up and is Sadek and there's this little room where there was furniture assembled but when we bought the house\nCeilings are only about four foot tall it's a spooky little room it's almost like Anne Frank and her family lived and there were a bunch of artifacts left over in the house when I was purchased\nOne of the things that was left over in the house\nWas this book ... book of photographs well Craig and I opened it up and there is one of the C. D. V. copies of the the same three children we opened it up and immediately there's those three kids staring right at us we dropped\nThe book industry [laughter] I mean that's\nWhat kind of coincidence is that right that's almost like that conjured up something pretty doggone spooky\nI guess you got to be careful what you do\nWell you know I don't think careful I think that the positive things about in takes as they bring about good spirits a lot of happiness but there are times when you got to pay a little bit careful I knew the warns pretty well and they are used to say don't play around with we gee boards and stuff\nI Believe that yeah yeah I don't mess around with really chilly and takes because you know you don't want to open up doors you can't close right [laughter]\nThat's true that is absolutely would you do when when ... you do you run a gene and you've been to some of these places and you find some of these things have you found objects that look scary to you\nAll the time it's often um ... the the things that that make them look scary is the houses that are in um [noise] I was in a house where this famous psychologist or\nI died the story was that he killed themself and uh I go through there with my buddy a another buddy of mine who were doing a kind of a an appraisal of this this for a for some lawyers and\nAnd and we're taking photographs of these pieces and this guy had spray painted things on the walls that were really strange he was a LSD person in\nThe house was filled with all sorts of strange uh furniture from the mission oh period nuts and had been claimed\nA in years and he had like captured animals in skinned him and made things out of um [noise]\nUm that was pretty scary when you're the first one to come across these things over the years\nAnd that that tends to make all the objects in the house all the scarier so I'm going through this house taking photographs of all the strange things right\nMy buddy won't go up in the addict I Know what's wrong with you because wine or something wrong up there what are you talking about it 'cause I saw something up there I saw it goes up there\nI said come on man we're working here right it's not time for this right we've got a lot to do\nHe would not go up in the addict by himself grown man we ended up going up in the addict together finishing photography up there and went downstairs took some more photographs [noise]\nAll right I develop I I had the photographs developed this was just actually no it was a it these were ah this is just the beginning when photographs were a digital\nPhotographs in the attic all had these weird circles and I'm like or like balloons every single photograph in that house\nHad these these weird or sent him none of the photographs before we went up and he had a cat that so I figured I'd spilled water on the lens I looked at the photographs or taken after we left the addict downstairs again\nOh problem just up and that's strange addict that's where my buddies says that's what I saw\nVery strange do you find that the older the object the more possible that it could be a haunted object\n[noise] yeah I think that um age has an awful lot to do with that ah just because there's more chance for stories to become attached to an object you know sometimes an object dies made and you know ... a table that was made back in ah\nIt seemed

the OPN is a is a really good um uh aspect of it\nAnd um my guess is if it's painted with a lot of lot of good subject matter interest it probably worth some decent money\nWhat about a picture of like George Patton or something like that what would that be worth\nA lot of money because George Patton was such an interesting fellow George Patton was you know they made a great movie about him and uh you know he he was just he was just a guy who stood out I'd love to have is a real handle pistol\nOh my gosh that would be worth something wouldn't it wouldn't that be something I sure would also

totally couldn't print a word to show he took where for refuge in the United states and became a regular contributor to the Washington Post\n[noise] ah one of our friends marches decree I wrote a book about the twilight zone or in the subsequent book the twilight zone companion he said that rod Serling you do write most of his shows by dictating in addictive phone while he was floating in his pool\n[laughter] well he he definitely wrote most of the shows by dictating he did dictate from pretty much from Nineteen fifty five on word\nUm I don't know if he did most of them in the pool in the pool but he's certainly dictated most of his scripts and and honestly I I don't know how he did it I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly was a rare breed he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nWell let's go back before the twilight zone even started to tell us a little bit about rod sterling who he was he was a veteran was he not\nShow was yeah he um he he enlisted in the army the day after high school graduation so he was um [noise] you know he was had the patriotic fervor of you know having seen you know Pearl Harbor and he he wanted to do his part I'm so he enlisted as soon as he possibly could\nAnd he had this um this idea that he wanted to be a paratrooper hey that was just he was gung ho on it he wanted to be a paratrooper and he got his wish she was assigned to the five hundred eleventh parachute infantry regiment of the eleventh airborne\nAnd he saw some pretty heavy combat in in the Philippines and lady and a and lose on 'em and it's ... it's called them for life and and it affected pretty much everything that he that he did from that point forward\nSome of his episodes for the twilight zone had a war type of personality to them and did he get that from his combat ... as it's yeah and he\nAnd he went back to the battlefield um several times a before the twilight zone during the twilight zone after the twilight zone so [noise]\nUm it was always there was always part of his makeup you know the the experiences that he had so yeah there are a couple of\nTwilight zone episodes particularly at one called the purple testament which is actually in lady um during World War two so that was as close as they got to literally revisiting his his combat experience in twilight zone and and several other other shows like I said before and after this while I\nWas fortunate to be born right in the golden age of television was any\nYes he uh he certainly was it was a time when television was obviously the new kid on the block you know radio is still king in the late forties when rod was first coming up\nAnd television needed writer so I was it was it was this fast you know if they've asked we find it was a vast medium that was just devoid of talent at the time and rod you know\nSo it was this fast you know I Would say vast wasteland it was a vast medium that was just\nDevoid of talent at the time and rod you know a jumped right into it and he said he was so prolific and he wrote so much that he just sent stuff outside stuff out until finally started being accepted and and soon enough he was you know his shows were you know we're all over the place\nDid you have a chance to talk this got Carol surly rods wife\nI did not unfortunately no no the way they had a a treat with that quite a person indeed I bet yeah yeah\nNow with with rod he started before he got in the twilight zone you as a writer for other kinds of shows was any\nOh sure sure cigarettes and some people may not know this but rod Serling was without question the most prestigious writer in television before the twilight zone\nHe had written you know he won three consecutive Emmy Award for best dramatic writing in Nineteen fifty five fifty six and fifty seven a twilight zone started and fifty nine\nI'm so he was at the top of the of the heap or before the twilight zone came out and he just kind of took that for ... you know just straight for drama\nSensibility into the twilight zone and gave it that little fantasy twist on it\nHe was very socially minded and I think he was frustrated because a lot of times when he wanted to put social things in his writings prior to the twilight zone the sponsors went ballistic and always tried to a critique him editorialize and even controlling\n[noise] yeah yeah that was that was the big you know the big problem that certainly ran into is that he believe that it's a writer's job to do those things that the writer job to address the issues of his time\nAnd every time he tried to address any issue of any social import on television the censors would get this way the sponsors would get in this way\nAnd it was frustrating for him and\n... he was successful enough and he had built such a name for himself that they were willing to give him his own show and he had always loved science fiction he loved fantasy science fiction horror\nYou know all that kind of thing so he created the twilight zone because he's always wanted to do a show like the twilight zone but he also was able to take it\nAnd say you know what I can probably get some of this stuff by if I did it in a fantasy or science fiction setting when it will be a little less a controversial\nScare Murray twilight zone episode Nick that I recall every twilight zone episode had some kind of social issue or a meaning behind it it wasn't just a television show where the cool ending it had a message to\nEl absolutely if it was a a television series that just had\nA cruel twist ending we wouldn't be talking about it right now you know ... it's a it was always deeper than that certainly certainly episodes were always deeper than that um because he again believe that that was part of a the artists job the art if it's going to be art it has to what he would say that has to say something about something\nAnd you know it has to be entertaining he did wants to entertain but at the same time you have to say something about something\nWhat do you think some of the ... that he wanted to address in his work\nWell you know throughout his career of the big the biggest issue was prejudice um rot had this this innate aversion to prejudice and he believed it was\n... I Believe that all evils stemmed from prejudice that that's the beginning and that's the root of all of them so he wanted to address that idea that um we have this\nUm this tendency to look to other people to uh for our own faults when we should be looking within will blame somebody else instead and that that idea came out\nThere are people to uh for our own fault when we should be looking within will blame somebody else instead and that that idea came out constantly throughout the twilight zone before and after\nHe in some of the things that he wrote about of course we're pretty dramatic but what do you think has kept the twilight zone so strong all these years I mean we're talking about sixty years now\nAnd next next year will be the sixtieth anniversary of the you know the debut in Nineteen fifty nine\nAnd yeah it is you know I just recently there was a magazine was released I'm a science fiction magazine that but it it was ranking the top one hundred television series of all time and it wasn't just science fiction as all television series and the only black and white TV series on the cover was the twilight zone is the only the only one who made it\nAnd at this point you know you ask the average twenty five year old [noise]\nThey're not getting any black and white TV series but they know what the twilight zone is it's entered the consciousness\nJust as a term you know people know that\nThe twilight zone means what you think it means it means something is off kilter something is strange something is not quite right and it lasted all this time because of of routes messages and because quite frankly just because it was it was so good you know it was just so well written so well produced so well acted\nA it was just a first class production from from get from point a to point the you know so so that's I think white has lasted all these years\nI've got this great letter in my office in Los Angeles from Ray Bradbury\nWho wrote the script I sing the body electric for the twilight zone and it was one of my favorites and I it's a Bradbury had heard about it and I had a written an article about it in or what we have what's called the after dark newsletter\nAnd Bradbury just loved it he said this was one of the greatest things I've ever seen about my ... my shows and thank you so much and so he sends me this letter that I've got and that's you know posted on my uh my board in my office about what role I didn't write all the scripts he oversaw things but he did right he had some writers like Bradbury\nSure no not listen nobody could write every script on you know a rod wrote Ninety two of the hundred and fifty six twilight zone episodes over five see that's pretty prolific\nOf that is that's ridiculous I mean nobody right from Ninety two shows in a five year five season periods just if you know and and at the same time he was doing other things you know so the amount that he produced is just it's\nJust off the charts I I'm just convinced he never slept you just never slept from Nineteen fifty to Nineteen Seventy five that was it [laughter]\nHe smoked a lot though didn't he\nYeah he sure did unfortunately he was he was just addicted here is just addicted to it maybe he got that in in the war as well um but um it was ultimately a big part of his mother's death\nUm yeah I absolutely had heart issues and that's what's on the demand you said that brought into rural do well over two hundred and fifty total scripts on some of the things he did I mean that's amazing if he wrote Ninety two twilight zones and two hundred and fifty others the total shows that's crazy isn't it\nIt it really is you know when I was researching the book it it's you know this couple of things that are really really impressive fat well first of all yeah he run Ninety two twilight zone episodes he also wrote thirty eight of the night gallery stories of some of those that's\nA hundred and thirty scripts right there so there's a hundred and at least a hundred and twenty other things he did besides ... gallery\nStay with those deck we're going to take a break we'll come back and talk more next hour we'll take phone calls with\nHer about a about the twilight zone and the ... with us his book is called the rod Serling is life more than imagination [noise]\nAnd with my personal fitter for guarantee our guarantee your blinds will fit role remake the free of charge you only pay shipping now there's no reason to ever pay a high price professional whereby poorly fitting ready made blinds visit ... dot com today and save a bundle\nTests because listeners take up to fifty percent off any order just use the code coast at checkout that's blinds dirt dot com blinds T.

waiting for puberty the strike what can I say\nIt really you were in three twilight zone episodes right\nThree of the original and then I was in the future and then I wrote one of the UPN episodes and then we return to it's a good life with ... and my daughter lily ana for it's still a good life back in two thousand three so I kinda got six notches on my belt when it comes to the tea zone\nAnd when you were in those episodes and they were being done was rod Serling around there was was he there\nAbsolutely I yeah I was on the set when he did as you know bumpers and intros and ah [noise] yeah he was definitely around and you know it's interesting because there was no regular cast\nOn a twilight zone so he was the only regular cast member and every time he was on the set because you know he and the producer buck out and work really thing kill the in charge of the vision of that show and wrestled\nControl from network hassling as much as they could uh every all the heads of all the different departments were always very happy\nTo see a Mr certainly when he was on the set and talk to him about what was coming up and the next episode her so usually when an executive producer or creator comes on and it was sad and they were but he gets a little uptight yoga that you know or when Alan's here [laughter]\nOr whatever but uh I recall quite clearly that a rod Serling was on the set everybody was delighted to be around to\nTalk with you yeah yeah sure we went out for Marguerite as every night and you know that's right and how old were you you're in a little kid\nI was six uh six and seven and nine\nThat somehow didn't they find you believe in these parts [noise]\nUm well actually the one of the very first lead roles like it was a an episode of ... to young show that was directed by James Sheldon the chorus Leishman played by mom and a\nAnd the director of that show brought me and for the first twilight zone James Sheldon he brought me in for a long distance call and he also directed it's a good life\nSo having to under my belt\nOr I guess they just you know just called me up for in praise of pet\nBusy guy and you were you were in ... now what do you do in these days really what's new\nWell a Angela car right now I've just released are novel a fantasy novel I think we talked about it when we were first writing any time and go charge on purpose it's called the devil ... and all the adversary his weapon\nFlow you set yourself with some uh for the show OK\nYeah love to do that and I'm ... thrown ancient aliens and you know I'm playing the real Dr Smith on the new lost in space so [noise]\nMaking music too you know keep ... thinks that's it you got it by George Bailey movie you're not a treat neck yet and I was thinking George so that was great uses a rod Serling for you on this show you never know [laughter] you might say my calling from the from the other side what inspired you to read the book about certainly\nWell I mean I became a a twilight zone fanatic when I was a kid nine ten years old I was just you know mesmerized by the show and and so that started everything [noise]\nAnd then really since then I've just uh it's been a very gradual process of becoming aware of all this other stuff that he had written a you know so much of it that was great and I I just wanted to\nCollect all this information about all of these shows that he had written and and it was it was just surprising to me that no one had actually\nI'm done this type of thing where for example\nPlease a list of all the shows that certain rod Serling wrote that were produced for television or or or film believe\nIt or not I mean every list I went to had things missing had ever had yeah gas or whatever but so that had never been done so the first thing I wanted to do is I Want to know exactly what he wrote you know for his entire career that was produced in any form whatsoever so\nAnd then once I did that I just I just you know just snowball from there I wanted to give some information about these shows I wanted to present them in a way that you know the reader who is never going to see a lot of these shows I mean they're not the twilight zone and not in that gallery there not been at it I haven't been commercially released\nUm I Want to give that reader an idea of what these shows were about\nSo you know so that that was the idea behind the whole thing and then the book became you know it's part that is part you know a videographer you reference guide but it's also part biography and his part you know critical analysis of the the theme certainly was was dealing with an a character types that he you know that he researched and you know develop into an ...\nDid you come across anything that surprised you in your research\nI came across several things that surprised me yes I'm\nProbably the most surprising thing that I found was you may have heard of a particular shall we talked about the sponsors before and how they would you know bought up against sterling whenever he tried to do anything that was remotely controversial whether there's one show that's particularly infamous in that regards called it's called noon on doomsday\nIt was rod Serling attempt to tell some kind of version of the Emmett Till lynching in Mississippi I'm for those who don't know him until the fourteen year old African American a boy who was lynched in Mississippi after allegedly whistling at a white woman\nAnd this really just\nDestroyed rod Serling she wants to sell some of the story\nAnd Everytime he tried to he you know you have met resistance well I was able to find the ... the actual first draft of this script that rod wrote before any of these um you know any of these into a interference is came into play\nAnd there have been several studies of this particular show in the evolution that it's so from from you know the where it was initially to to what aired on on on television well but none of those studies had the actual first draft and I just luckily\nFound the actual first draft in that surprised me because of all spoil it for you know it's not all that much different than what actually aired on television so this book is going to tell you a completely different version of that noon on doomsday controversies story than than you've ever heard anywhere else\nNovember twenty second Nineteen sixty three president John F. Kennedy was assassinated how did that affect the rod Serling\nIt ah it devastated them he was um [noise] you know superficially he was a Kennedy admirer he was he agreed with the politics and he [noise] he admired Kennedy but beyond that it was just it really you know I came across a letter that rotted written to um\nTo his ... can't say pastor but he was a Unitarian of most of his life for most of his adult life rod Serling was and he wrote a letter to one of his Unitarian a priest so to speak and and he just said how it just kind of it just took away his faith in humanity\nThat something like this could happen he felt that we were in you know in a dark age in dark ages whereas something like this could happen so\nIt really it just yeah it it it throw him for it threw him into a dark place for a little while and strangely enough what happened was the day after the assassination he and William fruit that one of the producers on this while its own were contacted by the state department\nAnd ask to produce a film to introduce Lyndon Johnson to the world while it was a document that they needed a documentary they\nQuick that we can just send to our allies and present to people so you know here's here's the new president and so rod Serling the day after the assassination when he was you know depressed for sure flew to Washington DC and began immediately working on this documentary to introduce President Johnson to the world\nSo he didn't he finished\nYeah in fact the you know the uh\nThe the people who asked him to do this I said we ... we need this in five days [laughter] and and and William fruits have listened that's not going to happen we [laughter] we can't do it in five days but we'll do the best we possibly can and they you know as we said before I was so prolific and he was so such a fast writer he did get through it pretty quickly and they had they had it ready\nYou know I I actually don't know exactly the timeframe wasn't five days but it wasn't much much longer than that\nWhat is it about black and white TV shows that have a different feel than the color shows that we all see nowadays\nBecause if you take action\nIf you do something about your mortgage problems you're far more\nTo get the most positive outcome\nThe housing expert about the options that are right for you\nOr visit making Home Affordable dot com and do something about\nEr visits making before the dot com or do something about\n[noise] news and talk on the radio\nNews radio thirteenth windfall Idaho you first\nSaudi Arabia now turkey Hi Dave Anthony Fox News secretary of state Pompeo has now moved on on the mission to find out what happened to that journalists presumed murdered he says in his talks with the Saudi leaders\nI stress the importance\nThem conducting complete investigations are in such a moment showing they made a commitment to the\nDoctor Simon oh and monitoring it all live in London\nDay the secretary of state meeting with Cherokees presidents as well as the foreign minister who described the talks as beneficial and fruit salt diminish to also sang Turkish police ... she went to the rest of the to the top Saturday get punished on both today the consul general they ... as a pro government newspaper techie publishes\nThe tails of an alleged audio recording claiming to ... jeep being taught should killed\n... men but inside the Saudi considered Saudi Arabia to the allegations ...

a sweet tooth level animal people wouldn't want to pet him and\nThat come up and they get close to him and it would be asked and my dad didn't want to touch like get the dog away from me even after we give her ... she would still stay very stinky both bad breath and bad gas I asked the vet and he had some dogs better than she\nDoes your dog ditch scratch stink worship like crazy come to China for help\nI N o v I T E mailed me a leg up three fatty I think felt the digestive as vital that are cooked out of regular dog food\nOh he has horrible horrible incident I'm a helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set\nA who's yeah you cast they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation you know in Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead you're high\nLike a couple of questions or one would be the first one would be that seems like it was very escapist\nWithin maybe someone stay back in the Sixers I'm just speculating that you had a record jobs and they came home and watch the twilight zone that would be almost like an escape from your daily reality\nAnd I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there any other shows really like that my\nSecond question would be about the mysterious endings which I think a lot of that could be almost a not necessarily ethic book could've unfolded into actual movies additional scenes\nUh where uh someone could take a twilight zone episode and kind of unfold and into an actual movie you know like a planet of the apes\nYeah I I I agree with you on that and and to get to the first question you know the yeah the escapist aspect that the twilight zone and that I think that is part of all science fiction and fantasy of course is that that\nA scape is tone to it um but you know it's funny that you you mentioned that because that has actually something that rod Serling uh often pointed to about ... gallery ah in the early seventies during the end of the Vietnam\nEra he felt that night gallery was giving people in the ... from the nightly news and seeing you know the stuff on you know stuff on the news about war and everything else that they go into the gallery an escape\nA through that so he never really said that about the ... some but I think the similar a point can be made about the twilight zone as well and it is surprising that that that someone hasn't taken you know a twilight zone episode\nAnd expanded it into a feature film although there's been there have been plenty of films that are certainly twilight zone in ... you know influenced that could very well just as just as well be toilets on movies that are called the twilight zone\nWas it Jack Lemmon on one of the twilight zones\nHe started for twilight zone yeah actually they actually started one with the movie um in praise of tip that's right yeah yeah and he was terrific guy Jack Lemmon probably gave my favorite performances on the twilight zone and and three of the episodes that he was\nHe was he a trumpet player in one of them\nExactly yes there's one called the passage for Trump rod wrote that one and I'll tell you a quick story about that episode you know he the director\nUm jak caught me was so good in that episode is just so good that the director actually wrote or called rod and said listen I don't want to take the camera off of this guy I just wanted to keep filming [laughter] you'll have to answer any way we can make this into a two part episode he wants to expand the effort to an allergist\nI don't want to take the camera off of this guy I just want to keep filming [laughter] you'll have to answer any way we can make this into a two part episode he wanted to expand into an allergist because jak cotton was so good and rod said you know there's some you just can't get on the budget we can't can't do more than half an hour but that's that's saying something with a director says listen I'm just gonna let this guy going I'm just going to film whatever does\nClassic classic classic Jason in Portland, Oregon is with us now Jason governance or\nWell where are you folks wherever that Presidents Day there's they why like those radios theater and they take some of the old episode he ran for the radio and they also incorporate residents date things and have a current topics like a just a couple of weeks ago I heard when it had to do with\nA nano robots eating up um oil spill in the problem that that could present at and I just thought the end it thank you and I think with the sterling stay\nCool did you know about that next\nI I was not aware of the current uh uh uh current radio series no there actually was a twilight zone a series of radio dramas of the original episodes that was produced some uh not too long ago but no I wasn't aware of a of a currently no\nDidn't write ever writes radio in his early days\nOh sure yeah that's that's where he really got his start was in radio his first sales were to a word to a series called Grand Central station that air and I think on CBS um CBS network\nAnd the road you know for radio or in college\nAnd so yeah that was that was the beginning before he broke and and actually the funny thing is he actually went back to radio and created a radio series in Nineteen fifty four so basically four years after he had broken into television he actually went back to work in Cincinnati and created this radio series called it happens to you\nAnd it was a series of Thirteen um original radio script\nWhere did he end up living Los Angeles\nA yes or while he once he lived in most in Pacific palisades for most of his a professional career and then he always went back to uh Africa in upstate New York every summer and then he was teaching it if it gets so we kind of gradually spent more time uh and it's like the later in life\nWhen he got sick was belonged illness or did you go suddenly\nUm [noise] well it was it was pretty sudden he you know he had\nWho's ... years old was any or something\nLike that was fifty yeah he was supposed to then get a couple of heart attacks and he went in for a bypass procedure which was fairly you know cardiac bypass procedure which was and it was in Philly new yeah\nTime uh and you know it's interesting you know how new it was because if you read some of the news stories at the time about the surgery they'll explain to you exactly what the surgery is you know they're going to take a vein of artery from this here and put it here it's like nowadays you wouldn't have to say any of that you know what a cardiac bypasses but that back then it was so new that that explains the surgery and\nHe had the surgery and the doctors thought he was successful and um by the time they were selling 'em up he had another heart attack on the table and that was pretty much at\nSteve's with us first time caller in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Hi Steve\nHow to er er I got a little trivia but a\nRide a uh I Lived in central New York from seven day period at Seventy five and I worked on a military base called cynical army ... was okay and I would say a big a big arts and all that had nuclear weapons\nAre quite a few actually been on a nerd a anyway rides home woods about two or three miles from that day\nAnd a a little town called ... up the road about Mao and a half or two miles was a little courage softer where are you ... where I used to have a purge brokered bug and that's where rod Finn died when he\nWhere are you ... where I used to have a ... and that's\nWhere I used to spend that yeah when he he had a a swimming pool built on its property there a couple of miles away right next to be a base ah it's actually an arsenal\nAnd uh I used to talk to the uh [noise] a postmaster it sounds like a one room a\nPurge of office and I could I I heard ... that comes in once in a while and I always wish I had met him but I never did but I I think that's where he's the uh syndicates tape cuts to Los Angeles to uh the uh contrived encouraged a\nTV program and uh\nYou know he's very here already you know as as I say you lived right on Lake or yoga or an in Ithaca an astronaut not far uh so yeah it could very well be and he would and he would dictate in Ithaca and some of the Senate tapes out to Los Angeles to be to be transcribed\nInteresting Steve what else you know about him what's that what else do you know about it and that's cool well\nUh when his career started the sink a little bit ah he went back to that area and he taught at a I Believe it's Cornell University down there and uh he uh he's buried not far\nFrom it that we're in some way it's been a little cemetery called uh enter lake and right on the lake and much loved that area in its wife up when they first got married they had their honeymoon there a on a lake or\n... a her relatives parents probably on their property and he bought it eventually and they live there and they always went back there on a summer to uh write and relax\nAnd uh but uh a funny thing is he used to do a little radio a promotion for uh people he know in the area like a shoe store whatever might be on store I mean that was kinda cute you'd hear of locally or\nJust to help him out of it now let's just to help 'em out\nYeah absolutely ... already which really nice guy\nThat's the way to do it in a sense of ... he had a heart of gold\nHe did he he really was incredibly generous with his time or he would do things like that all the time he would he would marry things for you know for free for people or people have to college or or local businesses as as you as Steve mentioned and yeah he would absolutely and and you know going through his\nCorrespond to see what rod Serling kept everything he ever ever ... every letter he ever wrote he kept and that they still exist than you would think he responded to every single fan letter he ever received personally on your personal letters really signed and everything [noise]\nUm he took that time to do that and it's really amazing that that you can't really find a somebody saying a bad
