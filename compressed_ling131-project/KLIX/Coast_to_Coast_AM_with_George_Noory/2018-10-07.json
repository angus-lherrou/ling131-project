you know I mean it just is what it is you just can't help it it's it's in your mind that's what you do you you would if you weren't that beach hanging out there with them you would just be just dying\nFlu I can relax a little bit the despite you know just by one of my friends will tell you I can relax I can show but you know I'll give you one quick example I was in Newfoundland or about ten years ago\nAnd I was there with a friend of mine were traveling around looking icebergs and part of the reason that I went there was because ah there's been a series of lobsters are the have washed up these you know mysterious\nMasses of you know sea creatures or wherever they are and they washed up there but uh so I wanted to go investigate some of that and there's also Spring Hill jak signing up there but as I was up there I came across um up a place called lake crushed and\nUm and it's this little you know new Finland is it's beautiful it's just you know it just Craig crevices and everything and it turns out that there's there's a local lake monster there and so and they actually have a like a twenty foot\nA metal sculpture thing this thing as you enter the town the town of the population is like three or four or something\nI wrote to the car and like I put on the break but I got a [noise] I I Can't pass a lake monster come on cry and you know my friends rolls her eyes like [noise] All right\n[laughter] well it's better than stopping for the biggest world's biggest a ball of yarn or something like that right that's right I'm with you [laughter] that's great stuff okay so I'm I'm before I go on you know this week I was like okay you know what I Want to talk about the origins of Halloween so I\nI Google that boom towns your article that even written 'cause you you do a lot of writing your author of course that you do a lot of writing for our life science dot com Discovery News skeptical inquiry magazine and um and some others out there too\nBut I saw this great article from you and I was like oh my gosh here's the guy you know\nAnd so it looked into your background so you were legit you weren't just somebody\nOr anything like that you actually research so so tell me about the origins now we're ... we're just now learning the origins of the Lewis wean the galaxy or use a lean\nSee this is ... I I I Want the two hundred years from now when people are researching the order says well if we and they're going to come up with this conversation hurry I'll love it might make her grandkids will be be all over it there'll be like\nNo I Want one of the things I Love about about you know to to to be honest with you I'm not I'm not big on the on the holidays mean your Christmas is fun blah blah but but you know to my mind the one that I really look forward to Halloween\n'cause it's it's you know it it secular a you know people of all religions can enjoy it uh you know sometimes the fundamentalists gets all the the the conservative sometimes get all touchy about that because they think it's really the the the cult which is not but it's it's it's basically something that everybody can sort of jump into\nAnd that's why I really love Halloween is it's it's more than just costumes and candy has a fascinating history\nI'm basically Halloween a ... you know as as with most of these sorts of sort of folklore Rick these events and holidays there is not just one street line back right I mean there's there's different influences that come in overtime\nBut basically we can trace it back thousands of years to an October thirty first a Celtic her daily festival called a so when [noise]\nUh and uh we don't we don't have that much information about just because it was that it was so long ago and there was no the the on the records or pre Sparky fragmentary\nBut it was basically an annual communal a meeting at the end of the year of the harvest and it was a time when of course you know it's wintertime the sole says ... and it's a time when I'm you know the the the snow's falling in you know plants are dying\nUm so it had this connection to uh to darkness\nBut it wasn't sinister by modern standards mean when we ... we think we think of the darkness as being you know something faster but to them a ... there was very it was much more of an an analyst\nPoint of view wasn't about death or evil it with the changing of the seasons um and so that was so ... so to the people that were celebrating it so it wasn't scary it was like yes there was a time to you know to a store or grains and to give thanks to to to to the gods and and the the spirits and this and that [noise]\nUm and it was believed that uh that on that day that the um uh the the the separation between the world's was especially thin and porous\nSo the rest of the year you know we we were in our happy little world and you know the the other creatures the other Ken [laughter] you know the the ferry folk or what have you there in their own world and they leave us alone and we leave them alone but on this day\nThe the the er the barrier between them becomes more porous [noise] um and so this is why are the the began talking about how spirits would would come come forth on this day and it was people were much more likely to be able to uh see spirits and they were basically all around us\nAnd it wasn't just the um it wasn't just the the idea that the the world are porous\nUm the the barrier between them but also um in leader incarnations of Halloween it was also that uh time is porous\nAnd so what you find is that a ... who would later become Halloween I'm there would be a it would be basically a time when I Would be for a time for prophecy\nSo it was this notion that uh you know there's ... there's other worlds but there's also the barrier between the president in our future and so\nThis notion that uh you know there's ... there's other world but it's also the barrier between the president in our future\nAnd so uh for example in the Eighteen hundreds or there were different custom that were that were involved the Halloween which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them but there were ideas for example that\nThe that are on for example woman born a Halloween would be able to tell the future [noise]\nUm and there would be a proxy and often times the prophecy\nA was um either dealing with like people who might die the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage so if it was often times there's there's very superstitions about young women who would on on Halloween Night\nApproaching apple they would uh be with a light a candle for a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with a look at the mirror at midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection [noise]\nUm and so all these sorts of another one example is up for Apple you know if you're down near the apple bobbing and there was there was a particular holiday tradition\nThat if you cut a pie appealed an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken and he talked it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell the initials of your future husband so there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and pass imprisoned coming together\nOn my way man I got to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night so I Do it and do it at midnight right\nOn willfully night\nThat's right will swing [laughter] well what about\nUm you may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to\nYou know 'cause I I get there are people that say Halloween a saint saint saint ... and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that that that they're cool with it you know um but um you know I always\nSee it as fun I see it as a I I mean if you say Halloween I immediately saying a cold Jack o lantern that you get to make I think a fall whether I think of orange and black colors I think a fake little cartoons that we would watch like which isn't the goblins\nAnd and very fun fun things that's how I see it and it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and all of a sudden they take the fun out of it in the traditions out of that and\nAnd uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're going to have to take a break here but what we have an abandoned Radford with us he is as an investigator and and into all the things that were into a\nAs coast the folks here that want to learn everything um but he also you know there's a lot of writing and he looked into the origins of Halloween and we're going to learn more from him about that and also goes hunting too so stay with this kind of well let's hear it's Willis we hang in there you don't know what you might hear tonight\n[noise] [noise]\nWelcome back to coast to coast am county Willis here discussing the origins of Halloween on Willis wean talking with been Radford been so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have a um an interesting history\nVery rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get said panicking gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around the time of Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanuts you know characters that's always fun with the ah great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but that like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know it it they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that they can do that any time of the year\nOh you don't know the the creativity to go to target and put on you know a bad man asking me make make I'm I'm Out of it you know\nYes agreed and and and do you know make a Jack o lantern and put a real candle in there and let smell that smell of burning pumpkin is so cool I Love it love at all [noise]\nAbsolutely no I mean that's that's one of the you know that that's really what the of course these days um although your Halloween was never really made me a children's holiday and it really didn't become focused on kids he go about Nineteen fifty\nBefore that it was I mean kids were involved but it wasn't really a kid the kid centered of it is today a it was it more of a community thing again sort of if you go back to\nGo back to solve when and the the the early a Celtic version of it\nAnd again sort of dealing with the changing of the season and darkness in snow and all that [noise]\nUm but you know so you you have that and then that sort of what happened was that um that that someone got mixed in along with all saints day which was November first which was you know ... obviously the next day which was a to honor that the church a church members will have to have gone to heaven\nAnd then also got wrapped up to a whole whole day which is November second which bills are wrong for the soul purgatory\nAnd so there was this there was it was interesting transition from an early purely pagan\nUm um you know ritual which died out long before you know the church was was even writing about devils anything like that and then you have the the influence of the Catholic Church with all things in a whole day\nAnd and again they were the ... ah bells and sometimes the bills are wrong to keep away a demons and scary things could loud noises verse head to scare away the evil [noise] um and that's where it transforms little later on into the modern costumes because what what happened is\nI'm a you know 'cause we are talking about you where the cost and you come from and one one part of it is that uh it believe that a drink so in the ... leaders would where animals skins\nI'm there and sometimes the animal heads like antlers whatnot during the ceremonies\nAnd they weren't there they weren't doing it to fool anybody of course everybody who they were but it was it was a ritual thing in terms of honoring the land and the animals that were given to them [noise]\nUm but then later on during the late Eighteen ... Seventeen hundreds and England was customary for the wealthy remembers in town to offer a small payment or food\nUm to the poor during Halloween preparing for the dead and this again the ties back into all day because the idea was that\nUm that on that day ah the soul of the word purgatory you know they were they were basically trapped between heaven and hell they needs to be prayer prayed for a and so the the the wealthy members of the other communities would basically\nA higher out there were ... they were subcontracted the prayers if you will to these numbers and so these these people would go from house to house asking for what were called full cakes where which type of bread and in return for paying for a for praying for those purgatory so they would they would do dances and songs rituals\nAre going from house to house getting little tokens of of of food\nOr or coin 'em and often times they would care with them how to turn it\nOf course that would lead or translate into uh the the the the uh the public and um but the candle at land for the candle in it\nAnd the candle light represented the soul the person they would pray for the idea was that they would these numbers go as far as to how say you know yes will pray for if you have a member of your family who's\nA who's passed on I'm with you know holding up this this turn up with a candle to think of this late as the the soles the coach wants to pray for them they would say yes\nAnd then of course when that came over with the Irish immigrants to to America\nUm the turn of the sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if you ask me\nTo read when that's when the pumpkins came in because the pumpkins associate course they're they're bigger they're they're more fun to carve and our associate with the harvest and that's that sort of how the the trick or treating asked that came along\nOh I like that yeah I agree with you turn now move on [laughter] ... says Munch on little olive oil salt pepper um candy I guess I guess it all turned into candy at one point in that like right after the ... like you were talking about\n[noise] yeah well I mean if it was interesting because because again the sort of\nFirst out along gender lines for a while because what happened is um that if you think about it you know again there was the the mom and going on this that\nAnd then uh the the during this time of the the jitters had pretty strict social and so\nUm and as I mentioned earlier during Halloween by the time when when young girls would would ah would kind of way and with ... think of you know who which which cute boy they would marry and the next town over who probably had three or four teeth at the time he knows\nBecause that's what they did um but you know so that that's what they were doing so so ... if you think about like during the time this is when people would go from house to house look into the mom and get sort of gone away but the tradition of going to people's houses to knock on the door and you know sort of\nTrick or treat and give us give us a little token or something\nYou would be inappropriate for young women to do that they wouldn't really go out alone by themselves during during that era so if that was typically sort of a young man you know ... a mysterious young men project and the the the girls and women were tend to be more indoors and that's where you get the apple bobbing\nAnd rituals and terms of you know the prophecy enough those sorts of things so [noise] so you know by the late Eighteen hundreds the tradition of playing pranks on Halloween was pretty well established and and that's when ah you know as the as the religious aspect sort of faded away right I mean they were [noise]\nPeople were no longer you know going from house to house asking for little bits of bread to to pray for you know sold in purgatory [laughter] that's that's a little less a little a little bit of outlandish for for a little too much work for these days\nSo that's when this sort of came down to treat a and even even today I mean I remember when I was a kid or not so long ago I like to say uh you know they were it was a number of you know every now I get to get a silver dollar or are you sometimes you get an apple you're like really\nReally only a capital okay and I like it was it wasn't even that I like it was like some really tart apple it was like you went out of your way to find a nasty apple did you I didn't say that I'm like you but anyway [laughter]\nYou know well I you know I remember when we would go I'm a long time ago it was great you remember the good houses together too because they were there were years where you would get full size candy bars and by the way if you came up to our house which was on a hill and it was scary and we would play that'll\nHaunted house record where you heard the green in which is right and it was very dark so if you if you were asked if you were brave enough to go to our house you would get full size bars you know marathon bars and you get a handful now you're\nThe only perimeter marathoners that I Love the marathon bars but they were looking at all and chocolate and they they were like a foot and a half long yeah and they were just great they're just going to have those I I haven't heard anybody mentioned those in decades oh yeah that's a horrible ... you got a full and you got a phone line is you can't replace a wish I'd been there\nI Can't believe they don't make those any more of those are fantastic but but we were when we would go trick or treating and we had to go kind of far up one hill this way money all the other way and you had your students on that's when they had those are nasty nasty you couldn't breathe or anything but at the time [laughter]\nBut we would never say one house it always had homemade popcorn balls\nThey were delicious it was the only time we ever had on there were awesome and you know back then you could trust the people\nAnd then of course you know you hear about razor blades in apples and things like that but then there was another person's house that they were a dentist and they only gave away toothbrushes like we don't want to go there you know thank you yeah trick or treat thank you [laughter]\nI should mention that because of all three answers the the the more modern scares\nThe the classic a poison ... and the reason the ... yeah and the fact is that that I mean that's that's there's there's almost no truth to that uh it's it's widely talked about a friend of mine Joel Best wrote a book about that um and and you know so when you actually look at\nAt the cases where somebody who's actually painted the sorts of things [noise] um if it happens very rarely there there was one case of what he points to it was a case of a man

yup ever on all the\nProducers were were watching that show or say hey you guys are going on there\nNow are so well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and the say panic part and all that good stuff\nNow another element is is some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage there pass doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff\nAnd now what they do is they go into cemeteries or they go into the woods or they go into you know the um um houses down the street that nobody ... the abandoned homes or\nThan in hospitals and things like that and they go inside these places and they use the energy board on Halloween Night or they or they use now all these different devices\nTo call upon spirits and goes now you have you ever written quite a few books actually and you do a lot of writing and oh my gosh good for you I I despise writing that's why I like to talk [laughter]\nMonroe social life I'll just say that all all with [laughter]\nI'd be like you let your latest book is about goes hunting and investigating what to look for what to do and also um what it used to be like in the past and what the differences are now I find I found it interesting that you had said to me uh that\nUh people will go into cemeteries and they'll ask to talk to his spirit were years back people would go well why would you want to talk to a stranger you know maybe call upon your family member or somebody you know and that's true I call it up you know\nNo that was that was that was one of the things that I uh when I was researching my book are investigating goes to those is basically a survey of\nOf the scientific attempts to to contact the dead I'm ranging from basically pre history a but primarily through the the you know the Victorian era upper upper today's you know goes hunters and all that\nAnd what you find is that the the idea that I mean you know people have been talking to the dead for millennia I mean that's you know there's references or in the which of indoor and the Bible and Shakespeare you know your lady Macbeth I mean banquet so there's there's there there there's no shortage of go see him in literature and history\nBut you know typically go or or if it's typically if people if you wanted to talk to a ghost you'd be talking to them for a reason for example you'd be talking to me your your your great grandfather or your your your best friend that that died recently\nUm and the the idea that somebody would go into like a haunted house whether the Myrtle plantation or are you the Wally house or you know what what have you go to a hundred location\nAnd talk to\nSome random spirit that happens to be there and say\nHi can you give us inside and you don't know me but tell me about yourself that that's that's a that's a relatively new phenomena hum and it's it faster you know you go back to look at the the the answer that were held in in the Victorian era are offering up or class\nUh places and they would have you know a lady they they've Crumpet the tea and the and you know they try to communicate with goats and then you would have the spiritual era [noise]\nUm and you had people like Harry Houdini printed research then Marjorie ... and all these spiritual if the you know came to the states and\n[noise] um and you had people like Harry Houdini printed research the Marjorie crammed in all these spiritual if the you know came to the states and Medicaid Maggie Fox and and and they're you know their their stuff and so\nAnd then you're Harry ... researching all that and then you sort of fast forward to uh the the the ATP idea and you know the electronic voice phenomena and the idea that you can record to communicate with ghost or through white noise improve basically a broken radio that switches channels\nAnd then you sort of fast forward to\nTo the more modern day goes to hunter with the the TV shows and all the spin offs and goes inventors and all that and it's just fascinating when you sort of look at the history of the sorts of things and went through techniques have been tried and and you know what works and what doesn't end and how do we know\nYeah I think it's a you know it's already kind of creepy enough or spooky enough or even scary enough when you do get some sort of interaction when you are going to try to talk to spirit beaches\nUm it's it's scary when you get somebody talking to you but\nPeople take that step further and they hope in pinch and you don't know who they're poking at ... I mean they're really trying hard to get interaction and you don't you don't know if that's going to be somebody nice or not and are these things go wrong with you you know that's where\nI grew up in a haunted house I the last thing I wanted to go around me I prefer going sledding or looking at the sky lights I don't want something going home with me even though people claim that those things go home with them too\nBut you know what I mean ... if you um and you talked about ... and things like that one of my friends is archbishop James long and James is like you know folks quick provoking quit provoking you don't know who or what you're talking\nTo and that's what they were there which that you're not doing yourself and you have are thereby poll whatever may be there\nRight you don't know what it is if it's evil or not evil or what it is that All right I mean\nUm you you talk about in your book there's different guidelines for scientifically investigating these reports how you do that scientifically\n[noise] ... there's a couple of things you know one of the first thing you do is um you establish I mean I I've done I've done you know many goes investigations myself\nUm and as I said I I come to it and more science based or someone who's skeptical point of view that doesn't mean that I just knew everything it just means that you know I'm not going to believe any we're you know sound as that goes and so for the first thing that I Do when I go into a case is try to establish\nA water the false viable claims that is what exactly is being claimed you know if someone saying that there's\nThere's a mysterious found or a laughing or something in the hallway or is there a photograph for me what what exactly is is is going on there and the question is\nCan we tested it'd repeatable right is it is it is found that comes up you know every every full moon I'm you know what's going on here and so a lot of times ah unfortunately a lot of the the ghost hunting you see on TV\nUh is is not very scientific um it it it looks exciting look dramatic you know it's all of course you know reality\nTV and ... TV reality\nYou know in in scare quotes um and I and I've I've been on many of the TV shows as you pointed out I was a subject them you know on both sides of the camera on this\nAnd you know and my my point of view is always you know I I don't make fun of goes hundred 'cause I I've done goes hunting and I I've I've done a lot of that and so my my point is if you're going to do with and do it right\nYou know I I don't make fun of growth on her because I I've done goes hunting and I I've I've done a lot of that and so my my point is if you're going to do with and do it right you know bring science to bring good good critical thinking too so I'll give you one quick example so\nOne problem that I often see is that go centers on TV and and not actually just across the board is is are you in this applies even you know amateur groups across the country is they typically engage in what's called the anomaly hunting\nAnd that is they're they're looking for they're sampling the environment whether it's a ... or you know EMS or magnetic uh frequencies water temperature drops whatever it is and they're the they're they're sampling the environment looking for something weird\nAnd they're saying okay well if we will will go here and we'll be there from you know midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these ratings walk around we'll try and promote goes and the sort of things\nAnd then they get hours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them and they try and look for anything we all look at this at at three oh eight PM am you know we saw this thing\nAnd the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate\nThe original claims they're you know the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness and you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are\nEasy to investigate those particular claims and and oftentimes that sort of gets ... pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do this sort of sexy investigating and you know get the get the cameras on and we're going to walk around here and all these things\nAnd and and that that's part part of part of the problem here is that is that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that\nThat in almost all cases they don't they don't have a good grasp of of of ah of the amount of data needed\nTo to adequately sample a location so for example you'll see a ghost hundred go into location maybe there's a team of them and they'll they'll take readings for three hours or six hours whatever else and then they'll go home and analyze them\nThe problem is that's not nearly enough time\nTo get a good baseline right in order to know what's what's what's um paranormal abnormal you need to know what's normal\nEverything we tried sail except of\nPick up two bottles of super bigger fish oil get the third bottled free packed with a mega three D.

I went to him I said the story um it was made national news and people are you all this weird thing of uh\nAnd because I live in the state again I'm about an hour away I why went up there and investigators night I went and and I went to the courthouse and looked at the camera and I talk to the deputies I interviewed people\nAnd I had some ideas of what it might be um and I did some experiments I eventually you solve the case and figured out what it was and so part of the answer is you you look at the the the the video or the photograph and you try to figure out what or alternative explanations right so I\nUsually I make a list of three four or five different things you know could be could be an insect could be a hoax could be a ghost is there is there some I mean so\nYou just basically any anything that he is even remotely possible I tried to list those and I tried to rank them in terms of what's most likely which which things can I scientifically test which things can actually you know investigating falsify\n'em and you just basically go down the list and and that's that's one of the things I Do so so one key thing that the important uh and it's not always possible because sometimes you know it's\nThe the photograph is you know Thirty years old and it was taken in you know in in Poland and you know who knows where the hell that came from [noise]\nBut but when possible it's good to try and replicated so ... for example a woman sent me a photograph that she took in a hotel in Deadwood and I said you know\nAre you are you still there should know this was a couple of years back I knew it was just sort of image does he she saw in a room in the mirror and I said well again it's it would be I could I could be more help if this was a recent photograph not just a couple of years back in different states but I said\nWell you know if you if you do go back there if you were still there go back and tried to replicate it you know take take take\nHere's back in different states but I said well you know if you if you do go back there if you were still there go back and tried to replicate it you know take take ... take the photograph at the same place ideally at the same time of day um and see if you see if there's something in the background\nThat that you know might might be might be mistaken for an ... an image of her face or something\nI see so and I get that I get that and but you know I guess that that thing whatever that might be is just there like you said and it might be people might think of something else that uh\nWell I'll give you another example\nOf one of them\nAre going to say one of it is um\nYou know if it's on the one question comes up as the other people see it right and so this is I write is often the case of where\nYou know there's there's an extra for example behind standing behind somebody a and actually I was sent us an example this a couple of months back and they said oh this was the weirdest thing you know my cousins here and there was this there was a sort of weird go the image\nOr just behind her to the left\nUm you what do you think it is I said well again I I wasn't there it's kind of ... you know it's hard to beat conclusive about it without more information but I noticed that no one else around them noticed it I mean there there are other people who are you or nearby and no one is looking at this strange image to their left and so\nThat suggests that that they probably didn't see the time and it may or may not be a camera artifact\nI Gotcha I Gotcha hey you know it's it's hard because some things are picked up on camera that we don't see what the eyes some things are picked up from a certain angle but not another angle um they need and it's just\nYou know there's some things that are seen that it just is no way the shadow is and just that second you know you can take something out but then there's some really crazy things that are picked out that\nThat's I mean it just looks like there's no way it could be anything else but something creepy or you know worthy of\nA sane at this place was hunting for sure so you talk about uh goes hunting equipment to man has it changed a lot so what works what doesn't work\nAnd and by the way I think in the future we're going to have a whole lot of different types of devices that will measure some of the things we're looking to measure that that we can't measure right now it's all a new science you know\nWell yeah I mean ... you know one of the interesting aspects of of gross domestic Asian is um is the uh you know of ... for example I was I was doing a TV show called the myth request a while back and I was there with them a ghost hunters and um the flu is out to California to investigate a haunted place there and\nAnd they they brought in all this all these are the gross telling the equipment and just you know there's cameras and even after all is like you know probably Seventy thousand dollars with the gear\nAnd it was all set up and the cameras and lights and I are all that sort of thing and and I talked to one of the guys who brought all that stuff a little bit later I said you know I'm just curious and we weren't on camera with this wasn't like a gotcha moment where just hanging out with were finished\nShooting we're going back to hotel and said I said why do you think why do you think it is that that we don't we still don't have good quality evidence of ghost or I mean even to this day and again this is you know six seven years ago so you know even\nIf you have a

reason that I'm not so sure that this this dog among the is it so popular to tell stories of in in your parts of the world on here now is\nIs flesh and blood in the true sense of the world that we believe in the flesh and blood is is because I I I listen to the stories of hunters and the weapons that they've used ... these are these creatures and ... send to mess\nWith a thirty or six or even

don't think\nThis is by chance I think I'm probably pull these sites of great importance of what he would come to the great importance on the ... on and in these locations because location is key\nOn these little villages around the the old lake lake flicks and which is what we've said he's now dreidel seemed to have the ... the them off of that first set share of the science things of what's been to them the full extent well we'll have another one of the early science themes I got was a from a farmer who has a ... a cult bridge\nI think it's beginning to end just down to flicks them and he told me that it's not this is not some terrifying accountable nevertheless it's interesting he told me that\nAs a young boy fourteen or Fifteen Years old he worked with a an elderly from Kate and Kate and he's only a mile away from ... in Coney across across the the drive to the lake but\nOn the edge of the the ... the ... not an ... interesting with people is spelled C a double a ass\nAnd it means what law and so it's nothing to do with a ...\nSo he said that he worked for they sold from who was elderly then when he was a young boy called Jimmy teeth I mean I'm sure people in kittens history will still remember this guy\nAnd Jimmy Keith ... always swore the scene for corporate mum about seven foot so cool but they have on the case in ... he'd seen it warms\nClaim that he's five but at the end it's a nice grandfather it's seen it on that ... that was not sort of an historic scientists from ... you know going back to the Nineteen forties ... will probably so even earlier than that probably in the Nineteen twenties they Jimmy Case guy a and\nThey're not talking about something hugely most skillet from what I can gather outs of the stories [noise]\nAnd then to stay in Nineteen forty eight we can just about they they ... there's a series of very old mountains at the top of ... and uh so close together that they ... if you'd from if emerged them they would still be a small village and\nAnd these these young boys aged about eleven at the time you know\nHello well did you and I know there's just one that I I honestly thought my phone that exploded that was ... not [noise]\nRight let me tell you I'm not a stranger thought I was gonna be out of speaking to you then\nOh skin creepy now that they didn't and then I got like you slammed the phone down\nNo no it's in

H O W W E\nAnd these young boys and a proximity Nineteen thirty eight what all that long slate summer's evening they will both I used to love and one of them's passed away now they're the ones still lives lives in the village\nAnd um [noise] they were playing and they will put on these burial mountains and they said if you know it was a time when you could sort of people that the doors unlocked

of ... sit down on its own shoes [noise] looking up something and it comes and they definitely said homes and their claws\nThey couldn't say out totally would have said if it should have stood up they would have said he was well over six foot tall ... essentially it eats up the head on like ... an ounce Asians and and the cool within ... still to the features of of a of a dog at\nA mixture of both and they're still looking at this thing not very close they're looking at you and they can't believe what they're looking at this at very slowly\nIt lifted it had been looking at something and I said he's time's an old system now they didn't say a glowing red eyes or anything like that now they tuned and run [noise]\nStuck to the court and they went off on the heels on the way home now this thing never pursue them now that's another thing that makes me think I mean we've been looking at today ... credit for the [noise]\nAnd it's kind of\nI don't know about that kind of reaction when he sees

love mysteries um and I just I just think they're cool and they're fascinating and I try to go to go into an open mind and I tried to use science and look you know look at it from a critical thinking folklore point of view\nAnd so one so partly the answer question one thing that often happens is that if I'm traveling somewhere\nLike if I'm traveling with my friends and family they just sort of know that all been looking at goes again All right you know they're like well give me a bit of the ... going to go to the beach and like that's really cool are you there is a monster there saw how\nWandering over they're interviewing people taking photos and so that that that's part of it is I've been able to double up\nA lot of my travels in South America and Africa and elsewhere uh you know I I happen to be there anyway and so I turned into investigation when I can\nLove it love it do I do the same thing you know I mean it just is what it is you just can't help it it's it's in your blood and that's what you do you you would if you weren't that beach hanging out there with them you would just be you're just dying\nSlim lead I mean I can relax a little bit the despite you know despite what my friends will tell you I can relax I can show but you know I'll give you one quick example I was in Newfoundland or about ten years ago\nAnd I was there with a friend of mine were traveling around looking icebergs and part of the reason that I went there was because ah there's been a series of lobsters of the that have washed up these you know mysterious\nMasses of you know sea creatures or wherever they are and they washed up there but uh I wanted to go investigate some of that and there's also Springfield jak citing up there but as I was up there I came across um up a place called lake crescent\nUm and it's this little you know new Finland is it's beautiful it's just you know it just Craig crevices and everything and it turns out that there's there's a local lake monster there and so and they actually have a like a twenty foot\nA metal sculpture thing for this thing as you enter the town the town of the population is like three or four or something [laughter] I went to the car\nBut I got a I I Can't pass a lake monster come on site and you know my friends rolls her eyes like [noise] All right\n[laughter] well it's better than stopping for the biggest world's biggest a ball of yarn or something like that great and saying I'm with you [laughter] that's great okay so\nI'm I'm before I go on you know this week I was like okay you know what I Want to talk about the origins of Halloween so I\nI Google that ... pounds your article that even written 'cause you you do a lot of writing your author of course that you do a lot of writing for our life science dot com Discovery News skeptical inquiry magazine and um and some others out there too\nBut I saw this great article from you and I was like oh my gosh here's the game you know\nAnd so it looked into your background so you were legit you weren't just somebody his most writing from somebody else's book or anything like that you actually research so so tell me about the origins now we're ... we're just now learning the origins of Willis wean the gal as the origins of Halloween\nSee this is ... I I I Want the two hundred years from now when people are researching or his willfully and they're going to come up with this conversation at great I Love it might make my grandkids will be be all over it there'll be like that\nI Know I Want to one of the things that I Love about about you know to to to be honest with you I'm not I'm not big on the on the holidays mean your Christmas is fun blah blah but but you know to my mind the one that I really look forward to Halloween\n'cause it's it's you know it it secular a you know people of all religions can enjoy it uh you know sometimes the fundamentalists gets all the the the conservative from time to get a little touchy about that because they think it's really the the ... which is not but it's it's it's basically something that everybody can sort of jump into\nAnd that's why I really love Halloween is it's it's more than just costumes and candy as a fascinating history\nI'm basically Halloween a ... you know as as with most of these sorts of sort of folklore work these events and holidays there is not just one street line back right I mean there's there's different influences that come in overtime\nBut basically we can trace it back thousands of years to an October thirty first a Celtic or deal with festival called a so when [noise]\nUh and uh we don't we don't have that much of a French about just because it was that it was so long ago and there's no the feel of the records are pretty sparse fragmentary but it was basically an annual communal a meeting at the end of the year of the harvest\nAnd it was a time when of course you know it's wintertime the sole says ... and it's the time when I'm you know the the the snow's falling in you know plants are dying um so it had this connection to uh to darkness\nBut it wasn't sinister by modern standards mean when we can we think we think of the darkness as being you know something faster but to them a ... there was a very ... it was more carbon an analyst\nPoint of view wasn't about death or evil it with the changing of the seasons\nUm and so that was so ... so to the people that were celebrating it so it wasn't scary it was like yes there was a time to you know to a store or grains and to give thanks to to to to the gods and and the the spirits and this and that [noise]\nUm and it was believed that a bit on that day that the um uh the the the separation between the world was especially thin and porous\nSo the rest of the year you know we we were in our happy little world and you know the the other creatures the other Ken [laughter] you know the the ferry folk or what have you there in the world and they leave us alone and we leave them alone\nThe the the er the barrier between them becomes more porous [noise] um and so this is why are they the began talking about how [noise] here it's worth a would come come forth on this day and it was people were much more likely to be able to ah the spirits and they were basically all around us\nAnd it wasn't just the um it wasn't just the the idea that the the girls are porous\nUm you know the barrier between them but also um in leader incarnations of Halloween it was also that uh time it's porous\nAnd so what you find is that a pool would later become Halloween I'm there would be a it would be basically a time when I Would be for a time for prophecy so it was this notion that\nUh you know there's ... there's other worlds but it's also the barrier between the president in our future\nAnd so uh for example in the Eighteen hundreds or there were different custom that would that were involved Halloween which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them but there were ideas for example that\nUm that uh for example a woman born a Halloween would be able to tell the future\nUm and there would be this a proxy and oftentimes the prophecy a was um either dealing with like people who might die the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage so if it was you know oftentimes there's there's very superstitions about\nYoung women who would on on Halloween Night\nOr for example they would be would a light a candle in front of a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with a look in the mirror at midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection [noise]\nUm and so all these sorts of another one example was a bombing for Apple you know if you're down near the apple bobbing and there was there was a particular Halloween tradition\nThat if you cut up he if he killed an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken and he talked it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell the initials of your future husband so there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and past and present coming together\nOn my way man I got to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night [laughter] so I Do it here the midnight\nRide on willfully night\nThat's right will swing and [laughter] well what about um you may you may have your own little um\nI'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to you know 'cause\nI I get there are people that say Halloween you know same same thing and and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that that that they're cool with it you know um but um you know I always see it as fun I see it as a I\nMean if you say Halloween I immediately saying a cold Jack o lantern that you get to make I think a small whether\nI think of orange and black callers I think a fake little cartoons that we would watch like which isn't the goblins and and it'd be fun fun things that's how I see it and it's terrible I thing and you know people get really deep into it and and all of a sudden they take the fun out of it and the traditions out of that and\nAnd uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're going to have to take a break here but what we have is a banner rapper with us he is an investigator and an end to all the things that were into a as coast folks here that want to learn everything\nUm but he also you know does a lot of writing and he looked into this\nUh as coast folks here that want to learn everything\nUm but he also you know does a lot of writing and he looked into the origins of Halloween and we're going to learn more from him about that and also goes hunting too so stay with this kind of well let's hear it's Willis wean hanging there you don't know what you might hear tonight [noise]\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am county Willis here discussing the origins of Halloween on Willis wean talking with Ben Radford been so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have a um an interesting history\nVery rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get say panic and gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around the time of Halloween\nOr that were the fun ones the little peanuts you know characters that's always fun with the ah great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff um but that like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that they can do that any time of the year\nOh you don't pay me to go to target and put on you know a bad man\nNormally Superman or something like that they can do that any time of the year\nYou know the the creativity to go to target and put on you know a Batman masking make make something out of it you know\nYeah agreed and and and you know make a Jack o lantern implanted real candle in there and let smell that smell of burning pumpkin so cool I Love it love it all\nAbsolutely no I mean that's that's one of the you know that that's really what's associate of course these days um although you know Halloween was never really mainly children's holiday and it really didn't become focused on kids until about Nineteen fifty\nBefore that it was I mean kids were involved but it wasn't really a kids it wasn't kid centered as it is today\nI was more of a community thing again sort of if you go back to\nGo back to solve when and the the the early a Celtic versions of it which were very and the mystic and and again sort of dealing with the changing of the season and darkness in snow and all that [noise]\nUm but you know so you you have that and then that sort of what happened was that um that that someone got mixed in along with all saints day which is November first which was you know ... obviously the next day which was a to honor that the church a church members will have to have gone to heaven\nAnd then also got wrapped up to a whole whole day which is November second which bills are wrong for the soul purgatory\nAnd so there was this there were it was interesting transition from an early purely pagan\nUm um you know ritual which died out long before you know the church was was even writing about devils anything like that\nAnd then you have the the influence of the Catholic Church with all things in a whole day and and again they were the ... ah bells and sometimes the bills are wrong to keep away a demons and scary things could loud noises were set to scare away the evil [noise]\nUm and that's where it transforms little later on into the modern costumes because what would happen is um ah you know because we're talking about you where the cost and you come from and one one part of it is that uh it believe that a drink so into drew leaders would wear animal skins\nI'm there and sometimes the animal heads like antlers whatnot during the ceremonies and they weren't there they weren't doing it to fool anybody of course everybody who they were but it was it was a ritual thing in terms of honoring the land and the animals that were given to them [noise]\nUm but then later on during the late Eighteen at least the Seventeen hundreds and England was customary for the wealthy remembers in town to offer a small payment or food\nUm to the poor during Halloween preparing for the dead and this again the ties back into all day because the idea was that um that on that day ah the soul of the word purgatory you know they were they were basically trapped between heaven and hell\nThey needs to be prayer prayed for a and so the the the wealthy members of the other communities would basically\nA higher out there were ... they were subcontract prayers if you will to these numbers and so these these people would go from house to house asking for what were called full cakes where which type of bread and in return for paying for a for praying for those purgatory so they would they would do dances and songs and rituals\nAre going from house to house getting little tokens of of of food or or coin 'em and often times they would care with them how to turn it\nOf course that would lead or translate into uh the the the the the uh the public and um but the candle at land for the candle in it\nAnd the candle light represented the soul the person they would pray for the idea was that they would these members go as far as to how say you know yes will pray for if you have a member of your family who's a you who's passed on\nThe idea was that they would these numbers go as far as to how say you know yes will pray for if you have a member of your family who's a who's passed on um ... you know holding up this this turn up with a candle and I think of this light as the the ... the coach wants to pray for them they would say yes\nAnd then of course when that came over with the Irish immigrants to to America\nUm the turn of the sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if you ask me\nRead when that's\nWhen the pumpkins came in because the pumpkins associate course they're they're bigger they're they're more fun to carve and our associate with the harvest and that's that's sort of how the the trick or treating after it came along\nOh I like that yeah I agree with you turn it's now move on my feelings ... says Munch on little olive oil salt pepper um so where do you think candy I guess I guess it all turned into candy at one point in is that like right after the ... like you were talking about\n[noise] yeah well I mean if it was interesting 'cause 'cause of getting the sort of the things sort of parsed out along gender lines for a while because what would happen is um that if you think about it you know again there was the ... the mom and going on this that\nAnd then uh the the during this time or the the genders had pretty stress strict social and so um and as I mentioned earlier during Halloween was a time when when young girls would would would\nKind of way with fully think of you know who which which cute boy they would marry and the next town over who probably had three or four of the time who knows 'cause that's what they did um but you know so that that's what they were doing so so ... if you think about like\nDuring this time this is when people would go from house to house in the ... the mom and get sort of gone away but the tradition of going to people's houses to knock on the door and you know sort of trick or treat and give us give us a little token or something\nYou would be inappropriate for young women to do that they wouldn't really go out alone by themselves during during that era so that was typically sort of a young men you know ... a mixture of this young man's project and the the the girls and women were tend to be more indoors and that's where you get the apple bobbing\nAnd rituals in terms of you know the prophecy in those those sorts of things so [noise] so you know by the late Eighteen hundreds the tradition of playing pranks on Halloween was pretty well established\nAnd and that's when ah you know as the as the religious aspect sort of faded away for I mean they were\nPeople were no longer you know going from house to house asking for little bits of bread to to pray for you know sold and purgatory [laughter] that's a little a little a live outlandish for the little little too much work for these days\nSo that when this sort of came down to treat a and even even today I mean I remember when I was a kid a not so long ago I like to say uh you know they were it was a memory out every now I get to get a silver dollar or are you sometimes you get an apple you're like\nReally really only a capital okay and I like it was it wasn't even that I like it was like some really tart apple was like you went out of your way to find a nasty apple did you I didn't say that and like you but anyway [laughter]\nYou know well I you know I remember when we would go I'm a long time ago it was great you remember the good houses together too there were there were years where you get full size candy bars and by the way if you came up to our house which was on a hill and it was scary and we would play that'll\nHaunted house record where you heard the green in which is right and it was very dark so if you if you were asked if you were brave enough to go to our house you would get full size bars you know marathon bar you need a handful now you're\nThe only perimeter marathon bars I Love that I Love the marathon bars but they were\nMarathon bar you need a handful\nNow you're the only perimeter marathoners I Love that I Love the marathon bars but there were like growl and chocolate and they they were like a foot and a half long yeah and they were just great they're just going to have those I I haven't heard anybody mentioned those in decades oh yeah that's a horrible ... you got to pull and you got a phone line is you can't replace a wish I'd been there\nI Can't believe they don't make those any more of those are fantastic but but we were when we would go trick or treating and and we had to go kind of far up one hill this way money all the other way and you had your suits and that's when they had those are nasty mass that you couldn't breathe or anything but at the time [laughter]\nBut we would never say one house it always had homemade popcorn balls\nThey were delicious it was the only time we ever had on there were awesome and you know back then you could trust the people\nAnd then of course you know you hear about razor blades in apples and things like that but then there was another person's house that they were a dentist and they only gave away toothbrushes like we don't want to go there you know thank you yeah trick or treat thank you [laughter]\nI I should mention that because of all three answers the the ah the more modern scares a and you know you mentioned the the the the classic a poison ... and the reason the assets yeah\nAnd the fact is that that I mean that's that's there's there's almost no truth to that uh it's it's widely talked about a friend of mine Joel Best wrote a book about that um and and you know so when you actually look at\nFor younger kids Kim says ask questions engage with them to help reinforce what's being learnt and if a child complaining that the subject is boring changing up the presentation can help with\nAll the average student for history but when I pair them with TV shows or nonfiction book or fiction books

I mean they're really trying hard to get interaction you don't you don't know if it's going to be somebody nice or not and are these things go wrong with you you know that's where\nI grew up in a haunted house I the last thing I wanted to go around me I prefer going sledding or looking up in the sky lights I don't want something going home with me even though people claim that those things go home with them too\nBut you know what I mean ... if you um and you talked about exercises and things like that one of my friends is archbishop James long and James is like you know those quick provoking quick provoking you don't know who or what you're talking\nTo and that's what they were there with that I said you're not doing yourself in your favor thereby ... whatever it may be there\nRight you don't know what it is if it's evil or not evil or what it is it All right I mean\nUm you you talk about in your book there's different guidelines for scientifically investigating these reports how you do that scientifically\n[noise] ... there's a couple of things you know one of the first\nSo um you establish I mean I I've done I've done you know many goes investigations myself\nUm and as I said I I come to the more science based uh someone say skeptical point of view that doesn't mean that I dismissed everything it just means that you know I'm not going to believe any weird you sound as that goes and so so that the first thing that I Do when I go into a case is try to establish\nA water the false viable claims that is what exactly is being claimed to you know if someone saying that there's there's a mysterious sound or a laughing or something in the hallway or is there a photograph for me what what exactly is is is going on there and then the question is\nCan we tested repeatable right is it is it is the sound that comes up you know every every full moon I'm you know what's going on here and so a lot of times ah unfortunately a lot of the the ghost hunting you see on TV\nUh is is not very scientific um it it it looks exciting look dramatic you know it's all of course you know reality t._v.\nAnd ... easy reality\nYou know in in scare quotes um and I and I've I've been on many of the TV shows as you pointed out I was a so I've I've done you know on both sides of the camera on this\nAnd you know and my my point of view is always\nYou know I I don't make fun of ghost hundred 'cause I I've done goes hunting and I I've I've done a lot of that and so my my point is if you're going to do than do it right you know bring science to bring goods good critical thinking too so I'll give you one quick example so\nOne problem I often see is that go centers on TV you and and not actually just across the board is is you know the supplies even you know amateur groups across the country is they typically engaged in what's called the anomaly hunting\nAnd that is they're they're looking for they're sampling the environment whether it's a ... or you know you EMS or magnetic uh frequencies water temperature drops whatever it is and they're the they're they're sampling the environment and looking for something weird\nAnd they're saying okay well if we will will go here and we'll be there from you know midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these ratings and walk around we'll try and promote goes and the sort of things\nAnd then they get hours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them and they try and look for anything we all look at this at at three oh eight PM I Am you know we saw this thing\nAnd the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate\nThe original claims there that you you ... the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness and you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are easy to investigate those particular claims\nAnd and oftentimes that sort of gets ... pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do this sort of sexy investigating and you know get the get the infrared cameras on and we're going to walk around here and all these sort of things\nAnd and and that that's part part part of the problem here is that is that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that\nThat in almost all cases they don't they don't have a good grasp of of of ah of the amount of data needed\nTo to adequately sample a location so for example you'll see a ghost hundred go into location maybe there's team of them and they'll they'll take readings for three hours or six hours or wherever else and then they'll go home and analyze them\nThe problem is that's not nearly enough time\nTo get a good baseline right in order to know what's what's what's um paranormal or abnormal you need to know what's normal and you know whatever readings you get your walking around with the M.

I went to anyway so the the story um it was made national news and people are you all this weird thing over\nAnd because I live in the state again I'm about an hour away I I went up there and investigators and I I went and I went to the courthouse I looked at the camera and I talked to the deputies interviewed people\nAnd I had some ideas of what it might be um and I did some experiments I eventually you solve the case and figured out what it was and so part of the answer is you you look at the the the the video or the photograph and you try to figure out what or alternative\nI make a list of three four or five different things you know could be could be an insect going to be a hoax could be a ghost is there there are some I mean so\nYou just basically any anything that he is even remotely possible I Try to lift those and I tried to rank them terms of what most likely which which things can I find typically test which they can actually you know investigating falsify\n'em and you just basically go down left and and that's that's one of the things I Do so so one key thing that the seaport and uh and it's not always possible because sometimes you know it's\nThe photograph is you know Thirty years old and it was taken in you know in in Poland and you know who knows where the hell that came from [noise]\nBut but when possible it's good to try and replicate it so ... for example a woman sent me a photograph that she took in a hotel in Deadwood and I said you know\nA ... are you still there should know this was a couple of years back I knew it was a sort of\nImage does he she saw in a room in the mirror and I said well again it's it would be I could I could be more help if this was a recent photograph not just a couple of years back and different state but I said well you know if you if you do go back there if you were still there go back and tried to replicate it you know take take ... take the photograph\nAt the same place ideally at the same time of day um and see if you see if there's something in the background\nThat the you know might might be might be mistaken for a ... an image of a face or something\nI see so and I get that I get that and but you know I guess that that thing whatever that might be in just they're like you said in it might be people might think they know that uh\nWell I'll give you again you know other examples\nOf what\nI was gonna say you're one of it is um [noise]\nYou know if it's on the one question comes up at the other people see it right and so this is I write is often the case of where\nYou know there's there's an extra for example behind standing behind somebody a and actually I was sent to an example this a couple of months back and said oh this is the weirdest thing you know my cousins here and there was this there was this sort of weird goes the image or just behind her to the left\nUm you what do you think it is I said well again I I wasn't there it's kind of ... you know it's hard to be conclusive about it without more information but I noticed that no one else around them noticed it I mean there there are other people who were nearby and no one is looking at this strange image to their left and so\nThat suggests that that they probably didn't feed the time and it may or may not be a camera artifact\nI got ya I got ya hey you know it's it's hard because some things are picked up on camera that we don't see with the eyes some things are picked up from a certain angle and but not another angle um they need and it's just\nYou know there's some things that are seen that it just is no way the shadow is and just that second you know you can take something out but then there's some really crazy things that are picked out that\nThat's I mean it just looks like there's no way it could be anything else but something creepy or you know worthy of\nA shame that this place was hunting for sure you talk about uh goes hunting equipment to man has it changed a lot so what works what doesn't work\nAnd and by the way I think in the future we're going to have a whole lot of different types of devices that will measure some of the things we're looking to measure that that we can't measure right now it's all a new science you know\nYeah I mean you know one of the interesting aspects of gross domestic Asian is um is the uh you know a ... for example I was I was doing a TV\nAspects of ghost investigation is um is the uh you know of of for example I was I was doing a TV show called the mystery quest a while back and I was there was some uh goes hunters and um the flu is out to California to investigate a haunted place there and\nAnd they they brought in all this all these are the ghost in the equipment and just you know there's cameras in him after all is like you know probably Seventy thousand dollars over the gear\nAnd it was all set up when the cameras and lights and I are and all that sort of thing\nAnd and I talked to one of the guys who brought all that stuff a little bit later I said you know I'm just curious and we weren't on camera I mean I ... this was like a gotcha moment where just hanging out with were finished shooting or going back to tell us as\nI said why do you think why do you think it is that we don't we still have good quality evidence of goes uh I mean even to this day and again this is you know six seven years ago said you know
