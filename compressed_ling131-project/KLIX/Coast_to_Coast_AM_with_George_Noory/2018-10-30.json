ago\nThat said that ah kids now are so enthralled with their phones the iPhones\nThat they're no longer a ... you know they no longer have any consideration for hot wheels are Barbie dolls the real problem is there are fewer kids about twenty five percent fewer kids under ten now than there were ten years ago he I think maybe just maybe that has something to do with their ... their sales declined\nYeah could be it makes\nMe crazy you know us seriously if you don't have a twenty five percent decrease in the size of your market I don't care if you're if you're in General Motors or or Amazon or your you know your sales are going to decline it it they're just they weren't born they don't exist\nYou know they don't but how do you look into a crystal ball can make these predictions if you're running a business\nWhat it what you do is is it the what's the most important question for any business any business you know I I I was a [noise] an opportunity to speak to the cheap\nQuestion for any business any business you know I I I was a\n[noise] an opportunity to speak to the chief marketing officer is in the hospitality industry about two years ago\nAnd and everyone was there ... ... a share tumors their Hilton was there and Google was their American Express was there these are all people that have to do with with the the hospitality industry\nAnd I asked him I said what's the most important question you need to ask yourself right now\nAnd and I'm In the ... you know come on marketing folks ... million dollar salaries in this room and it was about twelve people into ruin sitting around and round table and and they eat their answer was you know a Google said it's it's the uh understanding social media and how to advertise how to market on social media\nAnd and the American express said we have to get into their heads we have to we have to understand this new generation and why are you know how they think how they buy and Hilton says it's it's about new products are about making your room smaller in your lobbies bigger\nYou know the answer is the answer is is how big is your market and it's getting bigger or smaller\nThat's right it's all about demographics isn't it\nYeah it is because if your market is getting smaller I don't care how good you are Levi Strauss called me up\nAnd asked me what was going on with their market but ... you know it it for about Twenty years they could make their products fast enough they literally couldn't meet the demand and all of a sudden sales started trailing off is was Nineteen\nNinety eight and I and I said I'm\n... so your your sales are ... are are going flat and he said yeah what do we have a demographic issues as to the chief marketing officer in San Francisco Levis\nAnd and I said a Hoosier customer and he said and Eighteen to thirty four year old man and woman Eighteen to thirty four and I said what happens at thirty four years old that they can't buy your product and he's over ... they don't fit in the product anymore I said you realize you're a boomer business and he said yes\nI said the last baby boomers born Nineteen sixty four Nineteen sixty four I said I Am thirty four years to Nineteen sixty four where you come up with and he said there was a pause and he said Nineteen\nNinety eight and I said we're in it and he said Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd he said what does that mean as I said what that means is you know you're you're left gas just checked out of your hotel and their their sales went from eight billion get this George eight billion to two and about three years while why because they're not paying attention to demographic\nYou know if you want to count money count money go ahead knock yourself out\nBut if you want to understand where money came from it came from people count people and you will understand\nWell is it is simple to tend to talk to that demographic you need to go after then surely and find out some of the things they enjoy and look at those trends in you find out that you know you have kids Eighteen to twenty four years old younger people\nFind out from them what did they do what do they like where did they go did they go to movies do they not and then the judge yourself to that\n[laughter] Georgia too smart [laughter] but but you did that doesn't that sound like like logic commonsense is not so common ... said that\nYou know I I Do um I'll speak to an audience of five hundred people and and I'll say everybody stand up and then I'll say everybody born before Nineteen sixty five sit down and I said that's the boomers everybody you see that the boomers all sat down\nAnd I'll say okay if you were born before Nineteen eighty five sit down and ... and another large groups that found it and I say that's Jenn ... about three people standing\nAnd I said this that's Gen Y that Gen Y or the millennials are born Nineteen eighty or eighty five to two thousand for this eighty seven million of them I said you want to know about the new Martin\nOr the millennials are born ... or eighty five to two thousand for this eighty seven million of them I said you want to know about the new market you you have to hire these people and you don't have a clue because they're not here and it makes me crazy\nWell it's it's ... you got to adjust because if you don't you're not you're not going to succeed yeah what's happening is that what's happening like companies like McDonald's or they on top of things that used to be marketing geniuses something slipping\nI Know you're not you know what I tell people I'm sure McDonald's same store sales are off you know they're they're all their increases are coming from um their overseas operation\nI I I I tell folks I said listen it generation y is now fourteen to thirty three years old it's eighty seven million people are just now starting to have children I said and they realize what their parents were feeding them for the last Twenty years\nAs I said you know what the three ends up of a food it's called nutrition nutrition nutrition and what is McDonald's famous for its not nutrition [laughter] no it's it's for French fries\nYou argue is what they tried to say heart\nPeople have the impression that it's not nutritional food\n[noise] actually correct and and so that's that's their problem they they\n... if you if you want to sell food now if you want to sell food or it in the supermarket and if you want to sell food in a restaurant you need to sell good food you can't tell you you can't sell stuff that's going to stop people's hearts\nWhat's going on with population trends are they shifting down to\n[noise] yeah it was you know it's funny you say that uh in Nineteen ... we we have a new generation is called Generation Z and Generation Z started and I'd like two thousand five and they will they will be a but they will end around two thousand twenty four\nSo they're not fully born yet [noise]\nBut in Nineteen eighty seven excuse me two thousand seven we had a record year in the United states we ... we have four million a three hundred and sixteen thousand babies were born and that that was more than Nineteen fifty seven which was the previous record fifty one years earlier [noise]\nAh what's happened since two thousand seven is is the the population has dropped like a stone we we've gone from producing a over four million babies a year down to a just a little over three million baby sit here and and so this Generation Z will be smaller yeah\nThat's a big trend can stay with us we'll talk more about trends when we come back we'll take calls with you next hour Iran coast to coast they\nGet Daily Show updates right to your inbox for free with the ... zone newsletter sign up today at ... am dot com\n\n\nThan walking back and they're gone back with us as we talk about trends the incredible trends that the I guess Kim nachos businesses should be using things like this I Would guess anybody who's doing something marketing you name it should be aware of these things should night\nYeah absolutely that there's [noise] it it is mysterious to me well why everyone doesn't think about this because it it precipitate almost everything that we have in a market economy\nHow much has the smartphone change these things\n[noise] well it it has to a large degree um\nThe [laughter]\nYou know and what what I tell people when when they asked me a question like that [noise] if people are still people when when you have a large number of people that are consumer or a specific product at a small number of people consume a specific product\nThe large number of people will consume more though I Know that sounds ... but the ... the smartphone has a only aged folks in their ability to consume so uh it's it's a good thing from from that standpoint\nWhat you have to keep in mind that the thing that drives commerce of the thing that drives you know consumption is the number of people in the market period\nThat that ... simple isn't it well it\nIt almost sounds ridiculous doesn't ... I mean who is out there saying well okay so large groups of people consume a lot of stuff and then they're smokers people consume smaller amounts of stuff but if I read the wall Street Journal every day and I read the marketing section and I know that the wall Street Journal just based on what I read doesn't understand that\nBecause the the uh [noise] let me give you\nHe's actually these were were bought by baby boomers are Twenty years ago in in vast quantities\nAnd then the the uh [laughter] um yeah I'm a real companies had to figure out how to sell the same number of SUVs to a generation X. as they did to the baby boomers and they couldn't do it so they they kept on firing their marketing departments that have kept on firing their their chief marketing officers\nBecause they couldn't come up with the secret to selling as many SUVs to this other group but nobody bothered to count them and this other group of generation and the fact that they can be for a small\n... point my my twenty four year old granddaughter Ken was talking to me a couple of days ago and she said Popeye you know kids are age she calls herself cute but she's a young woman now we're not getting married like you folks used to and that's another trend can isn't it\nYeah and in you know it it's funny because I'm trying to figure that one out because you know half of the kids that are born today or the babies that are born in it and that's all about you know demographics\nAre born or outside of wedlock and they're they're born outside of a of a marriage\nUm the marriages seemed to come after the kids are born as opposed to for before a and there are certain cultures like the African American culture or where Seventy five percent of the kids are born outside of the the uh\nUh marriage ... it's just it's a different time George\nNow if you could understand that so whether it's a you know we're talking a lot about business but if you can understand that how much can you affect change\n[noise] well you know that that's another good question I'm not so sure that you can I I think you you mean in terms of\nChanging what the culture is doing I think the culture is going to do with the culture is going to do in right now we have the largest generation and history of our nation is currently fourteen to thirty three years old eighty seven ... million generation why millennials\nAnd I think they're going to do what they're going to do just like the uh uh you know you go back ... forty years\nAnd ... you look at the you know what happened in the sixties and early seventies what the hippie culture they did what they did they just simply did what they did\nBut then what happened they grew up uh you know I I actually spoke to my audience what happened to the to a sex drugs and rock and roll what happens in the ... the boomer hippies live became Republicans [laughter]\nIn all cases [laughter] no not all cases but you know if if you look if you look at\n[noise] that this this is ... let me back up a second because this is something that that people need to understand [noise] [noise] ah [noise] between the ages right now of thirty four in fifty three we have a diminutive puppy a population of of indigenous or people that were born here\nThere were there were only about sixty nine million people born between sixty five an eighty four as opposed to the boomers that were that were roughly eighty million born between forty five or sixty four\nWhat does that mean that means that that that particular population could not a ... support the labor needs that we had in our country and it sucked in immigrants like like a a a vacuum\nThat particular generation right now is the generation that is make making people think that we're a nation of haves and have nots when when what we are as a nation that has a small indigenous population\nAre superimposed over where the heavy lift or should be with words\nBe in our population it's actually smaller so the net result is a you know ... ... it's kind of having a you know ... ... and they should have haves and have nots with with a cushion in between of\nGeneration X we don't because they were never born we're losing that cushion\nYeah well what we did in as you so you you had people saying that the the United States is is broken because\nWe have the have nots but middle age and and a and a middle income or our occupy exactly the same space so if you're middle ages small then then you're middle income as small as well\nBut it's a demographic issue it was just simply a question of of how many babies were born for that particular period\nCan't let me ask you this too I mean let let's use Facebook as an example you know they they've got the billions of people on line or they've got huge amounts of advertising dollars because of a what they do socially\nBut I think they're starting to lose that I think they're starting to there's becoming a change their war I think advertisers you begin to say I'm not sure we're getting bang for a dollar a year or even for converting these in the sales because the market may not be what we really want what's happening with that\n[noise] a Facebook is kind of strange [noise] entity if you will and I tell folks listen it if you're if you're not paying for it you are not the customer you're the product um as far as I'm concerned and I and I've got Twenty one years experience in the marketing industry\nThe Internet are um advertising is a bottomless pit you have no idea what your pie non and there's no way to a reference any kind of success\nExcept return on investment so you you spend money on the Internet and and you just cross your fingers and hope that your sales go up your sales go up ... you don't know if it's if it's\nA relative to how much money you spend on the Internet [noise] but uh what what's happening with a a suburbs uh enterprise there is is not good it really is\nI mean it's huge but there's a trend here and to me the trend is very negative so that it\nIs involved in what's negative about it is is uh I I think he's totally disingenuous I I don't trust 'em\nA Facebook at all I I really don't I don't think I I think you have to understand George that everything that anybody writes on on Facebook can be analyzed\nAnd then the ... and and that analysis put people into categories and those categories uh our sellable and and what that sucker Berg does with that information is sell it to anybody who will pay for it\nSo there there's there's there's no security and anything that you put on Facebook nothing\nAnd well what about you know some of these wacky jobs you know the idiot that killed the loving people in the Jewish synagogues ... the guy who sent all these bombs these pipe bombs they use social media to kind of spelled their hatred um how can we can't catch them a little sooner\nYou tell me I I really don't know that\nRobert Ballard says in the ... and they are they are truly whacked jobs and um I don't know that that's\nThat's more of a a more understanding of of of a of a psych uh graphics than a demographics as far as I'm concerned\nAnd what's happening in the housing market most younger people aren't buying\nThey happen while they're renting because they had a trillion dollars of student\nLoan debt yeah\nYeah but don't worry about it now what we're what we're literally facing with um ah kids is is you have eighty seven million kids that are between fourteen and thirty three years old the kids are finally moving out of their parents' basements are throwing loyal as

that would in their punishment would be what they've said and and um [noise] uh I don't know like I think what he has done is dignify or is it the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean there was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows\nBut you don't get me a you know on one hand you got to defend yourself on the other how much do you monitor yourself in it and just move on and say you know folks I already said it I'm done with it and end it like that\nIt

next based on demography is based on a ... a very macro view a very thirty thousand foot view\nWhen it you know you you asked me a question about the president I'm I made the comment about the president but that was really subjectivity on my part that I mean that's what I feel right now I get it\nYeah kind of what's what's going to happen going forward it it is it right now we have a polarized country in the country is polarized\nJust like it was in the sixties early seventies because we have a huge population of young people and a huge population of old people and in between there is a small population that does not\nOffer the the uh position of of either of those too so uh\nWell what I like about Dana's remarks though is she's she said how she felt without screaming without putting you down for your views and that's what it's all about that's the way it should be\nExactly yeah so so might make a comment today and it would be thank you for your position it's thank you for that yelling at me\n[laughter] that's good zero in Long Island New York Hey Joe go ahead\nI can to questions or it it talked about the wall Street Journal having more ... than a ... and one issue than ... ... people have that it you know then and how the system that slashing explosion basically people pick and choose\nA their information or even at a a professional level what what are the size of the ... look at Japan\nPeople used to like Twenty years ago the people just work twenty four seven almost and it just hasn't worked out of the individual level in Japan for people with that high octane\nA drive to a stay at the office so that in the height or whatever\nWe ate of conscious something my second question will be about Amazon or\nI Know they get criticized for putting out small for prior to that I can understand that but at the same time this stuff you can find on there that you can find locally even a even under your for example I got I got this great glove was shoveling my neighbors snow\nAnd that's the main thing I Need it but I couldn't find them locally I got 'em on Amazon from like Minnesota [noise]\nI Do for the first question again [laughter] ... inside just drilling on Long Island and I'm from Long Island too but what was the first question go ahead and give us an office again Joe\nJoe\nYou know that it does for example and explosion that video ... you know like half of everything people get on a smartphone I think of this video based just\nHow should people if they're trying to move ahead or in the world just pick and choose how they consume information was to emphasize because it doesn't necessarily work out to put this clandestine emphasizing whether it's just so so much of the nation like\nYou like a carnival is sad or on the ... what good does it do the ... it's just too overwhelming\nThought where's your friends your neighbors are quite\nA lot of information that we get as it is overwhelming so what do you do with it you know if if I'm a ... a lot of the the the Gen Y kids the millennials are actually tuning it out you could ask them simple questions about you know what's going on in the world and they can't answer it\nBut ... how do you sift through this what you have to do is you have to compare several sources that's and that's what I Do when I Do research and when I Do presentations I really don't\nCome to any kind of conclusions unless I've compared a variety of sources and that's what helps me with information and in terms of Amazon\nI think Amazon is just you know ... what we did when we open the Internet we opened up the world we we just that was our view to the interests of the world and I think what's what's going down with Amazon is just something that's naturally transpiring and I think if you're just going to get nothing but bigger\nYou're going to see commerce is going to change everything about commerce is going to change\nWe've got a company that shift radios they make radios and they make darn good radio see Korean company and I I used to get my radio from them long before I started doing this show and it was simple you you go on line you order what you want it's delivered to your house in some cases it's free shipping\nBased on the deal that they've got at any given time\nI mean you don't have to park your car you don't have to spend money on gasoline you don't have to find a crowd it's a it's it's amazing\nIt's amazing I mean\nIt's infinitely easier you know when when you look at the boomers what how do you do business with a boomer you save them some time you make their life easy and you don't rip them off this was perfect\nAnd so Amazon is is is going to do nothing but a grow a you know and that online retail is good will exceed the tempers that word is now is probably going to twenty percent thirty percent\nThink so too they hurt bricks and mortar but I mean the the the goods are still being manufactured um the Amazon employees zillion people um some of which complain about their job there\nI'm more conditions and things like that but I mean they're they're hired people so there's displacement tea so when the bricks and mortar stores go really the only big thing to get hurt in you know some people are out of work that they can find jobs elsewhere\nIt's the real estate that just sits there what's gonna happen\nThe big thing to get hurt in you know some people are out of work that they can find jobs elsewhere it's the real estate that just sits there what is going to happen with that stuff\n[noise] that's a good question you know I Know that a a commercial real estate is you know as you know suffering some issues right now some serious issue\nI mean if you were an investor would you buy a mall right about now but no no\nNo but but but I certainly would buy residential you would I Would buy residential every day of the week yeah\nIt's a seller rent out yes [laughter]\nYeah no in fact I'm you know I I have a house in them but either Springs Florida and I and I have a house in in ... Connecticut\nAnd I'm In the house in ... Connecticut is four thousand square feet I don't know my wife and I just rattle around it\nAnd what we've decided to do is we're going to rent it will get we're going to come up with an executive rental forward and and that's going to be necessary because people are going to come into our area that don't want to buy houses people will come into all areas that don't want I have the ... got to be very big\nOn that you've got the company like air being beat up the rent out house houses and I mean yeah I Know people who own houses and they solicit through air being be exclusively and they're making a lot of money doing\nThat really they're very happy very cool\nYeah and I I Would I subscribe to that [noise]\nIt ... you're going to see in real estate across the board it you're going to see dramatic changes\nOne of the things that that's kind of puzzling me right now and I don't have an answer to it is this working from home and if that's going to\nRemain in place and remain as as a major issue going forward because that was precipitated by a small labor force that essentially demanded a you know their their own way but what we have now is a huge huge biggest labor force that we've ever had\nIs a very young right now and just entering the ah the process\nCan I Want to talk with you about India when we come back and also we'll take final calls in just a moment how about your books can people still get them can\nOh yeah K. juicy direct dot com K.

would have forty million more people if if abortion was illegal\nOr simply because I think people use abortion and birth control I I don't think they use it as a I mean it's it's it's almost like

and I never questioned it I just said okay that's that's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing cycling right to see 'em\nThere's always there seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so in an endless was a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a\nA small plane or by a a ferry or vote or there was no bridge to that island so there's very remote there is no hospital so uh you know they they needed the services of folk healers and and and that's what my grandmother did my my mother's mother\nWhere to science fit into this Bruce I mean the you know you're you're you're in academia um yeah we were to science fit in\nWell I I've been doing a lot of reading and a and you know I'm not a scientist but I did I've done a lot of reading and quantum physics and\nAnd I talk a lot to uh I I have communication with folks that have passed on and and that happened randomly before but now I figured out a way to make it more regular but\nSo I've asked an awful lot of questions and I've done a lot of reading and I've met people like teen raiding who are just you know wonderful and very easy to talk to\nAnd explain difficult things in from what I understand what I Believe is that the the paranormal the paranormal world is actually the quantum world so by studying quantum mechanics and how that works I think I have a good idea of how the paranormal world works and I've come up with a model or\nIs it how I I fit in what what I understand to be going on and tell us what that model might be\nWell the idea is that uh that I okay I'll I'll I'll look at it this way so I ... in the morning I take these I call them a a meditative walks\nSo so when I'm walking my one way of looking at me and said I'm I'm a a a a a particle bean I I'm a bean physically being\nBut if you see that I'm I'm moving and if you look at uh like in in in fast motion or whatever I Would be like a blur so I'm really I'm a I'm a wave more than I Am a a a a particle being\nAnd I and my my location is is not just in one place so I kind of see that in the in the quantum world that's that's what it is everything is in wave form and we don't see the world that way because you know that some in the subatomic world\nBut if you take it up to the macroscopic world and you think about that ah that I I'm not in any one location and it and uh and and that's kind\nOf how how I see it and and I think that that helps me understand how how this works and the the other thing is these near death experiences that I've had a like for instance I think we have many forks and what I call forks in the road of time I talk about that in the book\nWhere we experienced a maybe a near death experience or a close call and I've had a couple of those and in one dimension I think is where it comes into you know a different dimensions\nI think that we we might die in that particular thing that that incident and another's we we live on is if that didn't happen or and\nSo that might have been or maybe sometimes we don't and uh and then we can have many of these forks and the road of times throughout our our our lives and keep going from one life to the next\n... but at the same time that we're doing that there's this spiritual part of us so there's actually two part there's a physical form and then there's the spiritual form or that that is eternal and that's where I come up with the uh the title of the book which is timeless that that we don't really\nEver die\nAnd ... you have documented thirty four ... cases that happened to you have there been more you just didn't put them all in the book\nYeah ah [laughter] there there's a lot more and I have I've already written the second book it'll come out next year I call it timeless deja vu\nAnd uh I have twenty eight more experiences and I I I I kind of wanted to test the waters with the first book okay and I said I saved some of the more well I'll just say a little bit more bizarre stuff for the second book based on the reaction of the first one\nWell sounds like we're going to have your back about the same time next year huh\nAnd I and I yeah I plan to release it about you know the late summer early fall and and then I I also have a third book plan too so I I there's a lot of the incidents the they keep happening\nI I was going to ask you how deja vu because in most save a lot of it for the next book but ah you had mentioned the experiences where you know\nYou may have died in one life but not and another do you think that sometimes we might have memory of other existence as in other parallel universes and that's why we have deja vu\nI I I Believe so in fact uh I I remember as a as a kid and this is interesting because I think\nChildren are very open to the spirit world or the paranormal world but there are that's kind of over the years it's kind of a through our education system or sometimes maybe by their parents are different\nOrganizations it's kind of a you know drained out of them\nBut I remember as a kid thinking I Wonder if I've already died and I'm somebody else now I think I Am and it's and and I don't necessarily remember a previous life experience from that but I I remember thinking that a lot I mean a lot\nAnd uh so I I I think that's interesting that that children have those those ah you know those kinds of feelings but I'll give you an incident that happened just recently with me and my son we were driving here in Southern California on a sub surface streets and I\nI look down just momentarily I don't know what it was something that dropped onto the floor of\nMy drunk or whatever and I looked up and when I looked up and I thought it was just a split second here I was hurdling through a red light oh and it was it was terrible at it and how old's your son or he's he's Eighteen okay and he's sitting in the in the passenger seat and freaky now yeah he he is and\nWe're going through the intersection and on either side of us is a car you know two cars coming right at us so what was going to happen that I can see was that we're going to get T bone from both sides and just you know ... ... ... pinch between the two\nUh and uh at that moment everything's slowed down ... everything's slowed down and it was if I had all the time and the world to figure out how I was going to\nManeuver your way around a yeah and the next thing I Know I I I maneuver through and next thing I Know we're on the other side there was hockey and going on and the cars when everybody was safe and a time got back to normal speed again I mean I I think that\nWhat what happens is that we had we had glimpse the quantum world at that point and then the quantum world and in the paranormal world as my spirit friends have told me there there is no\nQuantum world at that point in in the quantum world and in the paranormal world as my friends have told me\nThere there is no past there is no future it's all just an eternal now and and that that's what I felt like and I and then I thought this is probably this is an example of a fork in the road of time because it another dimension which\nWe might have had this horrible accident in ... knows it it it potentially at least the potential forty five miles an hour oh at each other like that it you know that there could have been people killed and it's at least seriously injured\nAnd ah and we were unscathed and so or the other two cars thank God but um so it so I I that is what I'm Talking about and I had other experiences that you know when I was younger I I at eight years old I had another uh experience where I\nI uh uh was playing around it was in ah I'm up at the steps you pass I'm from Washington state and deception passing the north end up with the island there is a a to bridge spans that go from the mainland too with the island the north end and there's a middle island called pass island\nAnd we always used to stop there when when we went camping in and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you could overlook the narrow channels that that that separate the island from the mainland and I was running around and of course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak on for the\n... ... and I was running right towards the cliff and I remember running off the cliff and then everything was I was just like suspended in in in in in mid air was like everything stopped and once again I felt this this light and the warmth\nAnd the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion I was back on the trail and my dad was grabbing my shoulders and was yelling\nSomebody's watching Uber's

Bruce what about any demonic situations have you stumbled into that\nYes unfortunately like that is that is also out there in the paranormal world and the spirit world and\nSure that these things as far as I understand have never been human never will be human but they are very real and very scary out out to a couple of them I'm One of them was a a wise about Eighteen years old I was in a very low place in my life very uh down\nI was a not very successful I dropped out of school or at the University of Washington as living at my brother's garage sleeping on the concrete floor in a mattress and a ... just the night before this incident happened I I had cut across\nYou know I I was Eighteen but I was still acting like I was a little kid I'd still cut across yards and jump fences and stuff 'cause just to you know 'cause I it it just the old habits yeah\nAnyway I went through the yard of of an old lady who all of us in the in the neighborhood thought she was a witch and uh she lived alone and there was a story I don't know if it was true that her husband had died and she left him there for a month and told the neighbors complain that you know there was something\nSome kind of odd smell and then uh anyway so she their legend grew by leaps and bounds\nSo I was ... I was cutting through her yard and I saw a candlelight and the window and I just momentarily looked and there she was and she was very scary looking person she had you know this gray hair that was kind of shooting off and all direction yeah she had this\nShe had the old ... syndrome right\nYes she had the ... camp as it turned out cancerous or on her nose or she had me I felt like a deer in headlights I was just frozen\nAnd I was just staring at her and she had it was either a it was a candle yeah she had a candle in the window and she was just staring at me and it it just scared me and finally I broke away from her gays and I ran to my brother's garage and I\nAnd I and I you know went in to to I fell asleep well later that probably early in the morning I woke up to a very frightening\nThe mattress bad that I was sleeping on the floor there was like a a column of fire that was coming up out of the floor and I and I thought this is the worst during this is a horrible dream\nAnd so I pinch myself I slap myself and no I was awake in this column fire then spread over me in an arc from head from foot over my head you know probably six feet in the air and kind of like an art\nAnd like pulsating fire like a current a fire going over my head\nAnd it and if that wasn't scary enough there was also this this very dim what I Would classify as the demonic low gravelly voice speaking in in ... just these guttural tones and I'm not sure how long it lasts it it might have just been a couple of minutes but it seemed like it it took forever\nAnd ah it it was very very frightening and it was it was horrible and and I after it was over I was you know my heart rate was way up I was sweating\nI immediately called my my girlfriend and and uh I told her you know there's something terrible happened she said well\nYou know why don't you come over in in in the morning and I did and I explained it to her and she looked at me and she said uh well you know uh I think maybe we should call a psychiatrist what do you think and I said well just forget it you know maybe I just made it up but of course I didn't it did happen\nAnd I I think it had something to do with this this old lady I think that I had frightened or or major angry\nAnd something had been some and and I it was a terrible terrible thing and that that that's one of the experiences I've had it's one of the most scary things that's a that's ever happened to me and just as as I remember it as if it would just happened yesterday I could feel the heat I could hear that gravelly voice that just seemed to fill the whole room and\nYeah it was it was it was horrible\nWouldn't want to go through that again would you\nKnow no it was it was it was very real very reel to reel and nothing that it it so I I think what happens is that these kinds of things you know when you're at the lowest point in your life and that's when you're susceptible ah and I I think that that that they seize that opportunity\nI think so too I mean they they know when you're down they know when you're on drugs or you're drunk yeah and that's when they get ya and they get you a good time I don't want to dwell too much on the demons but tell us the other story\nWell the other one ah also of a foolish kind of thing a ... there was actually a um I was in Germany I was a soldier in Germany at working at the prison the military prison and Mannheim West Germany when it was east and West Germany where West Germany\nAnd uh there was a a a counselor at the prison of all people a counselor is like a senior in CEO and he\nWas into a a a witchcraft so he had invited me and my girlfriend to his his room to it 'cause he was bragging about what a you know powerful war locker which or whatever that he was in\nAt the time I was kind of I'm kind of interest that kind of you know skeptical been interested\nSo we went in there it into his room and he had this very frightening set up you know the very typical Satan worshipping kind of stuff upside down across a like goats had kind of thing going on and candles and\n... and that stuff so I said well I you know I don't think this is anything that I'm interested in and I got my girlfriend and we left and\nAnd he was being very very spooky and very scary about this whole thing and and uh so I decided that I was going to look into a a you know this kind of thing so I I I thought maybe as a defense you know I maybe I should try to one of them you know and try to scare him or something and\nAnd uh and I also felt like maybe he was trying to move in on my girlfriend too so I had a little bit of that you know kind of thing going on competitive thing so\nAnd uh and I also felt like maybe he was trying to move in on my girlfriend too so I had a little bit of that you know kind of thing going on competitive thing so I I went to the er at you know for soldiers they had a art rooms or like arts and crafts areas and\nAnd uh there was a a um [noise] uh ceramics instructor there and he I asked I like to you know do something with some clay and he said gave me some clay and\nI had been looking at a demon knowledge the book and or or no no he had a demon algae but that's what it was and I was fashioning a a what I thought would be you know some kind of scary looking head and it turned out to be a demon had you know that I Am fashioned and this was just you know very stupid to be doing this\nAnd as I was doing this this guy took notice of made this instructor then he had the Steven ... book and uh he said you know I'm very interested in this what is this year doing and I said well I'm just trying to make this scary looking ahead to scare the sky and he said well it's\nThat's very very interesting you know I'm very interested in in the mineralogy and he started to get really strange you know just like the counselor at the prison he was acting very strange like they were maybe birds of a feather or something\nAnd uh so I finished the steam and head and I got out of there\nAnd I took it back to the ... and I took it to my girlfriend's room and she wasn't there at the time with her ... her girlfriend a roommate let me and and I set it up on her night stand and there was like this mirror behind it and I said okay I'm I'm gonna freak her out and then I'm going to freak her out and then we're going to go and freak out this other guy and get them to get you know get away from us\nSo I set up these candles around it stupid right\nSo uh I was oh listen as the intent was good right\nIt it was it was maybe a good intent but it was playing with stuff I didn't understand so I'm sitting there looking at it and the girl friend left or I mean the the uh the roommate left and I was just there by myself sitting there staring at the ... all of a sudden it's lips started to move\nAnd it started to say things in that same kind of guttural voice that I had heard of before I joined the army\nIn that that other incident that I told you about and uh it was it was it was pretty scary and I thought at first this isn't real but then they kept happening and then my girlfriend walked in and she immediately so what are you doing and I said well your roommate Libyan and then she says what does that\nAnd she pointed to it and I said oh that's this thing I made to scare you know this councilor guy\nAnd she said you know that's very interesting because when I was in ... she was telling me when I was in high school I made something that looked exactly like that and I had to throw it away because it started to interact with me\nAnd I and I said well that hey that's what this did you know and she she freaked out she grabbed it she opened up the window and from the third floor she threw it out the window into the dumpster that was down on the in the parking lot and she said you don't ever play around with that kind of stuff\nAnd uh so that was the other to kind of demonic or incident that I that I had so that the the big lesson there's don't play around with things you don't understand even if the intention might be ... somewhat good\nAre these are forces that you you don't want to play around with it and if you are at a low

and and then it it kept vibrating again and then I just happened to look out the window and there was like a Greenbelt behind our apartment behind disgust house this bar\nAnd there was a Green Belt and then there was another uh apartment building maybe four stories high much bigger a complex\nAnd I I look directly into this window and there was a man standing there it looked like a man and he was very dark and he was a in kind of in the shadows but I could see there was a figure of a man and he was pointing at me\nAnd and I when I was holding singer I Hope no not a voting centers around it will just\nIt just seemed like a guy but he was moving in a very strange way\nSo I looked at him as soon as I think he recognizes I looked at him the vibration stopped so I I don't know what he was doing or what what reason he would have for doing it or what you know obviously you had some kind of tell the kinetic powers\nBecause it was related to what was going on because as soon as he moved away from that window and there was he wasn't there the the the items stopped and I\nAnd you know and I didn't have that feeling that somebody pulling me off to bed so it was that was pretty frightening because I didn't know what he was up to whatever it was was not good I can guarantee that and\nI'm here in St Louis that when you went through that red light and you made it through a

told me it was time\nIt was time to tell these stories to not be afraid to tell the stories people will come it's kind of like the old you know field of dreams build it and they will come\nA and that's exactly what what has been happening everything that he said uh is that I I I think I Do have a mission I I I I Know that you know I I think the fact that I\nHave all these credentials and stuff maybe that helps people accepted more but it it it's unfortunate that it should be that way but I think it does kind of a you know give people the idea that uh you know maybe he's he's more credible but\nI you know I don't know but uh I I Do know that I Do have this mission to get these stories out and to help people understand and to support people like a scientist like dean rating and others in trying to figure this out\nYou know and and our ... you know very chronically under funded because there's you know there is that it's difficult for them to get funding\nAnd I think this is it's probably one of the most important things that we can we can do in our lives is is try to figure out how this the spiritual world works and it\nProbably one of the most important things that we can we can do in our lives is is try to figure out how this this spiritual world works\nAnd it and it gives great comfort to people when I although I don't I'm not a practicing medium I Do a ... I Am able to to to do it and I I share this with my friends and family members and and ah people who are you know who asked me\nI don't do it for money or anything just do it because I feel it's a service to my fellow a human beings\nAnd it provides them with comfort and and it doesn't work every time you know a ... and I know there Charlotte ... out there and then and there are some real people that do for a living and I don't I don't ah you know begrudge them to make a living of it you know fair living as long as they're providing a a a decent service for people\nBut uh it it is it is real it's very real and ah they've tried to that is one of the more difficult things for scientists to research although they've noticed that when people say they're having a spiritual connection that later proves to be you know you know they got some things right about this person's a loved one\nA there is certain parts of the brain that they can pick up I guess some kind of image and I don't know if they use an MRI or what they do but uh so there is there is something that doesn't prove necessarily but it does show that there is something going on uh in in there is a a a connection being made\n'em and uh so I that that that is the mission that I'm On the mission I mine is too is to convey what I've found out and what I asked my friend Jean and\nAnd uh I there's another lady that passed on three years ago she was a colleague of mine and a good friend and and I also have some contact with her and I've asked them a lot of questions when I go on this walking meditation that I Do quite often\nAnd uh and connect with them and and that the things that I've learned are are are are pretty amazing and I I Want to share them with people and I and I I feel uh that I have to do it it I Want to do it but I feel like I have to do it too it's kinda like all the books I've written all the plays that I've written\nI felt compelled to do it it wasn't just something I sat down okay I'm going to write a play or I'm gonna write a book it's always I feel compelled to do it I have to do it and I'm more than happy to to you know to to do this and and help people and I think I I have helped some people\nLet's go to the phones for you if they have a story I'll have you with value waited for is ... it's just a question then take it away to them as a lawyer California Hi Thomas\nI charge thank you for taking my call and Bruce wild I promised my question Bruce I'm you spoke about your mere accidents in the intersection\nAnd a comment and question the comment is angels appear to be non denominational they appear at\nChristianity and Islam Hindu us some voters some Taoism and all of the indigenous traditions around the world whether they're called angels are being supple light whatever\nMy question to you sent to metaphorically dodged a bullet in that intersection\nHow can the average man the average woman develop cultivate if you will a close personal relationship with their guardian angels day by day even hour by hour or something that is\nTangible with absolute certainty\nWell that's that's a that's a very good question and I I Will uh started off by saying that that everybody has these\nThe light lie dormant sure because of you know ... when we were children we probably had you know pretty equal abilities and there's some people that have a little bit more than others but then\nThrough the experiences that people have they they accepted more and more and they're closer to the the spirit world so I'd say doing whatever you can to get a closer to that spirit world some people do it through meditation\nI just let it randomly happen because the door seem to be open since age for so it never quite shut so things kept happening but now I've\nI've learned to through meditation or what I call walking meditation all explain it I I Can't sit still very very long so I I have trouble doing the lotus position you know kind of traditional meditation so I I go on a walk\nAnd uh that's when I can get into the I guess what scientists would call an alpha brainwave state\nAnd at that point is when I can I I'll say a prayer a and I I I Do believe in God and I say prayers even when I'm not meditating but any way I Will I Will ask my guardian angel or some people practicing or you know professional uh mediums will say these are your spirit guides you know\nUm and I will ask them to help me to connect to those that are that are passed on and to receive whatever messages they have\nAnd uh and and to help people if they have messages they want me to pass on to their loved ones which is usually what it is\nAnd I I Would say just having a practice of that I Do it almost every day my foot has hurt right now so I haven't been able to do it so I feel kind of stifled but the last couple of days but uh making a practice of that type of mindful meditation and\nWhat my spirit friends tell me that in what they told me to tell my students in the class\nIs to have what they call focused calm\nTo be focused but be very calm and as you're doing this meditation and it will it will happen it might happen slowly it might not be you know like a an immediate you know like an epiphany or are very profound at first it might just come slowly might even think it's your imagination but it's not\nIt'll it'll keep building day by day and before you know it you you have you're more in touch with these things and you can also when you when the door opens\nYou'll ... you'll go back in time and see oh my gosh I've had these experiences before and maybe I didn't I didn't recognize it so it it goes like backwards in time as well once that door has opened\n... go ahead yeah\nNo that's the best way I can I can explain it I think it's a it's a life lifetime journey and\nAnd everybody's at their own pace you know like I tell my students you know some people say you know I'm like thirty five years old and these kids are like Twenty years old and I'm way behind you know I've been you know taking care of kids and working and now I'm going back to get my degree and I said everybody has their own timeline it doesn't matter you know we're all

I came on the air and stuff and Julie yes\nAnd that is on the email is still there um hopefully you'll get to watch sometimes when you're going to put me in fact for the local media of okay I'm really ... I wanted to ask your opinion about the peace\nAnd um I actually have this is the first probably George from coast to coast I have an actual recordings of ... the last about two or three seconds and I want your opinion on his wife\nHere when you go\nOh\nRenee or a\nA [noise]\nPretty scary foul yeah who's a weird so what do you think it sounds like like almost like a motorboat doesn't it\nWell they're recording the voice of God and my mom's bedroom um I've got an old fashioned tape recorder and there are ... ... ... for about two hours every night\nAnd it's been very quiet and they're quite well ... I Would check the outlets to see if there were some shorts or any where my sister and I and I actually have to have these recordings a father sat problems if he likes to park it's it's really bizarre actually out here and I can't explain to them\nWhat about you what do you think about ... BP's\nWell uh yeah so um electronic voice phenomena um I I I think that they can be very helpful because the it folks in the spirit world that are residing there we'll we'll try just about any way to get a hold of us especially their loved ones are a hero I heard all kinds of stories you know that\nSometimes they'll uh items will be misplaced for a while and then all of a sudden show up in a very unique location\nTo you know to give you a sign that that they're there and that they want to connect with you\nAnd I think the voice phenomena could also be a a you know something like that the third that they're trying to reach out and and and that is what I encountered when I Do this walking meditation is\nThat they desperately they desperately want to connect with their loved ones and pass on messages and sometimes it's very sometimes it's kind of sad sometimes it's a you know regrets too which is a very sad thing\nBut are often times it's just messages of love and and you know they're they're okay not to worry about them any more\nThan what do you mean by could be said\nWell I had this one experience where I connected with a lady had asked me if I could connect with her father\nI did a and I got some of the things you know you don't get everything right 'cause there's interference you know like with anything else you know uh and uh I got some of the things right and then he told me and I sensed in him and sadness and kind of some like he had regrets and I said\nAh I sense that is that something you'd like to share you know with me why you feel that way and he\nHe said well no and I don't want you to tell her that I have this these feelings either and it was it was very hard for me because this late\nHe said well no and I don't want you to tell her that I have this these feelings either and it was it was very hard for me because this lady was very much wanted to connect with their fathers or wanted to tell her but I I couldn't tell her and I am not going to say that the names or whatever but uh it's so\n... and sometimes it's not always you know rainbows and lollipops you know\nThis was an emotional for you\nIt was it was very emotional I was sometimes they you know their messages make me you sometimes tears of joy sometimes in this case kind of that I felt this man's sadness or in in the spirit world so I\nYou know it it's kind of a tough one I did not you know relate that and I'm hoping that if I connect with them again that maybe he'll give me permission to\nSpanish budgeting get up to ... to light the match on your personal opinion is that on ...

you think of Amazon crushing bricks and mortar stores\n[noise] [noise] yeah you know you say ... the Amazon or you know online a retail is about ten percent of total retail if I crushing anything it said it shares was kind of an anachronism anyway you know the ... the the retailers that are having problems right now\nAre having problems because they're having you know their their their model is not correct that because of Amazon\nYou do you think they should have adjusted that they could have prevented some of the things that have happened to them like toys R. us and all the other places\nOh yeah oh for sure yeah toy cigarettes makes me crazy you know I I started um [noise] um yeah I bet if you follow toys are us on in the wall Street Journal in you know it's it's actually gone now and now a Mattel as a higher there fourth\nCEO in four years fourth CEO and four years life because the CEOs that they hire can't come up with the magic sauce to a a reverse the the sales decline of of a hot wheels and Barbie dolls\nYou know what the real problem is is it what you know what they say in the army to read the wall Street Journal article just a few months ago\nThat said that uh kids now are so enthralled with their phones the iPhones\nThat they're no longer a ... you know they no longer have any consideration for\nHot wheels are Barbie dolls the real problem is there are fewer kids about twenty five percent fewer kids under ten now than there were ten years ago he I think maybe just maybe that has something to do with their ... their sales declined\nYeah could be it could have makes me crazy and you know us as seriously if you don't have a twenty five percent decrease in the size of your market I don't care if you're\nIf you're in General Motors or or Amazon\nOr your ... your sales are going to decline it it they're just they weren't born they don't exist\nYou know they don't but how do you look into a crystal ball can make these predictions if you're running a business\nWhat it what you do is is if the what's the most important question for any business any business you know I I I was a [noise]\nAn opportunity to speak to the chief marketing officer in the hospitality industry about two years ago and and everyone was there see and at a shark him as their Hilton was there and Google was their American Express was there these are all people that have to do with with\nSeriously ... at a sheriff Jim was their Hilton was there and Google was their American Express was there these are all people that have to do is with the the hospitality industry\nAnd I asked him I said what's the most important question you need to ask yourself right now and and uh ... you know come on marketing folks ... million dollar salaries in this room there was about twelve people into ruin sitting around and round table\nAnd and they eat their answer was you know a Google said it's it's the uh understanding social media and how to advertise how to market on social media\nAnd and the American express said we have to get into their heads we have to we have to understand this new generation and why are you know how they think how they buy and Hilton says it's it's about new products it's about making room smaller and your lobbies bigger\nYou know what the answer is the answer is is how big is your market and it's getting bigger or smaller\nThat's right it is all about demographics isn't it yeah it\nIs because if your market is getting smaller I don't care how good you are Levi Strauss called me up and asked me what was going on with their market but he you know it it for about Twenty years they could make their products fast enough they literally couldn't meet the demand and all of a sudden sales started trailing off is was Nineteen\nNinety eight and I and I said I'm\nSo your your sales are ... are are going flat and he said yeah what is it do we have a demographic issues as to the chief marketing officer in San Francisco Levis\nAnd and I said a Hoosier customer and he said and Eighteen to thirty four year old man and woman Eighteen to thirty four and I said what happens at thirty four years old that they can't buy your product and he's over ... they don't fit in the product anymore I say you realize you're a boomer business and he said yes\nI said the last baby boomers born Nineteen sixty four Nineteen sixty four I said I Am thirty four years to Nineteen sixty four where you come up with and he said there was a pause and he said Nineteen\nNinety eight and I said we're in it and he said Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd he said what does that mean is it what that means is you know you're you're left gas just checked out of your hotel\nAnd their their sales went from eight billion get this George eight billion to two and about three years while who are because they're not paying attention to demographics you know if you want to count money count money go ahead knock yourself out\nBut if you want to understand where money came from it came from people ... people and you will understand\nWell is it is simple to tend to talk to that demographic you need to go after ... and find out some of the things they enjoy and look at those trends you find out that you know if there were kids Eighteen to twenty four years old younger people\nFind out from them what did they do what do they like where did they go do they go to movies do they not and then the judge yourself to that\n[laughter] judge you too smart [laughter] but but you did that doesn't that sound like like logic commonsense is not so common volunteer said that\nLike you know I I Do um I'll speak to an audience of five hundred people and and I'll say everybody stand up and then I'll say everybody born before Nineteen sixty five sit down as and I said that's the boomers everybody you see that the boomers all sat down\nAnd I'll say okay if you were born before Nineteen eighty five sit down and ... and another large groups have found it and I say that's Jenn ... about three people standing\nAnd I said this that's Gen Y that Gen Y or the millennials are born Nineteen eighty or eighty five to two thousand for this eighty seven million of them I said you want to know about the new market you\nYou have to hire these people and you don't have a clue because they're not here and it makes me crazy\nWell it's it's ... you\nYou're not you're not going to succeed yeah what's happening is that what's happening like companies like McDonald's or they on top of things that used to be marketing geniuses something slipping\nI Know you're not you know what I tell people I'm sure McDonald's same store sales are off you know they're they're all their increases are coming from um their overseas operation\nI I I I tell folks I said listen it generation y is now fourteen to thirty three years old it's eighty seven million people are just now starting to have children I said and they realize what their parents were feeding them for the last Twenty years [noise]\nIs it I said you ought to three ends up of a food it's called nutrition nutrition nutrition and what is mc Donald's famous for its not nutritious [laughter] no it's it's for French fries you\nArgue is what they tried to say heart people have the impression that it's not nutritional food\n[noise] ... correct and and so that's that's their problem and they they\nAre if you if you want to sell food now if you want to sell food or in in the supermarket and if you want to sell food in a restaurant you need to sell good food you can't tell you you can't sell stuff that's going to stop people's hearts\nWhat's going on with population trends are they shifting down to\nIt was you know it's funny you say that uh in Nineteen ... we we have a new generation is called Generation Z and Generation Z started and I'd I've two thousand five and they will they will be\nA but they will end around two thousand twenty four so they're not fully born yet [noise]\nBut in Nineteen eighty seven excuse me two thousand seven we had a record year in the United states we ... we had four million a three hundred and sixteen thousand babies were born and that that was more than Nineteen fifty seven which was the previous record fifty one years earlier\nBy what's happened since two thousand seven is is the the population has dropped like a stone we we've gone from producing a over four million babies a year down to a just a little over three million babies the here\nAnd and so this Generation Z will be smaller yeah\nThat's a big trend Ken stay with us we'll talk more about trends when we come back we'll take calls with you next hour Iran coast to coast they\nGet Daily Show updates right to your inbox for free with the ... newsletter sign up today at ... am dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nThere and welcome back in going back with us as we talk about trends the incredible trends that are I guess can not just businesses should be using things like this I Would guess anybody who's doing something marketing you name it should be aware of these things should night\nYeah absolutely if that does it it it's mysterious to me well why everyone doesn't take about this because it precipitate almost everything that we have in a market economy\nHow much has the smartphone change these things\n[noise] [noise] well it it has to a large degree um\nThe [noise]\nYou know and what what I tell people when when they asked me a question like that [noise] if people are still people when when you have a large number of people that are consumer or a specific product at a small number of people that consume a specific product\nThe large number of people will consume more though I Know that sounds ... but the ... the smartphone has a only aged folks in their ability to consume so uh it's it's a good thing from from that standpoint\nBut you have to keep in mind that the thing that drives commerce of the thing that drives you know consumption is the number of people in the market period\nNow that ... that simple isn't it ... it almost sounds ridiculous stuff in it but I'm ... I mean who is out there saying well\nSo large groups of people consume a lot of stuff and then there are smokers people consume smaller amounts of stuff but if I read the wall Street Journal every day and I read the marketing section and I know that the wall Street Journal just based on what I read doesn't understand that\nBecause they they look let me give you an example of it you know SUVs actually these were were bought by baby boomers are Twenty years ago in in vast quantities\nAnd then the the uh [laughter] um yeah I'm a bill companies had to figure out\nHow to sell the same number of SUVs to a generation X. as they did to the baby boomers and they couldn't do it so they they kept on firing their marketing department said it kept on firing their their cheat marketing officers because they couldn't come up with this secret\nSUVs to this other group but nobody bothered to count them and this other group of generation and now you find that they can be for small\nGood point my my twenty four year old granddaughter Ken was talking to me a couple of days ago and she said pop by you know kids are age she calls herself or Cuba but she's a young woman now we're not getting married like you folks used to and that's another trend can isn't it\nYeah and in you know it it's funny 'cause I'm trying to figure that one out because you know half of the kids that are born today or the babies that are born and that's all about you know demographics\nAre born or outside of wedlock and they're they're born outside of a of a marriage um the marriages seemed to come after the kids are born as opposed to for before a and there are certain cultures like the African American culture or where Seventy five percent of the kids are born outside of the\nThe uh um marriage is just it's a different time George\nNow if you could understand that you know whether it's a you know we're talking a lot about business but if you can understand that how much can you affect change\n[noise] well you know that that's another good question I'm not so sure that you can I I think you mean in terms of changing what the culture is doing I think the culture is going to do with the culture is going to do and right now we have the largest generation and history of our nation is currently fourteen to thirty three years old\nEighty seven ... million generation why millennials\nAnd I think they're going to do what they're going to do just like the uh uh you know you go back to forty years\nAnd ... you look at the you know what happened in the sixties and early seventies with the hippie culture they did what they did they just simply did what they did but then what happened they grew up uh you know I I actually spoke to my audience what happened to the to a sex drugs and rock and roll what happened to the ... the boomer hippies\nLive became Republicans [laughter]\nIn all cases\n[laughter] no not all cases but you know if if you if you look at [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThat this this is ... let me back up a second because this is something that that people need to understand [noise] [noise] ah [noise] between the ages right now I'm thirty four and fifty three we have a diminutive puppy a population of of indigenous or people that were born here\nThere were there were only about sixty nine million people born between sixty five an eighty four as opposed to the boomers that were that were roughly eighty million born between forty five and sixty four [noise]\nWhat does that mean that means that that that particular population could not a ... support the labor needs that we had in our country and it sucked in immigrants like like a a a vacuum\nThat particular generation right now is the generation that is make making people think that we're a nation of haves and have nots when when what we are as a nation that has a small indigenous population\nOf superimpose over where the heavy lift or should be ... where the with the you know our our strength should be in our population it's actually smaller\nSo the net result is a you know ... ... instead of having a you know ... ... and they should have haves and have nots with with the cushion in between of generation X we don't because they were never born\nWe're losing that cushion yeah well what we did and as you so you you have people saying that the the United\nAnd because we have the have nots but middle age and and I'm In a middle income uh our occupy exactly the same space so if you're middle ages small and then your middle income as small as well\nBut it's a demographic issue is just simply a question of of how many babies were born for that particular period\nCan't let me ask you this to be a ... let's use Facebook as an example you know they they've got the billions of people on line or they've got huge amounts of advertising dollars because of what they do socially\nBut I think they're starting to lose that I think they're starting to there's becoming a change their more I think advertisers you begin to say I'm not sure we're getting bang for a dollar a year or even for converting these in the sales because the market may not be what we really want what's happening with that\n[noise] a Facebook is kind of strange [noise] entity if you will and I tell folks listen if you're if you're not paying for it you are not the customer you're the product um as far as I'm concerned and I and I've got a Twenty one years experience in the marketing industry\nThey an Internet are um advertising is a bottomless pit you have no idea what your pie none and there's no way\nTo a reference any kind of success except return on investment so you you spend money on the Internet and and ah he just cross your fingers and hope that your sales go up if you're a sales go up you you don't know if it's if it's\nA relative to how much money you spend on the Internet but uh what what's happening with a a ... a enterprise there is is not good it really is and\nI mean it's huge but there's a trend here and to me the trend is very negative so that it\nIs involved in what's negative about it is is uh I I think he's totally disingenuous I I don't trust 'em\nA Facebook at all I I really don't I don't think I I think you have to understand George that everything that anybody writes on on Facebook can be analyzed\nAnd then the ... and and that analysis put people into categories and those categories uh our sellable and and what the secretary does with that information is sell it to anybody who would pay for it\nSo there there's there's there's no security and anything that you put on Facebook nothing\nAnd what about you know some of these wacky jobs you know the idiot that killed a loving people in the Jewish synagogues ... the guy who sends out these bombs these pipe bombs they use social media to kind of spelled their hatred um how come we can't catch them a little sooner\nYou tell me I I really don't know that\nRobert ... in a a Cesar ... than they are they are truly whacked jobs and um I don't know that that's\nThat's more a a more understanding of of of a of a psych uh graphics that the demographics as far as I'm concerned\nAnd what's happening in the housing market most younger people aren't buying houses they're renting what's gonna happen\nWhile they're renting because they [laughter] a trillion dollars of student\nLoans [laughter] yeah\nYeah but don't worry about it now what we're what we're literally facing with um a kids is is you have eighty seven million kids that are between fourteen and thirty three years old the kids are finally moving out of their parents' basements are throwing loyal as sharp as they don't deserve and and that they're starting households and getting married you know starting a household\nBest time perhaps today during a disaster you may not be able to stay in touch with your family or friends as easily as you think\nAnd it's not always as simple as using your cell phone

sand on on the ... what good does it though the ... it's just too overwhelming\nThought where's your answer your question on of information\nThat we get as it is overwhelming so what do you do with it you know if if I'm a ... a lot of aid that the Gen Y kids the millennials are actually tuning it out you could ask them simple questions about you know what's going on in the world and they can't answer it [noise]\nBut ... how do you sift through this which you have to do is you have to compare several sources that's and that's what I Do when I Do research and when I Do presentations I really don't\nCome to any kind of conclusions unless I've compared a variety of sources and that's what helps me with information and in terms of Amazon\nI think Amazon is just you know ... what we did when we open the Internet we opened up the world we we just that was our view to the interests of the world and I think what's what's uh going down with Amazon is just something that's naturally transpiring and I think if you're just going to get nothing but bigger\nYou're going to see commerce is going to change everything about commerce is going to change\n[noise] we've got a company that ships radios they make radios and they make darn good radio see crank company and I I used to get my radios from them long before I started doing this show and it was simple you you go on line you order what you want it's delivered to your house in some cases it's free shipping\nBased on the deal that they've got at any given time\nI mean you don't have to park your car you don't have to spend money on gasoline you don't have to find a crowd it's a it's it's amazing that's amazing I mean\nIt's infinitely easier you know ... when when you look at the boomers what how do you do business with a boomer you save them some time you make their life easy and you don't rip them off this was perfect\nAnd so Amazon is is is going to do nothing but a grow a you know and that online retail is too will exceed ten percent where it is now is probably go to twenty percent thirty percent\nI think so too they hurt brick and mortar but I mean the the the goods are still being manufactured\nUm the Amazon employees zillion people um some of which complain about their job there\nI'm more conditions and things like that but I mean there are retired people so there's displacement so when the bricks and mortar stores go really the only big thing to get hurt and you know some people are out of work but they can find jobs elsewhere\nIt's the real estate that just sits there what's gonna happen with that stuff\nThat's a good question you know I Know that a a commercial real estate is you know as you know suffering some issues right now some serious issue\nI mean if you were an investor would you buy a mall\nRight about now no no no but but it but I certainly would buy residential you would I Would buy residential every day of the week yeah seller rent out yes [laughter]\nYeah no in fact I'm you know I I have a house in them but either Springs Florida and and I and I have a house in in ... Connecticut\nAnd I'm In the house and had an Connecticut's four thousand square feet I don't know my wife and I just rattling around in it and what we've decided to do is we're going to rent it or we're going to come up with an executive rental forward and and that's going to be necessary because people are gonna\nAnd what we've decided to do is we're going to rent it or we're going to come up with an executive rental forward and and that's going to be necessary because people are going to come into our area that don't want to buy houses people will come into all areas that don't want ... got to be very big\nGoal you've got that company like air being beat up the rent a house and houses and I mean now I Know people who own houses and they solicit through air being be exclusively and they're making a lot of money doing\nThat really they're very happy ... well\nYeah and I I Would I Would subscribe to that it ... you're going to see in real estate across the board it you're going to see dramatic changes [noise]\nOne of the things that that's kind of puzzling me right now and I don't have an answer to it is this working from home and that that's going to you know remain in place and remain as as a major issue going forward because that was precipitated by a small labor force\nThat essentially demanded a you know their their own way but what we have now is a huge huge biggest labor force that we've ever had\nIs a very young right now in just entering the process\nCan I Want to talk with you about India when we come back and also we'll take final calls in just a moment how about your books can people still get them ...\nOh yeah K. juicy direct dot com K.
