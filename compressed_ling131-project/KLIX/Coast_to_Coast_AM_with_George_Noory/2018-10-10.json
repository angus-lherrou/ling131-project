L. I. X. [noise]\n\nActually sending three thirty seven hundred and strip believing symmetry those kinda G G I decided to hold them and very head DJ younger and I\nKnow I was gonna say what a basically what you're addressing here and rightfully so to deplore the actions that take place here on the micro level this is what happens because the public is dead and it's been dead for quite some time and it predates the election of Donald Trump\nAnd it's the result of that and the fact that the government exists only in in any bombs state following the cool\nPerpetrated by Mitch McConnell back in twenty or sixteen was it yes twenty sixteen or twenty Seventeen rather when a way that no twenty fifty and I'm Sorry\nWhen or if he ... he decided that he would singlehandedly with a minimal majority decide to take control of the last institution that we had integrity and faith in which is the Supreme Court because the psycho drama is only a result of the frustration because the Democrats\nWho are the only main opposition to anything that occurs at that level failed to address what had occurred and now all that energy all that anger all that hatred is now translating it trickling down into the lower levels of the micro\nOf course but the ... billion is what I really don't understand is that I I and I beginning to I I was beginning to look at this and say to myself\nLook what we have here is we have fragmented portions within a country fighting against one another this isn't about one group against another group has been several groups wanting a piece of the action and that's why I think when you have that many groups want to get to see action in the fight we are in we're in a point a civil war we really are\nNo no we are this this is what's gonna happen because white now it seems that because I'm disappointed disgusted interjected by the fact that it would appear the Democrats at least right now are willing to allow this to occur at not to get their hands dirty\nAnd I'm questioning what is going on in the Senate level because I hear stories from\nOther radio shows more you know the mainstream type I consider you believe it or not a little more mainstream that you might like to be hearing these say\nBut along those lines where they said Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer are getting together and even though they have the fifty one vote threshold the judicial appointments that are being shoved through one after another after another\nUm he does have a a place at the table with it and I'm Wondering what is going on here rather\nThan he just he just seems like it's by design and like I said if if we look at a Senate in the mid term we find the Republicans hold to hold the majority in the Senate I like you know with the Knicks tipping points can it be like you know what the next scratch you could buy all the time they are going to be\nBack to your very first caller I'm a person who goes around and have been saying now for three years that I consider the Supreme Court\nGoing to be harkening back to your very first caller I'm a person who goes around and have been saying now for three years that I consider the Supreme Court deal legitimize because while I can I meant to you politicizing the court you can never make it partisan political because\nThe integrity of the faith of the judiciary was the last the institution\nEvery everything's been radicalized everything's being radicalized CJ that's the whole point\nWell that's it but you didn't have to go this far and that's what I don't understand it and it seems like there's there's collusion between the two of them on a new because there's nobody complaining about anything here and like I said I don't buy that you know I don't like Donald Trump that I Know I Can't I cannot blame this on their life to blame it\nOn the Machiavellian machinations of Senator McConnell and when he was the only allowed complaining and ... and the ... of the loaning obstructionism and changing goal post in that long winded speech he gave I was sitting here waiting for the very words to choke have after everything that had occurred\nRight right right well I mean we'll see what happens after the midterms and it's going to continue to the midterms and then we really see the gloves come off I think that's something that will have to be prepared for it it's going to patch in Illinois Hi patch or on ground zero\n... on on on very nervous and I try to do [noise] um [noise] I understand and I've seen a witness to a lot of things that happen to hear what you're going to feel like you got justice if they settle where you went in court and you don't understand they don't care if not their money\nYou don't understand when unlimited we understand he was you know understanding naturally get caught at you hatch patch you don't understand the situation my wife has a place\nIn law enforcement in in public safety she has a job in law enforcement public safety\nOkay I understand she identified herself and it still was abused I understand it so I don't\nCare when I've been around these people I also work for the state of Illinois okay I reported thanks ... nothing was done except for\nI was attacked on a um you have to you had a hit and target the actual yet to be able to target and sue the officer is what\nWe're dealing with it in a lot of ways are not just you know we got a lawyer just in case we were doing doing within a lot of ways and we're not going to be a you know we're not nasty to the police there's no way you're going to be nasty places especially when my wife has to work around police officers\nIt's it's just something that I I didn't know who the officer was what he thought he was doing and who's the body was messing with but you know when you have a public safety officer\nIn the area who was involved with very command and those people that come in and and she said that and says hey you know EMT are there needs\nTo be an EMT here because the guys in pain and the guy decides who the hell are you to tell me that's when it gets ugly and that's what happens to know I don't believe for one minute that is going to be any enemies here because I think Janine is smart enough to understand what's going on here I mean it's not going to be like you know it's not like most people I mean you know when we when it was first heard about the number of people\nGood police officers were their tobacco raw and there were plenty of police officers are little backed up and I'm sure we're not going to name the guy's name when I was gonna say it happened\nMaxine Waters said to harass people she should have been taken in and she should have been talk to but she didn't she got away with it and now people are doing it\nWell Maxine Waters ill and uh what's the guy's name Corey Booker or something like that Cory\nLet her know that anybody who sit there and encourages this type of a\nSafe and encouraging this type yeah either\nYou know it made it to the media doesn't to encourage it too\nWell I I think it could lead to assassinations because if you look in our past of remember we used to have abortion doctors that were assassinated mhm and and this is the level of hatred that we're at right now that you know if you're\nConfronting somebody in a restaurant or at their own who's to say that they don't have a gun and they're not going to assassinate somebody\nWell yeah that's the point you see that that that's the moment they're waiting for their waiting for the moment where somebody has a gun and shoot somebody who harasses\nThem telling them that they can go one way in a car you know they're waiting for that moment there waiting for that moment so and say no ah I'm turning left my gun says I'm turning left and shooting three or four people blocking my car said that I can go forward and backwards\nWell actually uh tonight on Tucker Carlson he led with the film footage of what's going on in Portland\nYeah I Know and when did you think of that did you see it\nI saw exactly what you were talking\nAbout terrorists to be I'm embarrassed to be in the city because of that because our mayor won't do a damn thing about our police don't act but they'll do they'll do other things including you know my wife because she was doing her ... she was standing away from the officer let me ask you do is work she said who she was ...\nThings including you know harm my wife because she was doing her ... she was standing wave the officers let me ask you do is work she said who she was and then she said by the way I Believe this man he's an EMT just saying\nAnd and he got angry and hit her she said oh I was reaching for my radio\nWell I Hope in regards to your wife that um you said you have an attorney [noise] um I Hope the arrangements that you have with your attorney is that he's taking a sudden the contingency basis both on his face and his costs\nWell I I did this is it in my view doing ... doing 'cause she has like I said her position she she works in public safety and I'm only giving the barebones thing I'm not going the whole thing but she does that so she knows exactly how the she knows how the courts work she knows everything about the court\nYeah so um I think a lot of people don't realize that if you're um a ... if you're a Supreme Court justice a member of Trump's cabinet or a senator or a member of the house representatives\nYou don't have security if you notice when these people it when you see the footage and these people being confronted they don't have security\nTo only a handful have security if you're in a leadership position right speaker of the house where justice right but the other justices cabinet members senators house representatives they don't have security\nI think they should have security because I tell you somebody is going to get shot at\nWell rice and does it need security on does it come at rice and went out they could have gotten to the president could have gotten to the joint chiefs it could have gotten to Ted Cruz\nSome things are a lot harder to protect than others so of course rice and going through the mail system is is very difficult to protect against\nRight it's really hard and then see that's the thing about\nClyde how it comes down to you and me and your listeners I wouldn't be very reluctant this political season to put a\nBumper sticker on my car or a sign in front of my house because I think you're leaving yourself open to get vandalized either having your car vandalized light skinned or having your house vandalized and oh yeah it does it like your politic\nWell that's the thing that's how radical we've become the idea of radicalization if the radicalization has not proved that we're in a civil war right now I don't know what will the idea that you can't express yourself\nBy having a political view either way and having someone come in and say I don't like his political view I'm going to keep his car or I don't like his political view I'm going to spit in his pizza\nThese are the things that are going on in this country right now and and this is evident I mean if you want to bring physical harm to people regardless of who you are in uniform out of uniform whether or not you're wearing a mask on the street with a baseball bat if you want to bring harm to people you're participating in a civil war\nSo here's here's what I think could happen and you remember I started off by saying that we're we're in a conventional civil war as compared to our first civil war but you could see this situation growing and growing\nAnd escalating violence so that we are sometime in the future in a civil war that looks like our first civil war you could easily have red states that get flu stay quiet\nBut that's not what it is hoping or if it's not what it is because it was bad then you would have to you you have to take into consideration all of the groups have been organized people like black lives matter\nMe to a separatist groups ah you know a patriot prayer Proud Boys you know I I Am trying to go down the list of all these groups that want to be heard\nRight and I think a lot of these groups are tend to identify either with the left or the right leaning Democrats republic\nIt's that I'm just saying that let's leave open the possibility that in the future of this civil war could escalate into something much more violent than it is now\nRight all out war between people a purge when I'm trying to talk about do you think\nYou could see you could see the the military getting involved in the first is getting involved\nLike South America exactly what it is\nGoing to happen in South America jak things for the call Tony in Texas Hi Tony you're on ground zero\nTake quite I'm enjoying your show tonight or I spoke to a couple of months ago and I mentioned that that my family my mother and my father were in Argentine at\nThe same time that you were ... and I think it's very difficult for you and I because you know we know what happened there with the factions guy faction what very potent America don't understand\nIs that all of these different groups if a civil war situation breaks down and there's not a um there's not a a\nA police force or ... or civil order what you have also are within the factions individuals settling vendetta ... okay that it just goes from bad to worse\nNow my father's family I didn't say this before but you'll understand the insinuation here my father's family or German ... ... now the ... in in in Argentina it was amazing how the police\nWere uh they would do retribution strikes that were very very similar to what the guest stop Bo did in Nazi Germany wasn't that amazing how that occurred\nAlso amazing how they were rounding up Jews as well do you find that amazing that they were doing that and is it interesting that Mr Big Leo was part of that and these are pump now isn't that amazing\nWell I what I I've been sanctioned for criticizing the Holy Father obviously I'm Roman Catholic so I Will say Jesuits a life of my family was not very fond of the Jesuits and you notice\nThat a certain a Jesuit turned on its own people and that and the death squads came in and killed a lot of friends as a result of that\nOh yeah yeah we don't want to talk about that do Tony that yeah the ... the death squads killed nuns and priests under his direction but no one talks about that were just so happy that he's pope now\nWell I'll tell you the people in America this is very important to what you're talking about tonight um I Hope well I'm going to say something and you may disagree I Would hope that perhaps the national guard\nWould be called in sooner than later so that it doesn't get out of hand especially in states on the left coast\nWell you you watch what happens during the mid term there'll be a lot of security I'll bet there'll be a lot of during the turnstile\nPaint cried I don't know if if you're aware of this but Sen Cruz is not going to be harassed much longer because\nThe governor of our state governor Abbott dispatched to detail of Texas Rangers to protect our senators and I don't know the American people know how bad the Texas Rangers are\nBut there is that going to be anybody hollering at either of our two senators on another occasion\nWell that that makes sense that they call those in because I don't know why Sen Cruz was targeted targeted before the rice and attack that really raised a lot\nOf red flags there I think [noise] and I don't like Ted Cruz X. amount of buying a new like ... [laughter] I'm just saying I just think it's wrong and they send rice and to him I don't really mean bad bad to deserve this type of treatment\nFrom anybody and and that's the thing that you know you don't necessarily like the politics that doesn't mean you have to act like an emotional zombie\nJust because you don't like a certain individuals that one of the middle east\nBut you know you don't necessarily like their politics that doesn't mean you have to act like an emotional zombie just because you don't like a certain individuals that just as many\nLegal in eight states generally quiet and you don't do\nThat now we don't try to tell people they can't believe that it actually happened and he did and it's happening again you're in the United states to get the same people are involved Henry Kissinger ladies and gentlemen Tony we'll talk to you later already by by Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred us to really fix them at three thirty seven hundred movie back\n[noise]\nYour garbage another life recycle learn how I I Want to be recycled dot org brought to you by keeping America beautiful and yet counsel for Dave Ramsey show\nThat's the largest my mom and I don't know maybe three of them are you in on\nSaving their income in retirement\nAnd then you start doing by a Bible college town house early\nThat led by Mr seven\nDifficult to change your life weekdays from Yemen until ten news radio Thirteen to N.\nK.

at the sherpas technology group in Silicon valley of former investment banker with UPS in New York His world view has been turned upside down in the late to two thousand sixteen period when he was exposed to world changing science\nWhich suggested that country the mainstream assumptions consciousness has not produced by the brain\nNow after researching extensively he wrote this book in the end the upside down thinking to introduce all of us to these cutting edge ideas and areas on coast to coast I bet that was really shocked you initially mark didn't it\nAbsolutely shocked me thank you for having me on\nI'm looking forward to this too I always ask questions of guests scientists and people who are experts on the brain\nDoes consciousness exist outside of the brain or not now the pure scientists Joe the medical professional folks mark\nWould always say you have to have the brain in order to have consciousness in the brain dies it all goes with it and I've always thought no there's something else here with consciousness you finally found out did you\nI did and I I was very squarely in what noted the material is science camp which suggests that the universe is fundamentally made of matter there was a big bang about Thirteen point eight billion years ago killing the universe with physical material that we call matter\nAnd when you have enough matter in this universe you're bound to get interactions between those pieces of matter we call that chemistry\nWhen you have enough random chemical reactions you're at you're bound to end\nMolecule like DNA chance says that would happen and DNA leads to the evolution of living organisms like a human being the human being developed the brain and consciousness awareness comes out of the brain\nThat's the perspective and if you buy into that which I used to then when the brain dies consciousness dies memories are gone so when you think about meaning in life\nIf you take the material is perspective very strictly there can't be any meaning because once one is dead there's no memories there is no consciousness and that's the prevailing perspective as you mentioned in in narrow science and most of science today\nNo you know you're ... I Would lose money and saying that you write a book about consciousness how did you do this\nI Would have lost money too [laughter] so it was\nAbout two years ago when I first learned of these phenomenon as I said I was totally material is that is what I Would call it now in hindsight\nBut I I randomly stumbled across odd cast that started talking about these ideas I was actually listening to a health podcast called extreme health radio and the next one in the queue was a woman who talked about energy and psychic abilities that she had\nAnd at the end of that her name is Laura Powers she mentioned that she had her own podcast called healing powers and I said oh that's interesting and I just decided to put it on driving from San Francisco to my office down further in the peninsula\nAnd I listen to different episodes and people there were many different people who've talked about things that I Would have considered to be paranormal like psychic abilities the ability for consciousness to survive bottled up things I had no familiarity with\nAn overtime just hearing enough different people describing similar perspectives on reality I got curious and so I started looking at the research and then discovered a whole body of science that put into question everything that I thought was real\nAnd this was a very jarring and disorienting realization for me because I thought life was meaningless and here I was discovering that maybe the brain isn't the producer of consciousness maybe the brain's more like an antenna or a filtering mechanism that process is consciousness and the identity that we have is not\nTied to the body so that totally freaked me out and a change in my world view completely led me down the path of intense research because I needed to rethink all of reality spent about a year of basically nonstop research outside of the office outside of my day job in finance and consulting\nAnd as I was doing that I told friends overtime at first I was kind of afraid to tell people about it because it sounded so outlandish but once I got a hold of the research I told people about it and the reactions I got were actually very positive and these were people who like me didn't have any familiarity topics\nUm and and people told me that their lives are actually shifting in a positive direction after we had these conversations and after they heard about some of the science which will discuss tonight so after hearing enough of this feedback and also seeing that I had intense passion for this topic I decided to put my thoughts on paper and just organize my thoughts and see what happened\nSo it was July Fourth weekend in two thousand Seventeen which was a four day weekend and I said okay let me see what happens I locked myself in my apartment in San Francisco\nAnd decided to write and I kind of channeled my inner investment banker I used to be an investment banker in New York during the financial crisis so I just worked nonstop for four days and ended up writing more than half of the book that's now out\nAnd then finish it over the next few weekends so all of a sudden I'm here at the end of July twenty Seventeen with a manuscript and ultimately a cold emailed bill Gladstone who's now my agent at my publisher\nMultiple people recommended that I reach out to him I sent him a cold email and I was fortunate to get a positive response from him and bill represents Eckhart totally\nDeeper meal Donald Walsh a and so that's where we are now what did you mean\nThat car totally ... you know wash 'em and so that's where we are\nSuper now what did you mean by an end to upside down thinking\n[noise] I consider upside down thinking to be the material is perspective that we start with matter and we end up with consciousness through a brain so the brain creates consciousness what I now see to be the more likely picture reality is one in which consciousness is primary existing\nBeyond space and time so instead of saying we get we start with matter and end up with consciousness consciousness comes first\nRights with out the brain does consciousness exist at all and the answer is yes correct\nThat's what I think the evidence suggests now with science back us up\n[noise] so my book is the scientific evidence suggesting that that idea is true and there are a number of phenomena that suggest that there is a consciousness existing independently of a functioning body so one example is chapter nine or I talked about near death experiences and if you'd asked me a few years ago with a near death experience\nI Would have said well isn't that just to hold his nation that happens when someone is about to die it's like a evolutionary mechanism that allows people to feel better before they're going to die\nI started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple uh first of all what's described it in near death experiences is typically a very lucid enriched type of consciousness it's not one that you would expect when there's minimal or no brain function at all\nAnd even more than that we find instances in which people accurately report what happened during the time that their brain was either not very functional or it was completely off like in cardiac arrest\nIt's known as a vertical out of body experience so the person it out of his or her body when their bodies not functional and they're seeing things in the room they come back to their body after the near death experience and they accurately report what happens so that it suggests that some kind of consciousness existing independently of the body\nMarks website mark Goldberg dot com is linked up for you and coast to coast am dot com the name of his book we're talking about in in the upside down

S. government studies which we can talk about later they tend to go into a trance like state and\nPeople who are better ... seem to have enhanced psychic abilities that seems to be an emerging finding\nI'm always wonder though if somebody is really tuned into certain things if they can pick up all kinds of different events\nWithout really having the send or having much to do with it I I I think that's a receiver might have a better effect in changing the outcome\nI think that's probably true people that tend to have heightened abilities whether it's ... or communications with the deceased\nThrough medium ship these are people that tend to be picking up information\nAnd if we use the analogy of the brain as being like an antenna which is not precise but it's it's helpful metaphor where there's a consciousness that's not localized to the body those who are able to better configure their antenna so to speak are better able to pick up signals whether it's from a particular standard or from something else\nNow what would have happened had you gone to the receiver the person in the room and simply not show them any of them for pictures but they just had to tell you what they think she sent to them what do you think would happen\n... well I think we'd have a distribution first of all we had just an everyday person versus a talented psychic if we had a talented psychic then we'd probably get some some pretty strong cats and that's what we saw at the U.S government\nEveryday person I think it would be it the more difficult study to examine because the effect is so small\nWell let's talk about the U.S government studies and the things that they've conducted we know that they've been very interested in this for very long time\nYes and again this is something that was very new to me I'm the program is sometimes referred to as the Stargate program and you're all use psychic spies for national security purposes\nMany of luring I've been on this show\nBy the way up during the Cold War and and the people who have more involved in it were a laser physicist at Stanford University there were many reviewers who are involved you say this was a real so there are many people talking about the fact that this was real\nI'm In my book I I have some documents from the CIA which had been declassified recently\nAnd the phenomenon that that was being studied was typically the telepathy was one that remote viewing\nIs the primary one which is the ability to perceive something at a distance without being physically so it's like you could see something in your mind that far away without even being there without seeing it with your eyes\nIt sounds completely paranormal consciousness is localized to the brain\nBut if consciousness is non local then it's at least conceivable preoccupy man I'm say explicitly and I I'm looking at it right now remote viewing is a real phenomenon this is from a declassified documents that has been released recently [noise]\nSo I mean for someone like me who's just trying to objectively look at evidence if I thought something like that in my business world that I had a consulting case for example that's really strong evidence whether one wants to believe it or not that to me at least made me question things\nUm even further than that\nThere's a page on a science channel and there are some very credible people including a someone from Cal Tech\nThe next page in the document says science panel's report principle findings either direct quotes implications are revolutionary evidence to impressive to dismiss as mere coincidence\nYou know in many cases many cases we have looked at these uh tell a path to studies\nAnd I've always wondered if the government really never stopped doing it with continued now I've asked some of the people who've been involved in these studies\nThat just that same question and they say no it stopped because they would have kept us on they would've used us I'm not sure what the government has found other people and they've continued these kinds of mine studies\nWell certainly there were some successes reported in the program during the Cold War for example former President Jimmy Carter confirmed that remote viewers were used to find a downed Russian bomber in an African jungle that they couldn't find\nSo there was some utility to the program whether it was reliable all the time or not is another question but sometimes it was useful\nSo you'd have to think that if if it were a useful thing to be doing that\nOr organizations would be trying it\nPre cognition mark a very valuable tool for people\nIn their life because of the ability to sense things make decisions based on those gut feelings and to react to them now a lot of people don't react they don't do it it's something happens when they go oh I should have done that and I I knew what\nWhat is your view of pre cognition\nSo there are some studies which show a very subtle pre cognition known as ... sentiment where the body is sensing something very subtly and we need to stick to show it before something happens and there are other examples\nThe dream known as a pre copy the dream the dream something and then the next day it happened exactly as they dreamed it that much less subtle but if we go to the pre sentiment studies this is where I think it becomes very

[laughter] or either or but um I I kinda think of it on a spiritual level what you're saying as well\nI Would think more ... maybe one in the ... what do you think\nThe thank you for your question Monday I'm I tend to agree with you George and there's an allergy I Love also from Dr Fernando Castro which summarizes the way I think about things\nWhich is to imagine reality as being like a stream of water where water represents consciousness\nAnd each of us is like a whirlpool within that stream so we're having a localized individual experience within the broader stream but we are fundamentally still made out of water so what happens when the physical body dies that's like a world will dissipating on the water doesn't leave the stream it just transitions into a different state\nAnd so the water to me of consciousness and consciousness is having this Friday of experiences whether localized in Milwaukee or otherwise industry\nDo you think that's consciousness is a normal process of moving more it's a supernatural\n[noise]\nAs a normal process of living more it's a supernatural\n[noise] the way I view consciousness is that it's like max ... he said I regard consciousness as fundamental regard matter as derivative\nFrom consciousness meaning that consciousness is the basic underpinning of reality and quantum mechanics and other things point to that but I Do everything that we experience as being a basically a modulation that is happening within consciousness\nHow has this new knowledge for you more changed your life\nIt's changed it massively [laughter]\nSo I alluded to this earlier that the material is perspective that I subscribe to\nA leads to a very bleak outlook on life once your brain ... over\nI mean I understood the implications of that and I think that's what our education system is teaching\nUm now I think that that consciousness does not died when the body dies because it's the consciousness isn't dependent on the body so I see much more uh meaning in life there's another phenomenon that I think is really really important and I I think I Wish that had been taught me a long time ago\nBut going back to the near death experiences what people often report is known as a life review where they experience their whole life in a flash and again this is one their brain as either offer highly impaired\nAnd they're judging themselves for how they acted during their life\nBut this is the kicker that really I think about this every day is that some people report experiencing the life or a view through the eyes of those they affected so let's say Bob harmed chain in his life and Bob is having a life review he might experienced the pain through chains eyes and he comes back\nTo his life forever changed carrying much more about\nUh how we treat people rather than material goods so it only talked about meeting in life the life review as a potential lens if we take that as a literal phenomenon about you know the purpose here is really to treat one another well\nDo you think in our life that we were given this gift to be able to do these incredible things\nThrough consciousness free cognition to lump in the

percent there's a subtle ability even people in people who aren't trained\nI think their ability that are just simply not harness in modern society because these ideas are considered anomalous and

remote viewer there was brought in a was Paul and I believe he was in a ... which is I Know it sounds odd but uh he spoke broken ...\nIsraeli descent from what I can get up who I dealt with over there mhm my question is that again I don't believe in\nAny of this other stuff but I Do believe in a remote viewing because of his I guess you would say non English or non American ...\nUh I guess association with nationality is there any research or anything where there's a culture or a nationality that is more than ... ...\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there were there were great remote viewers all over the planet or but it doesn't skew anything specifically\n\nI Would say that consistent with what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic isn't being research widely enough to understand if there are certain trend there are certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be what\nThe ability to perceive something where the mind alone\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has ... outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the wall or an allergy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though they're localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they

viewing\nBut it's er it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole so what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs 'cause you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nOr unfortunately with me only because of my background [noise] it would be you know personal experience I uh [noise]\nA lot of things that I ...

survives outside of the physical brain than physical body\nBut it's there it's out there in the ether I mean can we categorically all agree on that\nCommittee evidence point in that direction more strongly than any other direction when you put together the phenomenon that we discussed night a psychic phenomena like till after the psycho can eat as pre cognition\nNear death experience as children with at like memories when you put all these together combined with certain phenomena of quantum physics\nIt's they get that consciousness is playing the fundamental role in the universe beyond space and time\nWe've got George in Corpus Christi Texas now hey George welcome to the bird ...\nGeorge ah may God Bless you and your show continue lesson you thanks wonderful really wonderful\nAnd my uh my question is do you ever got tons of colors a reincarnation as a result of consciousness\nLiving outside the body in each of us so they can consciousness moves on to affect another human being good or evil out is free will play a part in or effect consciousness and I'll take my reply all right\nThis free will have anything to do with it mark\nThis is a very tricky\nYou know free will get ultimately boils down to who is the agent that we're speaking out that has the free well um are we talking about the ... body having free well are we talking about the consciousness itself\nAnd if we think of consciousness as being like the stream of water than all there is is consciousness\nSo at the level of the fundamental consciousness it would appear that there is a infant it pretty well but at the level of\nPerhaps ... an individual that is considering itself to be separated from that consciousness or at least appearing that way than perhaps the free world does not exist at the same level that I make that\nYeah it does it on a very difficult subject\nIt's very difficult and I think there are some of the concept that we're talking about night I think are beyond what our linear human mind can conceptualize sort of like insanity we all know infinity exists though can we really understand what it means I think there are certain concepts that our brains just limit from understanding fully\nYou think somebody like Jesus understood the ability of consciousness and how to deal with is how to use it a Andy Andy used it\nI I think there were probably people throughout history um who really understood the nature of reality and I don't know the details of how Jesus might've interplay with consciousness but from the pieces I I've heard it's possible that he was one of these individuals who really understood\nHow things work and it seems that when one understands reality perhaps we can do things that seem totally paranormal but again they're not paranormal under this alternative framework\nWe have a guest his name's Joe ... a gallon burger and he's a he's a professor and he is conducted experiments in Las Vegas one of his books is called liquid luck he has concluded beyond a shadow of the doubt\nThat the ability of the mind and attitude will determine whether you win or lose and his studies in Las Vegas where he's tested\nAnd ... and ... and he said it's on candy so if somebody goes in the Las Vegas offbeat positive uh there's a high likelihood they're going to win\nBut if they go in we're going to lose this isn't going to happen they're going to lose and and he said the results are on candy I think that's all tied together like consciousness it's all part of the same don't you\nI'm not familiar with that exact studies but I'm very open to the idea for the reason that you just state of consciousness is the basis of reality where everything is just the stream of consciousness than the reality we're in is almost malleable and sometimes very subtle where you have a random number Gatorade or that's behaving slightly non randomly\nAnd other cases we have reports like he talked about a metal being that using the mind so who's to say that outcomes which is just a part of the physical reality\nCould also be affected by the way our consciousness is acting\nEast of the Rockies Beaumont, Texas we go James waiting for a cello James\n... Ah yes real quickly before a make my favorite I like the uh respect of this disagree with a ... that are a few of a bill about the effects of drugs this Bush in the fall and the mind or if you know it's an indicator\nThat consciousness is a product of the mine ... I'm a you know as you the person speak him into a tape recorder as an example um you know at that example would be a consciousness\nAnd uh the play back of the tape recorder or you know if the typing wrinkles clinical though something will end up playing this started uh\nOceans that would be an example of the drug mine you know it's not the consciousness but that's the fact of the apparatus this I'm bringing about a distortion\nCope with consciousness put in it so it's not coming out in this to clarity that's you know or the wholesome of consciousness that went to his\nAh but anyway uh uh I think the prime example of a a spirit\nLiving outside of the body is that the self when you have a Gulf hunting so\nYou have a the example of an active consciousness uh this ... this thing outside of the by that\nI'm able to live with paid have knowledge of events that you know maybe it shouldn't uh otherwise a tele could nieces and everything else I think that's the prime example of consciousness uh outside the body right there\nWhen you think of them are\nWell there are studies using on mediums people who can communicate with the deceased is related to what James was just describing and they're actually controlled studies that have been done at the wind bridge Research Center\nAnd these studies are use five levels of blinding where the media and the person who allegedly can communicate with the deceased\nIs speaking on the phone to the researcher and all that person knows is the first name of the dead person and they're able to bring in non chance information American to peer reviewed journal studies on this ... nothing mediums are able to obtain information we need more research on it but that's an example of\nSomeone who appears to be deceased and a living person getting information about someone who is deceased\nWhere do you think in some mediums do you think some of them are very effective\nUh erasing an important point I think there is a tendency [noise]\nUm I think in the mainstream to say that there are frauds out there that are claimed to be mediums and maybe there are some fraud I think there are some people that have real abilities and the ...

day welcome Ron good to talk with you good morning looking forward to this ah tell me about this near death experience\nYeah everybody wants to hear about that I think that's the funniest thing because ah\nI I had cut my fingers off on a table saw a large yeah well you know anyways uh I went to the hospital and they looked at it and they really couldn't do anything at that time so they can to wrap them up and nice\nAnd kept me an emergency room to convey a specialist at six and a half hours later they\nPut them all back together and ah you know if it was fine but during the night um my doctor came up to see me and she realized something was wrong even though I I I thought I felt fine and she called in for a CAT scan actually had to bring the woman and hospitals nobody at that time\nAnd they realized they had a blueberry embolism and\nFrom then on things but yeah they have\nA well Lewis is all going on I had what I Believe was a death experience or it's not like the\nUsual edgy here and and that it was I was just basically in a different place it was extremely\nBright white I guess is the best way to describe it and uh they were uh people their figures anyways I couldn't really see any features or anything but they also white and the [noise]\nThe weird thing about it is also there was what I thought was [laughter] it\nSounds really ... music it had that mhm type thing and\nAlso it felt a and there's a line in the ... like a prayer that I always quote lead as it felt like home with a very comfortable it was very warm\nAnd then the whole thing just be disappeared like the closing of an Irish and it was a law that bright with us and it was just them jak ah\nThat was then and there was no music was just my heart beat on the morning there was nobody around and it certainly wasn't a long so I when I got a hospital I didn't know if it was a true experience or was it just the drugs they gave me so that's how I kind of got into the paranormal\nWhen did you conclude that ah it wasn't just the drawings that there was something really unusual going on here for you\nYou know it's something you you just have to um what's the word I'm looking for the ... his ... they're really either believe it or not and uh\nSo I I Know that I had this experience can I tell you it is absolutely a and yet I just that the experience you know can absolutely tell you it wasn't you know so it's one of those mystery that that pushes me to the other uh things that they do\nThey re attached to the fingers were they able to do\nYeah yeah well oddly enough and uh how many do you cut off I cut the the middle one all on my left hand at the middle and totally off the the um next to it I had had several places that was\nA kind of dangling the top of the funding I head cut off completely or they actually put a ... when they put together my ah middle finger and so if I ever given by the finger I always tell them it's not me [noise]\nYou know 'cause it's possess asking him [laughter] I was a joke\n[laughter] ha ha ha at three thirty in the morning it's good [laughter] not as soon as soon as the hand works normally yes it's amazing to guide yep\nIt's a you know what the time it's it's a little difficult with the cold but uh yeah it's fine\nNow tell us about the New England ghost project that you started what the what is that\nYeah it's a ... a pound Lama group was formed probably about Twenty years ago um when I get to the hospital was looking for something to do and I'm media one was often a course in TV production at the time because my hand was cast now there's all kinds of blood than us and things so it looked interesting\nIt was a thorough cause but are not up to complete it you had to do it on a a show on something and I suddenly had

is no doubt about it [laughter] or absolutely my uh I guess my question is is why why wouldn't have to try to do something to fix the house is that when they seem to get angry\nWiley they probably don't want any changes to the house who do you think Maureen\nYou are right on George um think about it if you put all your effort into a home and you made it what you thought was the best and it was wonderful and then you know you're still there and you're looking at it from a different side and now people are starting to change it you know sometimes that can actually started thinking about\nNo

tentative deal directly with her and not have to go through a meeting or not have to you know almost on demand type of thing but it's yeah I mean there are there are some\nUm better pieces equipment up there and there are some that that of course but you know there's nothing wrong with the good thermal imaging camera or a good ... I I Can't remember a a good record of\nThe marine how 'bout you will technology you change things\nYou know I honestly don't think that technology has reached a point that makes it more sensitive than human beings you know then what we can sense ourselves I mean we may be getting close with some areas that they're they're finding out but honestly I don't think it's sensitive enough yet\nSo you're not going to be replaced by a robot ghost investigator anytime\nSoon [laughter] I don't I don't think so\nI moved to new plan with calls here let's go to Z Hastings, Florida bill's with us than bill are you in a safe haven there ... hurricane headed your way\nWe're on the other side of the state we're south of St Augustine so I think we're uh we're probably going to be safe on this month\nOkay let's pray that everybody else is going to do\nIt a ghost story for you or when we came down here about eight years ago in Florida we were at the paranormal investigation if your Spanish Military hospital in St Augustine which is known to be haunted\nAnd while we were there a ghost or this was in the middle of the night that goes to actually made it table moved slightly up on the second floor so we went up to the second floor and we were able to communicate with the guest wife Susan and I and some other people that were there\nAnd we are we any um any man flashlight on a table and the ghost good answer our questions by making like blank\nAnd uh so risky and various questions and a to Z and got it to indicate that its name was verbally and then it was a was a had been a nurse at a at the hospital at one time\nDuring the Spanish period jeez you know I think and up at\nThe time my auntie um I had a briefcase with me and I was carrying around a large amount of money and then subsequently um for about the next year so time to time I would hear clicking noises that goes just teasing me that he was opening the briefcase\nI Love it\nNow while I'm On hold alone would happen is um if I drop like a little auto camp falls off the chair or something\nUm they last about a not last July but the one before that in the middle of the night having a little tiny bottled campers swimming softball player that year and it's fun and like a high percentage speed floor\nWhy are they mischief makers wrong what what are they trying to accomplish by playing around like\nSometimes the the just the tension seekers they they just want to be seen or heard other words that you know where I Am here pay attention to it if you have a a cat for instance the cats are pretty much like that so uh you know they'll they'll come in and do silly thing\nYeah I'm here pay attention to if you have a cat for instance the cats are pretty much like that to a you know they'll they'll come in and do silly things to what you know they're there and have pay attention to me so I I think that's that's primary it\nBut uh I I have to tell a funny story about the a book I wanted to my next door neighbor and ... and the\nNext day I came back I met her and she came back with the book and she said hey I take it back she says we were reading the or the first chapter\nAnd I was having a glass of wine and my glass shattered oh so she says I don't want anything to do with it [laughter] it's like glass shattering books is rather interesting thing to do anything really what they want to do I believe\n... each time what do you have a this woman from Sarah in Rochester I'm curious to run or marine can recommend ways to prevent ... from coming to a person's life evil into someone's why let's give that to you Maureen\nOkay so I don't even me with the wrong one\n[laughter] we'll get on men really will get\nTo yeah see I'm honestly I'm a big believer with the with the St Michael so I Know for me there's a few things one is intention if you you know you're looking for that and you're believing that evils coming into their life and you know it's very possible that you're you could invited in\nOn the other thing is I ... I have a granddaughter who is you know too young to do that sort of thing but she's picking up spiritually she thinks spirits are ready um so what we're doing is we have a St Michael's prayer card that I put underneath you know her mattress and in a pillow and I have a different varying crystals around the room to how\nMany ... um and she's doing a lot better so I Know you know and again it's an belief right so I Believe it works on its intention networks I think if you believe in yourself as well on you can tend to have bought out bought that out most times what'd\nYou say you Ron what about it\nWell I agree with it away and and you judge because you talk about the the hurricane in your intentions sure make it yeah so and tensions as a hundred percent but being a good old Catholic boy I rely on my religion the costs and so that's that's what I always recommend\nMe you know and I've seen this happen before I've seen hurricanes go from a category four down to two down to one and you know who's the sea prayer is the cause but hey you know what it worked\nYep crank Korea hundred percent with the judge pig\nIn any way we can let's go to bill in Idaho west of the Rockies Hi Bill go ahead doing OK wanted\nTo say first that uh oh I think we should all get centered in our\nHeart and intend to dissolve\nThe third yeah I agree [noise]\n... are questioning is probably more ring\nI have\nBeen serving the land for the last six years here I feel is a\nFor me to go back to serving man\nOf attempted to move in April when I had a series of events that showed me it was a time yet so my question is would it be time for me now to to move on [noise] do you\nDo a quick little reading here Maureen sure any one moment okay while you're pulling into a chat with Iran on this what's what are your next project Ron How often do you get called to investigate\nWell we had quite a few uh you know I Would say if you like it used to be daily but it's it's probably weekly now in uh we only choose the ones we really want to do basically uh uh\nYou get flooded\nYeah a lot of them to be honest with you judge so uh yeah and you've got a screen on somehow so which is all you know difficult ...\nOkay well let's go back to bill in Idaho and a marine go ahead\nI write a bell actually called the ... a couple of guys and one was aspirations pain you know ... to go after what you want ... it's almost like a spiritual card that says you know you need to be empowered is that\nUm and it's getting a good idea right you'll know when that moment is right to actually make canes and it seems like it and working behind me off I hate and cutting nice\nI'm working really hard and it's time to kind of read some of those benefits and actually to move forward um obviously I Can't tell you what to do but I think that if you were to make a change now would be good looking at the time are really pressure to\nLocate good luck bill hope everything works out next up we're going to Jaycee not that one in California Welcome to the show high Jaycee\n... lines draining tries it your opinion ... national and local news stories lodge at least your favorite hosts lots and lots of prizes you know a lot more\nRadio ... job to log on to win the war in Iraq you're strong following up on the news radio Thirteen John ...

His world view has been turned upside down in the late to two thousand sixteen period when he was exposed to world changing science\nWhich suggested that country the mainstream assumptions consciousness has not produced by the brain\nNow after researching extensively he wrote this book in the end the upside down thinking to introduce all of us to these cutting edge ideas and areas on coast to coast I've got this really shocked you wouldn't necessarily Marc didn't it\nAbsolutely shocked me and thank you for having me on\nI'm looking forward to this too I always ask questions of gas scientists and people who are experts on the brain\nDoes consciousness exist outside of the brain or not now the pure scientists or the medical professional folks mark\nWould always say you have to have the brain in order to have consciousness in the brain dies it all goes with it and I've always thought no there's something else here with consciousness you finally found out did you\nI did and I I was very squarely in what's known as the material is science camp which suggests that the universe is fundamentally made it matter there was a big bang about Thirteen point eight billion years ago killing the universe with physical material that we call matter\nAnd when you have enough matter in this universe you're bound to get interaction between does that matter we call that chemistry\nWhen you have enough random chemical reactions you're ... you're bound to\nEnd up with a self replicating molecule\nThat happened and DNA leads to the evolution of living organisms like a human being the human being developed the brain and consciousness awareness comes out of the brain that's the perspective and if you buy into that which I used to and then when the brain dies consciousness dies memories are gone so when you think about meaning in life\nIf you take the material is perspective very strictly there can't be any meaning because once one of the dead there is no memories there is no consciousness and that's the prevailing perspective as you mentioned in in narrow science and most of science today\nNo you know your mile I Would lose money in a shame that you would write a book about consciousness how did you do this\nI Would have lost money too [laughter] so it was\nAbout two years ago when I first learned of these phenomenon as I said I was totally material is that is what I Would call it now in hindsight [noise]\nUh but I I randomly stumbled across pod cast that started talking about these ideas I was actually listening to a health podcast called extreme health radio and the next one in the queue was a woman who talked about energy and psychic abilities that she had\nAnd at the end of it her name is Laura Powers she mentioned that she had her own podcast called healing powers and I said oh that's interesting and I just decided to put it on driving from San Francisco to my office down further in the peninsula\nAnd I listen to different episodes and people there were many different people have talked about things that I Would have considered to be paranormal like psychic abilities the ability for consciousness to survive bodily death things I had no familiarity with\nAnd over time just hearing enough different people describing similar perspectives unreality I got curious and so I started looking at the research and then discovered a whole body of science that put into question everything that I thought was real\nAnd this was a very jarring and disorienting realization for me because I thought life was meaningless and here I was discovering that maybe the brain isn't the producer of consciousness maybe the brain's more like an antenna or a filtering mechanism that process is consciousness and the identity that we have is not\nTied to the body so that totally freaked me out [laughter] and uh changed my world view completely led me down the path of intense research because I needed to rethink all of reality spent about a year of basically nonstop research outside of the office outside of my day job in finance and consulting\nAnd as I was doing that I told friends over time at first I was kind of afraid to tell people about it because it sounded so outlandish but once I got a hold of the research I told people about it and the reactions I got were actually very positive and these were people who like me didn't have any familiarity topics\nUm and and people told me that their lives are actually shifting in a positive direction after we had these conversations and after they heard about some of the science which will discuss tonight so after hearing enough of this feedback and also seeing that I had intense passion for this topic I decided to put my thoughts on paper and just organize my thoughts and see what happened\nSo it was July Fourth weekend in two thousand Seventeen which was a four day weekend and I said okay let me see what happens I locked myself in my apartment in San Francisco\nAnd decided to write and I kind of channeled my inner investment banker I used to be an investment banker in New York during the financial crisis so I just worked nonstop for four days and ended up writing more than half of the book that's now out\nAnd then finished over the next few weekends so all of a sudden I'm here at the end of July twenty Seventeen with a manuscript and ultimately a cold email bill Gladstone who's now my agent at my publisher\nMultiple people recommended that I reach out to him I sent him a cold email and I was fortunate to get a positive response from him and bill represents that\nTotally meal Donald Walsh um and so that's where we are [noise]\nAnd bill represents that car totally among the good people\nYou know wash 'em and so that's where we are\nSuper now what did you mean by an end to upside down thinking\n[noise] I consider upside down thinking to be the material is perspective that we start with matter and we end up with consciousness through a brain so the brain creates consciousness what I now see to be the more likely picture reality is one in which consciousness is primary existing beyond space and time\nSo instead of saying we get we start with mattered end up with consciousness consciousness comes first\nRight without the brain does consciousness exist at all and the answer is yes correct\nThat's what I think the evidence suggests would science back us up\n[noise] so my book is the scientific evidence suggesting that that idea is true and there are a number of phenomenon that suggest that there is a consciousness existing independently of a functioning body so one example is chapter nine\nOr I talked about near death experiences and if you'd asked me a few years ago with a near death experience I Would have said well isn't that just to host nation that happens when someone is about to die it's like a evolutionary mechanism that allows people to feel better before they're going to die\nI started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple uh first of all what's described in the near death experiences is typically a very lucid enriched type of consciousness it's not one that you would expect when there's minimal or no brain function at all\nAnd even more than that we find instances in which people accurately report what happened during the time that their brain was either not very functional or it was completely off like in cardiac arrest\nIt's known as a vertical out of body experience so the person is out of his or her body when their bodies not functional and they're seeing things in the room they come back to their body after the near death experience and they accurately report what happens so that is suggestive of some kind of consciousness existing independently of the body\nMarks website mark Goldberg dot com is linked up for you and coast to coast am dot com the name of his book we're talking about in in the upside down thinking or me or read the subtitle

colleagues when you wrote this book did it surprise them\nIt's a great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes there were very surprised to hear that but I think I Hope people about the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before until up at the pre cognition tell because you know psycho conditions you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nAbsolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics beyond science fiction I had no idea there was actual science controlled study that hadn't been done\nOn these topics and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think is the best evidence that exist today\nNow let's talk about till after the what did you uncover here and let's find out your explanation my aunt a guy who was a psychiatrist at the time devoted her entire career to investigating telepathy and uh she ... she came out with some astounding things but what did you find\nIt yeah I thought that the the very important phenomenon it's it's mind my communication and just taking a quick step back\nThe reason that I them each of these phenomenon is that I read them that the material is perspective that consciousness comes from and his localized to the brain that perspective cannot account for things like ... the and the other things will talk about and I read it in that any of these phenomena are real the material is perspective is not work well whereas\nA consciousness centric picture does work\nSo well apathy to me the most compelling evidence is a a procedure known\nAs the guns cell experiments and the basic design is as follows and I should say that these studies have been done over many decades by many different experimenter and when you combine the result the statistics are very compelling mhm doctor dean rating\nWho just wrote a book called real magic he has a section in his book called ...\nThe statistics are very compelling mhm and Dr dean rating who just wrote a book called real magic he has a section in his book called six sigma six sigma refers to statistical odds against chance when you get a six sigma result the odds of it that the effect is just happening by chance is more than a billion to one\nAnd in telepathy we have six sigma results so the ... experiment the study has one person in a room we'll call him Bob and very you know very relaxing state listening to relaxing music\nThere's another person let's call her Jane who's in another room Jane has given a picture by the experiment there's\nAn experimenter say Jane I Know this sounds crazy but I Want you to mentally send a picture of this thing that you're looking at to Bob while he's in the other room so jaded mentally sending this image to Bob Bob is then at the end shown for pictures he doesn't know what picture game was looking at\nWe would predict if there were no effect at all at Bob would guess correctly one out of four times twenty five percent right\nNow I'm going to be the ... the law of probability would tell you that\nRight especially over many decades and different experimenter as we would expect that we would approach twenty five percent with more and more trials but instead it's closer to thirty two percent so from a statistical standpoint even though it sounds like a small effect is twenty five or six thirty two\nThis is massive statistically it suggests that something is getting through\nAnd it actually conforms to our common sense our everyday experience because if we were one hundred percent ... then we would know each other's thoughts all the time you're instead it's actually more subtle where you think of somebody and then they tax you or they call you\nAnd that might be what we're seeing here with thirty two versus twenty five percent that it's a subtle effect that everyday people experienced\nWhat could increase ... percent mark is at the center or the receiver\n[noise] this is something that that needs to be explored much more ah but what we see with people who tend to be more psychic for example people that had been a has had been involved in the U.S government studies which we can talk about later they tend to go into a trance like state and\nPeople who are better meditate hers seemed to have enhanced psychic abilities that seems to be an emerging signing\nI'm always wonder though if somebody is really tuned into certain things if they can pick up all kinds of different events\nWithout really having the sender having much to do with it I I I think that's a receiver might have a better effect in changing the outcome\nI think that's probably true people that tend to have heightened abilities whether it's ... ethic or communications with the deceased through medium ship these are people that tend to be picking up information\nAnd if we use the analogy of the brain as being like an antenna which is not precise but it's it's helpful metaphor where there's a consciousness that's not localized to the body those who are able to better configure their antenna so to speak are better able to pick up signals whether it's from a particular standard or from something else\nNow what would have happened had you gone to the receiver the person in the room and simply not show them any of them for pictures but they just had to tell you what they think she said to them what do you think would happen\nWell well I think we'd have a distribution first of all we had just an everyday person versus a talented psychic if we had a talented psychic than we'd probably get some some pretty strong cats and that's what we saw at the U.S government uh but if it's an everyday person I think it would be a different more difficult study to examine because the effect is so small\nWell let's talk about the U.S government's\nIf it's an everyday person I think it would be it the more difficult study to examine because the effect is so small\nWell let's talk about the U.S government studies in uh the things that they've conducted we know that they've been very interested in this for very long time\nYes and again this is something that was very new to me I'm the program is\nSometimes referred to as Stargate Program and they're all used psychic buys for national security purposes many of wearing a been on this show by the way\nUp during the Cold War and and the people who have more involved in it were a laser physicist at Stanford University there were many reviewers who are involved to say this was ... so there are many people talking about the fact that this was real [noise]\nI'm In my book I I have some documents from the CIA which had been declassified recently\nAnd the phenomenon that that was being studied was typically the telepathy was won by remote viewing is the primary one which is the ability to perceive something at a distance without being they're physically so it's like you could see something in your mind that far away without even being there without seeing it with your eyes\nIt sounds completely paranormal consciousness is localized to the brain\nBut if consciousness is non local then it's at least conceivable document um say explicitly and I am looking at it right now remote viewing is a real phenomenon this is from the classified documents that has been released recently [noise]\nSo I mean for someone like me who's just trying to objectively look at evidence if I thought something like that and my business world if I had a consulting case for example that's really strong evidence whether one wants to believe it or not that to me at least made me question things\nUm even further than that\nThere's a page on science channel and there are some very credible people including someone from Cal Tech\nThe next page in the document says science panel's report principle findings either direct quotes implications are revolutionary evidence to impressive to dismiss as mere coincidence\nYou know in many cases many cases we have the looked at these uh tell a path ... studies\nAnd I've always wondered if the government really never stopped doing it but continued now I've asked some of the people who've been involved in these studies that just that same question and they said no it stopped because they would have kept us on they would've used us I'm not sure what the government\nHas found other people and they've continued these kinds of mine studies\nWell certainly there were some successes reported in the program during the Cold War for example former President Jimmy Carter confirmed that remote viewers were used\nTo find a downed Russian bomber in an African jungle that they couldn't find so there was some utility to the program whether it was reliable all the time or not is another question but sometimes it was useful so you'd have to think that if if it were a useful thing to be doing that\nA organizations would be trying it\nPre cognition mark a very valuable tool for people\nIn their life because of the ability to sense things make decisions based on those gut feelings and to react to them now a lot of people don't react they don't do it it's something happens when they go oh I should have done that and I I knew what\nWhat is your view of pre cognition\n[noise] so there are some studies which show a very subtle pre cognition known as pre sentiments where the body is sensing something very subtly and we need to stick to show it before something happens and\nSentiments where the bodies sensing something very subtly and we need to stick to ... to show it before something happens and there are other examples where it's much more explicit where a person has a dream known as a ... dream the dream something and then the next day it happened exactly as they dreamed it that much less subtle\nYou just Google ... down to a contest between song we aggressively oppose public I think government\nSingle payer

living more it's a supernatural\n\nThe way I view consciousness is that it's like max clump he said I regard consciousness as fundamental I regard matter as to rebut if\nFrom consciousness meaning that consciousness is the basic underpinning of reality and quantum mechanics and other things point to that but I Do everything that we experience as being a basically a modulation that is happening within consciousness\nHow has this new knowledge for you more changed your life\nIt's changed it massively [laughter] so I alluded to this earlier that the material is perspective that I subscribe to a leads to a very bleak outlook on life once your brain doctors over\nI mean I understood the implications of that and I think that's what our education system is teaching\nUm now I think that that consciousness does not die when the body dies because it's the consciousness isn't dependent on the body so I see much more uh meaning in life there's another phenomenon that I think is really really important and I I think I Wish that had been taught me a long time ago\nBut going back to the near death experiences what people often report is known as a life review where they experience their whole life in a flash and again this is one their brain as either offer highly impaired\nAnd they're judging themselves for how they acted during their life\nBut this is the kicker that really I think about this every day is that some people report experiencing the life review through the eyes of those they affected so let's say Bob harmed chain in his life and Bob is having a life review he might experience the pain through chains eyes and he comes back\nTo his life forever changed carrying much more about\nUh how we treat people rather than material goods so it when we talked about meeting in life the life review as a potential lens if we take that as a literal phenomenon about you know the purpose here is really to treat one another well\nDo you think in our life that we were given this

just simply not harness in modern society because these ideas are considered anomalous and totally paranormal\nAnd this is one of the reasons I wanted to write the book itself so compelled to do it is that an understanding human potential and these abilities that we have could revolutionize I think the world but also our science in our medicine if we understood how to incorporate them into what we

...\nUh I guess association with nationality is there any research or anything where there's a culture or a nationality that is more in tune to remote viewing\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there were there were great remote viewers all over the planted a but it doesn't skew anything specifically\n\nI Would say that consistent with what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic isn't being researched widely enough to understand if there are certain trend there are certain brain

George ah may God Bless you and your show continue blessing you thanks wonderful really wonderful\nAnd my uh my question is do you ever got tons of colors or their reincarnation as a result of consciousness living outside the body in each of us and the so AKA consciousness moves on\nTo affect another human being good or evil out is free will play a part in for a fact consciousness and I'll take my reply on the right\nTo free will have anything to do with it mark\nThis is a very tricky question I think the question of free will get ultimately boils down to who is the agents that we're speaking out that has the free well um are we talking about the ... body having free well are we talking about the the consciousness itself\nAnd if we think of consciousness as being like the stream of water than all there is is consciousness\nSo at the level of the fundamental consciousness it would appear that there is a infant it pretty well but at the level of perhaps ... an individual that is considering it felt to be separated from that consciousness\nOr at least appearing that way then perhaps the free world does not exist at the same level that I make that\nYeah it does in ... on a very difficult subject\nIt's very difficult and I think there are some of the concept that we're talking about night I think are beyond what our linear human mind can't conceptualize sort of like insanity we all know infinity exist so can we really understand what it means I think there are certain concepts that our brains just limit us from understanding fully\nLet me think somebody like Jesus understood the ability of consciousness and how to how to deal with is how to use it a Andy Andy used it\nI I think there were probably people throughout history um who really understood the nature of reality and I don't know the details of how Jesus might've interplay with consciousness but from the fifth and pieces I I've heard it's possible that he was one of these individuals who really understood\nHow things work and it seems that when one understands reality perhaps we can do things that seem totally paranormal but again they're not paranormal under this alternative framework\nWe have a guest his name's Joe ... a gallon burger and he's a he's a professor and he is conducted experiments in Las Vegas one of his books is called liquid luck he has concluded beyond a shadow of the doubt that the ability of the mind and attitude\nWill determine whether you win or lose in his study is in Las Vegas where he's tested and in any citizen candy so if somebody goes in the Las Vegas\nOffbeat positive uh there's a high likelihood they're going to win\nBut if they go in we're going to lose this isn't going to happen they're going to lose and and he said the results are on candy I think that's all tied together like consciousness it's all part of the same don't you\nI'm not familiar with those exact studies but I'm very open to the idea for the reason that you just state that have consciousness is the basis of reality where everything is just the stream of consciousness\nThen the reality we're in is almost malleable and sometimes it's very subtle where you have a random number generator that's behaving slightly non randomly in other cases we have reports like he talked about a metal being that using the mind so who's to say that outcomes which is just a part of the physical reality\nCould also be affected by the way our consciousness is acting\nEast of the Rockies Beaumont, Texas we go James waiting for a cello James a\nIn fact it by the way our consciousness is acting\nEast of the Rockies Beaumont, Texas we go James waiting for a cello James\n... Ah yes real quickly before a make my favorite I like the a speck of this to disagree with a set age is a bill about the effects of a drug this Bush in the fall in the mind or you know it's an indicator\nThat consciousness is a product of the mine ... I'm a you know as you the person speaking into a tape recorder as an example um you know if that example would be a consciousness\nAnd ah the play back of the tape recorder a you know the type it rankles clinical do something\nWill end up playing it just started a voice or you know distortions that would be an example of the drug mine you know it's not the consciousness but that's the fact of the apparatus that's I'm bringing about a distortion\nCope with consciousness put in it so it's not coming out in this to clarity that's you know of the wholesome of consciousness that went into it\nUh but anyway uh uh I think the prime example of a a spirit\nLiving outside of the body is that the self when you have a Gulf hunting so\nYou have a the example of active consciousness uh this this thing outside of the by that\nUm you know a little ever paid have knowledge of events that you know maybe it shouldn't uh otherwise a tele could nieces and everything else I think that's the prime example of consciousness uh outside the body right there\nWhen you think of that mark\nWell there are studies using on mediums people who can communicate with the deceased is related to what James was just describing and they're actually controlled studies that have been done at the wind bridge Research Center\nAnd these studies are use five levels of blinding where the media and the person who allegedly can communicate with the deceased\nIs speaking on the phone to the researcher and all that person knows is the first name of the dead person and they're able to bring in non chant information American to peer reviewed journal studies on this ... nothing mediums are able to obtain information we need more research on it but that's an example of\nSomeone who appears to be deceased and a living person getting information about someone who is deceased\nWhat do you think in some mediums do you think are some of them are very effective\nUh you hear anything important point I think there's a tendency [noise] um I think in the mainstream to say that there are frauds out there that are claimed to be mediums and maybe there are some fraud I think there are some people that have real abilities and the ...
