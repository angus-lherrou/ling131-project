Thomas\nAt the controls they are falls is our producer Rashid what's at all about the human and games where you're playing an opponent that is that you know you knew all week you were going to be you knew so what's at all about today\nYou come out and when you come out you make a statement as\nI said this last week you finish\nOff the game against Texas Tech and it feels like a loss to leave the sour taste in your mouth because you know you could have done better than uh than what you showed in that second half so uh it is what it is you have Kansas come into play or you know you should roll all over the same you come out federal through the metal don't stop first a fourth quarter you roll on I'm\nSteve done lab as a coach you've had this situation before where you come off a game where in the second half you took the foot off the gas or Dana supposedly in the coaches grilled him this week uh what what do you think it was like this week with them out in the years and how that translates into how they performed today\nWell from a coaching standpoint copies of the fact is we used to go to trap game because you could get your kids' attention they they weren't ready to play sometimes and really it's all about preparation focus in the intensity needs to be during the week when you prepare for an opponent so you have a big game coming it's usually not a big deal\nBut when you play a a so called inferior team and you have to prepare during the week you you really need to get their attention probably the best thing that happened or often so they didn't play well second really so they got something to prove now\nWhat what happened is that when you watch the film and you see the personnel for Kansas and except for a couple that we're going to talk about your players or that they know that they can be that guy on the other side then is it even harder to get their attention\nLike in your they totally wrong about that yeah the the whole song about ironic was wrong because not digress isn't that ironic I'm a you\nKnow I I don't know I mean we're trying to find ways to make this interesting\nUh interested on what I mean from it from a standpoint\nOf competitive it's very interesting or standpoint of West Virginia\nIs on that trajectory of trying to remain really I think\nA calm in a league team uh they look pretty good through three weeks looked really good I guess three and a half weeks a that second half attacks attack has gone on them until they put together some good tape and good execution and and and start doing things right again so you know I don't know how much bearing that have on this week but certainly\nI think they were challenged all we can practice to handle their business the right way to play the standard not to just simply say hey it to get the W. everything's okay and when I spoke with pro route and this week that was the main thing he stressed about\nWhat he took from Clinton versus what exists here and it's like no one had a side with the last two quarters that they put together a lot that can it typically that found that a good team let's see if they follow through and and got his dot correct\nThat's a great point play to a standard you want to win of course I mean the goal was to when you play to a standard and if you're not performing to a standard then you've got issues you got issues and then a whole ... this week he still thinks they are the issues in the season's going by quickly especially without the into thinking so are there still have things after improve upon the run game the wrong game right\nYeah yeah um\nYou know I think when Ron Kirk with here they were definitely power Ron oriented for a couple of years they brought in Joe with climate with the goal of getting a better pocket and that and that are packed protection I think they've achieved that I think I've often sacrificed a little bit as far as\nPutting your hand the dirt knocking guys off the ball and and I'm not sure those things have to be mutually exclusive but typically\nLines are better a little bit better at one than the other and I think right now you're saying I think that's pretty adept at ... protection but\nBut maybe needs to get from that and that his back and forth knocking people off the\nBall and I wouldn't say where metro new sports at the stadium age you do me a favor chick find raised her in a race everything you've written on the press box window a representing Beautiful Mind it was a great coincidence but we've established as meaningless let's move on thanks to you will talk to your shortly Brett how a West Virginia will likely start five and oh what's it all mean\nWell this was interesting just take what Alan was saying right there and some of the stuff we talk about you can tell West Virginia is having a big year by the conversations we're having we're not having big picture conversations yet we're down in the weeds in West Virginia put four corners together 'cause they only did three and a half last week can they run the football\nThis isn't big questions about where this team is these things don't come along very often I mean you're in some historic areas right now with WVU listen to the ... the last sixty two seasons only nine times as West Virginia started five and no or better that just Fifteen Percent of the time\nOver the last sixty two seasons just\nJust eight percent of the time they've started seven in ... and again I expect this team to not only win today you go on the road when the names next week and then you beat Baylor and you're following game I think\nThis is a seven and start team you've only seen that eight percent of the time over the last sixty two seasons of West Virginia in an area where it can do something pretty special that you don't see everyday\nThat what you're saying is that the ticket at eight percent I haven't done I haven't done a Beautiful Mind thing on that but that means about once every twelve years yeah\nSo how about that I mean there's a West Virginia is in an area where it's got a team that can compete and the schedule has set up really nicely but we've been talking all along about has West Virginia been tested we know November's going to get difficult so they need to take advantage of these games that they should win and by doing so they start seven to notice you're I'm going to\nTalk about not right now but we're I'm going to talk about what's after that because I think they will be seven in ... but then what and that's that's going to be a whole different equation if you will and that's going to ... what happens then and again we'll get to this will have a big determination of the value of the first step in Boulder dominant yeah there's no question\nAbout that I mean if you go in and ... went up to to Texas it turns the whole thing around but you can't get to taxes being ultra important in less you've taken care of business in through four weeks one month disease in West Virginia is done just\nLaugh in the back of your most Bible bank visit their website and the banking dot com member FDIC colleagues\nAlright wild west Virginia is playing Kansas today pretty big game and the big twelve going on at the same number nine seen sexist against number seven Oklahoma I ask how good is Oklahoma this is the first rank proponent for them this year ... well\n... if you don't quite know about Texas I mean clearly they started off terrible then they improved then they went to Kansas State and they got Snyder cats I mean they won but there was a backdoor cover\nBarely they only scored swelled all thanks to points I think this is a barometer for both teams to excess when you start to take a little noted if Oklahoma Greece's them All right maybe Oklahoma's for a look how I think you're right I don't know homeless put up big numbers against bad teams if you want to use that as a criticism against West Virginia\nUse it as a criticism against Oklahoma's well today we start to learn a little more about those are those the Oklahoma favored by I think six six or seven seven hand look at it on our\nHere is the Texas coach Tom Herman on the Oklahoma quarterback Tyler Murray they go way back\nI actually thought he was phenomenal player phenomenal in terms of the combination of speed and explosives in his running the football and such a beautiful quick release was you know strong on my son's velocity ...\nAnother question okay here's another Texas guy right from Allen, Texas Tyler Marie how did the longhorns not get this ... another great quarterback from Texas not playing for the long war went to a and M. first and the transfer\nAnnounced ahead Oklahoma but you're right palace another in the long list of great Texas quarterbacks that are not at UT and what's the what's the harm is that you're able to solve your head unbelievable twenty two when one\nAgainst the spread as an offensive coordinate or head coach\nSo twenty three times Herman teams have been an underdog as when he's been an offensive coordinators had coached he is twenty two in one in those against the spread so those aren't old outright win a write in a closed in a close spread watch out for ... unbelievable guys Texas\nPlays above itself into skiing yes every year absolutely so we'll see what happens today at noon taxes for the Houma from the ... part of the Texas state fair also later on today the big twelve conference number twenty five Oklahoma\nStay home again to Iowa State my ... he was in the news this probably we need to do this what do you have a couple of minutes but later on believable when he got destroyed this week I mean you really only get really paid a price at least nationally\nFor some just quickly thirty seconds on what he did well well it it's going to take more than that we need All right Larry he basically\nWhen jailing McCluskey transferred out\nHe's sent one of his media relations people to the media saying if anyone asks any Oklahoma State players about\nJailing McCluskey leaving access will be denied to the players by the media for the rest of the year\nThat is that's worse than what it it's it's absurd it's ... it's um\nThat then we're inside the beltway we had a better way of West Virginia so but from a national perspective or what what what if any bugs is there about West Virginia will be here today\nYeah none I go out there to carry your business um I think people only pay attention to this game if if Kansas goes out and and kind of makes the game of it but you know if you if you go out and you play like you did in the first half against taxes tax where you're at thirty five to ten\nA Texas accent the firepower to come back Kansas does not and uh they they want a couple of games early in the year because of turnovers I think if you go out you play clean\nOr not turned up all over ... had a couple of interceptions against taxes tack if you go out and clean that up I don't think it's much of anything today but that's okay you don't you don't need the writing right to to progress\nYou you you go out you take care of business you get you get three or four wheel real highlights and then the discussion is about West Virginia versus whoever wins the Texas ...\nRight and that's what you're saying he did hold serve today you're spot in line is reserved with a normal will\nEither way you cannot make tennis references because you hate tennis so you can never I've told you could never do that again okay been comfortable studio sports dot com thank you been Rashid Marshall give me a ... what are you watching\nOil actually been to the last comment leads exactly into what I was going to talk about enough for West Virginia to be elite uh you you had a slow game and we touched on this already against Texas Tech a you know that the second half was just a little bit for\nA for a lot of players and coaches liking so odd numbered Sunni offensively defensively and special teams to come out and be elite\nYour quarterback is getting a ton of national attention bring the difference with you bring a special things with you about West Virginia it's not about Kansas come out I hate to use it a cliche leave no doubt I mean there's nothing left on the table for West Virginia to prove against Kansas come out\nShow it get a big return on special teams possibly a touchdown\nAnd uh you show people that you were true and and you're very solid competitor\nIf you are sluggish today guys that is going to cause a from a national perspective and not known in West Virginia of course it follows every\nMatt buddy from a natural for prospective bread of people who watch closely there has to wait a minute now they're slow secondhand one very good numbers sluggish today I mean that's going to cause\nWell into the and that's why what Ben said is right and if you come out in the first half of your sluggish part is in the second again I don't think nationally to do at all because\nInterestingly last week if you watch any of the national programming on Saturday Night there wasn't a single discussion of West Virginia's ... and the second half it was all about ... numbers in West Virginia dominated looked so that most of these voters remember they're watching\nA lot of teams on the day they're going to tune in early 'cause it's noon you watched the first half and then they're moving away so if you're if you're going to have a better have come out start fast light 'em up early\nWell my my thought is is how is a Kansas deep it's going to play\nVersus will ruin in West Virginia off since uh Kansas said I'm going to play off safeties and we'll bring him out of the box by light in the box and and if you want to run the ball go ahead and run it now you're looking at a much better defense I think the rank sixty seven in the country with no help from their office or a hundred and six\nSo you know are they have really good safety both just saves user beginners or aggressive they play what we call quarters coverage which basically puts corners on islands\nA one on one which is in my mind that's a witness they're not very good at corner mhm but there are two line backers or to safety is their core inside are really really good players in in\nA you know are you going to play high you know they're not big with its team but are you going to play hard and you know and everybody seems to be going to an odd front now they are cutting out five teams are playing odd front you know three down which is unusual would back in the day everybody played a poor\nMan what are they getting are they getting they've had eight picks are they getting those because of the way they play defense and the aggressiveness of some of the ... and her numbers\nYou know there have fourteen in in ... the first two games in central Michigan Nichols states so that that's a that's a Bush and really matter\nOkay gotcha alright west Virginian games is what you have a lot more to go are you mad about the whole serves no no that's fine\nOr if you're not going to use it anymore you know me I'm like I'm Still actualize you can attack me and criticize me out of here Niceville

out because Brad makes a great point I think that\nThat to West Virginia the hearing all about him all we can give you got the defense fired up and they belong I mean he we were with anymore like he did last week on the big right now so we'll have to I think you'll be under one twenty five I'm Out\nAll right and I'm going to be in on this book rush for nearly a hundred yards against Oklahoma State last week including a sixty yard dash to\nThe house for six he also caught six passes for sixty more yards he should get plenty of such as in this game in West Virginia race is too big leader early as they should Kansas may try to shorten the game by keeping it on the ground and keep the handing it to ...\nI'm In All right let's move on to topic number two instruments up when West Virginia is putting up lots of points the mountaineers marching band gets quite a workout banging up the fight song after every touched down\nBut I'm not so funny thing happened to the west Virginia a fenced in when the Texas Tech last week after putting up five touchdowns nearly four hundred totally yards in the first to have a little bit about dropping buttered in the second half and produce no points it at all this week West Virginia's coaches have been saying all the right things about being more consistent and playing hard for all four quarters\nAnd we're about to find out if the players a got the message copy in or out west Virginia scores at least one touched down in each of all four quarters today\nAre just as you said Dave the pressure's been there from the coaches to finish the game and that finish the game means for quarters icy points as he touched every quarter as the west Virginia fifty plus I'm In on this All right\nBrad step in and take a crack at this one in or out west Virginia scores at least one touched down in each of all four quarters today\nYeah copies right that's been the message all week I think this is a chance to get your numbers boost those Heisman stats boost bulletin a cop awards that's I think West Virginia not only roles in this one I think it's spread throughout the game I think they do scored a touchdown in each quarter count me in\nOrange jumpsuits aren't in or out west Virginia gets a CD and each of all four quarters today\nDemand their mascot and the cheerleaders\nOr will be worn out with pushups recalls so yes I'm In Maryland I'm\nOut I'll go the other way the only game in which that was a Kurd so far this season was against the U.S Youngstown State could have happened to shore but I go to ride with the odds on this one\nI'm Out finally protect the football for all of the grumbling this week about West Virginia's all kinds of blame out in the second half last week one thing that's been mostly left on the cutting room floor West Virginia had no turnover is no bubbles no interceptions Kansas\nIs hoping will ruin companies will be a little more generous today they still lead the nation in a turnover marginal plus swelled the J hawks are always looking for drips into pick things off safety Bryce torn\nDan has two former recovery and eight different Jay hawk interceptions in or out west Virginia has three or more turnovers against Kansas state's defense today that produces six don't turnovers at each other when at Central Michigan and against Rutgers\nWhat do you copy enter ours\nIs the question that West Virginia's three turnovers is that it yes three or more I'm Alice\nAnd that yes they are blood and well the Kansas is plus will ensure numbers but as you said something that's misleading because of a central Michigan and Rutgers so they're turnover numbers look good but I'm going out I don't think West Virginia terms of all over three times on Saturday\nAll right Brad in or out west Virginia has three or more turnovers today\nYeah I get this could be a game where you get antsy and wants them stats if your will gr because I think everything is there for the taking from a WB standpoint you know I said they do not have three or more turnovers ... give me an out\nAll right Jeff Jenkins ... how about it in or out west Virginia has three more turnovers today\nNow I'm Out on that because if you have more than three turnovers you're not going to score and every quarter and get more than three turnovers spooky is going to have more than one twenty five total messes up everything else I've said so I [laughter]\nGuys I'm also out in my mind [noise] Kansas is still Kansas until they beat a good team Kansas has forced a lot of turnovers but ... generator just one take away in the last Oklahoma State last week and for an audience of unit that tends to be passed first ask\nQuestions later West Virginia has been doing a relatively good job of a boarding turnovers Kansas might force one perhaps too but the three is a bridge too far I'm Out and that so you play around\nMaybe by humans Bible bank visit their website and be backing dot com member F.
