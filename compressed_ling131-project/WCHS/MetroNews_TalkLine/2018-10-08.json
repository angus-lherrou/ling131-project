supplemental FBI file I plan to vote to confirm judge Kavanaugh than you did over the weekend does your support ever at any time waiver\nWell I mean I think when the um on the bombshell a allegations came out I I think you know I think everybody took a step back I mean I certainly did take a step back and say let's find out what this is all about which is\nWhy I was in favor of having her a common present a her testimony and then you know certainly investigated but after looking at the FBI investigation and reading all the papers and the documentation that was just no cooperation\nTo tobacco or very powerful story up and so I felt that uh my support for judge Kavanaugh with well placed\n[noise] do you believe that a doctor bossy Ford was telling the truth\nI Believe that she had a she has had a sexual assault in her life yes\nI Do believe that I mean she was painful to watch uh but I think that when she named her best friend at the time and other people that were in the room or in the in the house that could not cooperate it and she had holes in her story I think\nThat uh she has had a a a mixed ... reminisce of of\nWho it was and I think that Brett Kavanaugh was not the one that perpetrated the sexual assault that I Believe\nHappened to her or at some point in her a early life\nBut she said and obviously you uh were moved by her testimony but she said when asked or use certain it was read cab and all that a soldier your jumps result you she said one hundred percent she has no doubt she has no doubt it was more than just a\nHundred percent sure that it wasn't him and so it turns to the he said she said which then became they said and that they are the people that she named that were that would have first hand experience to be able to corroborate her story and they could not and they were repeatedly asked\nThey under a penalty of perjury they went in for ... FBI and I'm a ... in interrogations or you know questioning and their stories did not change\nUs under showing more cow but it was with this did you see anything and the FBI report the supplemental reports that added any additional insight to what happened or didn't didn't happen\nNot really no I didn't uh they investigated the uh the a bloody Ford and that investigated Vermeer as the other accuser and everything was patted down very it was very in depth a very um\nExplicit and a lot of things in that report which is why I oppose having it made public or private to the people that were actually talking when you go in for something like that and they assure you that this will not be made public\nI'm Sorry but we need to keep that a private and and not to hide anything but to protect their privacy\nAnd also the validity of the FBI being able to question under a a under these circumstances\nWhy do you believe it was a thorough investigation and when it was done in a matter of a week they talked eleven or twelve people and did not talk to Dr a doctor bossy flight\nI think that's pretty explicit in the testimony a doctor\nFord and Brett Kavanaugh had hours of testimony Brett Kavanaugh hours and hours of testimony and then uh back at the committee not in public but ah by the committee investigators are I think their stories were a well told I think that\nA doctor Ford was a asked to if she wanted to bring forward any additional information\nShe declined and uh and so I think what they did was then look at who ... who was implicated who would know not secondhand or\n\nToday's program is presented in part by Milan were delivering better health for better West Virginia is no job it is our mission\nComing up and it's got a limited to deal with the president of West Virginia Education Association his take on the governor's proposal for another five percent pay raise for school teachers public employees school staff and also to put one hundred million dollars into PE I texted me at three or four words out three or four\nSex topic of the reports the supplemental report from the FBI was a sham says the texture from Orangeburg for\nA reason you exactly questions Republicans claim presumption of innocence with vinegar Kevin all but see a black teenager should have acted differently around the police and yes the Republicans certainly invited this was Merrick Garland I'm not a big fan of the Democratic party but the Republican Party is the definition of hypocrisy the\n[noise] I I wrote a piece last week that I think that we are just it felt and I talked about this it really felt like a divorce it felt like a divorce where neither side is going to let the other side get away with anything\nYou don't want a divorce you argue over the uh the flat where you don't really care about the flat where would you not go at the other person to get a gift to take it out it was more at stake them and this and the flat where but you get my drift of what this was about but it it I I don't know when it started this this absolute\nA mutually assured destruction tone in Washington but it exists it exists on big issues and Kevin who was talking about things they agree on yeah there's some things they agree on but when it comes to some of these big issues the issues that are going to determine the election [noise]\n[noise] like health care or a Merrick Garland or tax cuts those kinds of things when it comes to those things it's it's there and you can't get a consensus it's impossible because then it's about which side can win and about maintaining or um\nOr coalescing power\nAnd clearly the Merrick Garland a deal that Republicans do which was the wrong thing to do that's not how it's supposed to work\nNow in today's environment that's how it does work but that was the wrong thing to do with capital supported Merrick Garland it in and do the Republicans toe the line on that said listen we got an election coming up you've got to wait till after the election uh but you know if nothing had happened if they went ahead and approve Merrick Garland\nAppointed by Obama a then Trump would have still got another appointment and it would have been it is you know ... Gorsuch anyway\nUh so Gorsuch would be the guy that ah that would be on the court now\nSo it's kind of it really would have worked out [noise] sex topics showing more capital\nI salute you on your presumption of innocence stance I look forward to your co sponsorship with singer Susan Collins outlawing cash bail throughout the country\nPacked stopping and this gets back to the conversation that was recorded by the courts official and when she was called into a meet with justice law free ... is it illegal in West Virginia to record your phone conversation I thought it I thought we were a one party state\nThe well first it wasn't it was a phone conversation was actual meeting a where the individuals called in to meet with law free in a couple of the people in there the court administrator or a couple of lawyers which is pretty intimidating but I West Virginia might be a one party state\nAnd by that I mean it it varies from state to state in some states for a conversation to be recorded you need to have the consent of both parties\nIn some states and I should know this and probably somebody listening will know like somebody to West Virginia broadcasters and one of my attorney friend West Virginia might be a one party consent state meaning that if I go into a meeting with you\nAnd I'm recording and I've given consent obviously because I'm recording and you don't know it it would be legal if you're a one party consent state and I think we are but I'm not positive about that\nSo I put out a whole let me give you a couple of poll numbers these are anecdotal poles but it's back to the whole Kevin audio and we haven't talked about mansion on this yet\nAt well we talked about a friday but then of course he voted for a confirmation\nThe poll from last week this was before the cloture vote veterans ... production time how will send your mansion vote on the Capitol nomination\nOh Seventy two percent yet Seventy two percent said yes and twenty eight percent said no so you were right that was what six hundred fifty eight responses so you are right in predicting how mansion would vote and\nUh well we'll get to look at the teacher pay raise proposal um in a minute and give you the poll numbers on that now I did some checking on is because some of you were asking\nAnd mansion it's my understanding did wait to vote\nUntil after Collins and flake and Murkowski\nSo once Collins and ... and Murkowski voted then it was evident that\nThe culture would have fifty votes\nSo Manchin was not the deciding vote and again pins could have come in and voted if it's been a fifty fifty tie a if mansion voted the other way so my understanding is that mansion did wait\nUntil those three had voted so that was evident that they're not the\nCloture was that they were going to vote to um pick that the coach of what was going to pass and then cast his vote for that now he's going to get some criticism about that\nAnd that is fuel for his opponents as well matching the classic mansion he's he's just fence sitting here and he's just waiting and he's just doing the political thing cetera et cetera and and those are those can be valid criticism that's something that Morsi can work with but\nBut some of that is a little more nuanced and it takes a it's a little bit harder to explain mansion has an easier time explaining and now I voted for capital\nIn a state in a state that is largely a red state in a state that supports Donald Trump in his state that wanted their senators who support cabin all he can say I voted for capital\nSo yes\nMarcy can say well a classic Joe and uh he waited for the last minute you can't count on and you can say those things and that'll that'll help\nSome but what's the bottom line voted for Kevin ... what do you say and if\nAnd if he's criticized for waiting for the last minute\nI was doing my due diligence I'm not I'm not defending that position I'm telling you how this plays out politically were to take a break and

forty four\nLive from downtown Charleston\nSomebody bought and everybody wanted so every ... every\nEverybody body and but it wasn't so much if they bought in as everybody became committed to the Lindsey learner everybody became committed to recognizing they have a role in a life of the children in this community\nWhat would your results of you what results have you seen in terms of attendance discipline a scores grade or do you give grades\nYeah so we so we get grades but they're they're um actually it's it's on a on a zero before rubric I'm as it goes to a throughout grading but and they can talk about that a little bit differently but we have had some tremendous results um our graduation rate has gone from sixty seven percent graduating four years to Ninety\nFour percent graduating we've had um our attendance essentially is um depending on which learning community you're referring to our schools are called learning communities um it's somewhere between Ninety six at the lowest in Ninety eight at the highest last\nMay um the the last month of school essentially here in ...\nUm we had in Ninety nine percent attendance rates district wide so at the end of the year when many learners are not coming to school they're burned out Lindsay learners um actually came to school um at greater levels and everybody\nHow did you do that I mean how did you do we got we got a huge attendance issue in West Virginia I mean just a ... unbelievable how did you accomplish that\nSo we went because because when you make the learning about the learner\nWhen you put the learner at the center when um when the learner becomes invested in their own future\nAnd the adults in the system believe in them and the adults in the system actually meet them at their level and give them what they need academically and personally than the school becomes a place at the Lerner wants to go to um we have part of our vision statement and this is that it's we're realizing it at this point\nBut division that we created it stated that I'm Lindsay learners come to school every day\nThey're mad at their developmental learning level they are challenged they are successful and they leave school wanting to return tomorrow\nAnd that's what we're experiencing is learners recognize that school is a place that is I'm essentially for many of them it's going to be the path out of poverty and they are supported and they are successful and therefore they want to come to school\nAt your school district is you're you're you're not in the upper middle class ... mansion neighborhoods or you're not oh no\nNo we're absolutely um till every county where Lindsey is\nIs a place is actually one of the the poorest communities in the country I'm ... I'm there's thirty seven percent poverty rate 'em in\nAnd Lindsay I'm the community and um [noise] we we have an incredible challenges with regard to our demographics apparent educational level is extremely low many of our families um had been dealing with\nGenerational poverty and yet I'm In yet what's what's turned around the is the learner bagel believing in themselves because the system as late than them\nI had this um if you have time to tell a story about a about a learner who um when we were starting the system we were talking to a group of an eighth grade learners and this was back in two thousand nine and we were selling them that um when you go to high school some of you might finish in four years\nIs the traditional way but some of you might finish in three and a half and some of the you might take four and a half or five but what we're going to guarantee is we're going to guarantee you learn the content and we're going to do whatever it takes to get you to learn that ship it means more time if it means that different adult if it means different materials were not letting you out until you learn this\nVirginia I'm you're headed for United States Senate and I approved this message for my Joe mansion for West Virginia\nHello I'm Dr ...

I Want to stop the flow of drugs that come across a you know but I'm going to tell you it's easy to get through while I mean I'm a I'm a combat engineer I can defeat any wall with a shovel or a ladder\nA I think that we do we need to have a twenty four billion\nDollar well maybe not when we have real issues I mean if we're gonna talk about why ... why do we talk about land the walls\nThat were built in the forties with the fifth year life expectancy I mean think about West Virginia and the areas I was in a Mason county when Clinton was the other day that area surrounded by it led the wall a Williamson Huntington places like that those walls are set over Seventy years old now\nAnd you know those walls are starting to show signs of wear and tear and they need to be looked at what we're going to focus on walls how about we focus on walls is going to keep water out of people's living rooms\nRicher judges with this candidate for Congress in the search congressional district a Democrats you've also talked a lot about the opioid the drug issue uh in southern West Virginia our poll found Richard that fifty seven percent of those\nLikely voters know somebody arrest somebody in the family who has an addiction to painkillers it as a an epidemic particularly in southern West Virginia\nIs do you have any solutions to Justin's on that\nWell first off I think fifty seven percent not accurate I think it's about a hundred percent uh you know I've got members on my team that one of my one of my folks has lost both parents to overdose another ah found his brother did do an overdose and just lost a nephew\nAnother has been living with her aunt and uncle or because of the opioid epidemic\nOr you know we have a serious problem here and nobody has the guts to stand up to big pharma you know we need real rehabilitation I Want to go to Washington DC and fight to bring the funding down here to ah established rehabilitation we had Seventy five bad\nTo address that issue in southern West Virginia and the third district\nThat's unacceptable but what's really unacceptable is that my opponent my opponent owns stock in the past and\nYou know one of the major major companies that through those oxycontin hydrocodone on our people like candy and this is a person that's going to now tell people I'm going to fight the opioid epidemic you mean the opioid epidemic that you have benefit from\nBecause that's what people need to you know to to to to ask themselves you know as you know she's not going to bite the hand that feeds her me on the other hand I\nI personally find it disgusting because I come from an area that has been his decimated with this problem and something has to be done and we got to stop allowing lobbyist to grease the pockets of legislators to buy their protection we've lost more people in the last two years\nThen all of the labs while during the Vietnam War\nSixty thousand two years ago when we think we're past that now this you're already\nDo you believe that uh you you were a big a backer of a medicinal marijuana medical marijuana in West Virginia do you think would you support the approval of recreational marijuana\nWill you know my focus is is on a you know the medical purposes or you know we have people you know I Want to give people a non addictive form of pain management versus artsy cotton and I'd go do we know that thousands upon thousands of people across West Virginia absolutely\nCan benefit from this you know my mother take CBD Oil and she's reduced her meds every morning by Thirteen pills and her doctor has\nSaid this is the ... so there's nothing wrong with that now in terms of recreation I mean we understand that you know there's a lot of revenue that can come from that you know West Virginia could be twice as\nAs successful as Colorado because Colorado yields one crop West Virginia you used to but I'm focused on medical purposes because that's what I Want to do I want to help people that are sick\nAnd we know that the jobs that could be created from being able to allow us to grow and create the products for medicinal purposes could create new jobs and to create revenue for West Virginia that could really go a long way to benefit our people\nRichard ... with a she's a a combat veteran he is a a democratic candidate for Congress in the surgeon rational districts use a current member of the state Senate I did see Richard that you were in that you're in the Michael Moore movie the nine eleven uh and you had a quote in there you said because Michael Moore came to southern West Virginia show them around\nAnd you told him you said you deploy you talk about the military you deploy because your nation's sends you to these places and then one day you\nCome home and you realize it was all a lie what did you mean by that\nWell I mean you know we deploy and we tell ourselves we're going over here and we're going to fight to give these people in these countries a sliver of the greatness that we have in America\nBut then when you come home and you get out of the military you realize that we've got children that go to bed every night hungry we've got elderly that are are are cutting their meds and half the elderly or raising the grandkids because mom and dad are addicted to drugs\nYou know we've got homelessness issues are infrastructure is crumbling you know we have places that have you know people in southern West Virginia ... they can't take for granted sewage and water\nBecause it's not there in a in some areas so you know really we've got elected officials that keep their hands in the cookie jar you know we've got a lot of serious issues in this country and they're not going to get fixed by ignoring them\nSo you know I'm not going to stand in the way the flag like I'm In junior high and say we're in the kittens and we're the bath\nIt's time for us to look at the problems and address them and then focus on fixing the problem and we can do if we ignore\nThe center and and you can't do them if you don't have a consensus in Washington DC there's a really good chance\nThat the Democrats will wreak take control of the house of delegates then you have a lot more power to do things that you would want to do but I Would think in order to do that you're gonna have to play ball would you support we used ... will you support or oppose Nancy Pelosi the speaker of the house\nI Would absolutely oppose Nancy Pelosi being the speaker of the house reason\nWell I think that she is what's wrong with the Democratic party you know a ... is is you just you know she's far you know she doesn't relate to regular people you know we gotta stop sending these\nPeople that cannot relate to the average citizen why is it that the only people that win elections are millionaires and billionaires they don't relate to us and the problem is there's a lot of times we all for it you know if we were it's at the how about we elect people in different areas that relate to the people in those areas\nAnd that's not what we're doing and I will tell you that you know I'm not going to I'm going up there to Washington DC to represent the people the third congressional district not to represent the interests of Nancy Pelosi or anyone else I have already said that was over forty different congressmen and Congress women and I told them I said if you got
