don't I just kinda I might be wrong\nBut that's what you have committees in the legislature for I actually think that you ought to have all kinds of views on the committees\nYeah you know ... and ...

time you have to put on those rooms you walk in there\nAnd they give you a list and you sit in this little cubicle yeah I mean it's insulting enough and it's not a Republican thing folks just both and David Jolly I think his name his name was jolly use the congressman from Florida\nAnd he got his it they wouldn't let him in the building\nAnd because he tried to call attention to it so they kicked him out of the building and now he lost his congressional seat right\nAnd they have a thing called issue one and I had a ... it's always a former congressman that wants to call attention to it a former ... because you can't do it while you're in ... that's right nobody wants it's like the ... and when the president puts it puts a special\nCommittee he always takes former Democrat Republican

I thought there I thought there would be and and if you go on in the first time I was very broad has protection but you cannot insight\nSo if you have a like if I got on here today and again\nIf I if I if I stayed ... meet me at three o'clock we're all going to go down and do this this act of violence I wouldn't be inciting I wouldn't be protected by the first amendment is on social media there is incitement is that what is is there any records of that or again because it was a lot of companies\nAnd you know yeah you know we we don't censor ideas in this country out of the first time we do censor conduct so that example you used you know let's go down in a specific time and do this specific thing to that person I don't think the court would find that to be anywhere protected speech\nIf it if it occurred but you know we allow for hyperbole in our speech you know uh I mean you know the words that we probably should never ever my mother would tell me never say this\nYou know oh I'm going to kill you well we say that sometimes in the heat of anger\nThat's not prosecute full that's just hyperbole so you know it's one of the things again we're struggling with this new media is how do we apply the old rules of conduct the old rules of taste and the old rules of law\nI'm that we've built overtime to this new medium\nYou know is a photo that cast doubt on the Holocaust inciting or is it just somebody's idea that I might find repellent repugnant but which they have a right to a spouse so we're we're you know we're struggling I think right now and that's that's where we really are is trying to develop this new set of customs and rules on what's next\nIn our society and then what is not protected legally in our society\nI mean the old example that flag burning Israel plug into the vast majority of us but it's protected speech\nRight right and you know the the old line about you can't shout fire in a crowded theater and we always say except when there's a fire yeah I mean we have set up rules around that over time this stuff is so new and so massive that it it just hits us all of a sudden that we're we're in a process of developing rules\nYou know I Would hope that as consumers of this stuff we might see this anti Semitic material on Snapchat or somewhere else and write them and say you know this is a repellent or post\nSomething opposing that view and overwhelming by numbers that one way to counter that kind of speech\n... withers veteran journalist chief operating officer of the freedom for um Institute and the U.S through the first amendment Senate let's go back now to traditional media give me or take if it's possible to simplify on what's going on between traditional media and the president\nWell you have to separate out the again the tiny little some part of one percent that covers the president that CNN and all those people and then take the rest of American journalism that do programs like here's the deal with real issues I was listening to that\nThe that where you were talking about what's coming up on the program and I was saying that journalism in America that local officials that's government that's issues that matter to me and my life\nYou know so much of the debate over the media has taken place at the thirty five thousand forty thousand foot level which is just a tiny slice of things it's important\nBut we need to remember the bulk of journalists in America do what you do it which is talk about issues that affect my daily life they're real they don't involve the president you know he's he's ... he's a master making a media a political opponent\nThat seems to work for him with with at least what twenty seven to forty percent of the of his audience a but it's not really journalism in America it's certainly not the kind of reporting that people do every single day or in the vast majority of our of our news outlets in the country\nYeah well the gene a thank you and I agree with you and that is correct but that's what dominating the discussion I mean I'm going to talk today again about we have impeachment issues in West Virginia we got a big\nA Senate race a we have a a ... amendments on the ballot that we're talking about you know all all kinds of things like that which I think are extremely relevant but ah when I watch Fox and CNN this morning I had the channel and CNN\nMostly I mean it was all about Trump that's all it was about it I'm not I'm not taking sides I'm saying that's all it was about\n... and you're right and I think that's a feeling of of journalism that we saw in the last few elections where they missed the the mail or likely predictors of the outcome because there were so consumed with the horse race in that then that little us and them issue\nThat they failed to talk about things like health care and true immigration reform and tax policy and what's going on in the ... you know I don't I I think we can do that without being boring and without losing an audience\nBut frankly I think many times than when you're talking about that national level it's the easier story\nA to get is what the Trump said today and how do I feel about it and again it's driven in some large degree by this\nSimilar phenomena to new media which is cable chat talk fest all day long and aimed at one particular side of the argument or the other that that's a way to get ratings I think it does a disservice to the country\nGene pool was ... who was with the first amendment center and the freedom form Institute a gene is always great speaking with you always valued

[noise]\n\n\n[noise] today's program presented apart by my oven we're delivering better health for better West Virginia is not our job it is\nOur mission we had on the show a yesterday Greg Thomas spokesperson for West Virginia citizens against lawsuit abuse and Greg was citing a study conducted by the German group that says because of excessive ... cause West Virginia\nOr she is the following and he said two hundred Ninety million dollars in direct cost British Seventy million dollars and you're out but\nAh eight thousand jobs that point was that that they have a research that shows that excess of all to contribute to economic headwinds in West Virginia in fairness\nThe other side from Steve knew who is president the west Virginia Association for justice of the trial bar Steve good morning how you've been good to talk to you again ... good morning hobby I've been well have you been\nI've been fine I've been fine so or Steve thank you for coming on so obviously you disagree with this assessment this research\nBy yeah is this like the two thousand five report that Greg Thomas and Kayla sided to to put us on a hill whole list for a case that was never filed\nIn West Virginia ... peeled back this onion any that Greg Thomas deciding to because you said great Thomas the punter well is that I grew up in Gilbert and I can go from zero to go into point seven seconds I'm happy to debate Greg Thomas I'm happy to have a fight\nThat man any time that he wants to have because this is nothing more than U.S Chamber and Kayla an ad trip produced propaganda to try to get legislature to buy the pagan the pope which is tort reform\nWell you know what after this election is over I might ask you guys to come on to gather my happy too I might do that anytime\nI'm happy to have this debate with Greg Thomas because he's wrong and these hell hole reports you said you thought West Virginia at one time was it held all you're wrong\n... we we never have been but the legislature for that for a period of time and there has been a lot of tort reform passed and out of it a question for you All right where you or Greg I'm it's\nOnly going to answer questions to ask you before you ask me questions let me ask you questions so would would you would you would you agree Steve that when you have extremely large judgments in cases that businesses look at that and go wow if I got hit by that I'd be put out of business philosophically speaking would you agree\nThat you think the average business would be concerned about the magnitude of of judgments in West Virginia\nNot a small West Virginia business perhaps but not these large multinational corporations one of the verdicts that you're talking about is ah the verdict against the large a nursing\nNursing home yeah what was that like Ninety million dollars or something it\nIs yeah yes and and the the reason for that was the that poor lady was the hydrated for weeks\nAnd it was systemic in that nursing home that weeks\nThat they are horribly under staffed and that verdict was sent to send a message now that was it some mom and pop nursing home down in ... or in Logan county that was a nationwide chain\nThat carries fifty or a hundred million dollars worth of insurance so no hobby a verdict like that is is not even a blip\nOn the radar screen of a national a nursing home\nDo you do you think of Iran or do you think of Iran and nurses using a vitamin a nursing home and I saw the Brigham and think oh my gosh I could you put out a bit somebody somebody could sue me and whether it's murder not going to be put out of business what\nWhat I think that you would think coffee is gee maybe I put another few CNA is on gee maybe I put it another few are ends on maybe I cut into my profits just a little bit and adequately staffed by nursing homes that's what I think ...\nMaybe I'm barely making ends meet as it is you know I mean maybe it's believed they weren't\nAnd that's the reason why the verdict was what it was his because when you look at these cases it's not that they're ... barely\nMaking ... let me ask you this is Steve Steve news with this present West Virginia association for justice why is it that when there's a lawsuit like this are you all name everybody in sight you name any body that's got to do it\nWe don't they that's common misconception they passed med mal tort reform in two thousand three we don't name every body insight now we must have screening certificates of merit against health care professionals who are alleged to violate the standard of care so the old days\nYou know the eighties and nineties have shot gunning a complaint where you name everybody who's name appears in the medical records those days are long\nSince over a but there are still inequities in that medical malpractice reform like tabs on damages a that's an affront to seventh amendment trial by jury I I don't believe there should be legislation to say that of an old person who's not employed who doesn't have wages\nAre is killed let's say by medication error nurse comes and I've had this case nurse comes in gives a shock to an elderly person it's the wrong drug\nThey pass away that that person's wrongful death case is worth only five hundred thousand dollars I don't believe that that's right now\nI live up in ... to ...\nGo ahead go when I started I mean okay let me ... ... if\n... I knew I was going to go in this direction but if if if if I'm On an ATV and I'm riding up the hill and I'm ... and I'm riding recklessly and you're on the back and I have an accident and and your your uh permanently injured are you going to you're going to sue me which you probably should or yogurt is also going to sue the maker of that to an ATV through your\nUh no no because\nI don't have any money I don't have any money I got nothing you're going to sue the age you know the guy who made the age you're going to sue the company that made the ATV aren't you\nKnow and let me tell you the reason why that that's a false equivalence hobby I represent I'm the president of an organization with five hundred trial lawyers and all corners of the state I come I review the\nNotion of the a frivolous law suits are going to cause I don't have time to prosecute frivolous lawsuits I Can't sue I don't have the time to sue Honda Kawasaki I'm a hall on a frivolous basis on a case that I'm likely never going to recover anything because\nUh the ATV is defective now let me tell you what me and my brothers and sisters do so if if I investigate that case and there is a recall on that ATV that led to the person's death if the brakes have been recalled or there's some problem with it\nI'll bring that case I won't sue merely for the sake of having a deep pocket\nSeizures with this president West Virginia association for justice\nHe's Steve let me switch gears for a second and that is how our West Virginians you know I I voted yesterday early voting to it's hard for even me who keeps up with this stuff\nTo make a call in that Supreme Court raised him people running for the two year term division one ten people running for the six year term division to her West Virginians and we're doing our best to try to have some of the candidates on the show here but how how folks supposed to decide\nA hobby I think what it boils down to if voters will do their research is this election boils down to experience and integrity I think for candidates rise\nAbove the others I think judge habit and judge Wilkes in division one I think judge Thompson and Jeff Kessler in division two that they rise above\nAll the other candidates in terms of experience this the west Virginia Supreme Court\nIs not a place for on the job training it's not a place for somebody who tried their last case Thirty years ago there have been a lot of changes in West Virginia law and the last Fifteen to Twenty years during the period of time that I've been license and experience\nMatters ... you've got three circuit judges who have experience managing their dog it's not only their pockets but I'll be in in circuits are the circuit judges the highest elected official in that circuit or they run the court house they they run a everything that goes along with that including the budget\nSo you are you all the doors for candidates of all is that just your personal opinion or as he associates association which has endorsed for candidates\nAssociation protest assess endorsed too it's my personal opinion that I think for our head and shoulders above the other six\nOkay or the association indoors\nThe association endorsed uh Jeffrey Kessler in division two and Joanna tablet and division one\nOkay and you and you through your chips in onto onto others as well\nBut well in my personal opinion I think that they are more experienced them and bring dignity and integrity to the court and goodness knows it that's certainly needed right now\nBecause the ... you know that last justice who was elected with no trial experience and no experience running a courtroom a free uh oh\nIt's you know I'm going to do just do a might drop and we'll we'll leave it there are just Steve New president West Virginia association for justice I enjoy a arguing and and I cannot argue I enjoy the debate with you too and I appreciate you coming at\nRight um it may be fifty one forty nine when it's all over I think the path to a Democratic majority\nIs I'm not impossible but it's really difficult if the Senate is not a status quo and by the way both parties and their allies will have spent one billion dollars to get there\nWell I'm Republicans will pick up at this point when I can get my credit every advantage I can only get them to take a really yeah okay\nAll right listen I appreciate the insides Jennifer Duffy who's a senior editor of the cook Political Report Jennifer I Know you're traveling travel safely and don't forget about the debate Thursday night okay thank you\nAll right good to talk to you you have Thursday night the debate I've been working on the questions and a half working on the questions and trying to ensure that they are tough but fair tough but fair will be back\nTo work Medicare for all sounds great but this new Democrat health plan is a terrible idea especially for seniors would get hit hardest even Democrat Joe mansion said he'd like to explore a government run health for everybody to just like the Medicare for all when President Trump says it will end Medicare as we know where to demolish promises made to seniors and the disabled\nProblems right don't let you do let's protect Medicare for seniors and stop a Democratic majority vote no on Joe mansion\nViolent criminals instead she allowed them to have shorter sentences violent criminals got off easy because of terrorists ... our\nFamilies can't trust terrorists on line do to keep us safe\nThankfully judge scanned Greer is tough on crime and ... in the only candidate for judges will not violent criminals get off easy judge gangrene raised his family here and we'll work to keep our family thing the choices clean\nDan ... is tough on crime ... easy on violent criminals vote for judge again greener for cannot county circuit court paid for by West Virginians for going [noise]\nRush Limbaugh all\nRight on point five eighty ...\nI think this mansion Morsi raised is going to be closer to a lot of people think [noise]\n... well a couple of reasons one is the conventional wisdom is that imagine is gonna win is going to win by you know he's up by eight or something like that\nWell a we know the conventional wisdom is frequently wrong number two or should be be is Marcy is a pretty good closer or campaign or good closer oh you did so in the primary\nUh three is where it would with those who are still undecided\nMean mansions everybody like Jennifer Duffy said everybody knows mansion so you would think that undecided would break toward more ... more than mansion because if you supported mansion you'd already support mansion\nSo if you're undecided now it seems like it would break more toward more see a mansion\nAnd for the Trump factor I mean Trump coming back just a couple of days before election day Trump is very popular in West Virginia so I I just think election night it's a it's going to be a lot closer than people think I Would take

article of impeachment against wa free sites as federal conviction\nOr it goes ... assuming passage it goes to the Senate that's really the evidence is presented in the Senate has a quote unquote trial and he is removed from office is that reasonable is that the reasonable consideration for the way forward\nI think it is I think there is no good reason that couldn't be carried out in very short order\nOkay Roger and so I was with us to house speaker so what do you do meantime on workman and on Davis\nWill that will be for the house Judiciary Committee in the house managers to take a puppet when we're back in session for ah for for purposes of considering the unfortunate situation with justice ... fully expect the house managers in the house and district committed to revisit the situation with the other members of the court who were originally subject to those articles\nWhere the house is with the house to do something like ... three ... and ... with the help change the articles of impeachment to fit what the Supreme Court said you needed to do\nWell that'd be for a vote of the house to decide I can tell you that the factual circumstances or perhaps a little different now than they were when the house originally adopted the articles which are now pending in the Senate so I think it's entirely appropriate to the house would look at\nThe facts that have developed since that time and consider whether there are additional changes to be made for example we did not we the house did not pursue articles of impeachment against former justice catch him because he had at the time resigned from the court\nNow just Davis has since resigned from the court so if the if the houses back in session for purposes of considering articles of impeachment whether the house wouldn't choose to proceed against justice Davis today is an open question because at the time we proceeded she had not resign from the court that's no longer the case\nOkay so again there's a possibility that the whole Davis thing could be dropped and or the workman thing dropped or that's up to the house Judiciary Committee in the house managers to decide\nIt's the latter hobby that'll be that'll be a question that comes back before the committee and before the managers when when the house reconvenes\nRoger ... was the was house speaker is the I guess what I'm trying to get at is it I'm trying to get in a way out here and you can't speak for the entire house obviously and maybe ... well\nI don't know I don't know how this is going to go for it it it is the legislature or that is the house is going to challenge the Supreme Court's finding this subject has been quote that you all don't have I'm ... thirty or the or the or or your charging they exceed their thought you're going to challenge with the Supreme Court said about all this\nWhile that's a that's a good question and its own right hobby so we were not a party that case right house was never made a party to that case so we we believe the the very fact that the court issued issued findings in conclusions of law with respect to the authority and actions of the house to be inappropriate and the first instance\nIf the court we are going to make that kind of a finding an issue that kind of an order and opinion certainly I think we should have been we should we should have been made a party to that case\nThe Senate's briefing in that matter was was the jurisdiction of briefing opposite right very clear that\nThat in the opinion of the Senate and for that matter that the house as well the the court ... fiction to hear that argument the first instance it's my understanding that the Senate is likely to ask the court for reconsideration of its opinion I expect we will probably seek to intervene in that that in motion ones filed\n... want to go back just real quick and makes them clear about this because there's little bit complicated so the house the house leaders of the Judiciary Committee or the managers\n... will likely start a different way forward for workman and uh for workman and I'm now offer senior moment workman\nIn Davis I'm saying that's certainly possible so once the houses back in session for purposes of considering articles of impeachment that uh that that entire issue is open again for the committee to consider okay All right Roger ... speaking West Virginia ... village Roger
