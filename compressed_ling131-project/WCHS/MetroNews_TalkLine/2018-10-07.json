be might only be all over the ridge on our Web sites\nAnd the real dislike of Jesus you ever do you tell me take off and probably that\nHigh rise Jesus can make a difference in any one part yeah but\nThink it's really hard to break into\nBy faith and process buffet because it's not something sometimes it necessarily or your information is going to make sense to but we got to believe that it is God's speaking to us\nOr the Bible tells us that all scripture is given by inspiration to the Holy Spirit all scripture is given by inspiration of the Holy Spirit so we we understanding that as we begin to receive messages you see the thing is\nUh it's it's possible to be very educated but not excited about\nWhat you've been educated about its it's possible to receive information and no revelation and you know a lot of stuff in your head but they still not\nRisen um I think we all know people that that have a lot of Bible information but very little face maybe yeah don't but I Do okay and then but then ah\nWe have also be careful but goals and I know even with me there sometimes I'll get in these mode where most of what I preach you just you know preaching and ...\nFor cleaning stuff and then sometimes I'll go through seasons where I'm doing a lot of teaching and just you know information type of stuff and the thing about it because we need vote because if everything is just preaching and proclamation than we give you revelation that excites your faith but if I don't give you information then we're still not grounded\nThat's why that's why the different give uh our our minister gets on Puerto Rico sometimes the teaching give operate sometimes a preaching get operate and it requires both because I Know a lot of people also that here a lot of good preaching and they get really excited but the\nIf we don't have information an education and we're not grounded and we'll get excited and ... will find ourselves in areas that are actually not biblical because we haven't been taught right so we've requires both and and all scripture is inspired by the Holy Spirit and I'm I'm I'm Lana\nHere are just just worked with me here real quick I'm learning about the Asian all scripture is given by inspirational Holy Spirit this is important because I Believe I mean here's what I Believe I Believe that\nFor the people have gone that when God gives you something in scripture that activate your face and you believe in and receive that it becomes your only when you when you receive it by faith does it become yours now here's the issue is is I've\nSome some stuff in in studies and some theological type of books and I literally a I understand when you are\nLet me just although there are\nOutta school principals to interpretation of scripture yard and like I knew any big words I Know a few\nA principal is when it comes to the interpretation of scripture and part of those things as you look at the contacts\nYou look at the uh the whole full scope of the scriptures it was written in not just not just one verse okay you look at context you look at the store go setting of the scripture where it was written what was the culture of the time all these type of thing you you ...\nYou look at the writers original intent what by Holy Spirit what what do we feel like the writer was trying to intend to the people at the time but also how does it apply to me I just I just gave you some quick Bible study notes right there um but but one\nThat we have to understand is is if we're not careful I've heard it taught one time\nUh because of of the historical setting who it was written to literally watch somebody take a scripture out of the New Testament that the the\nNew Testament writer said to the Jews scattered abroad and literally there was the passage of scripture that I used to stand on buffet that the\nThe parts of the teaching this class literally set up but that doesn't necessarily apply to us because he was writing to the Jews scattered abroad\nOh okay well then I guess uh the book of exodus don't apply either 'cause that was written the Moses and the Jewish people in Egypt or\nThe first and second Griffin's don't apply to me because it was written to the church a current event and so so when we start\nWhen we started doing things like that we we put ourselves in a place to where we can literally start dissecting scripture and only applying to us what we want to and we can't we can't get to play for like all well no that was whether that was technical written to the Jewish people so that's not for me now now you have to understand that all scriptures given my inspiration\nAnd we we understanding that scripture interpret scripture and that we would we begin to tie all those things together when the faith we can see the totality of scripture we can see how particular things apply\nTo us I'm Sorry I just took out through a Bible college class real quick\nY'all just pray for me but my mind is working on overdrive today and so\nHave to understand him to when we get back to re scripture shots as as a a chapter forty three and verse Eighteen we understand the historical context or when we started out we understand the people that I'll tell ya was promising to okay he was predominantly prop assigned to people and Babylonian captivity\nBut at the same time if all scripture is given by inspiration of Holy Spirit or to God breed them when I see scripture and got activates about faith for that scripture then I\nHave something that I can stand on by faith that I can say yes even though this was written thousands of years ago God's word is it breed by the Holy Spirit and spirit don't die which means this still applies to me because it was written by the Holy Spirit he just he just use man to ban it\nBut it was him saying it and when it was him saying it and he is eternal and God's word is eternal then that means when I Am here now by faith even though it was written then when I get a revelation of it and then becomes nine\nSo when we look at this passage of scripture then we have to understand that this is one of those type of scriptures and one of those passages of scripture that is very proclamation by nature which means that can only be process by faith the issue with things only being processed buffet is this the Bible tells us\nThe book of Hebrew it says the word preached was preached to everyone just the same but it says this it said that there was one group of people that it did not profit and the reason it did not profit one group of people is because it said they did not mix it with they it said everybody\nHeard the same word one group mixed in with paid the other group just heard it and was like oh that's nice but it didn't\nProfit the folks that didn't mix it with like hearing is one of those type of scriptures that you have to mix with they in order for it to bring profit to our lives so with\nFoundation being like let me get back to the text and I'll get out of here of course here the Bible\nInverse Eighteen and I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this one but he just says remember not the former things of old or consider the things I vote remember\nNot the former thing nor consider the thing of old I just I Want to touch on that real quick because obviously I Believe it's good to remember what God has done for us\nThat's when we talk a lot of testimony we remember what God has done for us and when we remember what God has done for us\nIt should bring a sprinkling to our\nFaith to cause us to be able to uh to walk on and go on because we've seen how God has moved before the problem is it's very possible to get stuck\nHas done and we miss what God is doing it's possible for us to be so enamored with what God did twenty five years ago Twenty years ago that we're still in a twenty year old member go and Don has already moved on and we're celebrating\nGod did Twenty years ago and if we started\nOurselves or what have got a well is it was it was a janitor said what have you done for me lately the I just got real carnival and yo yo pray for me I just got real carnival and yo yo pray for me\nBut it's possible to get stuck in an old season it was a good season but it's an old season it was a good time but it's an old time and it's possible for us to get stuck in that when we stay in it for too long and so he's saying don't remember the former\nThings or consider the things of old because sometimes it's possible that we get so stuck in that that we can't move forward or the the analogy that I've used in the past before is a you know when we were kids and we used to play on a monkey bars and on the monkey bars you jump on\nAnd you had to reach forward to the next wrong if I don't\nMe I'm not able to reach for the one in front of me that Ron\nEssential to get me to the next one but if\nI Can't stay on the run behind me\nI have to release it and go on to the next thing that's the way it is with God so don't remember the former things and so now we start getting into to the four points that God is saying I Will do I will make I Will calls\nAnd here is the first thing that got us here in ... Nineteen and he said because I Am doing a news thing I'm doing a new thing and he says now it will spring for very here again brings\nOf hearing aid proclamation and having a process that buffet because the Bible says and he was eleven now face is the substance of things hope for the evidence of things things here got and saying I Will do a new thing and when does he say we'll spring for now so then it takes now face to believe for a now season and the one thing\nIs as I can believe it by now even before\nI see it happening with my eyes\nI see my face operate for what I perceive okay well don't get to them and so what he's saying is he saying\nIt will watch as he said sprint fourth\nWilderness and I'll make rivers in the desert just as what God is saying to the people here through as a and I believe saying to us so here's what I wrote\nDown from this and here's here's what you gotta look God said he's a two things going to happen he said number one I'm going to make stuff grow\nSpring fourth he's at a number two I'm going to make things flow I'm gonna make stuff grow\nTo a crocodile or an alligator universities jak\nTo see I've also jacko automatically start picturing high and there's also a Madagascar\nOff the lion King I was thinking hiding as you note in those crazy thing it'd be laughing and all that I Would I was thinking high in his when he said jacko but that that's not if it's not know this a job or is not something that operates on land the Jack was\nDragging a serpent or a river monster or an alligator flash crocodile here's why this was important\nThree of these things that are jak represents or all three animals that use their mouth\nAs weapons\nThe dragon uses fire out\nThe surf and uses them\nMonster uses his mouth and strength to clamp down on the parade and do the death\nSpin\nIs he said I'm going to call the attacks of the enemy\nThat had been verbal\nLook at this he said the wild bees will honor\nMe off it OK okay so here's what just really good because this word honor\nWhat'd you go to the original Hebrew is the word ... which is also where we get the word glory from the word glory in the Hebrew language is literally it means the weight of God that which is weighing upon them so limited\nWhat God is saying is this for my people I'm going to cause the weight of Montgomery to be late on every lie of the enemy or\nEvery attack that has been verbal\nHas gone against you got that I Will put glory on it and I'm going to shut the mouth of the dragon I Will shut the mouth of the surface I Will shut the mouth of alligator here oh lord here's why and I thought on this before but scripture also uses the word the bias that for for the alligator leviathan for for the crocodile and we have to understand and that\nAnimal clamped down on its prey and begins to spin and gets it into the death spent this is the same way that the enemy still work you see because the only\nThe only way he should attack us with his mouth and even in scripture when we look at\nEnough I see it working sometimes and it makes me oh gosh what makes me mad because that that that that spirit uses it now to begin to turn\nAnd twist things out of order\nIt it takes a lie and clamped down on people and that's why people will believe lives and it will spend their life out of control that the work of the enemy but\nThat I'm going to cause glory to come into that situation and you see here's the\nRiver months for if you shut its mouth before he opens it up\nIt has no power or\nIt like just let's have you seen it both to catch them alligators I sit on them they sit on\nAnd they can close their mouth\nWith two fingers\nBecause it has no power\nIts mouth once it's been shot and then literally\nThey could just put a couple of raised the uh electrical tape around it and keep its mouth close what did they do they sit on\nOkay okay let's let's put it like this they put their weight on it and\nWeight on it they keep it from spinning and they're able to shut its mouth that the analogy that God has given to us here he said I'm going to put my weight owned alive I'm don't put my weight on them out of the enemy and I'm going to close its mouth\nIs about to get heavy on the attack of the enemy and you're like\nOn I've done I've got a I've got six minutes and Twenty one seconds right now so God said this he said I Would do and I will make our calls and then the fourth thing that he says it's this he said the response to that is you will pray\nBecause anytime God begins to do something for us the proper response to anything that God does is they give him little rate\nThe proper response to anything that God does is to give him on her and to give him the praise or the global read that as do his name but here's the interesting thing about this word praise but see because this entire scripture is prophetic\nI taught back in the summer\nEssentially seven main Hebrew words for praise and one of the ones that are really hit back then was the word hello and honestly I was hoping this was going to be the word ... but it wasn't it was it was okay which one in it and as I began to\nThis is the Hebrew word for price to look and God said not people once I Do this for you you will declare\nTo heal now here's the words that he led by definition I'm a ... through the number one it is an act of public praise\nAct of public ... I understand this dirt which I'm blessed God in our cars but also understand that it's good when we can bless God together I think that's what David said oh my lord with me I don't\nThat somebody is blessing God and we\nAnd we just sit and let them bless got no if you're blessed that God I'm blessed in God because the gods did it\nGod can do it for me to have a number one is an actor public\nI got to keep on going why do we get 'em in\nThe public ... says the second definition of it is a phrase that is laying by the qualities seeds for future of God\nFearing kingdom line fellowship church we prayed that you've been blessed with this message from senior pastor DJ Roberts\nYou can join us live it can ship church that four or five for the new south [noise] my truest Virginia to find one for three and three of four seven to one Ninety seven in the room and the women seem to mind WB\nJoined us Sunday October the fourteen and lemonade him for game day chili bass\nJoined us live with the church from [noise] be headed riverfront park six hundred and all the little parties\nCharleston West Virginia where are your favorite teams gear and bring your best part of homemade surely there will be free parking we will not have service at our nature location so be sure to join us live on land but [noise]\n\n\nI don't use yes yes I Am how do we find them from what I find that ...\nBush first Presbyterian Church Charleston located at the corner of Virginia St Louis on solving the way it is our hope and pray that you find this warship time uplifting and encouraging God Bless you\n\nThis is the day that the lord has made and we have gathered here to rejoice and to be glad in it so I welcome all of you to this worship service on this first Sunday of October two thousand Eighteen world communion Sunday this world communion was founded a out of shady\nSide Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania if you make a pilgrimage there you'll find a sanctuary a deal somewhat like this one a high dome ceiling on the front of that sanctuary as a marble chance and invested in that chancellor is about an eight ten foot a brass compass\nAnd that was placed there to commemorate that that was the founding place and the place for the inception of world community ones go worldwide communion today we celebrate with our brothers and sisters across the church in this a communion day\nAnd so we welcome you to this worship service and it's our hope and pray that as we can do worship together the living piece of Christ and living presidents of Christ that surround us and fill out and be more real to us than ever before we do ah I Want to welcome those of you visit with us we hope you feel very warmly welcomed here at first Presbyterian\nChurch into that and as we do every Sunday as the friendship pads or past across the abuse I invite you to sign your name and the information requested there so that we may make contact with you and once again as a member sign your name and as the friendship pets are past ... back across the pews please note the sitting with you and\nUh make every effort to greet each other and\nThe warmth and in the hospitality of Christ and the spirit of Christ\nIf you're interested in making your fate tangible through membership in first Presbyterian Church please indicate that on the friendship pad and there will be further opportunity to pursue that if you come to the community table here that sort of the pope and following or the benediction at the end the service and ...

found in the Old Testament section on page to listen for the word of God\nThen the lord said it is not good that man should be alone I Will make him a help her as his partner so out of the ground the
