the von in California in Novato, California Hi there John\nHi Ken welcome thank you what's going on um well a little confused\nAs we're traveling to Europe next month and my husband and I both have gone to identity theft so I'm very careful about what I Do and I was reading that I probably should have a ... an app for when I'm using public why\nAnd I'm Wondering how important is that I researched telling Larry I thought it was good his\nFat differently is any free ones out there what kind of like can you shed on me that that's\nAll right well let's start at the very basics okay is that when you're on the public why everything that you do is like traveling right through the airwaves okay\nSo if you are typing in your bank account and your password your Amazon dot com has whatever it may be\nIs that anybody can just pluck that out of the year so ... and so the whole idea behind a VPN or what's called a virtual private network\nIs that is going to use all this sophisticated encryption so it's going to scramble it all up to I was traveling in the airwaves you won't be able to just pick it out okay and so the whole idea behind using the VP an app is that we're going to have this magical tunnel that you're going to use\nWhen you are scouting around in Europe where you guys going\nUm we're doing um London, France ...\nAm and Germany oh how fun yes can't wait\nI'm so excited for you know London you're going to make sure that you get this app it's put out by the London museum oh and so when you're ... this was like the coolest things are going to totally love Esteban when you are like standing in a say in front of Buckingham Palace or pick her daily square or whatever it may be\nIs that you hold up your phone and augmented reality so you can see where you're standing what it looked like in say Eighteen sixty two\nOh my gosh oh it's so cool it's so cool and then the other thing are ... are you went to like military stuff\nAh my husband is okay\nThere's a museum and I made the mistake and I didn't mean to go to this museum which means like a lot of people don't mean to go to Sweden which means most most people don't go there and say is that is the imperial museum\nIs also in London and then of course in France make sure you take like a a cooking class for chocolate and ah it's just an old had to pick like the right cause song and you know if you could do a food toward any of these that has to be great I went back to your VPN so when you're sitting there\nHaving your tea and Crumpet or your wine and the souffle or whatever it may be is that I Want to make sure that the hackers in the bad guys don't get you so uh so you're right there are all these different VPN those some of them I Can't say on there because like hide your whatever\nUh then there's no word VPN and then there's also freedom VPN which\nThey were actually a sponsor of our show at the company by the name of F secure and it's a public company and this is the VPN that I use than it is free or like for example when I was in London last month and so it does slow things down\nA but if you want to be safe and secure and I'll put a link to this over I commanded a common that show picks buttons you can find it\nIs that is truly the best way to do and of course before you go tell your credit cards that you're going I mean you ... you know all the drill and then there's a there's another app that you need to get its called mobile passport\nYou heard we talk about that I'm no okay you need this app okay just if you don't do anything else and get them out okay All right so you leave the United states you're on your way back there's four hundred and fifty people on the plane right right\nAnd they're all coming down this pipeline all go to go through homeland security\nOr a border patrol\nNow if you have mobile passport on your phone I guarantee you that four hundred and thirty four people are going to be standing in line and sixteen of you are going to be on the mobile line and you're going to get through in like three minutes\nOh my gosh I have to have that oh you have to do it is you have to do it and so and it's like one of these things before everybody knew how to get pre check you know is good to get free check but no but now everybody has pre check [laughter] so it's\nKind of like that same thing with this mobile passport and so when you get off the plane and ah when you land back in the states just look for a sign that says mobile passport here in Phoenix\nOr they actually didn't have a sign and I had to ask one of the border patrol agents like you know where's the mole passport and he's like oh that way you go I mean it went all the way to the left and when I got on the line there was one person in front of me
