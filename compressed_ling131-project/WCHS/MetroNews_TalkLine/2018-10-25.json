you want to find out more here has a number for you star star three to four that star star three to four messaging data rates may apply called star star three to four from around\nSo that we can fully understand what we're dealing with when it comes to a person's ah for it passed so that when we do provide that final list it it will be in its final form on\nYour fish blurry told us happy we only get one chance to get this right and so we're going to great pains to make sure that what we release as accurate\nAs it were yeah absolutely I mean absolutely should be I mean you're talking about the very serious allegations here how long will that take Bryan\nWe hope to have our list complete an out published on the street on the Web site by November thirty\nWell okay so I thought it might be longer so obviously you're are you all pretty far along in this process then\nI think we are I think that um we have a discussion with our independent ... sexual abuse review board\nOr who they have fantastic experience in the medical and counseling fields um they're they're kind of our benchmark a for how we uh we ... we really need their advice in opinion on how to deal with issues issues such as clergy sex abuse\nSo we talk to them earlier a it was a Monday of this week\nWe presented to them an update on where we are in the process and they felt very comfortable that we should make this announcement that we should um [noise] you know proceed and make the announcement that will release that the names by November thirty\nAnd none of those names but you're still going through the files so how can you say with confidence that none of those names that will be released are of current or priests who are currently active in the diocese\nWell we had an active allegation against appreciate the spending from ministry\nAnd there would be an investigation or if it was a credible confident needed to go to the local prosecuting attorney in that county or the share of for the state police that would be underway so technically if if we know everything about all the clergy ... currently serving in the diocese and if there was an allegation there's no way they could be an active ministry\nRun monitors with this delegation of administrative affairs for the diocese of Charleston on there are pretty stunning announcement that the dies users are going to release the names of all freeze deacons and religious the name that you all get his religious which just means as I understand that there could be\nA members of religious order like a marathon producer for instance can freeze you just call\nThem we write yeah we've been fortunate to have a number of religious orders help staff are ah Paris over years and sets a cooperative relationship in a while those religious orders maintain those files we have fouls on those individuals while they were working here\nBrian wheels is a list include\nInformation about who knew what for example I'll give you a hypothetical that frees a a was there's credible evidence that frees day was sexually abusing\nA a child or children and that someone above him perhaps the bishop of the ... and get them working hypothetical here knew about it and didn't do anything about it or transferred that person to another parish well that information if that exists be included as well\nThat's a great question I don't think we've cross that bridge yet and we'll have to consider that moving forward my interview today would have to be no because I don't know if all that information will be available for each name who would be on the list but I think it's something that isn't the back of all of our minds you know how are we going to handle that and so on that as a work in progress\nOkay but you would consider that a credible request by\nNot just by the media but by others you would want to know because right as you know that's been a huge part of this scandal not just what some have done but the fact that those who has been in higher up positions have a look the other way or covered photos freezer transfer them to other places\nThat is absolutely a problem hopping we have to deal with it\nYou're right the\nHow why and don't take this the wrong way but but clearly you are aware and the church is aware that there is a huge trust in credibility issue here you are doing the review of the files and will release the names\nWhy should a parishioners why should members of the community trust the wheel in Charleston diocese canceling that this will be a thorough review that this will be a full accounting of what is alleged to have happened or what does credibly happened since Nineteen fifty\nI think 'cause it gets back to what's called a credible allegations so when when we use that phrase we mean\nA ... that we've been able to do initial legwork to find out if it were if the offense really could possibly occurred\nSo when somebody would make an allegation against a priest over history at least under our policy um we would look at the time the place the age of the parties are the background in history available at that time the personnel file the priest or\nWhoever was involved and other permanent facts so\nFor example we had one person make an allegation against a priest and when we looked into the situation\nThe person was actually incarcerated in a jail in West Virginia during the timeframe that he said that he was you know touched by the priest okay that's not a credible allegation okay so when we can rule out those obvious factors like that then we're able to turn those things over to law enforcement\nWhen we turn the files over to law enforcement conduct their investigation the dicey stays away so we let the local authorities do their investigation and whatever happens to the courts that's what happens and that's\nThe statute of limitations of kicked in on a lot of these cases\nThat could be true but I I'm Talking like in real time over the years as these allegations have come forth that's how we would handle things so yeah you're going to see a lot of names on the list copy of priests that are deceased\nAnd these things happen maybe in the fifties sixties seventies or eighties so that that is a reality of part of this release um but we just want to really make sure that the the community knows that we're looking at these credible accusations things that we could substantiate to the point that if we needed to self report that to the authorities we could do that\nI I Want to go back to the original question though and don't exist the wrong way but but the fact that with what has happened with this scandal now you're you are in essence asking for Easterners you're asking uh the state of West Virginia you're asking some of the victims frankly\nShoes to trust that what the Catholic Church in West Virginia put forward with this investigation with Israeli civilians will be thorough accurate independent and not I'm not a light weights uh owns escalation and you know what are you know what I mean you understand what I'm saying\nDo I get to an end to answer a straight up is that you know we do have a trust problem and we do have a credibility problem all we think we can do is take steps to alleviate that we can't fix history but we can account for it\nAnd we can turn her face to the future and tell you these are the things we're going to do to make sure that this never happens again I Know for a lot of your listeners today that's not going to be enough so we're gonna have to continue to take steps to prove to people that were willing to do this\nHobby on the delegate for administrative affairs I'm a lay person\nDo they program has brought you bought by Milan were delivering better health for better West Virginia is no job it is our mission please welcome Howard Monroe from WBAL wine wheeling ornaments mineral how are you\nGood morning sir I it's twelve days away from election day I'm just getting anxious where Dolby over\nReally [laughter] this is when it just to me it goes into this year we're six year old fourth gear or third year whatever kind of vehicle you have two weeks before I mean it's like it elevates even more and it gets a little ... you know for sure\nNot here I Would I Would I Would certainly agree it just gets busier that's all\nAbout like you and I guess yeah I was thinking about you and I wrote that piece about early voting because you do not early vote I Know that\nYeah I I I did last year for the first trial I I I Am always felt that voting\nShould be done on election day there's just something about all of America gets together and votes on one particular\nDay but then it got too easy to go and vote [laughter] literally vomiting [laughter] I just\nAnd the lines were shorter and I discovered it was just a it was just a faster way to do it\nYeah exactly how or do you think that the heated rhetoric that exist in the public domain today contributes to\nA what happens whether it's these attempted bombings or whether it's the gunshot attack on steep squeezed or Gabby Giffords or whether it's you know a threat to the Trump ... does the rhetoric contribute\nThe short answer is yes I don't think you can argue that rhetoric doesn't contribute otherwise why would you and I do talk shows me you know ... what is said matters so I think rhetoric does contribute to that and I think it's a it's a um a cumulative effect\nOver a period of time a period of comments a period of different people saying things with\nThat that lowers are some people some people's inhibitions about ah being a at least verbally violent if not physically violent but I also think hop you have to drop some distinctions between some of the other incidents and this particular situation with dealing with that yesterday and today I mean I think\nThis is clearly this is the this is clearly something more than just\nA venting out this is this is a political act against ... something that resembles and enemies list so I I did they get to drop the distinctions there but I think should read it and again it's not what somebody says today or what you are are due tomorrow it's what we all do over a period of time\nIt's the same as ... as the as violence in our society you know little by little we have become to accept more and more\nViolence in our society in general kids play video games different than Iraq play video games it didn't happen in one instance it happens cumulatively at least that's my opinion\nWell I'm not sure about that I I I don't like the heated rhetoric I don't like a lot of things the president said I don't like a lot of things other people say because it just seems like I've said many times here\nAt the other side's not just wrong they're evil and you want to tamp them down you want to step on this road you want to bury him a ... great but that's what it feels like sometimes but also I think there's a distinction between well I Know they're just thinking queen correlation and causation and there's whenever something like this happens there is an immediate rush\nTo the assumption I'm going to ask some questions about this morning as well because I feel compelled to but whether something whether a Cosby is a cause they is it there's causation does Trump's rhetoric or does or somebody did some the rhetoric by somebody on the rights or the left if demand the left cause\nThese bombing attempt or is there are simply a correlation or that took place and I think we I think that distinction is important because everybody rushes to seek a cause we don't know the cause you don't know the cost\nI mean you don't know I don't know in the ... until you arrest whoever did it and find out what their motivation really is well you know the cause maybe they I mean to me the guys were person's not to do it so those are the unhinged to begin with\nI I wouldn't disagree with that last part at all but if you look at this incident this this resembles an enemies list of those from the radical right I'm not saying Donald Trump when I'm not saying Republicans I'm saying the far right radical uh off the trail\nRight when this was an enemies list I mean look happy if we if I were to ask you two days ago\nTo drop a list of the people you think that the the crazy loony radical right would want to get rid of we'd be drawn by with that we have right now I I I mean we don't know I that's always something we have to say we don't know until we arrest him\nBut we can make a pretty good assumption to this is not just ... this is about an incident in isolation and\nThese are what nine I think now's the time that we're up to now I'm clear there's a clear connection between them\nWell I ... the but the problem is that we're just going to go back and forth that the next time something happens\nAnd if there's an attack on Trump or somebody sends you know something to something they've already done that to some family members than the writers going to say this is the radical left this is the this is the language of the radical left that is causing these things to take place and so we don't get anywhere\nYou know we just we just wait we just wait for the next shoe to drop and then uh you draw the usual a blame game\nBut somewhere you've got to begin to say that not all of these things are equal this incident I mean again I'm focusing on this one in particular this is very different than any of the other individual incidents the Steve ... influence\nOn our on our now that I'm joined in the argument you because the squeeze the guy ... open up a gun fire on Republican congressman the baseball field that's pretty serious I mean so far in this nobody's been hurt\nBut I I just I I look at but but it's not the same thing as having nine targeted individuals are receiving\nA buy guess pipe bombs wire explosive devices I'm\nA all all nine of whom are connected\nThe sense that they are perceived by the looney tune right and again I Hope people understand I'm not talking about those I disagree with just because of politics but the looney tune right fringe or this or their enemies list this is different you can't we always tried to want it in a complete everything into some equality it's\nNot the same thing this is very very different ... and I know what let me let me let me let me say one thing though I Believe in my own audience didn't believe me when I ...\nI Believe Donald Trump with sincere last night when he said this was despicable\nAt I Believe Donald Trump was sincere when he says we should not have this kind of political violence I Believe that's what is in his heart that I don't think Donald Trump understands that when he gets up there and does his shtick\nWhich is what it is that those words have consequences you know he dances and he prances and he has his rallies and and and he plays a game and I don't think he comprehends that that has consequences I think in his heart he feels that way you said last night I give him credit for that\nI don't blame him a the only I blame him for his not comprehend him but his other words if concert\nOK then does the does do the media have any responsibility here because President Trump tweeted this morning a very big part of the anger we see today in society is caused by the purposely falls and enact reporting in the mainstream media though refer to as fake news has gotten so bad and hateful but it's beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act fast\nBut since I don't agree with the premise there I don't think that the mainstream media is engaged in fake news or in misinformation I think the mainstream media is providing factual information that he doesn't live in the disagrees with him and then others can take that and become more um intense about it um but I I don't I don't agree with the premise of\nIt ... my problem with with the media and I are part of it and I often engage in this unfortunately but it's so much the nature of the beach is that\nAnd you know there's Howard and talked about this many times is that in in the public debate or that takes place in the media there is no there seems to be no room for common ground I Would agree and and and that and that in and of itself forces people drives people to choose sides I\nI agree and and I find myself and I get disturbed about this and people say to me I don't hear a lot\nYou're a lot more radical on the left now than you ever used to be and it's because I feel like I've been pushed that way because those are the voices on the right to become more polarized more radicalized and\nI feel compelled to be more the counter balance there um I decided that it it is certainly true that we do we do engage in this a lot and and to that extent up to the extent that we always have to have the argument instead of having the information you have a pretty good job\nOut of the time hobby and try to be informative as opposed to argumentative or\nA book about it because I Want to be ... as he interrupted you I I Want to be informative I like I like to argue well well enough that I\nI don't necessarily like to argue just for the sake of arguing and I don't like to just be an ideologue you know I like to really find a way forward and I maybe I'm naive about that but it it's ultimately about how do we figure this out\nI wouldn't call you naive I Would call your old fashioned [laughter] I\nI just that it's an old fashioned notion which I Wish we would get back to and again I hold myself accountable for being more\nA inflammatory than I used to be I feel that that's where we have ended up in this talk media game that that we're in I tried to be informative when I Do interviews but when I Do opinions that this is my show I tend to be very strong in my opinion stronger perhaps that I even\nThey'd be eleven or twelve or whatever and then Texas yeah as long as they win this week uh you'd have this huge matchup next week that would get a lot of attention because obviously they make the case that that'll be the front runner for the big twelve you just did a ... an interview with the Baylor media folk what do they think about the bears [noise] um I think they think that they're improving\nOr they love their a receiver jailing hurting transferred in from Tennessee he's instantly kind of made the transition from running back a tendency to receiver a Baylor and he's done really well\nI think they're high on the upside of Charlie brewer their quarterback is a true sophomore West Virginia faced last year um

... okay so if that's true then nowadays\nAnd has been transformed into social media and Internet and everything and I think maybe the main media leaders\nHave a responsibility to use that power to try to ameliorate or a lesson and not be so divisive in there\nA quote unquote reporting as to cause people on both sides to step back a second and think how much sense one or two points on the other side makes\nWell I I think the the media and I are the media so I I don't want to just bash the media but I Do believe the media could shake\nA greater role in trying to when they have debate when they have discussions about issues rather than just having a polarized debate of trying to I'm engaged the people in the debate to find some consensus\nRather than just have these polarized argues the problem is candidly that that's often boring and because it's boring people aren't going to watch or listen and then their numbers go down they won't make money I mean I I Am I Am I'm very aware of that and doing the show you want to be compelling an interesting\nUh because if you don't have listeners then you don't have a show but I also think the media can do a better job of when they have people on of trying to actually find if there was a consensus rather than just fomenting argument appreciate the call thank you Jim let me go to us send her\nShow him or cabinet joins us on veterans chocolate Sunni morning how are you good morning I'm great thank you you just came from an announcement with the governor where a company called the video is going to make a huge broadband investment of West Virginia I don't know much about it because we're just announced what is that\nWell it's great news for West Virginia to two hundred mile east to west route it's going to go and looks like right through the middle of the state and it's going to have great capacity for the pat down of the fiber network that were a lot of places that were missing and this will be an opportunity for\nA Internet service providers and everybody else to hook onto the facts aren't really give her\n[noise]\nLooking back on line on metro news off the first of all would you please welcome West Virginia attorney general Republican can for us and Patrick Morsi morning Patrick\nHey it's good to be here we love your bags the pretty cool\nYou know so it really has a campaign going well where do you think do you think you're a head\nI think we have all the momentum you know how do you think that well a couple of reasons one I think that as more people focus on the race they know that I'm the conservative fighter is going to help advance the Trump agenda they know the president it's all in for me\nAnd the more and more people examine Joe mansions record they see is just another dishonest Washington liberal it's in plain view everything is doing and I think his folks focus on that contrast it's a winning message from\nIf he were a Washington liberal why would she vote to confirm Kevin ...\nI think you have to look at how he went about that this is why he's not trusted by anyone across the spectrum now he waited he left the Senate floor and then afterwards he watched his Susan Collins voted for Kavanaugh then he prayed back and he cast his vote\nFor political expediency reasons he's part of the Schumer leadership team and we know that those guys want to go after the president and bring 'em down that's why because he's empowering the obstruct resist impeachment team in Washington and that's his first and most important\nVote but what he did vote for capital I mean he did vote for him he voted he voted the same way you would have voted\n... stepped up after it was clear that he was not the deciding vote and that he did that because you know he would have been a sure fire loser if he didn't step in that direction but you should see how we did it\nIf you'd call someone's name and you take a powder you leave and then you come back\nAnd Maine makes the decision for West Virginia I think that's why you're seeing people recoil from action because it can't be trusted he can't be trust on the left he can't be trusted on the right he's certainly can't be trusted to But West Virginia first and support this president when you know this president is supportive of me\nPatrick marshals with is West Virginia attorney general Republican candidate for US Senate is there a settlement pending between ... who is a is a drug distributors company and also um medical equipment between the cast in West Virginia is the resettlement pending\nSo happy I can tell you I honestly don't know the answer the question because I'm not involved in the case I stepped away from that case\nAnd so our offices handling I can tell you this based on the public reports that I've read what our office that said Joe mansion once again very dishonest he went on the air just making stuff up as he goes along it shows just how desperate he is\nHe should go back to being a carpet salesmen 'cause he knows nothing about settlements and opioid a lawsuit and it's just a shame that he's willing to just make things up out of whole cloth\nYou did take yourself out of that action when it was filed by the state of West Virginia against McCutcheon because of your background of lobbying for drug companies when you're in Washington DC\nOr your office though did settle with cardinal for twenty million dollars you office digital with a mirror source Bergen for sixteen million dollars\nAnd the reports are that if there is a settlement might be around thirty five million maybe there will be where we won't be ... or those right numbers I mean does that inappropriate is that ... I think you can speak to that now I could only appropriate number\nSo I think you have to look at let's look at the past for a moment because we shouldn't speculate as to the future if you look at the record breaking selling with their have never been such large trucks settlements in the history of the state of West Virginia\nWe've had seven eight million on my watch and if you look at the corresponding settlements that occurred on the federal level and other states West Virginia is leading the charge in terms of the total dollar value that it's bringing in\nAnd people have to remember is that a company's fight very hard in the arena we have to be stronger we have to make sure when these cases but seven eight million is a lot of money but it's also a lot percentage wise compared to for instance happy the other day you mentioned the da had a hundred and fifty million dollar settlement\nAnd if I pathetically thirty five million is that number my God I mean look at the percentages and the other thing is you have to say these are massive massive companies and a small percentage of what they're doing is on opioids I think that it's very clear\nThat whatever the settlements about their record breaking and we should make sure that we hold companies accountable hard to predict the exact number but I'm a big believer in everything I Do to help people count\nA mansion said that the opioid epidemic is costing West Virginia's economy eight point eight billion dollars a year he pointed out that the tobacco settlement was one point eight billion dollars but he says when you when you look at those numbers\nWith what he said and when you look at the size of the Macau some company that that you didn't say she knows but that that's a small amount compared to for example a tobacco sell about ...\n... I don't think that he's actually comparing apples or an art tobacco company does nothing but tobacco right you have these companies doing massive number of other things I don't know the percentage of what they do but I can tell you this record breaking and winning\nIs a lot better than losing and Joe mansion couldn't even snap a settlement related to drug companies and any of these issues he wants to sleep at the switch during this whole time as governor and right now he ... pharmaceuticals he takes massive amounts of their campaign\nHe's been complicit in all this I mean the reality is that Joe mansion has not been the leader we need fighting open abused whereas my office has been phenomenally aggressive not only in terms of enforcement which civil settlement but partnering with the U.S attorney's office I sued the da ... talking about hitting the drug companies where they live\nThat will result in dramatically fewer opioids that are permitted to be manufactured in distributed we're always going to put West Virginia first Joe mansion puts himself for\nYou you you've talked about you mentioned the ... and mansion has taken significant contributions from Ireland but ... and everybody talks about every ... a big issue Patrick but also when there's a big employer in West Virginia so uh I mean what does mansion frankly what's he's supposed to do about a mile and I mean what could he do\nI don't think you'd defend the system when he goes out in front of defense my own pharmaceuticals and meanwhile there's massive shipments of fat in all in and they have the ... I don't defend that you know as you know I went after I investigated that and violence had record breaking settlements nationally so I think you have to\nAs the attorney general you go after evidence you uphold the rule of law you know what you imagined does when there is a drug settlement they came and\nJoe Manchin and wants to divert three million dollars for a helicopter instead of apply the money for treatment that's not what's right for West Virginia Joe Manchin has a habit of putting himself for\nSitting you want to you want her to divert money to go to a state police agency rather and turn it over to the legislature around actually\nWe put money into the drug crime lab which actually test to allow people to be determined are innocent or guilty that's one of the foundational blocks for criminal justice and deals directly with the overflow of cases coming on drug related issues so it's exactly where the money should be\nPatrick Mars is with us Republican attorney general and of course running for\nThe U.S soon as you know held by Joe Manchin so we've had these attempted bombing of for the last couple of days the president said in a tweet he said a very big part of the anger we see today in our society has caused by the purposely falls in inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media\nThat I referred to as fake news has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act fast you believe that the media do use you said the president sports you do you support that statement by the president the media are contributing to the problems\nLook I think I condemn violence of all sore so I'm not going to get into all the particulars I think everyone can be considered responsible for all the costs to our behavior and the threats and we should say no to violence across the board\nAnd so that's been my position because I think it's wrong if it's done by the left or by the writer by anyone and we should call it out for what it is it's violence it terrorism and we shouldn't tolerate\nSo the president wrong to blame the media\nYou look I think the media has been a huge profit generally in our country and there have been a lot of big issues will copy I'm the one opposed by the liberal establishment and the media here in West Virginia you see it because I represent change and I respect this president for standing up and calling people out when they make mistakes you know obviously\nEveryone has their own word choice but I Will tell you this um I have always been clear no one should say that\nThere should be violence or there should be civil unrest let's call people out uh for the actions that occur\nPatrick ... is with us as a candidate for eternity drug ... for a U.S senator he's the current attorney general person also announced this morning and maybe I cut you off guard on this but that he is sending actually going to send ... United States military to the border because of that curve and do you support that action\nI think it's clear that we need to make sure we close our borders and what we're seeing down there this so called caravan is that it just seems to be growing in strength but part of the reason why you see that is because\nThe United states was known for so so long have you open borders policy which I think people in West Virginia need to know that the open borders policy that Joe Manchin supports isn't part responsible for many illicit drugs flowing into our state whether you're talking ... whether you're talking math\nWhether you're talking heroin and when you have porous open borders", "year": "2018", "show_name": "MetroNews TalkLine", "city": "Charleston", "day": "25"}
