still happens on occasion I Do like football\nAnd professional football is generally played on Sundays which typically is a work day for me so it it's rare that I Would get to watch the game so this wonderful thing called video recording has been invented so this afternoon we'll set the DVR and when I get home from evening church and a while I'm sitting there in my suit time button down shirt\nI'll watch the football game already already that's already been played hours ago\nAnd sometimes I enjoy it you know 'cause to me it's just rolling out sort of in real time there's sometimes\nMy wife and I do this we'll check the score and it will decide if we want to watch the game\n[noise]\nSeriously is it worth it or not um I got about three hours of my life but you know if they're going to lose it I just forget that\nBut it's amazing when you know the final score especially if you're on the winning side they fumble who cares we when\nWe're down to fourteenth points in the fourth quarter we when\nHave you read the last book in the Bible\nHaven't read the last chapter\nDo you know who's on the winning side and you know who's on your side\nTwo words rest\nAnd reassure risk in him whatever\nYour worked up about oh this is going on this\nTrend is this going to happen that's not going to happen come back to rest in\nBecause if God can get you from here to seeded and standing in his presence worshipping him in heaven forever\nI think he could probably get you to the end of the day and probably get you to the end of this year and probably get you to the end of this life rest and him the word second word you see in front of used the word race or you need to reassure some other people of the truth I just talk to you about when you run into those people that are the nervous Nellie ... of the world\nAnd those people that are just all worked up about everything first of all we need to be the examples of calm and confidence because we know are lord and then that could be the opportunity to share where your confidence comes from the fortunately receive a blessing from Jesus on hand from Jesus Christ that's what verse three is all about\n[noise] he says ... blasted is he who reads\n\nAnd those who hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written in it for the time is near\nBy the way ... what we call the attitude usually we think of Jesus staying those attitudes and and the gospels and the sermon on them out but there are many of them in the Bible it when it says a blessing speaks blessing by the way this is the first of seven blessings Seventy additives that are found in the book of revelation\nAnd you're going to find out the number seven is very important\nIn the book you can find out they're seven star seven lamps them seven churches seven seals seven ... seven ... seven spirits have got seven trumpet seven thunders seven angel seven ... seven ... seven mountains seven kings a lot of sevens\nWhat's the meaning of seven go back to the first week there ever was in seven days God did what he meant he did all he wanted to do and making everything everything everything was set in its place in seven days actually in six in the seventh day he rested and enjoyed it\nIt's a way of saying God has completed his work everything is full everything is finish if something God does\nIt might be a hint why the the number we see of the other side is the number six repeated the gods numbers the number seven of completed\nSo he says seven times there's a complete blessing for you a blessing we've talked about this many times wherever the blessing to getting passed out and go get go get in that line go find that station find that wherever that is and here's the blessing\nAh it's it's all coming from Jesus\nAnd here's how we react to that here's how we relate to that three words and all you can put them on the screen there in front of you is the words you read here and keep the seat in there and attacks lessons to see who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written in it\nYou won't blessing you read this book and now this is localized in the twenty two chapters of revelation but if we can I think we can apply to the entirety of the word of God because all scriptures given by inspirations got in is\nProfitable for us there is a blessing in it there's truth there in it\nSo he says he says you read this book\nDon't neglect that don't like to study and I've I've told you this often but for you to come on a Sunday Morning when you could be a thousand other places\nYou can still be in the comfort of your bed with a with a with the with the blankets all pulled up around you're just in in in peaceful slumber always always hesitate to introduce items images of slumber into church okay that's a little dangerous\nBut you can be anywhere the smart and you're here set in God's word together with your fellow believers in Christ God Bless you as we read as we study as we learn and here there is a blessing promise to you for that\nMaybe we might have trouble tracking where the blessing comes from but God's into blessing business and he wants to shower his blessing on all of you and us\nSort of read it and then not only that you you hear it here in the words is probably well what's there between reading and hearing hearing I think that's the idea of of a breaking it down explaining it turning it over understanding it having it taught teaching it studying it\nIt takes effort is that it's not just a casual heard that and going on but but but at the dedicated effort at it and then this word keep it\nThat we try to with God's help and the power of the spirit that we live at that we carry it out that we live without that it makes a difference\n\nAs God blesses or so it makes a difference as we rest and find her sugar and says we look and listen as we grow and\nHim all those things we've already talked about and then it ends with this little phrase for the times in the air\nAnd I got help assist open our hearts to him\nYou've been listening to the radio broadcast to mount calvary Baptist church in Charleston Mt calvary Baptist church is

see what you're referring to remember what would you say wait\nA minute and I was little you know and there was a swimmer I may have a sort of Irish people in my town or whatever\nAnd so we are created the image and the like is a God so therefore just as God is father son spirit one God we our\nSpirits so body one man so every single person you have a body\nYou have a soul and you have a spirit\nAnd your soul is where your mind rest you're so is that your mind you're will your emotions the seat of your affection sits in that so that that is that is where your mind is and so before Paul gets to renew in your mind he first deals with our bodies\nHe first deals with our flesh and he said\nThat I Want you to present your body's as\nA living sacrifice holy and acceptable under God this this popped out to me yesterday I never seen it like this before but look what this passage descriptor literally tells me that it's possible watch this not just for our spirit to be wholly unacceptable\nNot just for our mind to be wholly unacceptable but\nHe's saying that it's possible for your flash there'll be wholly unacceptable to God I've always heard about being psyched about in your spirit but he said you'll flesh can be hold your flash can be acceptable how when you make it a living sacrifice him along\nEconomy of this these two words right here living sacrifice living soccer by it don't make no sense I have never seen a sacrifice\nThat's alive let me give you an example when I when I looked out on the grill this week and I put that chicken up on the grill that chicken was not a living sacrifice it had been sacrifice and now it was only ... but it wasn't alive it had just been sacrificed\nFor the number's been my body for those of you to bless your food real good still don't make no sense to me how we have a triple big by large fried coke and be like oh bless up for the nursing on my body and I go say I've done it lord I just ... pizza and I pray to Greece in the fat off of it in Jesus' name it don't work but it sounds good\nBut when I put that chicken up on that grill that chicken was not a living sacrifice that chicken with just a sacrifice because in order for something to be a sacrifice it has to be dead and so what part was telling us here is I Want your body to be dead\nAt the same time and\nHe didn't even say that it's complicated that it's hard\nHe said watch is our reasonable serve it let me give you the beach idea that he's like that's what you're supposed to do anyhow that's the BJ beat\nHe's our due to protect your body's a living sacrifice 'cause\nThat's what we're supposed to do with how why are we supposed to present our bodies delivery sacrifice I Will tell you what those Christ presented here's a good living sacrifice and because of Jesus Christ presented his body as a living sacrifice for our sea and then we can present hours after living sacrifice for his holiness so he started\nBefore he went to the mine and let's let's just be on everybody got flash somebody else ... somebody else flushes nasty nasty and some of it's just nasty\nAnd like I told her first service I'll let this is Lee discern figure out what I'm Talking about\nWhen I say nasty nasty nasty watch\nEverybody's flash from birth is last everybody's fled is nasty to God that's why we have to present it to him as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable and so then that he wants to go on and he wants to talk about now the the the renewing\nOf our mind and and he wants to talk about here are really the struggle that takes place between uh the natural and the supernatural\nThe struggle that takes place between um the the Cornel\nAnd the spiritual natural supernatural Cornel spiritual and it's a it's a struggle Romans chapter eight versus five to seven says like this but they are that are\nDo mind the thing the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit\nWas first six quarter to quarter reminded his what hold on to be totally mind it as what the United his death but watch to be spiritually mind it is not just life but it's life and the I Love how he added to that he didn't just like to be demanding his life he said I Need you know that can be friends\nOf mine and it's not just life but when you have that life you also have the watch for seven because the law\nIs in the team again Don are Cornel natural let me sound like this are natural way of thinking is at war against God the natural way that we think from birds is at\nAgainst Scott remember\nA couple of weeks ago a viewer here I'll let you know your mind is like and I like a magnet those baggage that we had grown up as kids all these ideas maybe I was just weird but I got like the polarization on the ends up when you're trying to put the two ends the gathered that don't go and it just won't go together okay I got\nI got a few other weird people in the room with me so anyway but watches your mind or or the way you think because what you gotta understand there's this when your brain and your mind\nYour brain is this ... the blob stuff in your head but your mind is how you use it and so the Cornel\nMine is immunity against got your brain\nIs like a magnet it either it either receives the things of God or ... repels the things have gone\nSo I Want you to look at it like this 'cause there's a lotta people that that you're saying but your mind is still against guards said psychopaths then with the holy does money very far but your mind still needs some work still picture like just your mind is like a magnet that that is\nLiterally ... telling what daughter's trying to send to picture like a fourth just negativity all up in your head and God God trying to send something to your life and your brain is rappelling because\nYour mind is again dots but we got to take it a step further because of course for instance chapter\nChapter two verse twelve sixteen shows is even deeper what we're looking at here that's about yours type but his right oh that was weak that somebody else's type but it's right we're going somewhere don't worry it gets it gets good or course Corinthians to bar swelled watches now we have ... not the spirit of the world\nBut the spirit which is a God that we may know the things\nThat are freely given to us up God or Thirteen which things also it was like we speed was ... we speak you think here's this connection again between our mind\nAnd what we say\nOut of the abundance\nMouth we'll speak connection between what we think and what we what we say and he said he said I'm not into words which means we're some teachers are natural but what's the holy go see just comparing spiritual things were spiritual watch first fourteen for the natural man or the\nCornel mind cannot receive that things have gone now remember\nRobert ... says that are\nIs against God or repel sex so here is telling us\nOn mine cannot receive the things of God why but they're foolish to steer him it's [laughter] [laughter] God's image always are full retail your mind it's cooler you don't make no sense but look at the connection here between what we think and what we say remember\nRemember your mind is like a magnet that will either watches receive or repel based upon how we think so watch watch watch see maybe maybe not think about this may be maybe every time what comes out of your mouth is I'm never going to get it right maybe\nYou've said it because you're thinking it\nAnd maybe the thinking is rebelling do raise the gods trying to say I'll never get a promotion well the reason it came out of your mouth is because it's already in your mind and maybe because it's already in your mind it's repairing and can't receive the promotion they got try this it\nWas because it gone since the promotion that he wants to your mind not ready for it yet and you can mess up what got sent to you that's what I get your mind right because what God wants to do for you it's foolish destroy your natural way of thinking the stuff\nWants to do for his people is so much\nThat it's foolishness process even try to think about it it doesn't make any sense I use these examples of former use it against what God does doesn't make sense and your natural I Will always try to fight what the spirit of God is trying to appeal to you\nKnow but it does it it'll make it uh it doesn't make it doesn't make natural states watchers it's foolish to think in the natural that someone that is sick and they tell they were going forward we like hands on them and hailing come that's foolishness to the natural I\nDon't make no sense it's just the thing that in the economy of God the way to gain a harvest it's just overseas or in a way to get more money is this all money oh I Know since I Need this money I got bills\nI got chairman defeat I got a lot of kids and teenagers eat like horses\n\nDear lord I I take um the wind these ten minutes from the house and ate a big double the bacon to pound cheeseburger large fry and get home and they feel about that I have a snack I'm like a snack\nYou just say\nIs no longer push you get back our mind says I've been new to this and so now I can receive or confirmed what God is telling me\nIn a point in your life to where are you know God has been speaking to us I I don't know that under the\nThose problems and allows you to confirmed things with your mind that when God Speaks your brain says yeah that's right because I noticed there would have got\nYour mind confirms uh okay so here we go we don't take it out with this let's go to the Romans Romans chapter eight versus twenty six\nAnd twenty seven Romans eight twenty six twenty seven because you say when we hear something like this was like oh lord I got to renew my mind I've got to renew my mind I've got to renew my mind and the problem with that as we keep using the word out we keep we keep making your personal that I\nHave to do something and yes you did it in the word and yes you can pray but watch just here's how also got is\nPerson in this room that you say yourself\nThere's not a single person allow that could say you get yourself enough grades to get say nobody\nThat you get yourself nursery for your sins to be forgiven he made it happen for you and so forth I I Love the Romans chapter and verse twenty six twenty seven is like what\nThe spirit also helps our fraternity\nBut we know not what we should pray as we are but the spirit itself makes intersection for us with grown in which cannot be altered versus twenty seven and he that search is the heart or the mines knows what is the mind of the spirit\nBecause he makes intercession for the same somewhat they'd asked me he makes it a session for you\nAccording to what\nThe will of God so God said look if you didn't say to yourself you still going to be made for a renewed by too if you're going to give yourself grades to get said you're not going to be able to have a little time without me either so here's what he said every twenty six he said that the spirit of the Holy Spirit\nYour weaknesses December will help your weaknesses 'cause you don't know how you price you should opt for those prices according to the little dots to here's what he said he said in the process of having your mind renewed\nHe said I'm not going to leave you by yourself to renew your mind by yourself he said but if I gave you grace and mercy to be said that\nI'm also going to give you my spirit to help you really don't mind and so the weaknesses that you have in your mind God that I'm going to give you my spirit and uncle strict in those weaknesses and those areas where you feel like your mind out of control he said I'm going to give you the holy ghost and hold it goes it I give to you as well regulate those areas a week this was that are only inside of you to that\nWay when you feel like you're losing your body that I've got to hold it goes for that when you feel like your mind is out of control because he said I'm going to give you my spirit for that too when you feel like your mind is going somewhere else he said I'm going to give you my spirit and the spirit that\nPlaced on the inside of us don't help your weaknesses and you don't have to make do self strong but you're going to understand that when you are weak that's when God has made strong someone's that guardian given me his favorite and helping my week places that I don't know if you've got a we places or not but I got the with places like that what I Need is a wholly goes up\nSo you get done and don't give you a renewed mind but you can't you can't do it on your own you can't try to do it in your own drink or into power he said on both told you to get in my word but I'm going to give you the holy ghost so you understand the word but does\nI needed that I Need my people to be in a place to where they\nWhat I'm trying to do but their position spiritually and mentally to be able to receive the things that I'm trying to send to their lives and I don't know about you but I Want to be a receiver not a retailer I Want to be on defense and the thing I'm going to be on off in\nShe'll say I have\nThe mind of Christ my mind is being renewed by the spirit of God\nMy weaknesses are being strengthened my weaknesses that again\nAre being straight than I Am being position in a place to receive\nEverything that God has for me\nNo longer will repel\nDodge trying to send to me so God\nWhat you're sending my way I receive it\nJesus name hey man\nAnd Sandy your feet this afternoon\nGod's renewing our mind has renewing our mind\nGod's renewing our mind so we can see it the way he wants to see if we can do it the way he wants to do it we can have it the way he wants us to have it\n[laughter] I'm having a renewed mind\nHere this morning when I Need you to do is\nRemember it's not it's not your mind is the mind of Christ and the mind of Christ um when we enter into fellowship with Christ which only happen that comes through the gift of salvation\nYou can't save yourself you can't redeem yourself you can't be good enough to get it God gave it\nTo his death there was a record on the girls who calvary\nSo the Bible says that if you believe in your heart and you can fast with your mouth of Jesus Christ was raised from the dead you shall be said and says whoever calls upon the name of the lord shall be saved\nWhat we're going to do now is is we're all going to together we're going to\nWhat else they just get back to that is if you believe in you know why did they just get fashion\nAnd if we just get passed in what I Know what I Believe that the people in here that just get that we're about to make it will be ... dedication that you're ... you're like Jesus\nFor something like

Sunday and Consecration Sunday and in Sunday school those of you who were there\nMr Doug chambers explain some of the history of the reformation the reformation was brought about by some very brave people who saw that things needed to be changed and so I just want to talk a little bit about\nThe results of the reformation\nBecause of the reformation\nWere able to read the Bible themselves\nAnd what they found out when they read the Bible\nIs that they didn't have to pay for God's Grace have you ever been to a birthday party or had a birthday party yes me too and people bring presence\nAnd people don't say that will be nine Ninety nine pleas for your present you don't have to pay for your present right you get a present because that person the person who gives it to you\nLove you we don't have to pay for God's Grace because no matter what\nLoves us\nIt is by grace you have been saved through faith and this is not from yourself\nIt is the gift of God that is from uh the Asians\nAnd people during the reformation time got to read that for themselves\nAnd\nIt is by grace you have been saved through faith and this is not from yourself\nBy grace he's been saved threw faith\nSo because of that\nWere saved ... we don't have to do anything else but we do we do other things because\nOf another thing that happened and that is Jesus Christ\nCame to give us\nTo make us free from our sins\nAnd so on reformation Sunday we remembered that were saved by God's Grace and that's a free gift and Consecration Sunday we bring gifts and look you see this basket\nIt's filled with envelopes\nAnd the envelopes are filled with pledge cards\nAnd the pledge cards\nTell the church what each person is going to give to help the work of Jesus Christ through this church throughout the year\nYou all\nDon't have a pledge card but you know what you do have\nYou do have your two hands and your two feet and you use them all the time here in this church anytime you do the work of Jesus Christ in feeding the hungry when we make all those sandwiches for ... every Sunday\nAnd its next Sunday by the way so be there when we make three hundred sandwiches we give thanks to the glory of God for the grace that he's given us by doing the work of Jesus Christ\nNow let's all stand and on one two three we're going to say loudly made the piece of Christ to be with you ready one two
