know me I'm Joe mansion\nAnd ... and trying to contrast that with Patrick Morrisey who moved to this date and we're kind of parochial West Virginia so West Virginia\nThe polls the scientific poles and the anecdote of polls that we've done suggest that you a majority of you not all of you but the majority of you want Kavanaugh to be confirmed\nLook at the look at the online poll today look at the uh metro news talk line I mean look at the veterans dominion posed a poll West Virginia poll we did where majority of West Virginians there I have not seen any point we've done several or whether it's just on line or the west Virginia pull that suggest that West Virginians do not want cabin all\nA confirmed so if that's the case\nThen you're setting yourself up as I'm a West Virginia and reflect West Virginia values when you start to connect those dots\nDoesn't that lead to a yes vote for archiving all I think it's certainly points in that direction and now finally you do have a race\nDo have a race where if you don't vote for Kavanaugh\nA and I'm going to get mentioned the ... you mentioned the benefit of the doubt that he's searching his searching his the soul to figure out what to do here but if you're you're in politics you have to have a political calculation here and if you vote against Kevin all Marcy is going to go nuts with ads that say mansion\nSays that ah you know we worked with Donald Trump he says he represents West Virginia values but he voted it gives a tax increase any vote against capital\nAnd that could give a boost to ...\nPaying that is by the recent polls is trailing mansion\nSo I think when you put those things together and I know mansion has\nSome concerns as concerned about health care and what what cabin on my do on on health care if he's on the court but if you put those four or five things together they tip that scale\nToward voting for Kavanaugh and ... and I don't have to make a prediction but I'm going to make a prediction that he would vote do enclosure and then vote for a cabinet when\nHe had been seven six five eight to five five hundred seven six five CIA okay I don't have any inside information I'm not being coy with you I just think it's it's it's the I'm asking\nYou for your opinion so it's fair for me to put mine out there Robert on a cell phone Robert what do you think he's going to do and why\n[noise] well I Believe that he's going to vote for Kavanaugh unless he's\nThe fiftieth vote mhm\nThat's why he won't say what are you going to do yet because he's holding out and if it looks like if he's going to be the fiftieth or to come from [noise] he's not going to vote for him\nSo you think of the forty\nNinth or if he's the fifty first people vote for him but otherwise no\nOkay so right now and so if you if you got a couple of Republicans voting no if Collins and Murkowski or mccaskey and flake or if they voted no\nThen then that would make it fifty one forty nine the other way and then mansion doesn't want to be the fifth vote and then have parents come in and be fifty one that's what you're saying what\nHe won't he won't vote confirming if his votes needed my knee and he won't vote to keep him off if there's votes not needed but if he's if he's going to be the fifty but he'll he'll go against what\nDo you do you how big is all of this political terms in his race\nIs it that relevant will there'll be people who will change their vote or make up their minds\nBased on what he does and what he does\nA there'll be people who who ah who beat chomping at the bit to get to the polls to vote against him if he if he votes or Kevin all down from a won't change any minds but it'll it'll get people out\nThere will be a motivating factor yes All right Robert I appreciate\nThanks for the call David on a cellphone David what do you think syndrome matches going to do and why\n[noise] well I Can't say what he's gonna do specifically but I heard you talking about the polling [noise] by the way I see um I don't think that there's a sexual stuff is the worst of of him or do you remember Abu grab and all of a sexual torture that was going on in ...\nKevin was the guy that dropped the charges on the uh on the contractors a there's a company called khaki ca CSI\nVery easy to look up and in fact it was two thousand nine September twelfth two thousand nine cabinet or voted to drop the charges on notice uh a deviant or you\nKnow whatever I'm not familiar I'm not familiar with the intricacies of that case let's bring it back to what's happening today how's mansion going to vote and why\nWell you were talking about polling and forty one percent this is a ... a Reuters poll a forty one percent oppose cabin on thirty three percent support him twenty six percent they don't know in West Virginia a it's a seven day average of us adults okay that's us okay\nBut I I mean Kevin is dirty I told you before the Trump is organized crime everybody\nOkay which way to say on a second I Know I Know you have told me these things I'm not saying goes I'm not saying your opinion on that is relevant I'm saying the point today is how mansion is going to vote and what that means\nThat all of them were organized crime on the Supreme Court ... listen to what I'm asking you\nI'm asking you how mansion is going to vote and why\nDoes mansion on organized crime on the Supreme Court\nThanks for the call one eight hundred and seven six five eight to five five can you follow the simplest of directions Hi Bill what's going to happen today\nBecause I Will try to follow the simplest of directions I Believe some votes yes and I believe that Governor just this is going to play into this how\nBig because senator management and it was a formative ... is the senator up estate ... and Jim Justice relationship that Donald Trump this has been public about how it's going to work so you know wherever the use of the highest level out in the state of West Virginia\nI Believe that Governor justice would might make a suggestion for senator match you know you're out of this I I Believe that it\nThat I don't think so I I I'm going to disagree with you I don't think justice has denied the odor of influence on mansion on this one hundred seven six five TA okay Bret what do you think\nI think ... going to vote yes also because there is no real rock hard evidence against these claims against capital\nSo mansion will say\nThat there is no corroborating evidence therefore\nWhen a hundred seven six five TA okay one eight hundred seven six five talk and well I I honestly I don't I'm maybe I'm a little bit rude today I don't mean to be rude I just think here's the question this is that this is all that there is today on this\nOkay I appreciate it Jim in Charleston what's he going to do\nSo or he is going to vote yes on Kavanaugh for a number of reasons but it's hard to look at your voters and say well I'm One of you and I can support any president\nA President Trump carried
