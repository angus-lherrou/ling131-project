have said that you can take home a computer if you needed\nA but but no home office policy so the these are two charges relate directly to that that and to what law for his shut about it in again thanks to the workings of or the west Virginia broadcasters association and a judge coping have her\nA ruling in favor of the broadcasters motion we we have\nSome of justice law free statement to investigators where he took that position that the ... but there was nothing special about the desk and that it was ... it was his in his home in the first place those those clips are available on our website\nRead how about this testimony where on his desk you write off his testimony on Monday afternoon went so far as the country with a former justice sprint Benjamin\nLast week testified under oath about a conversation with law for you about the antique desks Benjamin recalled how you got to cast Gilbert desk and then last night when he took the stand he was very specific about that\nI I was I mean there were a lot of amazing piece of testimony but I thought that really stood out because uh it was one Supreme Court justice Benjamin sort of matter of factly on the stand under oath\nThey I had a conversation with him about a casket with that this was one law free was a clerk for the court but Laufer he had been assigned one of these old that's to workout Benjamin recalled saying\nThat's pretty neat you've got an old historic desk a calf Gilbert that use that term and Benjamin recall that the law free acknowledged it and said yeah it's great it's it's really of a historic interest law for yesterday called but he lived a liar he again was on the stand also taking the oath\nAnd when he was asked about Benjamin statement on cross examination Laufer he said I Know this isn't the nice thing to say but either he's a flat outlier or he's was remembering what happened\nTo where you just don't see that one no one Supreme Court justice on the stand under oath calling another Supreme Court justice a liar\nAnd then there is the testimony that came earlier by Kim Ellis\nWho is a former employee the Supreme Court they're justified she felt intimidated when she was called to a meeting with five court officials including law free where she felt like the last time he was trying to get hurt you remembered differently in certain circumstances and that came up as well and la Brea refuted that\nYeah you know what really made the Ellis testimony was she had record of it and and the jurors heard a clip\nSo on our website but her her context really made it Laufer he says you know in the moment he was just asking her if she remembered\nThese earlier questions from him about trying to keep the cost down a so so two different people taking the stand uh and and having a very different recollection of events it's gonna be law for his credibility against almost everyone else and it's going to be there eight which way the ...\nYeah that's that's what it comes down to is that if if you're not selling the nuance of this it's\nThat there's a lot of testimony about what went on a certain instances of what law for ... then up against the law for he was just saying they\nAre lying now what real quick Steve Canterbury the former court administrator who really has a lot of inside knowledge on this he hasn't justified yet but you say he's standing in the wings as a re bought a witness and that could be key to because of the ... because prosecution gets a chance to Colorado witnesses\nThat they could call Canterbury and Kennedy will get a chance to refute everything's in law free says although he'll be cross examined as well if categories called to testify\n[noise] yeah I was I was really puzzled yesterday because we heard that ... may be a witness and then I saw it with my own eyes on a bench outside the courtroom and I couldn't figure out what's going on because of the time I saw him\nThe prosecution had already arrested but when I Walk back and I said before you witness for the defense attorney said no I'm or above all it so\nThat makes a lot more sense to me and I I I actually think it's a really clever move by the prosecution to have free go through his entire story and then bring it one more person\nWho has such intimate knowledge of the court to the point by point a that's not true that is not the way I remember this was not or policy uh it it it's gonna be dramatic testimony to have potentially Canterbury in contrast what law pre has said over the last day and a half\nFinally bread we all know that intimately because we followed it for months but if you're a jar and you don't know a lot about it what do you think George or taking away from what they've heard since last week including a very compelling testimony today that yesterday they will continue today\n[laughter] yeah I've been trying to put myself in that area shoes all along because we and host of West Virginia frankly have heard so much about this hour what's in your poll showed that West Virginia does have a a really do you of the court right now but\nThe jurors were filtered out largely on on good around the how much they were already aware of this case whether they'd already made up their mind so these are supposedly jurors who are coming out this\nFrom a totally fresh perspective\nAnd I I really do wonder\nHearing law for ... for the first time versus all of these other witnesses you talked about uh the travel or the cast Gilbert desk how that is going to stack up lectures I can tell they're interested in watching\nUh they're taking votes so uh anything can go I think if if the jurors truly haven't made up their minds of hearing this this evidence fresh\nHi Freda McIlroy Metra Newsday white correspondent covering the trial of Alan ... free\nTo spend the state's been court justice and use testimony was scheduled to continue this morning but it does it's pretty dramatic because you have a state Supreme Court justice\nShaking the stand and refusing each of these allegations one by one\nSaying well yes he did travel to his home county of Tucker county where he had a home where he's from and where his parents live but that was business related\nIt was not just personally he thought there was a business aspect to it then there's about the cascade of her desk and while a couple of the charges about the casket over desk had been removed ... there is still the charge I Believe that he lied to investigators about uh the gas Gilbert desk which ended up at his house\nAnd then his testimony is white and it was a casket were desk and but there was an that contradicted testimony by former state court justice brand Benjamin who said he had a conversation with law free and offering knew that it was a historic cast Gilbert desk\nSo you have a very different versions of what took place and a lot of this is going to come down to\nOffer his credibility as a witness versus the testimony and the

I'm I'm supporting will do as much as we dance Berkeley would object to bring our public school teachers up to a greater parity with our our peers and with their peers are there in other states and do more to make that profession as attractive as we can and that we've we've talked a lot over the course of the last year about\nWhat we can do both both in terms of pay and other factors to make teaching 'em an attractive profession in our state to feel classrooms I Know\nUh the last number I saw was that we had still in West Virginia about seven hundred and fifty vacancies at the beginning

program use the word guarantee he said I guarantee you know again things can change an election the Democrats could take control of the house or the Senate or both\nA button Carmichael said as Republicans have control of the center city guarantees that the Senate would pass that five percent raise do you want or you as confident is that on the house side\nAll the members of the house have been together since the announcement hobby the members of the Senate payout so I don't know what a recession with the president had but with his colleagues are the members\nThen I I Know that I can tell you that we have interest in a ... and do as much as we can as quickly as we can and how I I certainly would never use the word guarantee about anything that goes through the legislature you certainly know that but I I can certainly tell you will take it seriously\nRoger ... with his he's the house speaker\nRoger does this actually create an issue for a lot of Republicans because one of the things that the geo view wants to do is reduced taxes particularly\nGet rid of that inventory tax so way that in there for me I mean you can't I don't think you can do both maybe you can but will there be a debate among Republicans about whether you want to give teachers a raise or get rid of the inventory tax\nWell I'm confident there will I mean as with every major policy issue how weak the weak the opinions on both sides of the issue will see opinions on both sides of this issue also uh we are a snake lots of priorities lots of needs and our education system is one our tax climate is another\nUh we we certainly have to prioritize how we spend a surplus money that we hope we do have I couldn't tell you that I've been encouraged by the budget projections that we've seen lately if we can then you won't pay square we have been first quarter of Nineteen we looked like we're on track for approximately four hundred and fifty\nTo five hundred million dollar surplus a year and for the fifth year so I'll will we be able to do everything we want to do certainly not we could spend a trillion dollars here and what we know that but uh we we we don't we don't want them in any way\nOr take the issue of our teacher shortages\nOr anything less than seriously that the that the problem\nWith every sector of our economy we know we have to have a skilled workforce we know we have to have people to feel the jobs that are being created in right now it's a problem with woman will take seriously\nOr Roger ... with disease the house speaker Roger let me let me parse this out a little bit because I hear you saying that this is a proposal by the governor that you as the speaker a\nPromise will be taken seriously taken seriously is different than saying yes I support the five percent pay raise and my parsing that out too much or is that fair to say why don't you clarify for me\nWell I'll I'll give you my personal answer I mean I Do personally support that proposal and uh and we'll go for it\nUh if if you're if you're asking me to be that that even that precise I'm certainly happy to do that but uh but we we have not been together as a as a Republican caucus or as members in the house in the governor's now\nSo I've not had an opportunity to gauge really reaction from any any of the members of the house but myself out of the senators have been together they've been unfortunately all in the proceedings and had a chance to see one another and be around the water cooler and talk about the governor's proposal since the announcement or they they've had the benefit of some time that we have not had\nYeah that's fair to say because you haven't had a chance to ... and you may be the house speaker but you still get together with members of your um of your body and caucus so that's that's a fair response Roger ... with us use the new house speaker\nTalking about that now on that surplus because they're the governor's thing it could be four hundred could be five hundred million dollars but I Believe that half of that by law has to go into the rainy day fund\nSo already that if there is a big surplus that limits how much is available whether it's for tax reduction or pay raises or anything right am I right about that\nYes you are right about that helping the let's let's also not lose ... ... ... when we have had them all on our rainy day fund the last couple of budget cycles\nAre not so much this past year but the two years proceeding in in uh in ways and levels that no one really wanted to do so it certainly is proven that we we we do replenish our savings account at every opportunity we have\nDo you think Roger that it is prudent to take a surplus which you don't know frankly we don't know if this is part of a trend up word of a steady economic growth or whether it's a surplus based on\nA surgeon or a coal mining and in construction because the roads that kind of thing\nSo is it proven to take a surplus which may maybe one time and put that toward a baseline budget item like a pay raise increase or a tax reduction or should you wait to see if the economy is steadily growing if I might be a little convoluted there'll be you follow my thinking they're right\nNo I Do and it's perfectly that's a perfectly legitimate question I'll be but I I think I Would respond to it by saying that it's prudent to put our money where our priorities are\nAnd we know that we've we've had an education situation in West Virginia teacher shortages than and teacher salary issues for far too long a we have we have people working part you are far too little\nAnd whether it's whether it's hurting to do it in our burden to do it later it's a question that one could always ask after every budget year so for example how many years must one around a surplus before you can consider it part of a base budget\nUh I I I don't know the answer that question I I Do know that we have a problem and the governor's put forward a proposal to address it and we are going to take it seriously\nRoger finally the critters there's been criticism not necessarily the plan but of the timing\nDemocrats and labor organizations have come out they always do on this program yesterday while four or five weeks before the election you come out with his big teacher pay raise plan to try to ... the criticism of some Republicans especially Senate Republicans over the whole strike teacher pay raises issue\nOr how much of a political decision do you think this was on the part of the governor\n[noise] ah well that's probably a question for the governor healthy but I Would say that that the timing of the un out with the nice thing to coincide with the ... first surplus numbers\nAll right no politics involved I I that's a question for the go off\nAll right Roger ... house speaker Republican from Kenny Rogers good to speak with you thank you for your time\nOkay thanks for having me up or by All right\nYou have the uh you have the governor all in on this they raised plan\nFive percent for everybody and a hundred million dollars to PE IRA and that would cost a total of ... for one year because the ... for two years so I think I might that's about a hundred and Seventy million dollars I think the pay raise when you count in the employer the amount that goes the employee and the amount that the employer has to put in\nA it's about a hundred and twenty million dollars is a number on going with now and and fifty million a year for the next two years on ... and the governor says he wants to use\nWell expected to be a category three storm of the

whatever that does mean\nRight so the way I I don't have a particular solution but I'm going to show up with I'm not a solution bring her and I saw a problem solver so I'm not going to show up and say this is the plan and this is what we have to do\nSo but what I Do believe is that right now West Virginia is struggling and suffering because there are too many people in West Virginia who are incapable of working because they are addicted to drugs or they are on well there are too many people who can't afford healthcare so they struggle with\nChronic diseases that um\nMedicine to treat and this this current scenario that we've been in with people moving in health and not able to fully engaged in our community is hurting us it's turning out people hurting our families it's hurting our school\nSo we need health care that people can you know can get regardless of how much money they have that will help and you know ... ... ... you know kind of get off on a tangent here but I'm part of the issue that we're really seeing is\nThe health care isn't it the situation we have is that businesses they're paying for it\nAnd businesses can't drive because they're really struggling under the incredible weight of insurance costs for their employees or they don't offer insurance to their employees and we've got people working at Wal Mart who are not able to address their health and\nSo do do do you think do you think of single payer system would work\nI think it could but I think that we have a ways to go before we can get there I think you know that is a pretty drastic change and we do have an economy that's set up with multiple businesses that are dependent on the model that we have\nSo I think we need what we need to be doing is moving in the direction of universal coverage and it could be Medicare for all it may eventually be a single payer system but it cannot be that people who are\nUm you know otherwise capable of working at the Tribune eating to West Virginia is a healthy economy in West Virginia are unable to do so because they've got diabetes and that cat get there and you know so and the way we pay for it is you know I pay for health care and my employer pays for health care seven different ways\nI think it's incredibly expensive to have I have ... you know paying a lot of money into the system that's not even covering it very well it's a very inefficient system\nSo if we read that cost throughout you know away from just business um providers but to everyone then we will pay less\nThan we're paying now for better coverage really what we see in countries that have universal health\nCare to ... with is the Democratic candidate for drivers in the first congressional district are taking on garbage McKinley income on education and and again this little bit more of a state issue but you do deal with it or in your platform usually uh the fight starts with incentivizing educators to stay in West Virginia what do you mean by that\nWell ... education is actually very much a state and federal issue more than half of our funding for public schools in West Virginia comes from the federal government and that the the boss that the um education policy for the entire country\nMy concern with the federal government and school is that right now the people who are at the helm are not fans of public education\nAnd if we if there is a pilot program that starts for vouchers my prediction based on what we saw and how historic our teachers strike was and how much attention was drawn to West Virginia for the good work with the teachers dead in fighting for their students than for their school\nWe have a target on our back now and then there was a pilot program for vouchers my prediction is that it's coming here for that will drive are talented teachers straight out of the state and that\nCan why would that any of that is why why would a voucher system ... drive them out of the state\nBecause the schools the public schools will no longer be funded um that they're already Mitt to minimally funded that funding will drop as students are able to take federal dollars out of the public schools to private school system\nThat doesn't necessarily have to actually educate the children that can be sent back to the public schools because there's no accountability and the private schools for actually educating them\nBut gender you know what we have now I mean ... and you're you're an educator you teach that WVU ... the scorecard just came out from WBUR huge problems I mean from the uh ... and we're doing terrible in math were doing bad in English language arts were doing terrible in attendance\nSo uh I think there are a lot of desperate parents out there that will do anything\nTo get their kid or good education and I'm a ...\nLook ... and we've got we've got other data to the top for performing county in the state for learning outcome of the top high with pain counties in the state for salary there is a correlation between supporting our schools with resources and access for students\nLook at ... let me interrupt during an example but there's also a correlation in those counties of are now about ... county is one of of in a community where people tend to value education more and maybe they teach at the university and you know the counties are wealthy and those kinds of things so not to the grass but\nNo you know and I actually agree that's exactly that's a great example if we get our community is healthy and we have a stable economy in the movies the people there are going to be people who who also contribute to successful school\nThis is a Venn diagram right everything overlap everything right together and the schools and in most counties in West Virginia or the hub of the community that is for kids get not only education but they get screwed they get clothing that get emotional support from their teachers because their families are struggling right now\nOur school are the most important employers in most of the counties in West\nVirginia any if we ... about ... where there's a Democrat again for Congress in the first congressional district finally ... and I'm unclear on this and I'm I'm trying to get in touch with them occasionally people do you have any debate scheduled with congressman McKinley\nWe do not but I've been trying for months to get one scheduled and I would welcome any any debate anytime anywhere I really think that the public deserves to hear from the candidates running for the seat\nAnd so far we have been totally unsuccessful at getting the Kennedys camp to agree to a debate on he's saying that he now he's saying get yesterday an article on that he and I were in in the daily at the end here on um the youth camp as he said he would be willing to debate as long as there is there's credible\nThird party willing to hope that and I think that sounds like new hobby so if we can get the\nScheduled I'll be there with all that well I'd be happy\nThe uh we've developed at home because there will be noisy for the debate but I'd\nBe happy I'll bet I agree that there should be a debate and I would be happy to host it so I'll tell you that

T. V. in ... George is on mission is talk on David good morning appreciate your time and it was a busy thanks for coming on\nNo thank you so much I appreciate you having a ... how's it going\nIt's going fine is going better than you guys because you've got a hurricane I Know that that's the that hurt and is west as east of you but I Know you're keeping an eye on what's the latest on Michael\n... [noise] well it sounds right now when there are a hundred and ten miles per hour or so I mean it's teetering on becoming a major hurricane I'm a category three hurricane which is forecast to do none of this strengthening that we've seen today\nIs out of the ordinary I mean the water temperature is down in the Gulf or eighty four eighty five degrees\nAnd it's like rocket fuel to hurricanes um so it will continue to strengthen and we're looking at it to make landfall probably somewhere between tape Panama City or Appalachia cola in the panhandle tomorrow afternoon say about one two o'clock I mean to you know kick\nGive or take an hour and ... so I live in Tampa\nThat's going to keep the storm about two hundred and fifty miles to the west of us so we are you know we're going to have minimal impacts here\nBut the big problem with this storm and I know you probably want to have some questions on the big problem with this storm hobby is is going to be storm surge you remember in Florence was in the storm surge per se it was the fifty inches of rain the Carolinas God\nThis is not that kind of storms this is the kind of storm that's going to bring ten to twelve foot storm surge to the right of wherever comes on shore and\nOne thing you don't probably don't know is that part of Florida and very vulnerable to storm surge that whole Big Bend area and you may be looking at some water going ... miles in really think about that for a second miles inland\nNow it's not the most populated part of Florida I get but there are some beautiful small towns there like steam achey and you know St Joe's in places like that where you could have inundation of these towns\nWell so I mean it's\nWhat kind of a ... what kind of alerts have been issued for that region of the kind of in the in the shoulder there in the band and also for the coast of the um\nThe coastal area round Panama City what kind of warnings have been issued would have people been advised to do in the panhandle\nWho they they issued hurricane warning for the panhandle late yesterday what tripped fantastic usually they listened the they ah issue those about thirty six hours prior to landfall\nMandatory evacuations for this zone AC down here we have the accusation Joe it's like a B C D E N E even be the farthest inland um all of a is completely gone and I'm sure that uh\nYou know parts of I can uh which encompassed Tallahassee and then go a little further toward the west those parts those low lying parts of the benefactor of it as well so let me they've really been on top of it they you know the governor down here has been on television for the past couple of days and laid out which\nUnfortunately for us if you look at the if you look at a map we can stick out you know uh we get hit plenty of times from storms and they they take every one of these seriously especially after Irma last year I can just east of Tampa\nStave also if you look at the projected storm pat ... it it's bad for believe it or not the Carolinas because it's projected to hit landfall and then head north east and if it does that of course it would diminish but it would still bring moisture a rain and winds to areas that were hit by foreigners\nThat is the last place that needs rain I Know it\nWhen you see the path but what's going to happen ... and I will say this once it makes landfall tomorrow afternoon it tomorrow night\nIt's going to start to get picked up by a movie called trough of low pressure and it's going to start to increase it forward speed so the only saving grace would be yes they're going to get more rain and the coastal Carolinas but it won't be there that long it won't have time to\nDump a foot or more rain because it's going to quickly move out and actually go back into the Atlantic after that and then curve all the way back into the Atlantic\nYeah well they've also burgers meteorologist at Fox Thirteen TV station in Tampa and he's keeping an eye on the strongest like
