Congress needs a bipartisan bipartisan solution to Medicare Medicaid and Social Security which it does however it came at a time in this campaign where are some Democrats are using that saying see we told you Republicans really want to cut\nOr the safety net and I don't I really don't think that's what McConnell said frankly except the tough decisions have to be made in Congress has shied away from making them but that plays right into mansions a strike\nBecause mansion has talked about that lawsuit that Patrick Morrisey I joined with a challenging Obamacare and so mansion can now go out and say see the Republican leaders do want to cut your safety net\nAnd it's a it creates another problem for Mars the one of the thing he has to explain in the last two weeks of the campaign that was in political get out of the author on tomorrow so if you saw that story and all but that's a problem I interrupted\nAnd things change in a hurry and in politics you know the conversation mention was having to have was about his Kavanaugh vote which was a appeared difficult for him to make one way or another and now we've already moved on to a different topic a courtesy of\nMitch McConnell campaign gold [laughter] yeah how political described it there was another national story over the weekend in the hills which is you know similar to Politico mansion wrestles with progressive backlash in West Virginia those came out about the same time so different views of\nThe political landscape and how they may be affecting the mansion campaign\nLet's talk about your weekends story concerning amendment one and this is the amendment\nThat says it would be would have ... a man to West Virginia ... state constitution to say that there's nothing in the constitution that requires\nA West Virginia taxpayers to pay for abortions for poor women but as I've talked about and written about and you wrote about extensively extensively over the weekend there is not universal agreement by those for and against as amendment as to what the amendment actually says\nWell there's there's absolutely not and as as you pointed out nodded to this is a undercurrent that's been going through West Virginia's conversation about abortion for a quarter century at this point\nBut what is this going to do I mean the wording the there's not a lot of ... going to be added into the constitution nothing in this constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion\nOr the first step would seem to to be that it would notify the pain of pinto decision which dealt with\nA weather Medicaid money state Medicaid money should pay for abortions for poor women are so so there are two aspects of that conversation one is conservatives saying we'll taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for abortions\nAre but the other side taking what I think it's an interesting position to say that it is government overreach to disqualify those who can't afford abortions from getting them to say the government should not be involved in that way\nAnd then another overriding question is that language added to the constitution a sure the first step may be notifying the pain of pinto decision but is the language so broad that it opens up a whole series of things that may happen in state law that that maybe are unforeseen\n... right and then that first part of the sentence nothing in this constitution secure to protect a right to abortion and you can look at the state constitution and I think that the\n... you could read it and say to their frankly is nothing in the state constitution is specifically first refers to apportion Margaret workman's saw it differently and he said there is cost there is a language in the constitution that really\nSets the groundwork for a a protecting a woman's right to choose and frankly even for state funding\nTo pay for abortions for poor women as part of of healthcare but there are there are those that look that language and say wait a minute this this light go even farther concerning abortion and ... and make it impossible a potentially\nFor a woman to have an abortion\nOr even though it is the all the land in roe v Wade or or\nOr perhaps difficult uh for the state or to pay for abortion or if there's a case of rape and incest or the mother's life so there is a lot of there are a lot of questions have come up about that first part of that to a vet amendment agreed\nYeah and the Senate the west Virginia Senate based this wording on what Tennessee had passed into law or just a couple of years prior but the Tennessee\nA constitutional amendment actually included that other language about uh the life of the mother incest rape and and for whatever reason the west Virginia legislature decided to remove that language\nOr some legislators said well it ought to be in there but uh in any case it's it is what it is it's it's just very few words that the voters will be deciding but could there be ramifications beyond what is immediately intended\nMuch Carmichael who support system in ... says that if this amendment passes his interpretation is if this amendment passes it means that the state\nOr that there's nothing in the constitution that require the states will pay for abortion for poor woman and you would actually refer back to\nThe Nineteen Ninety three law which pan of Penn so essentially nullified and that all did provide exemptions\nFor is that the states knocking to pay for abortions but did provide exemptions were cases of rape incest or the mother's life that his view of it that you would go back to that Ninety three off and your researching of your story did you find that that's what most people believe or is there are certainly about that as well\nYeah I I didn't get a a real clear answer on that and there were different answers depending on who you talk to that that law is still in state code but\nIt it's been so many years now and we moved on in a variety of ways in the age age are is operating under the assumption that that law is not in effect a delegate Kayla Kissinger a Republican from Fayette County\nOffered a bill last last session that that essentially reflected the law [noise] ah say Medicaid should not pay for abortions except for\nA ... instances of the ones we talked about a life or the mother rape incest so her passengers proposed bill uh was was essentially the same as what was overturned passengers says that if she was reelected and if\nThis amendment goes into effect she's going to offer it again which says to me that it's no no certain see that you just go back to the prior law\nUnderstand red Mac when he has a big piece on that over the weekend a very thorough explanation evident coming up later in the program Brad there's actually some confusion over how you vote yes no for or against\n... yeah just what we need yeah so what's\n\n\n... today's broke represented in part by my oven we're delivering better health for better West Virginia\nIsn't their job it's our mission later this half hour or more on a minute one from the pro choice side obviously they are against amendment one and will they be printed out a little bit later on but right now so vaping vaping is increasingly popular in vaping you've seen it around maybe you do it\nYou inhale the vapor that's created from a quick with the heat it up inside a device now this has been around for about ten years but it's become increasingly popular but now there hadn't been a lot of research into now but now there are there's a lot of research being done to find out well is is it really a safe alternative\nTo smoking it's been built that way for many and also suggested helps people get off\nOf a actual tobacco WVU school of medicine associate professor Dr Mark ... is done research on this and joins us on veterans chocolates professor good morning how are you sir sorry doctor\nAh I'm good thank you for having me this morning thank you for coming on is vaping dangerous\nSo this is a this is the question everyone asks and of course the problem with asking that question right now is vaping are hasn't been around long enough for us to really know what the long term consequences are ... are you know I I think maybe the first place to start would be why do people say it's safe\nAnd and there's two primary reasons or one is because it is true that uh the the vapor clouds that people are breathing in have fewer number of total toxic and\nCompared to cigarette smoke so people automatically assume that that means the vaping is going to be less toxic to them and the second is and this is a a false perception is at that\nCloud as water vapor is NATO it's not that clouds not water vapor at all I mean water vapor is what you see when you boil a pot of water on your stove and you see that steam coming off of\nA off of the the boiling water so what is it ... and this is not what you see from the from the ... you see the dance white cloud\nIt's essentially an oil it's composed of ... glycol and vegetable glycerin and and you just got to pick a ratio they could do all pro ... glycol or they can do just vegetable best one but usually it's a ratio of it to him and this is actually an oil\n... and and so what\nWe've been studying is what are the effects of inhaling that this cloud and what have you found\nWell the the most\nStriking finding for us is that when when we look at vascular responses\nHow the blood vessels behave in response to east cigarette vapor compared to cigarettes\nWere actually finding no different than a ... there's an equal amount of impairment that we see with the end up feeling yourself but the cells that line the blood vessels\nAnd how they respond to various stimuli they're equally impaired whether whether I in in our case we're having to use animal models so we can do long term studies and and when we compare the animals that are have smoke cigarettes been exposed to cigarette smoke ... uh compared to those that have vape\nA in a similar way we're finding that the impairment in blood vessel function is really not different\nNow Dr that now we're talking about the impairment and and now we need degrees I mean there can be impairment that is mine are there can be an impairment that is extremely significant right so can you define that further\nWell that's hard to define because people have different levels of exposure so you know I think the best compare him at the best comparable unit that we can make as a probably to cigarette smoking and we know that you know with cigarette smoking it's not just the lungs that we worry about the lungs\nObviously are are a major problem in the in the context of smoking and and you get ... you get the emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but that's not the only complication that occurs from cigarette smoking and so\nThe fact that we're seeing that people that they have the same level of impairment and at ... in there but they're putting other\nVessel their their arteries are and how those arteries respond to a dial eating when you need more blood flow to your organs or or when they constrict when you need to ... blood away from a part for the body\nBut these are all normal control mechanisms that when they're abnormal it sets the foundation for cardiovascular disease for stroke or heart attacks or at those girls is things that people will be familiar with so\nYou know it's going to be different for everyone just like smoking is different for everyone everyone's got a story of you know maybe how their uncle or the grandfather smoked for forty or fifty years and never had any trouble but this is not true for the vast majority of\nOf the public ... let me go back that we're finding\nThat vaping as producing the same degree whatever degree that is um in our case we're actually using a relatively mild exposure of the of the vape and finding that it's just as bad as as someone who's been smoking for that same period of time\nWe're talking with Doug professor Dr Martin overt\nWVU school of medicine on their research on vaping and doctor I Know you're focused in on that and you probably have not on this but I was doing my own research this morning and uh other research has shown to\nThat that people who've eight and ... and this has been billed as an alternative to smoking it's better than cigarettes is part of the pitch and some people believe that it is so when does this help them get off the rats are not smoke cigarettes\nBut that if if a young person starts vaping ... they are more inclined than to actually smoke cigarettes again that might not be part of your research but that is out there\nYet and I'm familiar with ... it's not it is you're correct in that it's not my primary every research but I Am familiar with the with the literature there and you know this is\nOne of the reasons why I'm I'm really interested in the field is it's not to take something away from adults that want to try you know a different product or something new but it's the fact that\nUm smoking has been on the decline for our youth are middle school and high school students and as as of now you said or have become have replaced all forms of tobacco use among the high school and middle school students\nAnd there's a huge concern there because the message is you know they're saying the methods that getting is that this is safe and most of them are using nicotine in in their devices and so this is just becoming another nicotine dependents product\nAnd the reality is for someone who's in their forties or fifties or sixties trying to use this to quit smoking\nYou know they may not realize that the harm that will take twenty to Thirty years to develop but our young kids will go to and it will be difficult for them to nicotine and stuff you know amongst the top five most addictive substances that we know\nAnd so it it just you know but the same reasons of smoking is difficult to quit vaping that's going to pose the same problems for this generation if if we don't give them the right information early on\nGot a WVU school of medicine associate professor Dr Marc overt on vaping professor appreciates coming on thanks for the insight thank you sir\nAlright researcher by or it\nWill take a break and come back when we come back we're going to get back to amend that one and we're

the fund I mean if I think the essence of the issue is whether or not there should be state funding for abortion I Do agree that the language is confusing that that that you could look at that and go wait a minute now what what are you exactly ... and I think the I think the language should have been different\nOnly gets added to the confusion of this frankly\nAnd and now you have your interpret I mean you have the opponents interpretation you have the supporters interpretation so I'm\nWell and they they may have a shot themselves in the foot by making it so broad because people are accented on

Saturday ah commit to WVU is that Bob Huggins biggest recruit ever\nEver ever ever yeah uh well here here's my deal on there I mean on paper you can make a case of his greatest recruit ever was kind of art\nA national player here did he have the accolades\nA shoe boy no but it's you know it's it's not necessarily two parts to this deal it's one of the the\nProjection of what the kids could be coming up the actuality of what they do become so I Would say he certainly in the top\nThree or four kids but he's probably ever why aren't at 'em and now the rest remains to be seen how much he develops\nWhy is there's so much buzz on Oscar shoe boy\nWell because he's a kid happy that much like ... is still very very young in his development and now just a few years into it\nOr has the ability to play the game addict extremely high level\nHe goes into the national competitions this summer and against the best of the best and he played um almost every one they came across some ... why his stock rose so quickly all of a sudden he's going up against these guys have these great reputations and the people knew all about and all the here comes this kid and they go like\nWhich second was this guy so as a result uh his were were courting ranking I'm short and he became the uh you know he became the guy that a lot of schools model obviously including Kentucky Kentucky Illinois and Baylor and in the end West Virginia wins because I think in the end of ...\nLike in business relationships oftentimes all the most important thing in West Virginia ... relationship with him um pretty much when he first arrived\nBack in mountain mission that's won West Virginia was recruiting form about near magic bender uh they they saw him then uh then he goes up and plays at sags his high school so there's been this long standing relationship and as a result West Virginia and yet when\nAnd he's from originally Congo right Congo yeah he's from the Congo yeah\nThis is what she said I feel like I'm the most comfortable around coach Huggins compared to any of the coaches that we're recruiting me\nHe said that he was going to treat me like his son and pushed me every day he's always said I was his only guy and that he wanted and I was just priority they'll Huggins to me is an acquired taste I mean he so coaches old school he gets after you uh maybe as hard as any coach in the country and not have\nBuy into it and when they buy into it West Virginia tends to be successful if they don't they don't last long so I'm I don't know what I'm going with that exactly except that except that plane for hogs is probably different than being recruited by hoax why don't you want to do more work on that\nI'll help you with the yeah thank you\nUm so I don't think you need to be worried about that I'm In other words is he going to come here and go oh my gosh this is different now happy that kids bent here so much over the last couple of years I mean it was almost like he was already on the team\nI mean constantly he has been here in the summer um teams that play down here he's been in camps I've watched them play\nAh he's seen everything he's seen he's seen Bob happy scene Bob coaching he seen Bob upset\nSo no this was going to be no different and I think that's what's kind of rally I tell you the huge piece to all of this\n... who obviously has a great relationship with him and you know he told them what it was going to be and what was going to be like and I mean that is you know we often times the reason we go to Amazon and we buy stuff off of the Amazon reviews\nIs because we look at the review and we see what the other people are saying well here's a person in fact this particular case a man had first hand experience with hogs and he said here here's what he's done for me\nYou know I'm chances are I'm gone after this\nYear monger transition you come in this could be you and I think the kids have been here before he sees what the crowd like he sees with the teams like you see what you see how safe place to go I Want to do that that's why I felt comfortable\nSix eight to thirty so he's a four\nBy four or five yeah he's a four or five the biggest thing about a hobby is his motor you hear that all the time\nHe doesn't stop he doesn't stop moving and a lotta times you have to push these guys to teach them how to play hard all the time you don't have to teach kids how to play hard all the time he goes and he goes and he goes I saw him here this summer uh there's plenty to direct center\nAnd he took a rebound middle Elaine\nAnd he just straight down the floor past guard's past for words on the way and just went down to dumped it and you guys don't do that guys just don't do that that size so uh you know great great upside but obviously a hobby um you know there's a lot of work to to be done but he seems to me the reason I'm excited about it is\nEvery indication is every indicator says\nExtremely coach Chabot wants to get better has all the physical attributes there is no hanging you know well he has to do this or you have to do that or he's got the situation or retail at this got though hanging chads on this kid and and I think that's why everyone is very excited that he's going to be able to come in and it just fit in immediately\nBecause typically frankly west Virginian does not get five star recruits you know\nYou know you don't that's not the culture of the program that's not um you know at the same time but you take a look look at some of the kids that have that highly acquired\nA you know that many banks I'm Kevin Jones right um you know a lot of those guys you can have it it's a heck of a head start it's nice to get them necessarily mean you have to have to have success but they're nice to have and so certainly you get you get a couple of these guys now um that are in the program fold right now you know McCabe\nRight you know pretty highly ranked for normal is and the uh Matthews highly ranked so you're going to have some of these guys around here\nCulver they're calling for he's a newcomer you know again these guys are in that top two hundred type thing that's good those are great starting point then you coach I'm up in the future future seemed to be very bright\n[noise] you have to put them on your chart or have you learned to spell shoe boy [laughter]\nNo I have to check I check every time helped me one that I won't spell I'll just give you an ethically no I just I just know I won't even put anything I just I just look at it a Ghost Ship way you don't need anything\nSomeone said that we should call them Mr T. because his name does start with the tea\nOr not crazy about that no\nNo I did but you don't have because he is a nickname comes up what form organically Mr T. is very very old school old school yeah I did I mean it's too old but it just it's a great name I mean in broadcasting when you call his name on the issue boy I Love it\nYou know I like it I like it a lot she boy yeah two syllable and yeah it's good\nWeather and like you smell it she S. H. I. E. B. W. E. she yeah she was a ... a real quick before I let you go and talk more about it later this week I went down ... percent just pressure this we could just today or tomorrow tomorrow today\nBecause uh coming up here at noon okay and I would think he's anxious to talk about something other than Iowa State you can talk about bad nobody understood yeah\nI think so I got back into it this weekend a boy I Hope you know we need to talk about something besides Iowa State my goodness that was bad uh started putting numbers together and to stick together with player did this all a player to that and I mean it's just wow that was a bad bad situation I think everyone involved needs to get another game\nHere and they better be ready to go because Baylor and the last game against taxes shut up the good ones out the second half that are you ready they're all Getty um they they're looking for that signature when you better be ready to go\nYeah they did they ... they could have won that Texas game in fact when their game or they did shut decks of sex and the second half\nI was looking at their stats last night they were to be pretty fundamentally solid met rule was a a is a a good coach did you see I don't know where you word and talking to this weekend did you see the Purdue on his day game I mean how would I Would argue that that was that was a bigger that\nThat's a bigger deal than West Virginia losing Iowa State I mean that was a ... I was a worse off a little higher state then West Virginia's loss was Iowa State\nYeah I guess yeah I think so yeah for a team that's supposed to be a national championship contender I mean it wasn't only got beat I mean the last couple of scores\nThan I Do ... absolutely like hey come on over here let me just rub your face oh yeah um that was I mean that was the kid with the cancer and yet or either Tyler I mean\nWhat a what a perfect perfect boiler makers moment I mean I think I'll go down in their history forever\nAbsolutely absolutely Tony greedy play by play announcer for the mound you're saying stony can happen and when we come back\nI Want soup this may seem like a small thing but I Want to I Want to clarify it so you know when you go to vote because you might be a little bit surprised and I know I sometimes I take these things for granted like well certainly you would know this understand this well maybe not but it has to do", "year": "2018", "show_name": "MetroNews TalkLine", "city": "Charleston", "day": "22"}
