justice from office are already already governmental official who is being who who's in the impeachment process so that two thirds number would be\nA a a high mark to reach the other option may be a keep justice Walker an office and ensure her which would be sort of a I have noticed a formal disapproval\nWere you able to get any read on the room you've covered trials I'm covered trials you sit there and you kind of watch the jury wash the body language able to get any kind of a a read on the room as senators took in his testimony\n[noise] only that they were taking it very seriously ... they I I could tell\nThe way we're situated is right behind the ... and so you can see everybody and and they were clearly listening they were looking up or the exhibits on their on their laptops\nAre they the jurors had the opportunity to submit written questions the judge or they fully took advantage of that or the judge got a lot of questions that he'd been read aloud to the witnesses\nSo so

impeachment proceedings you were governor justices press conference or want to hear from the governor of some clips from the governor coming up in just a little bit um but what was the highlights or if you can pick just one highlight what was the highlight of the governors message this morning\nAnd operated on two levels are one was this breaking news that I I Know ... there's going to talk about uh dedicating a hundred million dollars to PA the governor fuel there's the flexibility to do that based on recent budgetary trends are announcing yesterday that that there was another monthly budget surplus\nAbove estimate so a hundred thousand dollars hundred billion dollars a to shore up PA which has been has been a lingering\nPractical and political issue in West Virginia also the governor promising a five percent pay raise in the next legislative session for public employees um\n[laughter] but the timing of it all is pretty interesting with the election out front I think the governor is going to get immediate pushback from the other party about well if the money's there let's go into special session and do it now give us the bang for your book at this moment instead of waiting I think is what he's going to hear\nBut the other under current that I was I was alluding to a few moments ago is a you know the part of the nature of it it began with\nA sort of a highlight video that was played pretty loudly almost like a campaign video and what was billed as a press conference a regarding where he stands with its budget a book the governor and in many of his political allies depicted in that video\nA sort of rock and roll music behind it and the governor saying Republican Republican Republican over and over and over and and my saying that it's not to criticize Republicans\nMerely to say that these news conferences this one in particular have stood out for their part of the nature\nYeah it was ... I I thought somebody who's going to come running out of the tunnel is kind of like a pre game hide video brand\nYeah is that we're we're in for from now on now or you know as I wrote a story over the weekend the governor has added a lot of muscle to his\nCommunications team particularly in the area of people with video skills and and so what we're seeing maybe an example of what's to come\nBrad Will let you get back in the Senate chambers we appreciate it we'll check in the next hour for an update as closing a closing statements get underway there in Beth walkers impeachment trial thanks brand\nThey are not Brad back when you mentioned in statewide correspondence and the impeachment trial of justice Beth locker getting ready to wrap up at the Capitol\nAnd I've\nI've talked about this heat on Morgantown a and the local show on W.

actions were they illegal probably not but can you teach a Supreme Court justice\nFor doing something that you don't like now that they had the authority to do now do you like that she's been a ... whatever the number was over a hundred thousand dollars in an office renovation or is having these expensive lunches\nNo don't like it but was it the legal\nProbably not doesn't look like it does that excuse the actions [noise] no but is that an impeachable offense and two thirds of is a high threshold to hit their brand medically any mentioned that two thirds of the high threshold to get to\nGot

I Would think we get his decision sometime today\nI'm Brad said I guess we're still all working our way through the impeachment process anyway ... brand was you know I'm not sure how quite deliberations work but yeah yeah I'm with you I I think this has got to be a speedy resolution to this trial at least\nI guess it all comes down to a new brand we're talking about this she admitted to doing things is that enough to remove him from office you know her her argument is it's not\nI don't know that she's done anything criminal Jeff ... can you remove somebody for not being a good steward of taxpayer money and let me tell you if you're going to lose somebody from office for not being good stewards of taxpayer money you might want to watch out for the rest of Charleston there so yeah it you might not like what she riot but is that a removal of fence\nYeah I don't know I don't know and I'm Glad I don't have to decide\nI Know it's good it we'll see how long deliberations will go should be very interesting\nTo hear All right uh yeah morning getting back to governor justice uh yesterday late yesterday the\nGovernor's office came out with new revenue numbers\nI didn't ... didn't hold a news conference just came out with a release saying you know every month they gauge where revenues are tax collection is basically and how they're going against the estimated tax collections because then that's what the next budget is based on and they continue to exceed estimates so after the first three months of this fiscal year\nUh July August September the state of the head of where it thought it would be by more than one hundred and Ninety million dollars\nWhich is significant the justice administration says that's a record for the first three months of a fiscal year to be that far ahead of estimates\nSo and the state has and the last several months shown you know I'm doing better with a with a growing economy are and so the three areas that have performed best our personal income tax\nWhat we all pay a consumer sales tax what we buy and corporate income tax so all those three areas ah or doing well ... but those first three that I mentioned are really the drivers to this so today the governor makes an announcement\nAh with surrounded by Republican lawmakers and a two significant things he pledged monetary early\nOne hundred million dollars to the a permanent fix toward for PIX but let's hear what he said about that here's the governor\nWe are announcing but we're going to dedicate a hundred million dollars today a hundred million dollars so a long term solution of fixing the guy and save lives and you're in the future\nNow we know this is one of those things a day that um [noise] uh that's been part of a you know the teachers strike earlier this year is a permanent fixture PE I all the things that have happened and the ... task force continues to work on as\nA and the governor says this isn't supplanting what they're doing but he says he's going to make one hundred million dollars available to any permanent fix\nSo that was my next question Jeff was this also news to the ... task force which has held all of these meetings is working toward that goal they have any idea this was coming\nI don't know if they did I don't know what they've known they may have heard about it or you know ... already not in bad shape quite honestly because they had a good year last year with her to cheat them say that and so\nHave a surplus and so this will be an additional surplus um the governor said at one point you know they don't need it so to speak but then this will help into the future\nSo I think if you give the PI task force you know additional one hundred million dollars and that can that can you know help help them with the decisions they need to make a and a recommendation for the government continues to talk about maybe privatization and some other things that we're going to that process still has to play its way out\nThen he made an announcement about uh about the teacher pay raises and here's we said about that\nThat we're going in the next session these people are committing I'm committing ... all of us are committing to an additional five percent pay raise for the teachers\nAt all state employs\nAll right so that's a pretty significant announcement there yeah yeah yeah [laughter]\nPretty soon we ever get from the governor that and this is again I we talked about this earlier today this is um you're talking about business based building I mean it's not just one time money I mean you talk about raising and hobbies talked about this a lot over the years\nFive percent and and I don't have the exact numbers in front of me but that's not cheap you include all state workers so if this were come about\nThat would be a temper cent raise for teachers over two years ah they got the five percent after lawmakers passed that are in the days after the strike um and so now the um [noise] so now he's proposing any any says all of us and we're talking about he's talking about the Republicans ... surrounded him\nHe had a dinner with him last night here in Charleston and then they come together and they make this announcement today now of course that would have to go through all the budget process and everything during next year's session but if you got the governor who's going to propose to budget and you got a we don't know how the election is going to end but you have majorities in both the house and Senate there's probably a pretty good bet that that's going to happen\nJeff I'm going to go out on a limb here\nAnd get the timing of this announcement with the mid term elections well what are we about a month away yeah not a coincidence on the timing of this announcement Brad Mac Lenny alluded to this\nThe word Republican was used a lot there was a kind of almost like a campaign ... video yeah that was played so uh that under current also there today oh yeah that are maybe it wasn't an undercurrent maybe when I was like\nNo no that was definite that that was a definite theme and and and we got to cut that the kind of proves that here we go the governor\nBottom line is delivering where we are supposedly all believe in education we think we should invest in education we think as we do that and we're doing it right now we're putting our uh our money where our mouth is period Perrier\nAnd he yeah so who is delivering he says the Republicans aren't delivering\n[noise] All right we can ah of course get more details or what the website\nYeah we are working we got a little just a little bit of a story up and you can see the go and you can still watch what the governor said these were putting together a longer story in at some point today we don't get the reaction of the teachers' unions see what they have to say about this um [noise] so uh we'll see what uh we'll see what happens as we are as we get through this\nAlright joke I Try to do work too hard today

it\n\nYeah yeah there's definitely a cost definitely cost associated there are let me see this is a long way away and hard to read Jason tweaks\nJustin anecdotes oh boy should read this at a time but that entire Capitol building wind built was considered unreasonably fancy inexpensive at the time\nBut the money was spent anyway in part as a status symbol to help offset West Virginians reputation as a poor state so technically there is precedent you know I I think you bring up something interesting there Jason if you're the state Supreme Court\nI mean you don't want ... there is an image you need to exhibit right there is a perception you need to have so somebody walks into your office I mean you don't want\nYou know a Nineteen Ninety nine share from you know down the road if it's a big

what you're saying Jason\nBut where's the line there who\nWho's to say well that's your it's too expensive that okay at thirty thousand dollar couch might be a little more a little too ... but\nI I see what you're saying there eight hundred seven six five talking hundreds seven six five eight to five five will take a couple of calls Mike in Charleston wants to weigh in the morning Mike good morning I'm\nA first first with a justice Walker\nI don't think she should be patient makes you should get a slap on the roads basically a reprimand cause and she didn't ask them some money but I don't think she was doing and what the intent of doing something illegal wrong but I Do have a question I don't know it's been brought up in the past or not\nBut and I know that you can't teach kids to bury\nBut can't very well the administrator basically run in the office the the the\nWhole thing for the for the justices so why\nWhy did he ... he was fired bring up all the poor spending habits et cetera other justices why did you call Kenny bats there why didn't he don't\nWhy we're still in addition that he was there and can have not be held accountable does he have to okay or do the groundwork except for all this also\nYou know Mike I I don't have an answer to that question but I Know it's a question\nA lot of people have asked\nWish I had a better answer my pre she had to call eight hundred seven six five talk and under seven six five eight to five five Brenda what's your thoughts on justice Walker\nHello Brenda I hello [laughter] Hi I'm\nGood I think that she should not be impeached none of that like what she did ...\nAt all but I'm sixty six just for a little background and people will probably recognize me because I'm outspoken although I didn't want that\nBack it was a pervasive additives in West Virginia for a long time in that I did not see when I worked in the federal court system but I Would see people rotting gather\nUp to ... meetings from the courthouse when I worked in the courthouse and each\nOf them turning in mileage my ex husband was a worked for the steak and lots of comedy was given free meals for meals for a dollar that caused them where he worked and what did\nI what educators administrators\nRotting together to a meeting at various places and they charging mileage it was just a pervasive attitude in the state it does make it right but I don't think it's an impeachable offense unless we're going to sift through every business every\nPlace that represents says seven hold everyone accountable this just shake every one that but not 'til they did the right thing from now on because they're afraid of being caught the shape that that's a reason to keep people from stealing from taxpayers\nBut it's it works it's good enough I don't think she should be able to take just because we don't like what she did ...\nBrenda I appreciate the call thank you very much for weighing in eight hundred seven six five talk eight hundred seven six

nothing eight hundred seven six five eight to five five eight hundred seven six five talk let me know how you would vote at this point me personally\nI'd have a tough time pulling the trigger to remove an elected official from office with this one article for basically spending money the way I don't like it or basically not liking the way that she spent the taxpayers money or they have a tough time pressing\nThe button on that what do you think eight hundred seven six five talk eight hundred seven six five eight to five five wheel in Morgantown wants to weigh in good morning will\nBe

there a little queen worked in there today in Queens or the stone age where yes yes\nWe are a halfway through most teams have you ever played ... at least five games most teams just played six games to this point in the season Joe what do we definitely know for certain at this point in the high school football season\nThat Martin's Bergen wheeling central are still is heavy favorites as you can possibly get and I think everybody's looking forward to fair a monsignor meeting Bluefield yet I mean in a\nWay to go out on that limb Joe [laughter] you say what do we know and that was you know um\nI mean those teams have been really as dominant as you can imagine you know there there's a chance Martin's bird gets tested against a surrender Virginia this Friday night at ... does a team that usually play them very well and it's a strong team out of Virginia\nA you know but we keep waiting for somebody pops year teams to really get tested and and and it hasn't happened\n[noise] what do we think we know a halfway through the season\nI think we know that spring valley is probably established itself as with all due respect to hunting that it was also sitting as a as an undefeated team as well as spring valley and some pretty strong football or to go in the capital and and slow down the Hoover off and they did\nFriday night and a Twenty one to Thirteen factory I think we know that spring valley is probably a team that is the top contender or to Martin sparks crowd in\nI think we know the poker in class ... is pretty good to see them a Saturday their game against this into\nA school at thirty four points in the second quarter and was able to play some pretty good defense on the Indians and the second half to post a fortune ... victory I started out for no money and some opponents at work topped your team last two weeks that maybe the central\nBy Eighteen points and then sister do by twenty so I think we know that poker is probably in the next year behind paramount in your Bluefield went to Bridgeport within Nicholas counties with some of the other top teams in class of a way that makes him well\nAll right Joe now here's the question what haven't we figured out yet or what are we still trying to figure out halfway through the year\nI think there's a couple of teams in class triple A. that we're not really certain exactly what they are we've seen heart imposed a couple of good victories but then they all the ...\nAnd then uh on friday there now train three ... a lot of cheating that inquest triple A. R. N. G. W. partners or in the mix a obviously there are different team of bread strange now with the wind up so I think there's a lot of uncertainty\nAs to the middle of the pack in class trip boy who were the teams that could end up being six seven eight and our first round home games or the team's maple high now but maybe just a strong so I think ... is going to be interesting maybe in about three or four weeks I don't really start to get a good look at how all the play out that there's things that don't break down\nYour lives glass AAA and from my observations it's Martin's burg and there's a gap and you know you can ... spring valley Huntington you I think you can put capital in that group of maybe three or four teams\nAnd then there's another ... back to the rest of the pack which is going to be five three probably twelve or Thirteen there in the playoffs meetings and then I think you're fourteen Fifteen sixteen seeds probably are a little bit of a gap there in Tripoli So it's going to be a fun fun or can you believe there's only what five weeks left in the season though\nYeah it it's amazing how quickly this all the high school sports seasons this goes the quickest without question 'cause it's better to let the waste time you've got the regular season all wrapped up in a will be will be talking for hours and five lakes\n[noise] hey by the way you mentioned Britain strange from
