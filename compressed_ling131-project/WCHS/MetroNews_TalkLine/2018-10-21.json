{"month": "10", "state": "WV", "station": "WCHS", "content": "That came to pass after these things that Joseph was told and did your father is sick so he knows\nI'm getting ... quit in the in this county\nAnd he took with him his two sons monastic on that for him and Jacob was told look your son Joseph is coming to you and Israel strengthen himself and set up on the bed and Jacob Senate Joe's of God God Almighty appeared to me at laws and the land of pain and bless me\nAnd it goes down and talks about this blessing and he he's he's bringing Joseph is bringing his sons so that Jake it might speak a blessing over his sons\nAnd you can read that in the text and I just want to call out what he did not get into specifics of it just yet but you are called to be a blessing to the generations that following you\nAnd he begins if you just kinda got a little flavor over there he can he basically gives his life story he gives his testimony here's what happened got appeared to me and they see tell us about God's work in his life if you will be a blessing to your children your grandchildren great grandchildren\nMake sure they know your story of face\nThat will do a couple of things one that it might be an influence in their lives that they will be people of faith but secondly some day\nSomeone's going to have to not come\nVisit the nursing home they're gonna come visit to the funeral home and what they should hear from you bringing in their ears his dad and mom grandma grandpa whoever it is I heard from their own lives that they were a believer in Jesus Christ and they had a sure is that when this they come they were going to step into the presence of God\nThat the assurance that's going to bring to your family is a measurable and many of us have had occasions where we've had loved ones where we didn't have that assurance we did know\nAnd that and you don't want to ever leave your family in that situation we do it by being prepared and we do it but by sharing that and sharing your story about how God has been faithful to where you started and where you are\nAnd seeing that continue in between the two that God has blessed in God has given and God has provided a God has done great things that don't be afraid about sharing some of the defeats in the struggles of the difficulties in life because that's where God's stepped in and sustained you in spite of the confusion in spite of the heartache and heartbreak sometimes\nBecause they're so be it be that blessing to your children\nThen be a testimony of finishing well going down and she after forty eight if you will see move over to forty nine so excuse me\nForty nine versus twenty nine forty nine twenty nine were very near the end of Jacob story\nResponding on any charge them this is Jacob speaking and said to them I Am to be gathered to my people bury me with my father's in the cave that is in the field of ...\nHe knows his time as a death is approaching but notice what he says look at that phrase I to be gathered to my people\nIn a wonderful thing to say it's not on dying and not leaving everything I'm leaving everything a little behind that life's over no I'm going to my people that have gone on before my\nThe people say I'm being gathered to be with them it's a wonderful positive thing by the way\nI just would say this very briefly but very directly are you ready to be gathered to hear people uh I I don't wish ill on any of us I Hope we all live at least to be a hundred and twenty or a hundred and thirty would that be nice I'm trying to be generous here\nBut you know what they're they're they're there is a date upon which we will not exist on this planet any any longer and here's what God has done for us he sent a son to be or saber down across that through faith in that finished work we're prepared to step into God's presence and be gathered to our people\nHere this morning and you've never made that decision or maybe you say I don't really get what that's about but\nThat that ... something in my heart would love to have a conversation did say that to me one of our pastors may become with the Christian friend this morning it what does that mean I Want to be ready tell me what that means it will be glad to share with you how you can become a follower of Christ you face in Jesus that invitations open to you\nAnd noticed one more testimony to step sees me this is a ... a test my finishing well okay now one more\nBe proactive in making your wishes known what he says and thirty he's already said bury me in this field of effort on his side in verse thirty in the cave which is in the field of my fellow [noise]\nWhich is before mom right in the land of pain which Abraham bought in the field of effort on the hit Titus the possession for burial place there they buried ... wife and they buried Isaac and Rebecca his wife and were buried\nLeah the field of the cave is there were purchased from the sons of half\nHe says here's the okay [laughter] it's like here's all the details you need\nAnd it's just something less than about that let your family know what it is you want after you're going to let you make the say don't don't leave that to them you know if you if you're going to leave leave some money behind you decide who gets what and how that works\nThe other alternative is like the guy who left will that said I being of sound mind and body spin at all\nThat that's one option\nBut make that choice have a we'll have a living will have a power of attorney all those those documents and things that will help your family and let them know what your wishes are where are you want to be buried where are you how you what you want to and it's sometimes difficult thing for family we don't know what dad or mom or grandma or grandpa wanted will tell them he\nDid and it's a way of communicating not just the practicality\nExpressing faith because notice he mentions all these people who are already buried in this cave and he's already said I'm going to be gathered to my people that's the people you're talking about right there even in even in preparation is an opportunity to be that'd be a statement of face\nAn attitude is the ... is everything for those who the caregivers an attitude of care for the care receivers an attitude of cooperation and maybe we do what God causes to do\nWith the assurance that he will give us the strike\nTo sustain this through it all\nYou've been listening to the radio broadcast of mount calvary Baptist church in Charleston Mt calvary Baptist church is located at Fifteen ... avenue in

is a spiritual thing this is the ... how many people you have to see if there is a national and there are disappearing\nYou can you really do have natural here there are fearful you\nDrive by there are real dry dry oh a mental wins over with some of them I think there is a spiritual ... natural saying they're scared to women for me you\nKnow they know that you you you have to understand\nWhere you can call in and do we we are in a law called me yesterday for three to six seven teams and it came there is going to have one of the ... when you said that kind of got to hear me now hearing you\nSay you're going to be able to recognize the truth about God do you call your or we're we're very scary to a certain job staying there for your time you that's how you know you talk with mine is really interesting is\nThat how you know you're even saying you're saying there was there a couple of things that you want to see what we don't want to say Indian\nIs\nBack on the line the ominous that's how\nWe don't understand is she really knows how to do we know they are watching we know they marry the person was a member of a challenge to come up and then later on we really don't recognize me and I believe\nI don't feel sad\nIf I'm going to be\nHere\nTo tell me if you look back and play\nAs well\nAs spiritual ... was you know ... springs\nSeem more beers which can be\nWith this word righteous is as we've been taught wrong in church for too many years and the only thing we've heard of righteousness preached to us or talk to us is the concept of your ride just this is a filthy right\nAnd and we hear sermons talking about ah go right to censor this filthy rags your dirty load the scum of the earth whatever we hear all that stuff and honestly\nYeah that's about the place where all at but the thing is for the believer it's not about your righteousness anymore because you're righteousness is all full or your\nAbility to try to stay right with God is always going to fall short so for us it's not about\nRights just is it's about the righteousness at Christ has given to us about righteousness here's what I mean righteousness just means is it means that we are and writes standing with God that is right just as right\nStanding with God and so when you understand being and writes standing with dog we also have to understand that I can never be an right standing with God based upon my own work\nI can never be right standing with God based upon my own merit based upon my own ability or based upon what I can do on my own because if I could be in right standing with got on my own I wouldn't need Jesus\n\nSo so then God gives us grace and it gives us the blood of Christ or Clinton just watches from all an righteousness you see this soldier and you're right just as they're no longer depends on you you're right just as depends on the blood of Christ that has Clinton's do from everything that was filthy\nBecause on righteousness is the same thing as outright just as being as filthy right\nAnd so through Christ Rogers or through cries we now have a right standing with God which is why the Bible and the New Testament tells us that we can come boldly to the throne of grace and we can find help in the time of need the only\nWay we could come boldly to Christ in prayer is when we are in right standing with him and the only way we can be in right standing with him is through the blood that has cleansed us from everything that was separate us from his righteousness and separate us from his holiness so hook the prayer although\nRighteous person avail as much so this righteousness is not based upon your merit\nThis righteousness is based upon his great it's not based upon your words or what you can do but rather it's based upon what he can do so for the child of God you are in right standing with God which also means then that your prayer has power\nHave you ever gone to God and prayed and the whole time your brain you think about last week oh lord and and maybe like I Can't even pray to de lord I've been a ... for the last eight days\nOr maybe it's been a hotbed for the last year I don't know but anyhow regardless [laughter] yeah\nThat means you're ... you're trying to come to God based upon your merit and God doesn't want you to come to him based upon you and he wants you to come to him based upon him lord and so he tells assume that the prayers of a righteous person or someone who isn't right standing with him has great power as\nIt is working uh see we got a child is in and we're we're talking about prayer\nAnd all this other stuff but when we look at prayer\nRighteousness here's the thing there is no such thing as a perfect prayer\n\nI Wish there was and I'm sure probably if you grow up in church you probably had somebody to church growing up that just dot every time they pray man they just you were like oh yeah they they know how to pray I mean it's like you know as soon as I stood up it just it sounded holy as soon as I started\nBecause they immediately went to the king's English\n\nBrazil so would you be ... ... ... is our old our most heavily and holding his father you know oh yeah God here and this one\n\nYeah he got a direct line it's old downloads holding his father yet yeah the lord is on the throne today\n\nAnd then and then sometimes it and sometimes when when when it's your turn to talk to God you're just like\nLord I'm\nIt's me again\nStruggling\nGot some problems going on and it's real easy for you to think that the one that stands with old DOMA holy as heavily as whatever and they got here is that with more than you but you want to understand there's no such thing as a perfect prayer and God is not a respect or a person's which also means he's not a respect drove your prayers\nBecause it's not just about the the absolute a face filled prayer that God's ear and sometimes got here's the prayer that are mixed with a little bit of a little bit of whatever\nI'm struggling a little bit I'm not having issues gone still hears that prayer here's the thing you got to understand a ... and I've taught this before I got to hear it again when the man came to Jesus that had an issue with this child he's a lord I Need you to do something for my child and and she just looked at him he said I'm all things are possible if you believe\nAnd the memory sponsors lord I Believe but help my own beliefs\nNow if you grew up real charge him real religious of media you'd be like oh you didn't answer on that prayer he's got some he got salon belief going on but guess what Jesus did he did exactly what the mandate it\n\nWell because there's no such thing as a perfect prayer only imperfect\nIs the one you never pray\n\nPerfect prayer is the one that you never break and I don't I don't want embarrassing but I had to teach them how to pray when he was when he was four and he's already like a lower\nThese are so but no\nI I'll come over here and explain it but do you think here's the thing up forever so simple but we make it so hard\nJay Jay was for he asked he asked me this question he was like that when we get to see God oh wow oh no\nAnd I said why next thing that came out of his mouth is because I'm missing I said OK okay and I said well Jay Jay\nI said you can talk to him anytime you want to it's called prayer I said here's all you have to do all you got to do is say hey God is Josiah and then telling whatever you need to it was two minutes later all of a sudden I heard his four year old boys in the back of my beat up Ford Ranger\nThank God this is ... and then he started talking and I thought how simple it is\nThat my four year old can grasp the concept of prayer but also adults mess it up so bad\n\nThat it's as simple as that God is PJ oh missed a day I Need some help I guess what he hears that prayer\nHave to understand that when you come to him the fact that you're coming to him to start with already says that there's an indication that there was they in you that's causing you to turn to God\nIf you had no favorite oh you wouldn't be talking to him\nIf the enemy that comes in to try to tell you you don't have enough faith for your prior to be hurt the fact that you're even going to God to start with lets me know that there's already an element of fate that's causing you to turn to God and so maybe it's that element of fate that's going to get your miracle that even though you didn't think you had enough say the fact that you just have mustard seed faith was enough\nFor Jesus to step into your situation and do something for your life before your family I Believe help\nMy own belief patrols prayer ultimately is access to unlimited potential that is what\nPrayer is when you begin to open up your mouth and talk to God it gives you access to a limited potential there's there's different kinds of prayer that we look at you know sometimes we got that\nThey field prayer people full of faith or go to God they just come in and they'd given scriptures and all that other stuff it's good sometimes sometimes we had a forceful prayer because prayer sometimes is declared two\nOh when it comes to pray and sometimes I'll let me say like sometimes you got to do when the ... sometimes you know when to sell you sometimes those are declared abrupt it's how do I know\nWhen we're we're talking about a larger here and it said a larger pray that it would not rain the only issue is is I never see we're allied actually ... wouldn't right\nWhen you read the story of a larger it just has a larger showed up in the king's chambers that a tank if not do writing until I say so he's out\nThat's a BJ the assault happen\nYou know he just showed up making a larger you know here's the deal your math or I'm here to have a God it's not going to say so oh so you have you know where do I hear it where he actually said oh that most Holy Father\nIt's ... not rain it just showed up and go right into last night's vote and it didn't rain until he went back three and a half years later and said so that was a that was a declare it too\nAnd demonstrative prayer but here's the thing you gotta understand about ... is is I Love this because\nWe read them very sixteen the prayer but righteous person has great power as it is working but then over Seventeen it immediately flips to a large and this is encouraging because he said ally joke was a man with a nature like our\n\nThis I I got to let this thinking because it's real easy for us to read the Bible and be like that was the Bible\nWhat it is not dealing with and they not completely understand but gone already know\nGod wants to hear your voice\nBecause there's something about prayer that you have to understand prayers Clinton thing for yourself\nJesus said caster cares upon me because I care for you how do we can't stop cares upon him oh like this hey God BJ\nDealing with a lot of stuff right now I Need you to help me I pray for is like that before God I Need you to help me I don't know how I don't know why but I Need some help right\nPromise you the affects your fervent prayer of the rights you\nWork your prayer works\nIt has power just like a lot I just had you don't want to be called profit for your prior to have you don't have to have a title for your prayer to work\nYou don't have to have a position in the church for your prior to work got just wants to hear your voice and let you know that your prayer is work your prayer is working why because it's got huge\nGot here's you deserve a time that you talked to him that your prayer hit the ceiling you might feel like it sometimes I feel like you're talking to the air and nobody list it but I promise you got to this thing and he's not just listening he's this thing with the intent of acting\nGod wants to hear your voice let's stand or feed this morning\nWould you do something maybe maybe a little a little different I I just want you to reach out and kind of grab a hand real fat [noise]\nAs you're grabbing at hand whoever's hands you're holding I Need you to I Need you to know what I Need you to see the\nGods just as real as the hand that's touching your hands right now\nHe's just as evident he's just as the president as the hand that you're touching right now I Want to pray for everybody right now got got we come to you now we thank you\nWe thank you lord that you hear our prayers are you answer our prayers\nGotta thank you detect that we've got in coverage meant that we might be messed up we might have some issues we might have some problems but look we're not coming to you based upon our problems were coming to you based upon your righteous than\nWe're coming to you based upon grace and mercy based upon the blood of Jesus Christ that Clinton says from all over I just\nBurned down and they felt like you're not listening anymore you're not paying attention anymore\nBy now we thank you that they just rising and then again\nStrength is rising in their lives again\nBut give them a fresh a fresh face the terms of you to pray to you because you are hearing and you are working what they're saying is working\nThe only imperfect prayer is the one that we do not praise God we turn our hearts to you today\nJust like David said that when my heart is overwhelming\nLead me to the rock better is higher than I\nTook out we tell you that even as we turn to
